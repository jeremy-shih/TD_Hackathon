Thanks to everyone who's joining the call today. We had another great quarter, marked by continued execution, to deliver double-digit top and bottom line growth while making progress with our innovative R&D engine. EYLEA global net sales grew 14% to $1.9 billion, including U.S. EYLEA net sales growth of 16% to $1.2 billion. We continued to build on our leadership position in retinal diseases with market share gains across wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic eye diseases.","DUPIXENT continued to deliver strong growth while transforming the lives of thousands of patients around the world suffering from a number of Type 2 inflammatory diseases. Global net sales of DUPIXENT are now annualizing at more than $2.5 billion. Launches in atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps are generating broad-based growth for this important brand. We're still in the early days of DUPIXENT as approvals around the world continue and our enthusiasm continues to increase.","Through the strength of the performance of DUPIXENT, we generated improved profitability for our own -- for our antibody collaboration with Sanofi. We expect profits to continue to increase, further diversifying our earnings base driven by growth in DUPIXENT as well as effective cost management across the collaboration.","Importantly, our efforts in oncology are bearing fruit in the form of global launches of Libtayo, our anti-PD-1 therapy in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma; as well as new data from Libtayo in lung cancer; and our portfolio of innovative bispecific antibodies, including our BCMA antibody in multiple myeloma. We aim to be a leader in immuno-oncology by bringing important new treatments to patients with both blood and solid tumor cancers.","Beyond oncology, we have novel programs that have generated significant late-stage results that we intend to file with regulators, such as evinacumab in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Similarly, results from the PALM study in the Democratic Republic of Congo demonstrated that our antibody combination was superior to the standard of care in preventing death from Ebola in the recent outbreak. We expect further pipeline readouts by the end of the year as George will speak to in a few moments.","Taken together, we continue to demonstrate that Regeneron has the talent and track record to tackle some of the world's most scientifically challenging health issues while creating long-term value for shareholders. We continue to execute on our strategy, and a result -- and as a result, are in a strong financial position. We think carefully about how -- about our capital and how to deploy it strategically. ","As such, we will continue to invest in R&D, as we have shown that those investments have generated significant value for shareholders and for patients. Business development efforts will continue as we seek the best science and capabilities to pair with our own innovations. Beyond R&D, and based upon our confidence in the business to deliver value both in the short and longer term, we are initiating a $1 billion stock buyback program. ","These are exciting times for Regeneron. We have strong momentum as we head into the end of the year and into 2020.","Now I'll turn the call over to George.","George Yancopoulos","Thanks, Len. I will begin with DUPIXENT. There is nothing more gratifying than hearing directly from so many individuals about how DUPIXENT changed their lives after years of suffering from diseases such as asthma, atopic dermatitis and nasal polyposis. Just last week, a co-worker shared her story, how she was dreading her fourth surgery for nasal polyposis and instead convinced her doctor to try DUPIXENT. Not only did her nasal polyposis vanish without surgery, but her co-morbid asthma also dramatically improved. ","Such stories reflect the science behind DUPIXENT. Many patients suffer from a body-wide hyperactivation of the Type 2 immune pathway, which manifests in disease at many different sites, including the lungs, skin, upper respiratory system and even GI tract. DUPIXENT can be life-changing as it can reverse the systemic Type 2 hyperactivity, thus simultaneously treating multiply apparent, distinct disease entities.","The other remarkable aspect of DUPIXENT is its safety profile. Since Type 2 hyperactivity is often counterproductive, DUPIXENT is not immunosuppressive. Across all of our studies, we have not seen increases in serious infections. In fact, in our AD studies, where people are prone to skin infections, we actually have seen a numeric decrease in infections.","The DUPIXENT opportunity is growing in several ways by expanding to new territories to younger age groups into new Type 2 diseases. For example, the nasal polyposis indication was recently approved by the European Commission. We are submitting for atopic dermatitis in the pediatric population later this year and we are enrolling Phase III studies in eosinophilic esophagitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In addition, there are numerous ongoing or soon to be initiated trials in additional Type 2 diseases, including bullous pemphigoid, prurigo nodularis, chronic spontaneous urticaria, hand and foot atopic dermatitis, alopecia areata and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.","We're also very excited about the potential of DUPIXENT to accelerate and enhance allergen desensitization. Our combination trial with the immunotherapy for grass allergy will be presented at a future medical conference. And data in combination with Aimmune's AR101 for peanut allergy are planned for late next year. Related to our DUPIXENT efforts, we are expecting a readout of our interleukin-33 antibody, Regeneron 3500, in atopic dermatitis and COPD over the coming year.","As you know, DUPIXENT is currently approved for uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma and atopic dermatitis and is approved in earlier stages of these diseases. However, because of its efficacy and safety profile, including the lack of immunosuppression, we believe DUPIXENT can have an important benefit earlier in these diseases, where biologics have thus not -- thus far not been utilized. And we are considering studying DUPIXENT in patients with these earlier stages of disease.","Now we'll turn to our immuno-oncology efforts. First, I want to remind you how challenging it is to create best-in-class biologicals and how often failure is still the rule. The foundation for Regeneron's success over the years has been our technology platforms that we have repeatedly used to produce first-in-class or best-in-class biologics, whether EYLEA for eye diseases, PRALUENT for heart disease, DUPIXENT for allergic Type 2 diseases or the recent stunning success with our Ebola antibody cocktail. I need not remind you that in all of these settings, there were very few, if any, successful competitors. Instead, numerous competitors, including some of the biggest biopharma companies in the world, failed. And now we feel that we can create similar advantage by bringing our next-generation technologies to immuno-oncology.","Arguably the biggest advance in this field has been PD-1 blockade. But even here, most efforts to develop PD-1 or PD-L1 blockers have not produced best-in-class results, with Merck's pembrolizumab being a clear outlier. Moreover, even with this best-in-class PD-1 blocker, most cancers do not respond. And for those that do, only a fraction of the patients have satisfactory response. We are very far from curing cancer in general. This is why we feel that with our technological advantages, we can make a major contribution. ","First of all, we believe we can use our VelocImmune human\/mouse, the widely acknowledged gold standard for making fully human antibodies, to make best-in-class checkpoint blockers such as for PD-1. Moreover, we have developed a next-generation VelocImmune mouse that, when combined with our recently described Veloci-Bi platform can produce the most natural antibody-like bispecifics more rapidly and routinely than other approaches. Our bispecifics naturally have long half lives without complex engineering, without mutations and can be delivered like normal antibodies without requiring constant infusion. This has allowed us to emerge as a leader in the so-called CD3 bispecific space, in which a bispecific can be used to link a killer T cell to a tumor target. ","Moreover, we have invented what we believe is the next important class of bispecifics, which we call co-stimulatory, or co-stim, bispecifics that can synergize with both our PD-1 antibody and with our CD3 bispecifics. We believe that progress in cancer will require amplifying and deepening the responses and settings where PD-1 antibody is already active as well as activating responses where PD-1 has little or no activity, such as in prostate, pancreatic, colorectal and other settings. We hope that our bispecifics will demonstrate such synergies together as well as with our PD-1 antibody.","We have already begun establishing the individual efficacy profiles of our 3 classes of immuno-oncology agents. In terms of our PD-1 antibody, Libtayo, we defied expectations by identifying important new cancer setting where PD-1 therapy had not previously been characterized despite the broad efforts in the field. We obtained rapid approval in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC, based on some of the best response rates yet described for a PD-1 block into a solid tumor setting, approaching 50% in late-stage metastatic and locally advanced CSCC. While others have subsequently explored their PD-1 therapies in this setting, Libtayo remains the first and only approved therapeutic in advanced CSCC, and based on cross-study comparisons, has an outstanding efficacy profile.","We believe non-melanoma skin cancers represent an important previously untapped opportunity, and we are working to expand our leading position in this space. A registrational study in adjuvant CSCC is already ongoing. In addition, Dr. Neil Gross of MD Anderson recently presented exciting early results with Libtayo in neoadjuvant CSCC with 70% response rates and 55% complete pathological responses. And we are now planning a larger new adjuvant study. ","We're also looking forward to a potentially pivotal data in the first half of 2020 for another -- from another important common skin cancer where PD-1 therapies have not been extensively characterized. That is basal cell carcinoma. Finally for skin cancers, we're also exploring Libtayo in melanoma in various combination studies intended to show increased benefit over PD-1 therapy alone.","Beyond skin cancers, we are working to establish Libtayo as a therapeutic in non-small cell lung cancer, the largest current PD-1 opportunity. Along these lines, earlier today, we provided an update on our lung study with Libtayo monotherapy in high PD-L1 expressers. This 700-patient study is now over 90% enrolled. Based on an early interim analysis of overall survival in about 1\/3 of anticipated events, the IDMC recommended continuing the trial as planned.","We also announced that in the first 361 randomized patients, the confirmed objective response rate as determined by the investigators is currently 42% Libtayo versus 22% for chemotherapy. These objective response findings, while not sufficient for regulatory approval in this setting, support our hope that Libtayo may prove an important therapeutic and non-small cell lung cancer. The next event-driven interim analysis for overall survival is anticipated in 2020. ","In terms of other important phase -- in terms of our other important Phase III study in lung cancer, which is comparing Libtayo with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. We expect full enrollment in the second half of next year.","As with our PD-1 antibody, we are also establishing the efficacy and safety profile of bispecifics first as single agents. Starting with our CD3-class of bispecifics, we have already reported that Regeneron 1979, our CD20xCD3 bispecific, demonstrated impressive single-agent response rates in late-stage lymphoma patients, including in those that have failed CAR-T therapy. ","At the European Hematology Association meeting, based on a small number of patients, we reported 93% objective response rates with 71% complete responses in late-stage follicular lymphoma and reported 57% response rates in late-stage diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients, including 2 responses in 4 patients that had failed CAR-T therapy. ","While the ASH abstracts that we'll be posting tomorrow will only include older data, our presentation at ASH will include additional patients in longer duration of follow-up with about 20 patients at effective dose levels for each of follicular lymphoma and DLBCL. We have already initiated a potentially pivotal Phase II study which intends to enroll independent arms with different subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.","In terms of our BCMAxCD3 bispecific, based on early single-agent proof of concept data that we will present at ASH, we are encouraged about the potential of this treatment for multiple myeloma. Remind you that the abstracts -- the ASH abstract posting tomorrow will also reflect all the data, including only our first dosing level with the BCMA bispecific. We look forward to updating these results with promising new data from our second dosing cohort at ASH.","Finally, our third CD3 bispecific, MUC16xCD3, continues in a trial as a single agent and will shortly start a combination phase with Libtayo. In terms of the first example of our entirely novel class of so-called co-stim bispecifics, our PCMAxCD28 bispecific, we have begun dosing patients in recently initiated combinations with Libtayo. In this prostate cancer setting, which is normally not responsive to PD-1, we hope that our PCMAxCD28 bispecific can trigger responses as it has in preclinical studies.","In summary, we are very excited that the initial entries for our three different classes of immuno-oncology therapeutics are establishing their individual potentials, and we are entering into the next stage, exploring combinations. In terms of combinations, we're not limiting ourselves to our internal portfolio. Our external immuno-oncology collaborations fall into 2 broad categories: Cell therapy, including CAR-Ts and other approaches; and vaccine-like approaches. Once again, these all have the potential of being explored individually but also in combination with our PD-1 and other checkpoint inhibitors as well as with our 2 classes of bispecifics. Altogether, we believe we are making significant progress on our strategy to become a leader in the immuno-oncology space.","I would like to finish with brief discussions updating our ophthalmology efforts and also briefly touch on our rare disease portfolio. For EYLEA, we are planning registrational clinical programs in wet AMD and DME, evaluating a novel and higher-dose formulation of 8 milligrams in 8-week -- sorry, in 12-week and 16-week regimens. The Phase II trial in wet AMD is underway. Beyond EYLEA, we are continuing preclinical development of a new VEGF blocker, gene therapy and other novel approaches, including with our Alnylam collaborators.","We have also made substantial progress in our rare disease portfolio. In mid-2020, we are planning a regulatory submission for evinacumab in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia based on Phase III data showing nearly 50% LDL reduction in patients already treated with statins and PCSK9s. By the end of 2019, we're also expecting a readout of garetosmab for fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. And we are becoming increasingly excited about our C5 program. ","Let remind you, we set a very high bar for entry into existing markets with novel agents. In the case of C5, our goal was to achieve convenient self-administration with a subcutaneous dosage form as well as more complete blockade of inappropriate complement activation. We are encouraged by our progress towards these goals and plan to present our first data for our C5 antibody, pozelimab, in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria patients at a future medical conference. We're also exploring options for combination with cemdisiran, a novel SRNA developed by our Alnylam collaborators.","In closing, this is a very interesting time to be at Regeneron. Now we'll turn the call over to Marion.","Marion McCourt","Thank you, George. We continued to execute well in the third quarter led by our core EYLEA and DUPIXENT businesses as well as promising Libtayo market introduction. Starting with EYLEA. Global net product sales grew 14% year-over-year to $1.9 billion. In the U.S., net product sales grew to $1.2 billion. This represents 16% year-over-year growth. A combination of overall market growth and share gains drove strong third quarter performance of EYLEA. Growth in the overall market continues at a mid- to high single-digit range, underpinned by the aging population and increase in diabetes prevalence. EYLEA's share of the branded market also increased to 73% of net product sales for the quarter driven by physician preference for EYLEA. We continue to invest in EYLEA to advance our market-leading position across all indications.","Let me take a moment to remind you of select strategic commercial initiatives to enhance our market-leading position in wet AMD and further penetrate diabetic eye disease, where there is significant growth opportunity. In wet AMD, we are growing our position by focusing on EYLEA's rapid and sustained outcomes to improve and protect vision. Wet AMD currently represents just under 60% of EYLEA business and EYLEA continues to grow in this patient group. In diabetic eye disease, our expanded field team is making tremendous strides. Our strategy is to increase diagnosis and treatment rates by educating health care professionals, consumer awareness and applying technologies to support diagnosis. With approximately 15% of the market receiving an anti-VEGF treatment, there's an important opportunity to help patients preserve and improve their vision. Our growth in DME indicates our strategy is delivering results.","Our diabetic retinopathy launch is off to an encouraging start, with EYLEA use increasing in both proliferative disease and severe non-proliferative disease. We anticipate EYLEA use to increase as retina specialists see the benefits of actively treating these patients. Finally, we plan to launch the EYLEA prefilled syringe before the end of this year. Taken together, EYLEA has compelling efficacy and safety, breadth of indications, dosing flexibility and clinical and real-world experience.","Turning to oncology. We're commercializing Libtayo with Sanofi. Global net sales of Libtayo were $52 million, including $4 million from our recent ex U.S. market launches that began this quarter. In the U.S., we continue to establish Libtayo as a standard of care across all lines of therapy for advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC. Libtayo is now the #1 systemic CSCC treatment in terms of total patients. It is outperforming chemotherapy and has made rapid share gains within the anti-PD-1 class, where Libtayo has 80% share in new patients. We expect growth to continue based on demographics, enhancements in patient identification and referrals. In addition, recent updates to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN guidelines, list Libtayo as the preferred single-agent systemic option. Libtayo is the only CSCC, anti-PD-1 treatment with a 2A recommendation. Ex U.S. launches in CSCC are currently underway in multiple markets, including Germany, the U.K. and Brazil. While early, we are seeing encouraging progress on access and reimbursement as well as prescribing trends and physician interest.","Moving to PRALUENT. In the second quarter, global net sales were $70 million. We are working diligently with our collaborator Sanofi to address brand profitability.","Turning to KEVZARA. In the third quarter, global net sales were $55 million. In the U.S., we see steady growth as KEVZARA continues to make headway in the IL-6 subcutaneous class, with 48% share of new-to-brand prescriptions and 30% share of total prescriptions. Now for DUPIXENT, which is transforming the lives of patients suffering from many Type 2 inflammatory diseases. Global net product sales in the third quarter were $633 million. In the U.S., net product sales reached $508 million, representing 131% year-over-year growth. Total prescriptions in the U.S. grew approximately 21% compared to the second quarter. We continue to see strong prescribing trends across all approved indications. Weekly new-to-brand prescriptions for the third quarter averaged approximately 1,350 patients per week, up from 1,200 in the prior quarter.","In atopic dermatitis, DUPIXENT continues to outpace other biologic launches in dermatology. For adults, we are pleased to see an increased number of patients with moderate disease being prescribed DUPIXENT earlier in the treatment paradigm and ahead of immunosuppressant therapy. We see ample opportunity in atopic dermatitis as approximately 20% of adult patients with the greatest need have used DUPIXENT. Additionally, our ongoing launch in adolescents continues to contribute meaningfully to the brand.","As a reminder, DUPIXENT is the first biologic approved for atopic dermatitis in adolescents, many of whom remained uncontrolled using topical therapies. This launch has been aided by physician experience with the efficacy and safety and adults.","In asthma, DUPIXENT in positioned to capitalize on this significant market opportunity. Approximately 75% of DUPIXENT asthma patients are new to biologics, demonstrating our ability to grow this market. Prescribing trends are accelerating among both allergists and pulmonologists. With only 15% of eligible patients being treated with a biologic, there's significant opportunity to educate patients about DUPIXENT. As a result, last month, we initiated our asthma direct-to-consumer TV campaign.","Finally, our launch in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is going extremely well. Encouragingly, patients are being initiated on DUPIXENT regardless of prior surgery. As a reminder, in the U.S., up to 90,000 adults with this disease are considered uncontrolled despite prior surgery or systemic corticosteroid use. About 55,000 patients have had prior surgery. While early in the launch, we believe this will be a meaningful growth opportunity for DUPIXENT.","We have an unprecedented opportunity with DUPIXENT in Type 2 inflammatory diseases. The number of physicians prescribing is growing. And with more than 100,000 patients globally treated with DUPIXENT, the outlook remains exceedingly positive.","In closing, the commercial organization delivered a solid performance in the third quarter. We have the right strategy and we are executing to deliver short- and long-term growth.","Now I'll turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Landry","Thanks, Marion. For the third quarter 2019, Regeneron delivered double-digit growth on the top and bottom lines driven by strong performance from both EYLEA and DUPIXENT and increased profitability within the Sanofi Alliance. Total revenues for Regeneron grew 23% year-over-year to $2.05 billion driven by continued growth of our core brands, EYLEA and DUPIXENT. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share grew 14% year-over-year to $6.67 on non-GAAP net income of $762 million.","Since Marion discussed our EYLEA results in the U.S., I will start with our Bayer and Sanofi collaborations. Starting with the Bayer collaboration. Ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales, which are reported to us by Bayer, were $730 million, representing a 12% reported and a 14% constant currency basis increase year-over-year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the third quarter of 2019 grew 15% year-over-year to $303 million, of which $275 million was derived from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S.","Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $404 million, up 58% year-over-year, as commercial profitability improved sharply. For the third quarter of 2019, Regeneron recognized a profit of $94 million in connection with the commercialization of non IO antibodies compared to a loss of $39 million in the prior year period and a profit of $39 million in the second quarter of this year. Both the year-over-year and sequential increase was driven by higher DUPIXENT profits. As we head into the end of the year and into 2020, we expect continued improved profitability driven by strong DUPIXENT net sales growth, continued cost containment on PRALUENT and KEVZARA and improvements in our operating leverage.","Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $603 million for the third quarter of 2019 compared to $497 million for the third quarter of 2018, an increase of 22%. We are continuing to invest in our pipeline and research capabilities which is critical to the long-term success of the business.","Our oncology pipeline continues to forge ahead, and we are advancing several wholly owned molecules into clinical development with more to come. In addition, we are funding external partnership obligations as jointly developed molecules are rapidly advancing. While we are not yet giving guidance for 2020, we anticipate non-GAAP R&D expenses to increase.","Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total non-GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, was $441 million for third quarter 2019 compared to $311 million for the third quarter of 2018. Based on the current forecast for the remainder of the year, we are tightening our previous full year 2019 guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to $1.68 billion to $1.71 billion.","Next, non-GAAP SG&A expense was $379 million for the third quarter of 2019, a 16% year-over increase driven by higher headcount and related costs and launch-related expenses for U.S. Libtayo and for new indications for EYLEA and DUPIXENT. We are tightening our previous full year 2019 guidance for non-GAAP SG&A to $1.55 billion to $1.58 billion.","Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, line items found within Sanofi collaboration revenue, was $115 million for the third quarter of 2019. Based on spending trends and cost containment efforts related to PRALUENT and KEVZARA, we are lowering and tightening our previous full year 2019 guidance for Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses to $490 million to $510 million.","In the third quarter of 2019, combined non-GAAP cost of goods sold and cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing were $210 million compared to $102 million in the third quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to the company's obligation to pay Sanofi its share of Libtayo U.S. gross profits, lower fixed cost absorption and higher inventory reserves and write-offs. The year-over-year increase in cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing was primarily due to recognition of manufacturing costs associated with higher sales of DUPIXENT.","Turning now to taxes. For the third quarter of 2019, our GAAP effective tax rate was 12.9% compared to 6.5% for the third quarter of 2018. Based on our actual results to date and forecast for the remainder of the year, we are raising our full year 2019 GAAP effective tax rate guidance to 12% to 14%. We continue to expect our full year 2019 non-GAAP tax rate to be higher than our full year 2019 GAAP effective tax rate.","Turning next to our cash flow and balance sheet. Year-to-date, we've generated $1.35 billion in free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We ended the third quarter of 2019 with cash and marketable securities of nearly $6 billion.","Earlier today, we announced a $1 billion share repurchase program. With that announcement, let me take a moment to discuss our capital allocation priorities. In terms of capital deployment, investing in our internal research capabilities and advancing our pipeline remains our top priority. As evident by our productivity and the high returns we've generated historically on our R&D, these investments are critical for our business and shareholders. ","Second, we seek to complement our internal efforts with external strategic partnerships and collaborations. Over the last 18 months, we've funded in excess of $900 million in equity and upfront payments, comprising more than 5 new strategic opportunities in the areas of RNAi therapeutics, oncolytic viruses and CAR-T therapies. Following these R&D investments, we assess additional strategic uses of our cash. ","Our overall business is growing with increasingly diversified revenue and cash flow streams. Coupled with the strength of our balance sheet and our confidence in the long-term outlook for the business, we view share buybacks at current trading levels as an efficient use of capital.","In conclusion, we are very pleased with our financial results and performance this quarter. With continued execution on our R&D and commercial strategies, we are positioned for long-term growth.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Justin.","Justin Holko","Thank you, Bob. Sheryl, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray.","Christopher Raymond","So just maybe a question on the EYLEA franchise. And maybe just from a high-level perspective, you guys have been framing your next-generation efforts in a pretty similar way, I think, for a few quarters now. And so the high-dose formulations in the clinic now, which I think is new. But your discussion on the other mechanisms still seem to be framed in the same way that you had the last few quarters. ","And so I guess the question is I'm wondering if you can talk about where -- when we might see something from these novel mechanisms in the clinic. And maybe talk about these efforts in the context of the IP runway you have with EYLEA. And then maybe a second part of the question, can you describe more tactically any continued impact from the supply hiccups of compounded Avastin on the quarter?","Len Schleifer","So Marion will take any comments about the Avastin supply issues. Let me just say that -- I'm not going to comment on our patent situation here. I can say one thing for sure, is that our data exclusivity runs some ways into 2024, so we have a reasonable runway there. In terms of timing, obviously, we're working hard. We tend, Chris, not to predict when things will finally go into the clinic. But as soon as they do, we will let you know. We're hard at work at it. And the one that we mentioned, the high-dose, the new formulation, is now underway in our Phase II program. Marion, you want to comment on the Avastin situation?","Marion McCourt","Sure, Len. And just to comment, in the third quarter, there were some temporary spot shortages of Avastin in select geographies, so they may have given some modest benefit to EYLEA. We mentioned the same in the second quarter. And the one thing I can add is that we are hearing that patients that are started on Avast -- excuse me, started on EYLEA because of these shortages do continue on EYLEA therapy. So we'll continue to monitor the situation, which is episodic. And of course, in many instances, are related to ongoing issues with compounding and quality concerns.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein.","Aaron Gal","A couple, if you don't mind. First, on the CD3xCD20. George, it looks like you might have actually got here with Roche. Can you comment a little bit about your -- the -- kind of how you differentiate your program from the Marcelin [ph] program, the developed program? ","And are you going straight into first line with this? Or are you still thinking it's going to be in a relapse setting for the next set of trial? And if you can remind us whether the partnership with Sanofi gives them the right to enter this program? Or is it still at your control. And given you're now in a kind of an excess cash situation, you have more choice about what you're going to do with this?","George Yancopoulos","Well, maybe I'll start at the back because it's the easiest. It's a wholly owned program that we control and nobody has an option on it. Number one. Number two, in terms of the comparisons with Roche, I mean, obviously, these are cross-trial comparisons. But we're very encouraged with how our data looks and how we both have a -- how we have a chance to have best-in-class potential. One of the most important things, we believe, about not only this program but our immuno-oncology franchise in general, is that we have, we believe, an unparalled opportunity to generate synergistic therapeutics that can work very powerfully together. So we are certainly going to be exploring our CD20xCD3 in combination with our PD-1 antibody, Libtayo, which we're very interested in. But also, we have an assortment of additional bispecifics in the settings where one might need additional efficacy. We believe that we can add to it, and we've certainly shown that and demonstrated that in preclinical models. ","So we think that, that's what really differentiates us, is that we really have a lot of tools in our tool kits a lot of possibilities for combining a lot of things with synergistic capabilities together. In addition to the fact that each one of our individual agents, we believe that based on the emerging data, has a chance to be best-in-class. And we're moving very aggressively into a near-term pivotal, approvable trials. And we'll be moving into earlier stages as well.","Len Schleifer","Certainly, it's Len, just to echo what George said. We feel good about our position, but we don't take Roche lightly. They're a formidable -- Roche\/Genentech are a formidable competitor with lots of experience in the CD20 space. But they may have historical approaches that may be -- might be disruptible by new agents and combinations.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.","Geoffrey Meacham","Just have a couple for Bob. I wanted to ask about the commercialization-related expenses. Was this just lower reimbursable expenses to Regeneron? Or is it related to, say, DUPI profitability? Or is this sort of -- should be looked at as the next phase of the JV expense base overall? And then for George. Obviously, you've got Libtayo-chemo combos going and CTLA-4 combos going, but how much of a priority is it to test more novel mechanisms with PD-1, just given recent data from AZ and Bristol?","Robert Landry","Geoff, I'll start. Well certainly, with the launch of DUPIXENT in the new indications, I mean we're moving full speed ahead with regards to that. And we've been talking about PRALUENT and KEVZARA cost containment for the last couple of quarters I would say in the third quarter, you're meaning -- we meaningfully saw what we were -- have been working on with our Sanofi counterparts in terms of trying to rein in a little bit with regards to the amount of OpEx associated with PRALUENT and KEVZARA.","George Yancopoulos","Okay. And so certainly, we're following closely the PD-1 field. As you said, it is evolving. Our goal, as it's been from the beginning, is to have a foundational PD-1 therapeutic that is at least competitive, if not best-in-class. And so we're very excited, for example, about some of the data that we reported on today in terms of the response rates in our first-line monotherapy lung cancer study. But once again, the story is as you said, that we think that we have an enormous opportunity of combining with our novel sets of reagents. Some of which are already in combinations in the clinic not only with the entire assortment of checkpoint inhibitors but also with our entire assortment of bispecifics. ","So as I already mentioned, we're exploring combinations with the bispecifics of the CD3 class that are in the clinic already, but we've already initiated our second class of bispecifics, these co-stimulatory bispecifics, which have the opportunity to activate PD-1 responsiveness in tumors that are not normally responsive to PD-1. So not only can they enhance responsiveness in tumors that are responding to some degree already, but they can actually endow responsiveness in those that don't in preclinical models. And we hope that, that pertains, obviously, in the clinic. This creates, we think, a great way of extending the benefit that immuno-oncology has already provided by taking it deeper in cancers that are already responsive, but also opening up cancers that haven't responded to date.","So I do want to just emphasize again, why do we have this ability? Because we have a unique platform for making these bispecifics. As far as I'm aware, we're the only platform that couples essentially a naturally derived bispecific antibodies using a genetically humanized mouse, together with this Veloci-Bi platform that we recently announced, to rapidly and routinely make natural bispecifics that behave just like normal antibodies. ","You don't have to give them by constant infusion. You don't have to introduce linkers. You don't have to make mutations in there so that they have longer half-lives because they look, and they're manufactured in fact, just like regular antibodies. They behave like them. You can give them normally like you give biologics. You don't have to go to special -- extensive lengths to manufacture them. This allows us to rapidly and routinely make many of these and put them into the clinic very rapidly in these various combinations and target them in exactly the way we want to, in some cases, initiate; or in other cases, trigger or activate a co-response. And I think it's the collection of these put together that allow for very exciting combinations, as I said.","Len Schleifer","Yes, and let me just add something very quickly. Geoff, you also alluded to there were other combinations out there, whether it be CTLA-4, LAG-3 or what have you. We in this field recognize that not all antibodies are created equally. As George said, I mean, you've got some antibody like a KEYTRUDA that worked in first line; and others, let's say, in PD-L1; or others even in PD-1 that may not work as well, didn't work. And so we have to make sure we explore some of these other antibodies, LAG3 or what have you ourselves, to be satisfied that there's not opportunity for a combination therapy there as well.","Justin Holko","[Operator Instructions]. We still have several callers that we'd like to squeeze in.","Operator","Our next question comes from George -- I'm sorry, Geoff Porges from SVB Leerink.","Geoffrey Porges","A quick question. You have three products that are -- look like they're annualizing at about $200 million a year in revenue: KEVZARA, Libtayo and PRALUENT. And certainly, Libtayo is still growing strongly. First, Bob, can you give us a sense of whether they're actually contributing to cash flow at that revenue level? And secondly, do you envisage any further changes in the commercial support, the structure behind those products, such that they could enhance the profitability or at least not drag on the profitability of DUPIXENT in the future?","Robert Landry","Geoff, I'll start. And you can imagine for competitive reasons, we're not going to get into kind of specific products with regards to what they're generating from a cash flow perspective. We've given kind of high-level cover -- color with regards to what the drivers have been. Obviously, DUPIXENT on our current profitability for the quarter. Repeat the second question, the second part of it.","Geoffrey Porges","Yes. Are there any changes that you could envisage in terms of the structure or the spend that, let's say, allow you to capture more of the profitability of DUPIXENT?","Len Schleifer","You have sort of faded out at the end. This is Len. But I think what you're asking, can we change the structure or the profitability? I think Sanofi and Regeneron are constantly looking at this. We see the same data you do. It is very early for Libtayo. So that's one thing. It's getting a little bit late for PRALUENT and KEVZARA. And we are focused on making sure we do the right thing overall for the -- so that they're not a drain on the overall alliance. You can be assured of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn","I was just wondering, for your BCMAxCD3 bispecific, are you encouraged because you're seeing activity in a second type of cancer here with the platform or encouraged because you have a competitive efficacy profile relative to the CAR-T and ADC data we've seen from the competitors? And then any commentary you can share at a high level regarding the safety\/tolerability profile at this point?","George Yancopoulos","Yes. I think that it's fair to -- I think you made two great points. I mean, I think, one, it's very important to see that the platform is consistently producing what looked like very competitive, exciting data. And so it's encouraging for that reason. And secondly, if the platform is producing competitive data in a particular area, then it's exciting for that reason as well. So I guess the answer is yes and yes on both of those.","Len Schleifer","We shouldn't go any further. We'll show you the data at ASH.","Operator","The question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Harrison","George, I just wanted to follow up on some comments you made around C5. I guess, two parts here. So first, you mentioned a couple products that you expected at ASH, but you just said a future medical meeting for C5. Should we expect this at ASH? Or is this -- are we not going to see this at ASH? And then you also said that you're encouraged. So should we think about this as something that it looks like you plan to move into pivotal studies at this point?","George Yancopoulos","Well as I said, we had a very high bar before we would get excited about it, which was we want to feel like we could change the field. As you know, the current approaches are limited to intravenous delivery. We were looking for a subcutaneous, self-administered approach and we were also looking for more complete suppression of hemolysis. And so we are excited because we feel like we satisfied our high bar. ","In terms of where we're actually going to present it, we're hoping to present it as soon as possible in a major medical conference. And so that we don't get prevented from presenting it at such conferences, we can't tell you where we're presenting. Sorry about that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yaron Werber from Cowen.","Yaron Werber","Great. So George, maybe just one for you relating to -- give us a sense. In the Phase II high-dose EYLEA study, you're testing 8 milligrams. Can you advance that right away into the parallel Phase III pivotals? Or do you need to show sort of safety first before you can move to a pivotal and the pivotal would have a different dose? ","And maybe if I can just throw in, any initial feedback on the Beovu launch that you're seeing in the last literally three weeks or so?","George Yancopoulos","I'll leave the last for Marion to comment on. But in terms of the first, of course, there's always safety concerns. But depending on whether one sees something unexpected or not, we are planning to do it exactly as you said. The Phase II is intended to simultaneously be providing data while we're running the Phase III to give us confidence that the high-dose EYLEA is actually performing and doing the things that we're predicting that it would actually do. So we're not limiting the Phase III by the Phase II data. And Marion?","Marion McCourt","Sure. And just first, we're pleased with the EYLEA performance through this third quarter and certainly been in a competitive market for some years. But specifically to the most recent launch, Novartis' launch, when you take all the important competition seriously and certainly have been prepared for new market entrants. But it is really early, so we can't report on any impact. We're not seeing any impact at this time. And I think the market will be looking to product profile to determine issues of safety, efficacy and product use.","Operator","Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Evan Seigerman","Congrats on the progress. So one for Bob. I was wondering if you could provide us some more color on the rationale for the newly announced share repurchase program. On this, this seems to be kind of a deviation from your prior capital allocation strategy. So why now? Do you believe that your share price is undervalued and that this is the best way to invest capital? Or are there other factors impacting the decision?","Robert Landry","Thanks, Evan, for the question. And again, we wanted to be kind of pointed during our script with regards to calling out the framework that we have on this because we do get a lot of questions on it. I think exactly where you kind of ended off on the question with regards to -- we currently like the valuation. Obviously, all the work we do inside here and what we know is coming and...","Len Schleifer","Bob, I got to interrupt you. I kind of hate the valuation.","Robert Landry","The valuation from a purchasing point of view is what we certainly like. Thanks for that help, Len, on that. We like the levels. And as I tried to point out, I mean, we sufficiently invest in R&D in the right areas. Things continue to move through the clinic. We are also going into external transactions. We mentioned in May the Alnylam transaction, and I talked about a little bit that -- there on the script. So now is the right time with regards to being able to kind of put additional capital to work. And again, to reiterate what you said, we do like -- we think the valuations are attractive from our point of view at this level.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yatin Suneja from Guggenheim Partners.","Yatin Suneja","Congrats on the quarter. The question is on the lung cancer update that you provided today. I mean, if you end up with an identical result to KEYTRUDA in the front-line lung setting, do you compete on anything other than the price? Is that going to be the strategy? Could you maybe comment on the strategy there?","Len Schleifer","Yes, it's a little early to comment on a strategy till we see the data. I just remind you, this is going to be a very large space. KEYTRUDA is annualizing right now at about, I think, $12 billion. And the whole space is predicted to go much larger than that with most of the sales, at least initially, coming in lung cancer. ","We have two strategies I think that George has been articulating for years. One is we need a foundational strategy so that if it just turns out the only checkpoint inhibitor that continues to make a difference, as it has for the last 5 years in lung cancer, is a PD-1 inhibitor, we want to be there with ours and we want to compete. And we'll see how the data goes. But it could be one experiment away with either some combination, a co-stim, a bispecific or something else. And then everybody's back, loaded up in the starting gate. So this has been, I think, articulated innumerable times by George: PD-1 is a foundational technology for us in the immuno-oncology space, lung cancer is the biggest opportunity, we want to be there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.","Matthew Holt","This is Matthew on for Cory. So my question is on your BCMA bispecific programs. Can you talk about the differences between REGN5459 and 5458? What informed your decision to advance the former into the clinic? And whether this was in any way dependent on the initial 5458 clinical data.","George Yancopoulos","Yes. I mean, these are all great questions. I think the important point to make is, and it was brought up by a previous caller, that we are really validating our platform and we're excited that it looks like the platform works. And what we're beginning to understand is that one way to control, not only efficacy but also safety, is by the components that are used, particularly the constant components in our platform. I'll remind you, they're all created from entirely natural sequences of antibodies and so forth, so there's no immunogenicity problems. ","And so what we're doing, we committed not based on any data that we saw, but to test a couple of variants of the constant aspects of the platform to try to optimize the efficacy and safety profile. Though obviously we're seeing what look like very competitive profiles right now, we're always aspiring to even do better. So it's just a matter of building and optimizing our platform to maximize the efficacy, the safety equation as best as we can and learn that -- how we can take the platform and generalize it and optimize it to the best. And that's why we're testing, in some cases, at least two versions of related bispecifics.","Len Schleifer","So let me just repeat what George said, maybe in my words, is that the platform is powerful, and therefore the activation energy to try more than one thing is low. And so we have that as a competitive advantage.","Justin Holko","Thank you. I think we have one more -- time for one more question, Sheryl.","Operator","Our final question comes from Josh Schimmer from Evercore.","Joshua Schimmer","It looks like the sequential quarter-over-quarter growth of DUPIXENT in the third quarter was much lower than it was in the second quarter despite very strong underlying prescription trends. Can you discuss some of the factors underlying that, including potential inventory or gross to net fluctuations or any other factors that might have contributed?","Len Schleifer","Josh, Marion will take that.","Marion McCourt","Sure, happy to. So Josh, we're very pleased with the quarter-on-quarter performance. And as I mentioned in my script, when we just look at, obviously the percentage growth of TRxs quarter-over-quarter, and I believe it was 21%, it was quite substantial. As it relates to gross to net and inventory, I know that inventory is within the normal range and therefore don't have more to report on that area.","Justin Holko","Great. Thank you, everybody, for joining the call. We'll be around to take questions.","Len Schleifer","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference for this morning. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference today is being recorded. I would like to now introduce your host for today's conference, Dr. Michael Aberman, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations for Regeneron. Sir, you may begin.","Michael Aberman","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Third Quarter 2014 Conference Call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under events and presentations for 30 days.","Joining me on the call today is Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President of Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer; Bob Terifay, Senior Vice President of Commercial; and Bob Landry, Chief Financial Officer.","After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A.","I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, those related to Regeneron and its products and business, sales and expense forecast, financial forecast, development programs, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, intellectual property and competition.","Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected in such statements. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, and in Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2014, which was filed with the SEC earlier this morning.","Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","In addition, please note that GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed on today's call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP are available in our financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website at www.regeneron.com.","Once our call concludes, the IR team and our CFO will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Thank you, Michael, and a very good morning to everyone, who has joined us on the call and webcast today. The third quarter was another successful quarter for Regeneron. EYLEA sales continue to expand with a 23% growth in the U.S. compared to third quarter of 2013 and a more than twofold increase in sales outside the United States. Total global sales of EYLEA were approximately $725 million during the quarter. Importantly, in the third quarter, we received approval for EYLEA in the U.S. for the treatment of diabetic macular edema or DME. And in October, we announced top line results from the diabetic retinopathy clinical research network, comparative effectiveness study of EYLEA, Lucentis, also known as ranibizumab and Avastin, also known as bevacizumab, in patients with DME. In this independent NIH-sponsored study, EYLEA had significantly greater efficacy than both Avastin and Lucentis with a good safety profile. Patients receiving EYLEA also achieved this outcome with few injections and less rescue laser therapy. While these data have positive implications for the long-term growth of EYLEA, we are constrained about how much we can say about the detailed results of this study until the full data are published or presented by the DRCR.","Beyond EYLEA, our company is in the midst of an evolution into a multi-product company with the potential for multiple significant revenue streams across a variety of therapeutic areas. We expect this evolution to drive our future as a company and to enhance value to our shareholders. With our collaborator, Sanofi, we will soon submit regulatory applications in the United States and EU for alirocumab for lowering LDL cholesterol. And we expect to receive Priority Review by the FDA, based on the use of a priority review voucher we purchased during the quarter. We expect additional Phase III data for sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody, next year and regulatory submission by the end of 2015.","Dupilumab, our IL-4\/IL-13 blocking antibody, continues to show very encouraging data in multiple indications. Last quarter, we were positive -- we reported positive dupilumab data in chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps. And earlier in the fourth quarter, we presented additional positive data in atopic dermatitis. We also recently announced that we have started the atopic dermatitis Phase III program. We expect additional Phase IIb data in asthma this quarter. Our early-stage programs are also humming along. George will share with you important progress with our earliest-stage pipeline as well as with our Regeneron Genetics Center, and landmark genomics efforts that has already exceeded our initial expectations in terms of productivity.","Turning to our earnings. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $295 million and diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.52. This included a $34 million, or $0.29 per share, charge that we incurred for the purchase of the priority review voucher. Bob Landry will discuss our financial performance in more detail.","As we all are acutely aware, the recent Ebola virus outbreak is a serious worldwide public health emergency. Regeneron has an active infection disease research group and is working on establishing a rapid response approach to address new and serious infectious disease outbreaks as they emerge. With respect to Ebola, we already have an effort there and are consulting with various government agencies to see if our fully-human monoclonal antibody technologies can be applied to combat the virus. This is still a very early initiative, but we hope that our leading antibody Science and Technologies will be part of the solution for Ebola and other emerging infectious diseases.","A recent honor that George and I are especially proud of is Regeneron being ranked as the #1 employer in the biopharmaceutical industry by Science Magazine for the third consecutive year, a 3-peat, so to speak. We are very proud of this recognition since it is a testament to our science-driven innovative culture and our incredibly talented employees. As we grow and evolve, we are focused on staying in this culture in order to maintain our edge as a leading scientific innovator and employer of choice with talented scientists.","Before I turn the call over to George, let me briefly address the recent management change at Sanofi. As I'm sure you all know, last week, the Sanofi Board of Directors removed their CEO, Chris Viehbacher, and announced initiation of a search for a new CEO. We had a close and productive working relationship with Chris for many years, and we wish him well in his future endeavors. But our relationship with Sanofi began before Chris's tenure and extends deeply to both company's research, development and commercial organizations. We expect the relationship to continue without interruption and unabated, as we advance our joint pipeline, including 3 Phase III antibodies to clinical trials and into commercialization. I spoke with Serge Weinberg, Sanofi's Chairman and acting CEO, on the day of their announcement and we'll meet with him this week. Sanofi and Regeneron are committed to bringing our late-stage drug candidates to patients as quickly as possible.","With that, let me turn the call over to George Yancopoulos, Regeneron's Chief Scientific Officer, who would discuss -- who will discuss our pipeline and our clinical research progress in greater detail. He will be followed by Bob Terifay, Senior Vice President of Commercial and then by Bob Landry, our Chief Financial Officer. George?","George D. Yancopoulos","Thank you, Len. And a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. I echo Len's sentiments that we are at a transformational stage in our evolution. From an R&D perspective, we had a very successful third quarter and we are poised to make significant strides in a variety of therapeutic areas. We have 3 antibodies in Phase III clinical development, and our pipeline of more than a dozen antibodies is advancing well.","I'd Like to begin with EYLEA. In the third quarter, EYLEA was approved in the U.S. in diabetic macular edema, or DME. And just last month, EYLEA received FDA approval for yet another indication, macular edema following retinal vein occlusion, which now includes both central and branch retinal vein occlusion. Outside the United States, our collaborator, Bayer HealthCare has received approval for EYLEA in DME in the European Union and for myopic choroidal neovascularization, or MCNV, in Japan.","Len mentioned the results from an NIH-sponsored study called Protocol T that looked at the comparative safety and efficacy of EYLEA versus ranibizumab and bevacizumab in patients with DME. We are very encouraged by these top line data and look forward to the full data publication by the DRCR and presentation at an upcoming medical conference.","We continue to invest in R&D that could bolster and protect our EYLEA franchise. Specifically, we're exploring combinations of EYLEA with other antibodies, our PDGF receptor antibody and our Ang2 antibody. Our combination trial of EYLEA with our PDGF receptor antibody is ongoing, and we expect to report initial data in early 2015. We have identified 2 doses from the Phase I study that we plan to move into Phase II, both in combination with the approved EYLEA 2 milligram dose, formulated in a single intravitreal injection.","Our combination study of EYLEA, coformulated with our Ang2 antibody, also in a single intravitreal injection in ophthalmology, is on track to enter clinical development later this year. In the third quarter, we received breakthrough therapy designations for EYLEA from the FDA for diabetic retinopathy in patients with DME. This designation was based on the positive data from 2 Phase III studies in DME, VIVID and VISTA, which demonstrates statistically significant improvements in prespecified measures of diabetic retinopathy in patients with DME after 2 years of treatment.","Turning now to the 3 antibody programs we have in Phase III, alirocumab for lowering LDL cholesterol, sarilumab for rheumatoid arthritis, and dupilumab which is currently in Phase III for atopic dermatitis and also being studied in a variety of other allergic and atopic conditions.","In the third quarter, we reported detailed positive data from 4 pivotal Phase III studies of alirocumab, our PCSK9 antibody, for lowering LDL cholesterol in people with hypercholesterolemia. These data were presented at the Annual Meeting of the European Society of Cardiology.","Across all these trials, alirocumab showed significant and sustained reduction in LDL cholesterol over one year on top of standard-of-care statin therapy across different patient types. As a reminder, a post-hoc safety analysis from the ODYSSEY long-term study showed that there was a lower rate of adjudicated major cardiovascular events, including cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke and unstable angina requiring hospitalization.","In the alirocumab group, compared to placebo, 1.4% compared to 3%, with a nominal p value of less than 0.01. These represent the first preliminary evidence that this class may potentially lower the risk of cardiovascular events. However, definitive conclusions on cardiovascular risk lowering of alirocumab await the results of the ongoing 18,000-patient ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial, which is prospectively evaluating the potential of alirocumab to demonstrate cardiovascular benefit. We will be reporting data from 5 additional studies of alirocumab at the upcoming Annual Meeting of the American Heart Association.","Turning to sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody, which is in Phase III development for rheumatoid arthritis. We will be presenting additional data from positive Phase III sarilumab RA MOBILITY study at the upcoming Annual Meeting of the American College of Rheumatology. Let me remind you that the Phase III data, we have already shown, demonstrate an inhibition of progression of structural damage at week 52 as measured by the change in the modified van der Heijde Total Sharp Score. In the MOBILITY study, the group receiving the 200 milligram dose of sarilumab plus methotrexate had a reduction of approximately 90% in the radiographic progression assessment of the modified Total Sharp Score compared to the radiographic progression with placebo plus methotrexate at week 52. The safety findings in MOBILITY study were consistent with those observed in prior investigational studies with sarilumab. We have also initiated a new Phase III study, MONARCH, which is a head-to-head study of sarilumab monotherapy compared to a TNF inhibitor, adalimumab or Humira, also as monotherapy, in patients who are inadequate responders to methotrexate. We expect to report data from the ongoing Phase III trials and plan on regulatory submissions in 2015.","Dupilumab, our antibody that blocks both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, is one of the most exciting antibodies in our pipeline and continue to make significant progress in the third quarter. We now have positive Phase II data in 3 allergic or atopic conditions: atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic sinusitis with nasal polyposis. We also expect to see data from our phase IIb study of dupilumab in asthma before the end of this year. While asthma, atopic dermatitis and chronic sinusitis with nasal polyposis present in different ways, we believe that they all share the same basic immunopathology. The fact that many people suffer from more than one of these diseases at the same time provides evidence for this link. For example, in our phase IIb atopic dermatitis study, approximately 60% of patients had another allergic condition, including approximately 40% of patients who had a history of asthma. The positive data we have generated so far in multiple indications support our belief that IL-4 and IL-13 could be important drivers of the common underlying immunopathology that links certain allergic diseases.","In the atopic dermatitis indication, we recently initiated a Phase III study called, LIBERTY AD CHRONOS. This is the first study in the Phase III clinical program for dupilumab and is a double-blind placebo-controlled multinational study, with the primary objective of demonstrating efficacy of dupilumab in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who had administered concomitantly with topical corticosteroids through 16 weeks.","The trial is expected to enroll approximately 700 adult patients and will explore 2 separate doses of dupilumab. This study is part of the Larger LIBERTY Program in atopic dermatitis that will consist of at least 5 clinical studies in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.","Turning to our earlier-stage pipeline. In immuno-oncology, we recently initiated the study of our CD20 by CD3 by specific antibody, also known as REGN1979, and we expect to submit an IND for our PD-1 antibody before the end of this year.","We would also like to share with you the targets of 2 antibodies that have been previously undisclosed. First is REGN2222, an antibody against respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, which is currently in Phase I clinical development. This antibody is being developed in collaboration with Sanofi. RSV is a virus that affects the lungs in the respiratory passages and can result in serious illness and mortality, particularly in young children. It is the most common cause of bronchitis and pneumonia in children under the age of 1 in the United States, and is also an important cause of respiratory disease in older adults. We believe that our antibody could require significantly fewer administrations when compared to the standard -- current standard of care, which would be a big advantage for the pediatric population and open up the opportunity for benefit to a larger unmet need population.","The second antibody, we'd like to disclose, is REGN1500, an antibody to ANGPTL3, in the lipid lowering space. We are particularly excited about this opportunity because there is a substantial human and mouse genetic evidence supporting the possibility that blocking ANGPTL3 can improve lipid and metabolic profiles and perhaps provide cardiovascular benefits.","Continuing on the theme of genetics. We recently announced that the Regeneron Genetics Center is fully operational and that we have obtained DNA sequences from the first 10,000, the de-identified individuals. We are currently on track to be able to sequence samples from 50,000 individuals per year. While our capacity for DNA sequencing is extremely high, our competitive advantage in this field starts with the focus on the right types of individuals to sequence, such as those in our Geisinger collaboration, and is further enhanced by our ability to rapidly combine DNA sequencing with mouse gene functionization technologies. And our ability to translate findings into therapeutics using our VelocImmune technology. We have continued to expand our capabilities into foreign areas of human genetics research through new scientific collaborations with several leading institutions, an important additions to our in-house and advisory scientific teams.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Bob Terifay.","Robert J. Terifay","Thanks, George. And good morning, everyone. It's been a very busy time for the Regeneron commercial team with 2 recent approvals and launches for EYLEA and diabetic macular edema and macular edema following retinal vein occlusion. And a potential launch in 2015 for alirocumab for hypercholesterolemia. I'd like to begin my comments today with EYLEA.","Third quarter, U.S. EYLEA net sales to distributors were $445 million, which represents a 23% increase over third quarter 2013. Sequential quarterly growth in physician sales was 8%. Currently, EYLEA sales in the United States represent approximately half of the FDA-approved anti-VEGF therapies for retinal diseases. The vast majority of EYLEA sales come from the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration. EYLEA growth so far this year has come primarily from growth in the wet AMD market.","As you know, in July, we received FDA approval for EYLEA in a third, very important new indication, DME, which is the leading cause of blindness among working aged adults in the United States. EYLEA is the first and only anti-VEGF agent approved for DME with a dosing interval of greater than every 4 weeks. According to the U.S. prescribing information, EYLEA can be dosed every 8 weeks, following 5 initial monthly doses. The Phase III studies for EYLEA in DME were the only registration studies that compared an anti-VEGF agent to standard-of-care macular laser photocoagulation therapy. Immediately, following approval, we launched EYLEA in DME. The targeted physicians are largely the same physicians who treat wet AMD.","DME represents a large potential market opportunity for EYLEA. As it's estimated that approximately 600,000 eyes are diagnosed with essentially involved diabetic macular edema in the United States each year, a similar number to those diagnosed with wet AMD. Of these eyes diagnosed, only about 40% are currently treated with anti-VEGF therapy, with laser used as an alternative treatment modality. Because EYLEA has been approved using the same single strength 2-milligram dose per injection for all indications, it's difficult to give you an estimate of the portion of our sales coming specifically from DME versus AMD. Anecdotal physician reports indicate that they are using EYLEA in both their anti-VEGF naive and switch DME patients. Consistent with our prelaunch market research, physicians continue to indicate strong prescribing intent for EYLEA in DME. However, uptake will be slower than in wet AMD. There's a significant difference in the market dynamics between wet AMD and DME. In wet AMD, physicians are concerned if patients have ongoing retinal edema with fear of hemorrhage leading to sudden vision loss. Therefore, they look for alternative treatment options that might dry the retina. At the time of the EYLEA launch in wet AMD, there was a large patient population with a history of inadequate response to both ranibizumab and bevacizumab, whose physicians were waiting to switch them to EYLEA. In DME, physicians believe that the waxing and waning edema is not as dangerous to long-term maintenance of vision as in wet AMD. Thus, there's less urgency to initiate treatment of naive patients or switch patients, who have suboptimal responses to their current therapies. Anti-VEGF agents have also not been used to DME for as long as they have been used in wet AMD. So the market is not as well-developed, with laser treatments still heavily entrenched.","Pair dynamics are also different between wet AMD and DME. In wet AMD, the vast majority of patients are over age 65 and covered by traditional Medicare. Traditional Medicare coverage of \"buy and bill\" drugs occur shortly after FDA approval. In DME, only an estimated 30% of patients are covered by traditional Medicare. Commercial payers are slower to provide drug coverage. Even when coverage is granted, notification to physicians, and the loading of reimbursement information to payer portals doesn't occur in a predictable manner.","Retinal physicians, who must absorb the cost of anti-VEGF agents if they don't get reimbursed, often want evidence for each payer that the drug is covered and that each payer has paid a claim before they will prescribe the drug.","For these reasons, while usage of EYLEA in DME continues to grow, we expect the uptake of EYLEA in DME to be slower than what we saw in wet AMD.","Where are we so far with reimbursement? Week-over-week, we continue to make steady progress with coverage and paid claim confirmation across the payer space for EYLEA in DME. Currently, all Medicare jurisdictions have coverage and evidence of paid claims for EYLEA in DME.","Regarding commercial patients. Over 95% of commercial lives have confirmed coverage for EYLEA for DME. We currently have evidence of paid claims from over half of these payers. Benefits investigations to our reimbursement hub have increased at a growing pace every month since launch.","Likewise, use of physician samples for the initial patient startup therapy has increased since the DME launch. We remain confident that there's a significant market opportunity for EYLEA in DME, if physicians become comfortable with reimbursement coverage. This should be bolstered as physicians become more familiar with our Phase III DME data against standard-of-care therapy and when the pending data from the NIH DRCR Protocol T Comparative Safety and Efficacy Study of the VEGF inhibitors are publicly presented.","Other potential sources of further EYLEA growth include potential changes to the regulation of compounded biologics, such as bevacizumab and our recent approval in macular edema following retinal vein occlusion.","I'd now like to address the x U.S. business, where we split profits with our collaborator, Bayer HealthCare.","Third quarter 2014, x U.S. EYLEA sales were $277 million. X U.S. EYLEA sales continue to be an important growth driver, and the launch outside the United States is making significant progress. EYLEA has recently been approved for the DME indication in the European Union and for the treatment of myopic choroidal neovascularization in Japan. Bayer HealthCare has also filed regulatory applications for EYLEA for the treatment of macular edema following BRVO in Europe. There remains significant x U.S. growth potential for EYLEA.","Highlighting the growth potential for EYLEA outside the United States. The annual market for EYLEA and ranibizumab, the 2 branded therapies combined, is approximately $3.5 billion outside the U.S. based on the run rate observed in the third quarter. EYLEA currently has approximately a 30% share of the x U.S. branded market as compared to a 50% share of the U.S. branded market. Therefore, there is ample growth opportunity x U.S. through approval and additional indications, further geographic expansion and market share gains.","With respect to alirocumab, our investigational PCSK9 antibody, that is being evaluated for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, we and our worldwide collaborator, Sanofi, are busy preparing for U.S. and EU regulatory submissions before the end of this year and planning for potential approval in the second half of 2015.","Regeneron and Sanofi share in all internal strategic and tactical planning and execution, including marketing, market access, health outcomes and medical affairs. Launch preparation is actively underway by both companies. We've recently agreed that we will share in sales force promotion for alirocumab with Sanofi in the United States. Sanofi will be responsible for sales promotion at launch outside of the United States. We reserve the right to share in x U.S. sales promotion at a later date. In this competitive marketplace, we'll not be sharing any further specifics at this time.","Preparing for a significant launch, such as this one, requires planning and commercial investment. With the potential launch anticipated in the second half of 2015, that investment is already underway and will continue to accelerate in the upcoming months. As part of the agreement with Sanofi, we currently share pre- and post-launch commercial expenses, approximately 50-50, on a realtime basis.","Bob Landry will provide more detail on the financial impact. With that, let me turn over the call to Bob Landry, our Chief Financial Officer.","Robert E. Landry","Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone who has joined us today. Overall, we're pleased with our third quarter performance.","In the third quarter, we are in $2.52 per diluted share for a non-GAAP net income of $295 million, which represents a 5% and 6% increase respectively versus the 3 months ended September 30, 2013.","Our non-GAAP EPS was negatively impacted by a $34 million charge, or $0.29 on a per diluted share basis, that we recognized in the third quarter 2014 in connection with our and Sanofi's purchase of the priority review voucher, which we plan to use for the anticipated BLA submission of alirocumab later this year.","Regeneron's non-GAAP EPS excludes noncash share-based compensation expense, noncash interest expense related to our senior convertible notes, loss on extinguishment of debt in relation to the conversion of a portion of our convertible notes which occurred earlier in the year, and income tax expense.","In the third quarter of 2014, our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation also included an incremental charge related to our branded prescription drug fee, based on final regulations issued during the quarter by the IRS.","A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings and a brief discussion of the branded prescription drug fee incremental charge is set forth in our earnings release.","Total revenues in the third quarter of 2014 were $726 million, representing a 22% increase compared to total revenues in the third quarter of 2013. Net product sales were $449 million in the third quarter of 2014 compared to $367 million in the third quarter of 2013.","EYLEA net product sales in the U.S. were $445 million in the third quarter of 2014 compared to $363 million in the third quarter of 2013, which represented an increase of 23%. U.S. EYLEA distributor inventory levels remained within the normal 1 to 2-week range.","As mentioned in our press release issued earlier this morning, we are tightening our U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance to $1.7 billion to $1.74 billion from the previously provided range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. X U.S. EYLEA sales were $277 million in the third quarter 2014 as compared to $247 million last quarter and $125 million in the third quarter of 2013.","Product revenue from x U.S. EYLEA sales is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer HealthCare. Please keep in mind that Bayer HealthCare's reported x U.S. EYLEA sales are not exactly the same as the x U.S. numbers that we report. This is because for Japan, Bayer reports their sales to their distributor, Santen, while we report Santen's end market sales.","In the third quarter 2014, Regeneron recognized $85 million from its share of net profit from EYLEA sales outside the United States after repayment of $14 million in development expenses compared to $32 million in the third quarter of 2013 after repayment of $15 million in development expenses.","Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue for the third quarter was $136 million. This included two 15 million dollar sales milestones that we earned upon aggregate x U.S. net sales of EYLEA exceeding $800 million and $900 million over a 12-month period. We are expecting to earn another two 15 million dollar milestones during the fourth quarter. This would bring our EYLEA x U.S. milestones in 2014 to a total of $105 million. After that, there will only be one 15 million dollar milestone payment remaining to be earned from Bayer related to x U.S. EYLEA sales, which we expect to receive in 2015.","Global ZALTRAP, or ziv-aflibercept, injection for intravenous infusion net sales, as recorded by Sanofi, were $23 million in the third quarter compared to $18 million in the third quarter of 2013. We recognized approximately $1 million as our share of the losses related to ZALTRAP in the third quarter.","Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $133 million for the third quarter of 2014. As we said previously, the Sanofi collaboration revenue line primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, which was $142 million in the third quarter of 2014, our share of losses in connection with ZALTRAP, amortization of upfront and other payments received from Sanofi and our share of expenses associated with Sanofi's prelaunch commercialization expenses related to alirocumab in accordance with our antibody collaboration agreement. As we approach the potential approval and launch of alirocumab in 2015, we fully expect these prelaunch commercialization expenses to become substantial.","Regeneron's share of antibody commercialization expenses was a new component within our Sanofi collaboration revenue line item first introduced last quarter, where we outlined the accounting treatment. However, I think it's worth recapping again. So let me say a few words on how we will record our share of the antibody prelaunch commercialization expenses. The prelaunch commercialization expenses that Regeneron incurs will be primarily recorded within our SG&A line. We then recognize 100% of the amount of these prelaunch expenses as reimbursement revenue, which is contained in the other line in Table 4 of our earnings release under Sanofi collaboration revenue. On a net P&L basis, this reimbursement revenue offsets the expenses we incur. In addition, we will also record 50% of the total prelaunch commercialization expenses spent by both parties as contra revenue, which is represented by the $13 million of Regeneron's share of antibody commercialization expenses in Sanofi collaboration revenue, as depicted in Table 4 of our earnings release.","Please keep in mind that as we approach the launch of alirocumab and other antibodies that are part of our collaboration with Sanofi, we expect this expense, or contra revenue, to significantly increase. However, once the antibodies are launched and become profitable, we expect this component to become positive revenue as it will reflect our share of the antibody commercial profits.","Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $292 million in the third quarter of 2014. Our unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense minus R&D reimbursements we receive from our collaborators and R&D noncash share-based compensation expense, was $145 million in the third quarter of 2014. Our press release issued this morning includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense.","As we mentioned earlier, in July 2014, Regeneron and Sanofi announced that the companies had purchased an FDA rare pediatric disease priority review voucher from a third party. We, in Sanofi, shared equally the purchase price of the priority review voucher. Our share of the cost was $34 million, which we recorded as an R&D expense during the third quarter of 2014. We are tightening our unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D guidance to $490 million to $510 million from the previous guidance of $470 million to $510 million. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the third quarter were $82 million. We are tightening our non-GAAP SG&A guidance for the full year of 2014 to be between $330 million and $350 million from the previously provided guidance of $310 million to $350 million.","As referenced earlier and illustrated within our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, the 2014 third quarter GAAP net income included a $41 million incremental charge related to our branded prescription drug fee based on final regulations issued during the quarter by the IRS.","By way of background, a non-tax-deductible fee, called the branded prescription drug fee, is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs, such as Medicare Part B. This fee is allocated to companies based on their prior year market share of branded prescription drugs into these government programs, and the fee commenced in 2011.","In July 2014, the IRS issued final regulations that provided guidance on the branded prescription drug fee which were different in some respects from the temporary regulations issued by the IRS in 2011, including the fact that a company is liable for the fee based on its branded prescription drug sales in the current year, instead of the liability only being applicable upon the first qualifying branded prescription drug sale of the following year under the temporary regulations. Given the onetime nature of this adjustment, we have elected to exclude this expense from our 2014 non-GAAP earnings.","Non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $33 million in the third quarter. Included in this line item are royalty expenses in connection with our agreement with Genentech related to U.S. EYLEA sales, which we are obligated to pay until May 2016. Cost of collaboration manufacturing was $22 million in the third quarter.","With regard to taxes, due to the amounts of the company's net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards available for tax purposes, the company does not currently pay significant cash income taxes. In the third quarter of 2014, our GAAP effective tax rate was approximately 55% as compared to 37% for the third quarter of 2013. For the full year, we expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be in the mid 50% range. As a reminder, since we expect to begin to pay significant cash taxes in approximately the middle of 2015, we anticipate that our non-GAAP tax rate beginning in the first quarter of 2015 will represent a blended rate based on an estimate of the cash taxes payable for the full year. We will be able to provide more details in early 2015.","Our capital expenditures for the 9 months ended September 30, 2014, were $215 million, as we expand our Tarrytown, New York and Rensselaer New York facilities and continue renovations on our new biopharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Limerick, Ireland. These capital expenses will play an integral role in helping to ensure that we have the necessary infrastructure in place to launch our next generation of products. We are lowering our full year capital expenditure guidance to $300 million to $350 million from the previously provided range of $350 million to $425 million. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $1.5 billion compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2013. In October 2014, the company received notifications, that an additional $161 million principal amount of the company's convertible senior notes was surrendered for conversion, and settlement is anticipated during the fourth quarter of 2014.","The company has elected to settle these conversion obligations through a combination of cash and shares.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Michael.","Michael Aberman","Thank you, Bob. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our team will be available in our office after the call for follow-up questions. Thank you. And Roland, if you can please open the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Raymond from Robert Baird.","Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just sort of a general market trend question. I wonder if you can give me a little bit more color from what you're seeing in, so you may know that IAS has a data point that they publish every month that shows specialist office visits in the U.S. And it's shown, essentially all year, that ophthalmology business has been relatively weak in -- even when you look at it versus other specialties that have been fairly stable. I guess, first question on this is, are you seeing this? Or is this signal sort of not just right because it looks like not just EYLEA and AMD that is perhaps seeing a little bit of slowdown that's happening pretty much across the board. And any color on that would be great?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Sure. Bob can handle that. And I will just say, Len, just as an outset, that the retinal specialists are only a small subgroup of the ophthalmologists, so I'm not sure how relevant. And also, we haven't seen a slowdown in our product. Bob?","Robert J. Terifay","No. As, I think, Len summarized it, the retinal doctors are a small portion of the ophthalmology population. We are not hearing a slowdown in terms of visits. Given the urgency of retinal diseases, it would not be prudent for patients not to come into the physicians' office. So we're not seeing a falloff.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kantor from Credit Suisse.","Terrific. Any chance if you could provide us with what you think the breakdown of your sales are for AMD, RVO, and DME? And in the case that you're not going to answer that question, could you tell us a little bit more about the ANGPTL3 target? Is anyone else working on it? How is this different from PCSK9? How do you see this developing longer term?","Robert J. Terifay","Yes. So what we are -- we said we can't really give you breakdown because we don't have it, but George may be able to give you a little more information on ANGPTL3.","George D. Yancopoulos","Well, as far as we know, we're the only people who are developing a fully human antibody to the target. There are other approaches that I'm not going to really comment on that are trying to use other technologies to try to hit the target. But in our hands, an antibody is, really, an optimal way to address this target and certainly, we've shown that in preclinical models. The human genetic evidence as well as a lot of animal data suggests that this really can impact lipid profiles as well as perhaps, metabolic impact. In terms of lipids, it not only lowers LDL cholesterol in an LDL receptor independent pathway, meaning that for example, it could work in familial homozygotes that have absolutely no LDL receptor function. But also, it can dramatically lower triglycerides and essentially in animal studies, normalize them regardless of how high that they are. So the human genetic data suggests the possibility that this can be associated with positive outcome benefits. So we're very excited about this target. We think that we're relatively alone in terms of fully human antibodies, which is an optimal way to address it, and we're excited about moving forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber from Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I just wanted to follow-up on an earlier question. Maybe for Bob. So when you look at your earlier guidance of originally '17 to '18, now you're kind of taking to the lower end despite getting approval in DME a little earlier, so maybe I'm trying to understand a little bit. Can you help us understand what you're seeing and why you're sort of lowering the guidance to the lower end? Or what was sort of unexpected for you this year?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Sure. Bob will deal with that. I just want to finish up on the ANGPTL3, George was being -- maybe being a little bit too modest there. He and his colleagues were the first group to discover the angiopoietins, it means the angiopoietin light protein. So we have a long and rich history in this field that we're building on. And combining with our experience with PCSK9, I think this is a good and logical target that you -- we expect you're going to hear a lot more about. Bob, you want to address?","Robert J. Terifay","Yes. So first of all, I'd like to point out that we are very encouraged by the uptick that we are seeing in DME. As I said during my presentation, the benefits investigations are growing month over month since the launch of DME. We also have seen a growth in the utilization of our samples, which we did not have at our wet AMD launch. The samples are actually a way of getting patients started on to therapy whilst physicians get comfortable with the reimbursement situation. I think the big difference between the DME and the wet AMD is that the ramp is going to be a little slower. That's both because physicians don't have the same urgency to treat, but it's also because they want to have evidence that the commercial payers, who are the primary payer in wet AMD due to the -- DME due to the age of the DME patients, take a little longer to have evidence of a paid claim. So it's not that we're discouraged by the performance of the product this year, it's just in DME, it's going to take a little bit longer.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes, I think I might add that protocol T has the potential to be a real game changer, I think, in the minds of physicians. And they have not seen those data, so we hope those data will get published in the not-too-distant future, and we expect presentations by the DRCR. And as that data gets into the literature, we hope that it will influence a physician choice.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Robyn S. Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'm going to ask the question, you probably won't answer and then one that maybe you will. So just with the PCSK9 lawsuit, can you just -- I know you can't comment probably on your thoughts around it. Bus is there any color you can give us on why isn't it something that we might have predicted earlier and whether or not you think at all this could influence the timing of your launch? And then the question that you might be able to answer more is, so the Phase III in atopic dermatitis you're going after adults in the broader market, as I understand it, is more children. Can you help us understand how big the adult market is versus the kids, and like, what is the path or to getting to the broader label? Thank you.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Sure, Robyn. Before I get into that, which question didn't you think we were going to answer?","Robyn S. Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Oh, the PCSK9 lawsuit with the Amgen question. Any color would make me very happy though, I appreciate it.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Well, let me just say about the PCSK9 lawsuit. I know that Amgen has said publicly that, I think, the phrase they use that, it's sort of like a football phrase, they have the will and the skill and all that kind of stuff. We're not going to comment much, but we're going to focus on the facts and the law. And we've got a lot of experience in this patent arena. As you remember, we had a patent fight with Genentech relating to our EYLEA. So this is something I think that you'll just have to watch it unfold. As far as, whether or not we -- what we can say, we don't believe that we infringe any valid claims asserted in the past. Now, Bob, do you want to comment on the split between adult and pediatric opportunities?","Robert J. Terifay","Yes. So Robyn, you're correct. Obviously, there are a large number of children that develop atopic dermatitis early in life. And as George pointed out, the interesting about these Th2-mediated diseases is those children often develop other conditions, such as asthma, food allergies and other Th2-mediated conditions. So the pediatric audience represents a very important one, and we believe these children suffer in having the severe itch, in having the rash all over their body. There are definitely limitations on sleep, limitations on their ability to learn. So we definitely intend to develop dupilumab in the pediatric population, but we had to start in the adult population. The adult population does represent a significant opportunity. There's approximately 2 million adults around the world with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis that is inadequately controlled with topical corticosteroids. The other treatment options for those patients are not chronic because they have safety drawbacks. So we believe there is a significant opportunity. We've talked to a number of these patients, they suffer in silence and this dupilumab represents a major opportunity to help these patients.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adnan Butt with RBC Capital Markets.","Adnan S. Butt - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Len, you said Protocol T could be a game changer. When I attend meetings to talk to doctors, they appreciate the differences in safety and even efficacy. But at the same time, they say that maybe the sample sizes aren't big enough to show definitive differences in systemic side effects. So how do you think this impacts usage? Is this something that gives you an advantage versus the other agents? Is this something that helps you make the argument in front of parents? How do you expect Protocol T to play out?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes. I think we want to -- we don't want get into a debate now about this. Because we want to respect the DRCR. They worked very hard at doing this well-controlled study, it was independently conducted, multi-sites, lots of investigators. They were in complete control, and they deserve the ability to publish the data and discuss it and answer these types of questions. At a very high level, the only reason we put something out is because we believe we thought that this was material for our shareholders to know that on the top line, the data should be disclosed. But we don't want to debate. The Genentech machine is already in full gear, coming up with press statements, which I think is sort of not what we agreed to do with the DRCR. So we're not going to get into that level of debate. But if you hang in there a little while, I think everyone is going to be very pleased at how it all turns out.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So looking at the mid-point of your new 2014 EYLEA guidance that implies about sequential growth of 12% in the fourth quarter. And I think over the last 6 quarters, you guys have averaged around 6%. So just wondering if double-digit sequential growth is the right way to think about the forward trajectory for the drug now that you have DME and BRV on board?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Well, I think the only -- as far as you should think is, as far as we've given you some information, which is your mathematics is correct for the quarter -- for the next quarter, Terence.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can I ask a second one then, since...","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes. Because that was a weak question and a very narrow answer, we'll give you another one.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. I'll try harder this time. So obviously, in your prepared remarks, you said you selected 2 doses of 1979, your PDGF antibody that you're carrying forward into Phase II. Just wondering what type of data drove the choice of the doses there. Was it only PK data? Or did you also have some PD data that was available?","Leonard S. Schleifer","I think the first study primarily was just a safety study to demonstrate that we could deliver the product safely without inflammation and that sort of thing. And that's the main guidance of dose selection for Phase I.","Robert E. Landry","And Terence, just to be clear, the 1979 is our 80:20, so when you get there -- I know these Regeneron numbers can be confusing.","Leonard S. Schleifer","This is, yes, different numbers, sorry.","Robert E. Landry","I believe it's 2176.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Who knows, but...","Robert E. Landry","But we'll get back to you on that.","Leonard S. Schleifer","But the answer is, that was primarily a Phase I tolerability study.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The first one is related to your 2 antibodies for AMD and DME. I noticed that for the PDGF antibody REGN2176, you're doing the Phase I in AMD patients. And then you just announced the REGN910, which is the Ang2 antibody coformulated with EYLEA. You're testing that in DME patients in Phase I. I was wondering if this suggests you might use these 2 different antibodies to target different disease, one for DME, one for AMD? And then I have a question on DRCR, I mean, I hate to beat the dead horse, but Genentech and Roche were out there telling doctors that the 2 other difference between Lucentis and also the EYLEA in this trial was not really clinically meaningful. Can you make any comments around that?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes. So as far as the second question goes, as I said, you are beating a dead horse there. We're going to let the DRCR publish and speak and address the data. And when you see the full data set, come back and talk to us and talk to Genentech.","Robert J. Terifay","Actually, it's a live horse. It's just that it's still in the barn and it hasn't gone out yet, so you can't see exactly what it looks like.","Leonard S. Schleifer","As far as where Ang2 and PDGF combinations might fit in, I think that there's some preclinical data. As you might be aware, that would suggest a more restricted application for the PDGF, not wanting to use it in the DME setting. We'll see whether or not we can go broader in both settings, frankly, with Ang2 and EYLEA combinations.","Ying Huang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So Amgen recently announced that they're increasing enrollment for the OUTCOMES trial by 5,000 patients so that they will get the OUTCOMES data no later than 2017. I was wondering if you can comment on your evaluating the OUTCOMES trial for alirocumab?","Leonard S. Schleifer","That's a very good question, Ying, but we have no comment. I'm sorry.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Matt Roden from UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I have a question on the different horse, this one from the pipeline. And George, I guess, you have to think about where -- or I'm sure that you're considering very carefully where to invest your R&D dollars. We realized bringing in a new product cycle forward takes a lot of money, a lot of time. And I just wondered if you could talk about the rationale for bringing forward a preclinical PD-1 antibody at this point. We understand that the checkpoint inhibitors, particularly PD-1, represent a paradigm shift and providing combination approaches is one of the ways to differentiate within that. But what are your thoughts on that versus focusing on other checkpoint inhibitors, where arguably you could be more in front of the pack? And this is a little bit specific to PD-1, but it's more like I want to better understand the rationale for how you pick your projects to bring forward?","George D. Yancopoulos","All right. What we think that it's still very early in the game in terms of understanding the best and optimal way to use these various immuno regulators and checkpoint inhibitors. And we think it's very important to have our own foundation therapy to be used in a variety of combination approaches, both with other immuno regulators, but also with other classes of therapeutics as well. So we're taking a long-term view here that the real solutions, the real advances are still yet to come. And it's important to have a collection of the important players in the game to be providing the optimal combination solutions to patients in an efficient and economically feasible way as well. So it's a long-term strategy. We believe that it's very early in the game, and we're very excited about it.","Robert J. Terifay","And I think, as George has already said in some of his public talks that having more than -- if you need combinations of these, if you could have both of them, then you can control the cost with patients as well. And I think that's going to be important because we can't keep adding on expensive therapy on top of expensive therapy.","George D. Yancopoulos","I think that's a very important point. And I should also say that even our early-stage PD-1 trials, we're going to be trying to do different things than have been done before. So even our early studies may suggest a new insight and be able to provide better benefits to patients even before we get to latest stage combinations as well.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cohen and company.","Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on the alirocumab patent challenge with Amgen. Can you give us some sense of the publicly available milestones that will happen between here and your launch? Amgen's obviously asked for preliminary injunction, and it seems like the time is kind of tight for a judge to make that decision. So what will we see between here and kind of your PDUFA date coming from the judge -- or coming from the case?","Robert J. Terifay","The only thing we can say is we don't expect this lawsuit to impact our plans. But the details of how this unfolds, et cetera, et cetera, are probably going to be fairly complicated and have a bit of a rollercoaster in terms of lots of activities, little activity, but that's all we have to say, Phil, at this point.","Michael Aberman","Operator, that's going to be the exit call. So I want to thank, everyone, for joining us for this call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Michael Aberman, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.","Michael Aberman","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' First Quarter 2014 Conference Call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under Events and Presentations for 30 days.","Joining me on the call today is Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President of Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer; Bob Landry, Chief Financial Officer; and Bob Terifay, Senior Vice President, Commercial.","After our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for Q&A.","I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, those related to Regeneron and its products and business, sales and expense forecast, financial forecast, development programs, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, intellectual property and competition.

Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP are available in our financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website, www.regeneron.com.","Once our call concludes, the IR team will be available to answer further questions.","With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter was another significant quarter for Regeneron. The global EYLEA franchise continued to grow, and I will address that in more detail shortly. Our pipeline made progress, and we now have 15 antibodies in clinical development. We continue to make advances towards our mission of bringing important and innovative new medicines to patients. Our financial position has continued to strengthen, and we have embarked on new R&D initiatives and collaborations, including a collaboration with Avalanche Biotechnologies in the field of gene therapy that we announced earlier this week.","Let's turn now to some of the specifics of the quarter. The EYLEA franchise continues to exhibit strong growth, with global net sales of $577 million in the first quarter, representing a 54% increase compared to global EYLEA sales of $376 million in the first quarter of 2013.","First quarter 2014 EYLEA net sales in the U.S. was $359 million, which represents a 14% increase compared to first quarter of 2013. Net sales in the first quarter of 2014 were negatively impacted by a decrease in distributor inventory, while net sales in the first quarter of 2013 benefited from an increase in distributor inventory. Excluding these inventory changes, underlying demand for EYLEA in the first quarter in the United States increased by over 25% year-over-year. And this increase was despite the severe winter weather conditions that we believe impacted patients' ability to get to their physicians' offices for scheduled visits in many parts of the U.S. during the first quarter. Bob Terifay will provide further details in his remarks.","x U.S. EYLEA sales -- net sales were $218 million compared to $62 million in the first quarter of 2013, which was the first full quarter of EYLEA sales outside the U.S. by our x U.S. partner, Bayer HealthCare.","Looking ahead at the rest of 2014, we expect a number of potential growth drivers for EYLEA in the U.S. As announced previously, we have been granted an FDA target action date of August 18 for EYLEA in the Diabetic Macular Edema, or DME, indication. We believe that over the long term, in the United States, DME could be as significant an opportunity as wet AMD. We have also been granted a PDUFA date of October 23 for EYLEA in the fourth indication macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion, or BRVO. With these 2 potential label expansions in the second half of the year, we expect an increase in the growth of EYLEA sales in the U.S. in 2014 to be weighted towards the second half of the year.","Taking these factors into consideration, we reaffirm our previously provided full year U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. You will hear more about the commercial performance of EYLEA from Bob Terifay.","Further confirming our commitment to expanding our presence in the ophthalmology space, early this week, we announced an exciting collaboration with Avalanche to research and develop novel gene therapy products for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases. Avalanche is a leader in the field of next-generation gene therapy technologies, and we look forward to working with them to expand our approaches to developing novel therapies for diseases of the back of the eye.","In the coming months, we anticipate a large amount of new slope from our late-stage pipeline. We expect to report Phase III data from 9 studies about Alirocumab, our PCSK9 antibody for lowering LDL-cholesterol. Alirocumab clinical trials are addressing several patient populations, where, despite current therapies, there continues to exist a significant number of patients at high-cardiovascular risk. It is estimated that worldwide, there are approximately 22 million diabetic patients on statins with LDL-cholesterol levels greater than 70 milligrams per deciliter. There are 7.6 million secondary prevention patients, at least 250,000 diagnosed heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patients, and finally, about 5.8 patients -- 5.8 million patients who are statin intolerant. All of these patient populations are at high-cardiovascular risk and could potentially benefit from a therapy that could lower their LDL-cholesterol more than can be achieved with current standard of care.","We hope to present our Phase III data from sarilumab, our IL-6 antibody, with achievement of rheumatoid arthritis in the medical conference this quarter. Despite the availability of several TNF inhibitors for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, it is believed that up to 40% of patients are inadequately controlled or unable to tolerate their first TNF-alpha inhibitor. We believe that sarilumab has the potential to offer a very compelling product profile, with the flexibility of both low-dose and high-dose subcutaneous regimens, coupled with every-other-week dosing, which might offer a good option for patients.","For dupilumab, a potentially important new therapy for patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, we look forward to reporting top line Phase IIb data and starting a Phase III program in this indication shortly.","We are also currently exploring dupilumab in Phase II trials for asthma and nasal polyposis and evaluating starting the drug in a variety of other Th2-mediated diseases. You will hear further details from George.","With that, let me turn the call over to George Yancopoulos, Regeneron's Chief Scientific Officer, who will discuss our pipeline in greater detail. He will be followed by Bob Terifay, our Senior Vice President of Commercial, and then by Bob Landry, our Chief Financial Officer. George?","George D. Yancopoulos","Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. I'm happy to report that Regeneron's broad pipeline continues to advance. Let me begin with EYLEA. As Len mentioned, we've been granted a PDUFA date of August 18 for EYLEA in the DME indication and October 23 for the macular edema, following BRVO indication. Our x U.S. partner, Bayer HealthCare, has also submitted applications for marketing authorization in the DME indication in the European Union and in Japan.","Diabetes is a growing significant public health issue worldwide, and diabetic macular edema represents one of the site-threatening complication of diabetes. If approved, we hope to be able to provide a new therapeutic option for the treatment of this condition.","We are going to be getting a lot of data from our late-stage antibody programs in the very near term. Let me begin with alirocumab, a monoclonal antibody for lowering LDL-cholesterol. Beginning in June, we expect to start reporting data from 9 Phase III studies about alirocumab. We have previously reported positive data from the Phase III ODYSSEY MONO study, which studies alirocumab in the monotherapy setting. The data from these 10 studies will be the basis for our regulatory submissions globally. And we expect to be ready to make these submissions by approximately at the end of 2014.","In the U.S., the regulatory submission is gated on the progress of the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial and discussions with the FDA. Since both the trials and our discussions are ongoing, we cannot give more precise guidance on timing in the U.S. at this time.","This past quarter, we also shared data for the first time for alirocumab dosed every 4 weeks at the 150-milligram dose in patients who were not on statin. We think this regimen could be an important option for patients to be dosed every 4 weeks, with an easy-to-use, single 1-milliliter injection of alirocumab. We are studying this dose in the CHOICE II trial that was started in the first quarter and is already fully enrolled.","I'm also happy to report that the CHOICE I study, which explores 300 milligrams dosed every 4 weeks, is also fully enrolled. We believe that the Phase III ODYSSEY program is designed to yield robust efficacy and safety data. Excluding the OUTCOMES trial, we expect to have over 5,000 patient years of double-blind exposure at the time of the completion of these trials.","As we have mentioned before, we have also designed our program to support the ability of physicians to personalize therapy and either start patients at a higher dose or start at a lower dose and up-titrate necessary, thus offering greater flexibility to suit individual patient needs.","Our Phase III program in rheumatoid arthritis with sarilumab, our antibody targeting the IL-6 pathway, is progressing. And we hope to present the full positive data from the Phase III MOBILITY study in an upcoming medical conference shortly.","We reported top line positive data from this study in the fourth quarter of 2013. There are currently 4 more Phase III studies of sarilumab in RA that are ongoing, with expected readouts beginning in 2015.","Turning to dupilumab. We continue to be very excited by this IL-4 receptor alpha antibody that blocks both the IL-4 and IL-13 signaling pathways. Dupilumab is currently in clinical trials for asthma, atopic dermatitis and nasal polyposis.","At the Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, also known as Quad AI, we presented positive data from a Phase IIa study of dupilumab in atopic dermatitis. We expect to report data from our Phase IIb study of dupilumab in atopic dermatitis in the second quarter of 2014 and expect to initiate a Phase III study shortly thereafter.","Dupilumab is also currently in a Phase II proof-of-concept trial in nasal polyposis and a Phase IIb study in asthma. We are evaluating the potential use of dupilumab in additional clinical indications.","As you can see, we have a busy late-stage pipeline. Our early-stage pipeline is also active and growing. We now have a total of 15 antibodies in the clinic, including 2 that entered the clinic this year: REGN2176, our PDGF pathway blocking antibody; and REGN2222, against an undisclosed target. We expect at least 2 additional antibodies to enter the clinic by year-end, including our first clinical candidate in immuno-oncology, a bispecific antibody. All of these antibodies were derived using our VelocImmune technology. 8 of the 15 antibodies that are currently in clinical development are being developed in collaboration with Sanofi, including our newest antibody in the clinic, REGN2222.","I would now like to also spend a few minutes talking about a recent new R&D initiative. As we announced on Monday, we have entered into a collaboration with Avalanche Biotechnologies to develop next-generation gene therapy products in ophthalmology. Genetics has always been an area of interest and expertise at Regeneron. As such, the movement to gene therapy is a natural fit. We view Avalanche as a leader in this field, particularly as it applies to diseases of the eye and development of novel vectors that specifically target retinal cells. Our scientific and commercial expertise in ophthalmology, combined with Avalanche's novel vector technologies, will allow us to invest and investigate potentially breakthrough therapies in ophthalmology.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Bob Terifay, our Senior Vice President of Commercial, who will provide further details on the EYLEA commercial landscape.","Robert J. Terifay","Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin with EYLEA, or intravitreal aflibercept injection. First quarter U.S. EYLEA net sales were $359 million. According to a qualitative market research survey that we conducted in the first quarter, EYLEA continues to account for approximately half of the branded anti-VEGF market in the United States for the treatment of wet AMD. And the brand of market continues to represent approximately half of the total anti-VEGF market in this indication.","As previously mentioned, we saw distributors build EYLEA inventory towards the end of last year, which was driven partly by the tightening of our commercial payment terms, beginning in January of 2014. During the first quarter, inventory levels were worked down to the normalized 1- to 2-week range compared to the greater than 2 weeks of inventory at the end of 2013.","Putting inventory aside, if we look at sales to physicians from the distributors, we saw an increase this quarter of over 25% on a quarter -- on a year-over-year basis and an increase of approximately 3% over fourth quarter of 2013. While there was quarter-over-quarter growth in sales to physicians, we believe the first quarter 2014 U.S. EYLEA sales to doctors were negatively impacted by severe weather conditions in the United States. The inclement weather made it challenging for patients in some parts of the countries to travel to their physicians' offices. Anecdotally, physicians have reported that in the Northeast, Midwest and mid-Atlantic, the weather resulted in fewer patient visits to physicians' offices. EYLEA is an in-office procedure, and the typical wet AMD as outpatient is elderly, making travel this winter particularly difficult. An analysis of sales to physicians by geography shows that EYLEA sales growth in the first quarter was strongest in the parts of the country that did not experience such severe weather, such as the Pacific Northwest, the West Coast, the Southwest and the Southeast.","Turning to the macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion, or CRVO indication, the second indication for which EYLEA has been approved in the United States, data from our survey suggest that EYLEA in this indication represents over 40% of the approved branded anti-VEGF market. The branded anti-VEGF market continues to represent about 45% of the overall market.","As Len and George mentioned, we're awaiting regulatory decisions for EYLEA in 2 additional indications: diabetic macular edema and macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion, or BRVO. DME could be as big of a market opportunity as wet AMD.","As we have said before, it is estimated that approximately 600,000 patients are diagnosed with clinically significant macular edema in the United States. Of these patients, only about 40% are currently treated with the anti-VEGF therapy. If approved in these indications, we expect an acceleration of growth in the United States' EYLEA sales in the second half of this year.","I now like to address the x U.S. EYLEA business, where we split profits with our collaborator, Bayer HealthCare. First quarter 2014 x U.S. EYLEA sales were $218 million. x U.S. EYLEA sales continue to be an important growth driver, and the launch outside the United States is making significant progress.","According to data provided by Bayer HealthCare, EYLEA has approximately a 30% share of the market in Germany and is gaining share in the United Kingdom and France, 2 countries where the drug was only recently launched. Over the course of 2014, we expect Bayer to embark on additional launches in the 2 approved indications of wet AMD and macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion, following regulatory and pricing approval in individual countries.","Outside of the United States, EYLEA's approved in 61 countries for the wet AMD indication and 40 countries in the macular edema following CRVO indication.","With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry.","Robert E. Landry","Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance. We earned $2.26 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $263 million, which represents a 27% and 31% increase, respectively, versus the 3 months ended March 31, 2013.","Regeneron's non-GAAP EPS excludes noncash share-based compensation expense, noncash interest expense related to our senior convertible notes and income tax expense. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release.","Total revenue in the first quarter was $626 million, representing a 42% increase compared to total revenues in the first quarter of 2013. Net product sales were $362 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to $319 million in the first quarter of 2013. EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $359 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to $314 million in the first quarter of 2013, an increase of 14%.","ARCALYST rilonacept net product sales were $3 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to $5 million in the first quarter of 2013. As mentioned earlier on the call, first quarter 2014 U.S. EYLEA net sales were adversely impacted by a drawdown of distributor inventory levels to a more normalized range of 1 to 2 weeks on hand.","As stated in our press release issued earlier this morning, we are reaffirming our U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. This guidance factors in the potential approval of EYLEA in the DME and macular edema following BRVO indications in the U.S. in the second half of the year.","x U.S. EYLEA sales were $218 million in the first quarter 2014 as compared to $62 million in the first quarter of 2013, which was the first full quarter of EYLEA sales outside the United States. Product revenue from x U.S. EYLEA sales is recorded by Bayer HealthCare. As Bob Terifay mentioned in his comments, the EYLEA x U.S. launches on a strong trajectory and showed sequential quarter-over-quarter growth of 18%. We and Bayer HealthCare are very pleased with the progress that EYLEA is making outside the U.S. and anticipate further growth as Bayer continues the global rollout into additional markets, including Spain, Italy and Canada.","We recognized $61 million as our share of the net profits from x U.S. EYLEA sales in the first quarter of 2014, after repayment of $14 million in development expenses to Bayer HealthCare.","Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue for the first quarter was $125 million. This included 2 $15 million sales milestones that we earned upon aggregate x U.S. net sales of EYLEA exceeding $500 million and $600 million, respectively, over a 12-month period. Depending on x U.S. sales, we could receive 2 additional $15 million milestone payments this year.","Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $131 million for the first quarter of 2014. As we've said before, the Sanofi collaboration revenue line primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, which was $128 million in the first quarter; our share of losses in connection with ZALTRAP, ziv-aflibercept for intravenous infusion, which was $3 million in the first quarter; and amortization of upfront and other payments received from Sanofi. Global ZALTRAP net sales as recorded by Sanofi were $22 million in the first quarter.","Turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $244 million in the first quarter of 2014. Our unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense minus R&D reimbursements we received from our collaborators and R&D noncash share-based compensation expense, was $95 million in the first quarter of 2014. Our press release issued this morning includes all the information that's required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense.","For 2014, we are reaffirming our previously provided unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D guidance of $425 million to $475 million. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the first quarter were $71 million. For the full year 2014, we are reaffirming our non-GAAP SG&A guidance to be between $330 million to $380 million.","We are expecting our non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be higher in the second half of 2014, as we begin to record prelaunch expenses for alirocumab. As a reminder, non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses exclude noncash share-based compensation expense.","Non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $27 million in the first quarter. Included in this line item are royalty expenses in connection with our agreement with Genentech related to U.S. EYLEA sales, which we're obligated to pay until May 2016. Cost of collaboration manufacturing was $16 million in the first quarter.","Turning now to taxes. The company does not currently pay or expect to pay in the near term significant cash income taxes. In the first quarter of 2014, the GAAP effective tax rate was approximately 63%, which is higher than our previously reported rate. Recently enacted New York state tax legislation reduced our New York State income tax rate to 0%, effective in 2014. While this will provide us with New York State tax relief, we also took a onetime tax charge in the first quarter to reduce our related deferred tax assets.","Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2014 was also negatively impacted by the expiration at the end of 2013 of the federal tax credit for increased research activities and losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions with rates lower than the federal statutory rate.","For the full year 2014, we expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be in the low- to mid-50% range. At the end of the first quarter, we have cash and marketable securities totaling approximately $1.2 billion. We also had trade accounts receivable approximating $800 million.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Len.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Thanks, Bob, and thank you, everybody else. The coming months will be filled with data from many of our programs, including expected readouts from the Phase III alirocumab program and Phase IIb dupilumab trial in atopic dermatitis, both of which we are doing in collaboration with our partner, Sanofi, and the -- as well as the data presentation of the Phase III sarilumab MOBILITY results, also in collaboration with Sanofi.","In addition, we are preparing for the potential approvals and launches of EYLEA in 2 additional indications: diabetic macular edema and macular edema following BRVO. We are working steadily towards advancing our pipeline and investing in novel technologies.","With that, I will now turn the call back over to Michael.","Michael Aberman","Thank you, Len. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call to Q&A.","[Operator Instructions] The IR team will be available in our offices after the call for follow-up questions.","Thank you, and operator, if you could please give instructions and open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Robert Baird & Co.","Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So just curious, you guys highlighted sort of, as I heard it, 2 factors here for the seasonality. One was weather and the other was inventory. And I think we kind of knew about the inventory, from your comments earlier in the year. But not asking for exact figures, could you give some sense of the breakdown between the 2? And with weather improving in April, May, can you maybe talk about what sort of trends you've seen in the regions that were affected in Q1?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Chris, thanks. Len. Thanks for your questions. In terms of the last part of your question, we just never comment about how -- quarters ago and mid-quarters. Just a standard policy here. In terms of the breakdown between weather and inventory, it's hard to do that. Inventory, we told you about, you can sort of quantify that, based on what the information we gave you at the end of last year and this call. Weather is just a guess how much that impacted things, and it's really hard to know, although, as Bob indicated, we saw a good and stronger growth in regions that were not impacted by the weather. This is -- we're just beginning also to understand the seasonality of our business here because up until now, we've been in the really rapid part of the growth of the launch, and you haven't seen -- it obscures any seasonality. When you look quarter of this -- first quarter of this year compared to first quarter of last year, the underlying growth to doctors was still very strong. So that's the information we have, and I know you'd like to crawl around a little bit more, but I think that's all we're going to be able to give you today, Chris. Sorry.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kantor with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jason Kantor - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Well, I was going to ask that exact same question, but I have plenty more. Could you give us an idea of what kind of [indiscernible] that you would hope could come out of the collaboration with Avalanche? What kind of deliveries are we talking about? Is this something that would augment or replace anti-VEGF therapy? Are we looking at other diseases of the back of the eye? Could you give us some better sense of what you're trying to get out of this collaboration?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Sure. Maybe George can comment on that in a little more detail. But in terms of the business terms -- before he gets into the science, the business terms of that -- we get to work on some very specific targets, as well as we get to have a certain right to negotiate for what they have in the clinic already for anti-VEGF. But we believe that it's the ability to go after diseases that are not easily addressed by conventional pharmaceuticals that's intriguing here. George?","George D. Yancopoulos","Yes. To that end, we're not announcing what the targets are, but the point being that as Len said, they have an interesting set of technologies and vectors that allow you to target, perhaps, particular cell types. It's a way of, perhaps, getting longer-term delivery of a gene product. And it also allows gene products that maybe can't be delivered as protein to be delivered to the eye. So I think it's a very interesting collaboration. Of course, we note that it's a relatively long-term investment and collaboration that's not going to necessarily be yielding something in the very near future.","Jason Kantor - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","When would we expect to see any data from the PDGF program?","Leonard S. Schleifer","So the PDGF program is early going. And so I guess we'll get -- so when we have them, we'll give them to you. We're just in the Phase I part of this program. So until we get a little more into it, it will be hard to give you some timeframes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Schwartz with Leerink Partners.","Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the market opportunity that you see for alirocumab before and after CV OUTCOMES data is generated. You gave some metrics on the various segments of patients. Do you see adoption more or less in any of those areas if you're approved, just on LDL versus several years away when you get CV OUTCOMES data?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Right. So I'll let Bob take that question. But let me just make the general point here, is that the drug is not approved yet, so we're speculating on how the drug might be used. We don't know what the label actually will be. But we can talk to you about the kinds of patients that, based on our research, might find that they and their doctors would want to use this product before OUTCOMES and some afterwards. Bob?","Robert J. Terifay","Yes. So I think the important point is when you look at the high-risk -- so I think when you look at the high-risk patients with uncontrolled LDL-C, there are approximately 20 million of those patients in the United States. And there is a significant unmet medical need that LDL-C reduction in and of itself is an important goal for patients. I think that the enriched patient populations that are particularly interesting are those who had a history of a cardiovascular event, as well as those who are statin intolerant. Statin-intolerant patients don't have a very effective alternative to statins, and so those -- both of those markets represent significant opportunities, as does the heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patient population, who are also very, very poorly controlled.","Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Do you have any market research that says what physicians -- to what degree they're willing to use it in these segments before...","Robert J. Terifay","I'm not going to give you the specifics right now, but there is significant -- physicians, when they see the product profile, are very, very interested in using the product.","Michael Aberman","And if I could add also, it's Michael, we did an IRC, we had a call just a month ago. We presented some of our early market research that did show just unwillingness to prescribe. So if you want to go, I can share those slides to talk about awareness, as well as likely how they're prescribing monoclonal, so we can do that offline.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just one quick one and then a little more in-depth ones. First, just on the gross to net. Can you guys give us any update there in terms of where this stands, given you mentioned you're still tracking the -- how your drug is now post in the hyper-growth phase. And then the second question is just any expectations for the ongoing DRCRnet, DME trial, comparing EYLEA, Lucentis and Avastin?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Right. So do we have any color at all on the...","Robert E. Landry","Yes, Len. I mean, what we saw in the first quarter from a gross to net has been consistent to what we've seen. We had a little bit of an outlier in the first -- in the fourth quarter of 2013, but it was kind of as expected, our gross to net, for quarter 1, pertaining to EYLEA.","Leonard S. Schleifer","And in terms of the DRCRnet study, I don't -- we don't know exactly but -- when the data will be available. I think this is referring to some studies being conducted by a consortium. And my understanding is it might be late this year. But I'm not -- Bob, do you have any further information now?","Robert J. Terifay","I don't have any.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Mohit Bansal - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Mohit filling in for Robyn. She is hosting our Healthcare Conference in Boston. So the question is regarding the market dynamic in DME. Could you please help us understand how the DME market is, in terms of maturity when you compare it to AMD? And do you expect AMD like [indiscernible] for DME as well?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Right. So in terms of maturity, I would say that the market is not very mature yet. Bob Terifay might have some color on that. And as well as in terms of the uptake, we don't want to get into predicting the launch here. So Bob?","Robert J. Terifay","As we said, we believe that the long-term market opportunity in DME is at least as big as the wet AMD market opportunity. At the present time, about 400,000 patients are treated with an anti-VEGF therapy each year for wet AMD. When you look at DME, it is growing year-over-year, but it's currently at about 240,000 patients are treated with an anti-VEGF. The issue is that a lot of these patients are still out with the general ophthalmologist who uses laser therapy in these patients. The issue with laser therapy is that it does affect the visual field for the patient. And so the real challenge for us is to make sure that we emphasize to patients that they need to get a dilated retinal exam as early as possible and regularly. And they need to get to a retinal physician for treatment. And that really is going to be the focus of our launch. But I will tell you that since Lucentis launched in the diabetic macular edema indication, the market has grown.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes, I just want to reemphasize that our Phase III data that we submitted to the agency was a head-to-head comparison against laser. So we think that data, if the drug gets approved and then gets into a label, could have an influence on practice, in terms of the selection. As Bob mentioned, laser still has a pretty strong legacy. I was at the ARVO meetings and some previous retinal meetings early this year, and basically, the sense you get from those meetings is that laser for center-involved macular edema is really being relegated not to the front line. It's moving more and more to anti-VEGF therapy with the approval with Lucentis in that indication.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company.","Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask on the dupilumab Phase IIb data that's going to be out sometime over the next few weeks, what your expectations are for the data. I guess, in particular, when I look at the Phase IIa with the EASI-50 responders at 100%, I guess that's not going to change. I'm curious on the placebo on there. However, it looks like 30 days, that was still trending up. So is there a chance that over 3 months, maybe placebo kind of also approaches that 100%? And same -- similar questions on the pruritus numeric rating scale and the IGA score, all those were trending down at 30 days. Would we be wrong for the -- to our group in just extrapolating those lines out to 3 months? Is there anything different in the design between the IIb and the IIa that would kind of make that a not valid expectation?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Phil, I'll let George if he wants to get into some more detail, but I think that you may be approaching it in the wrong way. I don't think there's much of a gain to get into trying to predict exactly what these numbers are. I think that what we can say is we feel extremely confident in this program that we're going to have strong data, based on what I feel is a very strong Phase I and Phase IIa program. That's the main message here. George, do you want to add?","George D. Yancopoulos","Yes. You should go back and just review the Phase IIa data, which was a 12-week study which was presented. And we do think that, that data, we're hoping -- because that data was very impressive, we're hoping to replicate that sort of data into Phase IIb. The 100% numbers you're talking about was in the Phase I study in combination with topical corticosteroids. So the average percent change in EASI over the 12-week study was about 75%. So that means the average percent change in the total patients was about 75%, and the placebo group was about 25%. That was in the 12-week study, as I said, the Phase IIa. And the proportion of patients who achieved an EASI-50 at 12 weeks was about 85% and the placebo group, about 35%. So what we're hoping -- these obviously are very impressive data, which we hope would be replicated in the Phase IIb. And that's what we're looking for. We're looking to get quite similar data to what we saw in the Phase IIa, which was a 12-week study.","Leonard S. Schleifer","George, could you just comment because he made a question whether placebo continues to change over the course of the trial. Is that what we saw or is it...","George D. Yancopoulos","Well, the placebo does go up slowly, but it was a 12-week study. I think Phil was thinking about our Phase Is, which were 4-week study. So the increase from 1 month to 3 months is only about from 25% to 35% in placebo. So obviously, we saw a very big differential with the 85% EASI-50 -- 85% of patients achieving EASI-50 with dupilumab over 12 weeks. So there was obviously a very substantial drug-associated benefit compared to placebo, and as I've said, I think, the hope is that we can replicate them. Just to give you some other outstanding numbers, EASI-75 is the percent of people who had a 75% improvement. It was about 60% in the treated group and only about 14% in placebo. So there's really a relatively impressive drug effect. The same with pruritus scores and every other assessment. And as I said, we only hope that this really represents the -- what this drug can really do and continue to do on patients. So what we're hoping for is to largely just replicate these impressive Phase IIa data.","Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And are there any differences in enrollment criteria that we should keep in mind, that could result in slightly different patient population? Or are the patients almost exactly the same?","George D. Yancopoulos","There are slight differences that could affect different aspects of the study, different jurisdictions, more patients, U.S. versus Europe, things like that. But our biggest hope is just to reproduce these sort of data that we've already seen.","Operator","Next question will be out of line with Matt Roden with UBS Securities.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I want to take a stab at quantifying the inventory again and better understanding the underlying demand trend. So based on what you said, it seems to me that the channel swing might have been something like $25 million to $30 million between 4Q and 1Q. So first of all, are we on the right track here? And then if we back that out of '14 numbers, then we're looking at about 2 straight quarters of about 3% sequential demand growth. So is that about what should be expected until you get label expansion later this year? And we realize you have a big opportunity here with DME coming up, but is there anything you think can be done to revitalize this quarter and the opportunity?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes. So I don't think we want to get into predicting quarter-by-quarter sequential growth rates. I don't think your calculations are wildly off. I don't want to get into the fine details of them. But I think that we did tell you that the sequential growth in the fourth quarter to first quarter was about 3%. And we did tell you that we expect the growth -- the bigger part of the growth would come, subject to the approvals that we have in the latter part of the year. So I think your thinking is good. So maybe that's all I want to say on that. I do want -- as long as we were back on EYLEA, in case we don't come back to it, I do want to say that it's a very interesting marketplace, of course, with lots of things going on. There's still questions about what's going on with compounding. There's still, of course, all the issues related to rebates. And then there's, of course, our poor friends and customers, the retinal docs, who, I think, took a lot of unnecessary abuse with articles in Washington Post and New York Times where they were -- it made it look like that if you needed a loan, you should call your local retinal doctor, and that probably was a little bit unfair because most of that money was being -- going through their shop to pay for either Lucentis or EYLEA. So I just wanted to make a little comment about that. But the bottom line is that the business continues to grow, but we expect the big growth to come in the latter part of the year, hopefully, with the approvals.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Kelsey Harrison - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I want to go back to dupilumab and just ask sort of a question around, there are a lot of other antibodies in development for asthma, some are IL-4 -- I mean, some IL-5, so a bunch of different mechanisms. But I'm just wondering if you could maybe help us understand mechanistically where you think the differences are and how they might play out clinically between dupilumab and some of these other antibodies.","Leonard S. Schleifer","So I'll let George handle that. But just from a -- before he gets into the technical aspects, just from a broad perspective, you're right there, there's a lot going on in asthma, and George can comment on where we fit in. But there's been a lot less going on in atopic dermatitis, and that's a disease with a lot of people -- Bob, how many people have moderate to severe atopic dermatitis?","Robert J. Terifay","Over 1 million.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Over 1 million in the United States with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, so that's -- from a competitive point of view, not a mechanistic point of view, obviously, the asthma space is more competitive. But, of course, it's a very serious disease. Atopic dermatitis is a troubling disease, albeit not life-threatening, but a really serious troubling disease to many patients with less competition. George, do you want to get into the mechanistic stuff?","George D. Yancopoulos","Yes. Well, the basic question that you get at in terms of mechanism is which of the side [ph] kinds [ph} are the most important drivers of the disease processes in these various settings? And I think that, mechanistically, what we think is emerging, and in fact we think that our data is really contributing to this, is -- to shed some light on what's going on, in terms of what many view as a worldwide growing epidemic in terms of all sorts of allergic diseases. And we're not just talking about allergic asthma, but we're also talking about atopic dermatitis, but we're talking about everything else as well, food allergies, all sorts of other allergies, seasonal allergies and so forth. They're well documented by the New York Times and the CDC. I mean, there's been this huge uptick in all of these diseases. And one possibility is that these diseases have unrelated mechanisms and unrelated causes, and the upticks are just all occurring at the same time but are unrelated. So we believe, instead, that there's reason to think all of these as essentially variations of the same disease and that it's the same fundamental mechanistic drivers that are skewing the immune system, perhaps due to shared environmental impacts and drivers. And that the same mechanistic drivers are contributing to variations of the same disease and in some people are manifested as allergic asthma, and others as atopic dermatitis, and somebody else as sinusitis and somebody else as seasonal allergies. And we believe that the data suggest that 4 and 13 are the critical mechanistic pathway drivers, perhaps, for all these diseases. And the thing that we think is quite stunning and perhaps unprecedented is to have produced data that shows very interesting effects in 2 important variations of this class of disease, that is allergic asthma and atopic dermatitis, by hitting this pathway. I think that this really does suggest for the first time that, indeed, all of these related diseases perhaps have the same drivers, and that IL-4 and IL-13 are the core pathway drivers. So it may be true that for one or another one of these diseases, a downstream factor could be important because that -- and it may be true for that variance of disease, but not another variation of disease. But it's also quite possible, we're very excited about this possibility, that 4 and 13 could be the core drivers of a large proportion of the allergic diseases that are now being driven.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Newman with Canaccord.","John L. Newman - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","I just wondered if you could talk about how much detail you might provide going forward on your Phase III studies for alirocumab in terms of the injection-site reactions. And the reason I ask is because when you presented your first Phase III study and you tight traded up from 75 to 150, it seems that your reverse event profile was more favorable than Amgen. And I'm just wondering, going forward, how much detail would you be able to tell us about things like injection-site redness and reactions.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes. I think once we have the data and it's presented at the medical conference, we'll be happy to share all the detail that we have available. It's not been an issue of any significant concern, as far as I'm aware to-date.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adnan Butt with RBC.","Adnan S. Butt - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I still have 3 questions, but I'll start with 1 question. So for the alirocumab, for the anti-PCSK9 program, what's the difference that some other competitors think that they may be able to file but there's some uncertainty on the Regeneron Sanofi side? And what's the cost of filing -- potential filing time range in the U.S.? Is that anywhere from 2014 to the end of 2015? Can you say a bit on that?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Sure. Stating when you're going to file and predicting and all that sort of stuff, there may be some stylistic differences between the companies and how we approach things, but there are no regulatory differences between the companies. The bottom line is that we and our partner, Sanofi, plan to be ready for filing, certainly, by the end of the year, in both the United States and the EU. In the U.S., it's gated on the progress of OUTCOMES trials and ongoing discussions with the FDA. And so since these discussions are ongoing, we don't want to give you any precise predictions because they might change, as a result of these discussions. But we have no reason to believe -- in fact, we believe just the opposite, that the U.S. regulatory requirements are going to be consistent for different products across the same class. And if anything, we think we have a much stronger package at this point, in terms of 5,000 patient years of blinded data in the non-OUTCOMES study, which, best to my calculation, might be as many as 2 or 3 times more than the Amgen program has, based on what was presented at the recent meeting. So we have a very robust package, which we will be submitting with. And so we're confident that we'll get the same treatment from the regulators as everybody else.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Barclays.","Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I hate to beat a dead horse, but Bob, can you just quickly comment whether the inventory will go back to normal level of 1 to 2 weeks? Or it will -- or last quarter, 4Q, was actually outlier with greater than 2 weeks. And then also on the status of your Ang2 VEGF program in wet AMD because we knew that Roche just started a Phase I program of their Ang2 and VEGF program.","Robert J. Terifay","Right. So to answer the inventory, as I said earlier, we were above the 1- to 2-week inventory level at the end of Q4. At the end of Q1, we have returned back to the inventory levels below 2. And that is really where we anticipate inventory to be. Although at the end of the year, you do see people buying in, especially the change in commercial dating terms, which led to some people buying a little bit of excess inventory.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Okay. George, do you want to make a comment on the Ang2, that study is for development for us later?","George D. Yancopoulos","Right. So I think the common to the question was about Roche and Roche's bispecifics. And as you guys probably know, I mean, we're very heavily involved in the bispecific space and we have strong views about it. We think that, honestly, it only makes sense to make a bispecific, when you want to actually, for some reason, bring some targets together or join molecularly 2 targets. It doesn't really makes sense. In fact, it's the opposite of making sense to make a single reagent that can block independently 2 things that are better blocked separately. And why do I say that? The odds that you want to have a single agent that's delivered at the same exact levels to attack 2 different natural molecules that they themselves are probably going to be expressed by the body at 2 widely different levels with 2 different affinities and so forth, it just doesn't make any sense. And it's much better, in fact, to be able to have 2 separate blockers, which you can give at the right proportions, at the right ratios, instead of having to be forced to be giving them in the fixed ratio that the bispecific does. So we are actually always designing bispecifics for the right and the rational reasons. And obviously, we have a lot of bispecifics at various stages in development, including one we hope to be putting to the clinic this year. But those, we think, will be rationally designed and guided, based on the fact that it makes sense to make a bispecific for those targets. For this purpose, we're blocking VEGF and Ang2, it makes no sense to have a bispecific. In fact, it's the opposite of making sense. And we are very much more excited to have the 2 independent agents that will be able to be titrating exactly in their perfect ratios that will benefit most the patients, yet still give them the same injection if that need be.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough with BMO.","Nicholas Abbott - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","This is Nick in for Jim this morning. Just to go a little bit back to DME. Can you let us know, about 240,000 patients currently receiving treatment, what proportion of those are receiving an anti-VEGF and within that, the brand, I guess, Lucentis market share? And then, in terms of the biology of the disease here, clearly, differs from AMD. So is this a disease where you think you will need chronic dosing for most patients? And then Protocol T was mentioned before. But when you do your market research, obviously, there's a lot of interest versus laser. But a physician is really interested in getting this head-head data of Avastin versus the 2 branded products.","Leonard S. Schleifer","So let me cover on the numbers. To clarify, there are 600,000 patients with centrally involved DME. 240,000 are treated with an anti-VEGF therapy at the present time. Similar to before EYLEA launched, Avastin has the majority of the DME market at the current time. If you remember, when we launched an AMD, Avastin had about 65% of the market. We were able to not just penetrate the Lucentis market but also penetrate the Avastin market. So that is the opportunity in DME, is to grow the market beyond the 240,000 patients and to take share from both agents, both in the new patient starts, as well the switch patients. I would remind you, in our U.S.-based study, the VISTA study, 42% of the patients were prior anti-VEGF therapy. As we presented at ARVO this week, those patients did equally well as the newly diagnosed patients. In terms of the biology, I'll let George address it, but what we see is the DME is a chronic condition and that there is a long-term opportunity for the products, although dosing may change over time.","George D. Yancopoulos","So let me just make a couple of comments. First of all, I agree with Bob. I think, look, our program is under review, so we don't know what our label is going to be. We don't know if it's going to be -- get approved. But assuming that it does, I mean, and we think we have some nice advantages, at least in the design of that program, highlighting what Bob said, obviously, is we demonstrated that there was a lot of people in that program who had previous exposure to other anti-VEGF agents. And also, it's really the only approved agent, if it gets approved, that would have a direct comparison to laser. Having said that, I do think people will be interested in the Protocol T, which is, for those who are not familiar, is a consortium DRCR-led, a study which compares Avastin and it compares Lucentis at the 0.3-milligram dose. I should remind everybody that one of the other advantages of our drug that we've submitted for is at the same dose, whereas the Lucentis had 2 different doses: 1 for AMD and 1 for DME, a lower dose, in the United States. So all of these should play into the marketplace. But I think maybe we should really wait and respect the process and have a lot more to say about this, if we get the drug approved. So let's wait for that before we say any more.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just on U.S. EYLEA, after the first quarter, the guidance assumes a pretty big step-up in the second half. And so I'm just curious, are there some market dynamics in DME that could accelerate adoption, when you look at things like compounding levels or payment terms or kind of what you guys see as an unmet need by laser or VEGF?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes. I mean, it's complicated, obviously, but -- and we're making some guesses, and so it's obviously a forward-looking guess. But we do feel that based on what happened with the launch in AMD, there will be a reservoir of patients who might be unsatisfied with current therapies and who might consider using EYLEA, if it's approved. And so that reservoir should make for a pretty nice initial uptick, if it goes the same way as AMD went. But, of course, there are other things, and as I said, there are other aspects of this as the lower dose we're is going up against this time as opposed to the -- we have a 2-milligram dose versus their 0.3-milligram dose. We did have data in our study for the Q2 month, so have to see how the labor goes with that. That could be an advantage. Remember, diabetics tend to be younger. Many of them still tend to be working. And so a convenience of -- less of an injection burden could be important. But once again, I don't want to get ahead of ourselves. Let's -- we can have a really robust conversation about this, after the PDUFA date.","George D. Yancopoulos","But Len, I do think there's another important factor. There's another influencer of the forecast in the second half, which is on October 23, we're expecting approval on macular edema following BRVO, if everything goes well.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. Regulatory authorities.","George D. Yancopoulos","And the BRVO market is 3x the size of the CRVO market. So there are some upside there as well.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Right. And, of course, I would emphasize, Geoff, that this is a global launch and marketplace. And so you might see growth here and more growth overseas, and then you'll see something more growth here and less growth. I just -- we think that the overall product is growing very nicely. Bayer is doing a spectacular job, as you can tell from their numbers. And so we think of this as a pretty big important global franchise. And Mike, do you want to wrap it up?","Michael Aberman","That's great. So thank you, everybody, for participating. Thank you, operator, for helping us with this call. We'll be in our office, if you need anything. Please don't hesitate to reach us via email or by phone. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Dr. Michael Aberman, Senior Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations for Regeneron. You may begin.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Thank you very much. Good morning, and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' second quarter 2015 conference call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under Events and Presentations for 30 days.","Joining me on the call today are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President of Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer; Bob Terifay, Senior Vice President, Commercial; and Bob Landry, Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for Q&A.","I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call include forward-looking statements about Regeneron.

Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions.","With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Michael, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us on the call and webcast today. The second quarter was yet another strong and successful quarter. EYLEA continued to show very impressive growth, and we achieved significant advances in our pipeline, which now has late-stage clinical programs across five diseases. And in the month of July, we launched Praluent, a first-in-class medicine for the treatment of elevated LDL cholesterol for US patients, and we entered into a strategic new collaboration with Sanofi in the exciting and evolving field of immuno-oncology.","Financially, we delivered a strong quarter driven by top-line growth. On a worldwide basis, EYLEA delivered nearly $1 billion of sales in the second quarter. I think I'm going to say that again, it sounded good. On a worldwide basis, EYLEA delivered nearly $1 billion of sales in the second quarter. Based on the strong US EYLEA net sales in the second quarter, we are increasing our full year US EYLEA net sales guidance to be year-over-year growth of between 45% and 50% from the previously provided range of 30% to 35%.","We are particularly pleased with the FDA approval of Praluent, which represents the fourth approved drug that was discovered at Regeneron labs led by my partner George Yancopoulos. We and our partner Sanofi have launched Praluent in the United States and are proud to bring an important new option to patients who struggle with elevated LDL cholesterol or bad cholesterol and the physicians who treat them. You will hear more about the ongoing launch from Bob Terifay.","On the strategic front, we recently announced a major collaboration with Sanofi in immuno-oncology. We believe that these are early days in immuno-oncology, and the efficiency and sophistication of our VelociSuite technologies including our proprietary bispecific platform, combined with our capabilities in human genetics and our established partnership with Sanofi, make us uniquely positioned to accelerate the development of potential new immuno-oncology treatment options. You'll hear more about this from George from a scientific perspective and Bob Landry with just some of the financial implications of this collaboration.","On the pipeline front, we have made steady progress. We now have 15 antibodies that are in clinical development, and we have late-stage programs in five different therapeutic areas: sarilumab for rheumatoid arthritis; dupilumab for atopic dermatitis and asthma; fasinumab for pain, and REGN2222 for RSV or respiratory syncytial virus.","With that, let me turn the call over to Dr. George Yancopoulos, Regeneron's Chief Scientific Officer. He will be followed by Bob Terifay and then by Bob Landry. George?","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. Before I talk about the pipeline, I want to offer my congratulations to all my colleagues at Regeneron as well as our partners for the continued success of EYLEA and the recent approval of Praluent and also acknowledge the many patients, investigators and physicians involved in all these efforts.","Last week, we announced a major collaboration with Sanofi in the arena of immuno-oncology, and I'd like to begin by providing some additional details on the scientific and strategic aspects of this collaboration. Immuno-oncology has been a rapidly evolving area and has shown the potential to dramatically improve outcomes for patients with certain types of cancers. The current immuno-therapies which are delivered as monotherapy or in combination with traditional chemotherapy have yielded overall response rates in the 10% to 30% range. Many of these responses have been durable and have led to increased survival indications such as melanoma, kidney and lung cancer to date.","While these data are incredibly exciting, we believe that the field is still in its early days. Our goal is to improve outcome in a range of different cancers. We believe that we are well positioned to deliver on this goal. We increasingly believe that the future of cancer medicine will involve innovative combinations of targeted medicines.","We're cognizant of the fact that this is a crowded area with many players who have immuno-oncology assets that are more advanced. Nevertheless, we believe that the key to future successes in this complicated area is the efficiency and sophistication with which one can attempt and evaluate novel treatments and their combinations in novel settings. And we believe that we are well positioned to be competitive in this area. With Regeneron's unique biology, technology and genetics capabilities, we hope to be able to combine antibodies to multiple targets, adopt creative ways to use these antibodies as well as harness novel technologies such as biospecifics.","In addition, access to our proprietary animal models allow us an early indication of which combinations are more likely to be successful in the clinic, which we think gives the collaboration an additional advantage. In terms of novel combination therapies, we have several immune targets such as LAG3 and GITR in late-stage preclinical development. Our PD-1, antibody which we anticipate might be the foundation of several combination therapies has already demonstrated evidence of activities in early clinical trials.","In addition, we believe that our novel and proprietary bispecific platform will deliver additional opportunities for both monotherapy and combination approaches. Our first is bispecific, a CD20xCD3 antibody, which is outside of the Sanofi collaboration, has already demonstrated activity in early human trials and could potentially pave the way for multiple additional bispecifics to enter the clinic in the coming years. These other potential bispecific antibodies are included in our immuno-oncology collaboration with Sanofi.","Bob Landry will review the financial aspects of the collaboration shortly, but let me highlight some of the key aspects of the deal, and in particular, the differences from the existing antibody collaboration. As a reminder, in the existing collaboration, Sanofi provides funding for pre-clinical discovery and development work up through filing of an investigational new drug or IND application, at which point Sanofi can either opt in or not for these antibodies.","During that pre-clinical work, Regeneron has final say over all activities. If Sanofi opts in, Sanofi funds 100% of the clinical development cost and also has final say over clinical development and commercial activities.","Under the new immuno-oncology collaboration, Sanofi's right to opt in is later, at clinical proof of concept, which means Regeneron has greater control of development through a later stage. In addition, after opt in, unlike the existing collaboration, Regeneron retains the leading global development role and lead commercialization role in the US for half of the antibodies on an alternating basis beginning with PD-1. Obviously, there's an incredible amount of trust that has been built through the many years of the Sanofi collaboration that allows such an arrangement, and we look forward to working with Sanofi on building an immuno-oncology franchise.","In terms of late-stage antibodies, let me begin with our most advanced program, sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody which is in clinical studies for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In the second quarter, we reported positive data from three additional Phase 3 trials, including the SARIL-RA TARGET study of sarilumab in combination with non-biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, or DMAR therapy, in patients who are inadequate responders to or intolerant of TNF-alpha inhibitors.","These data are in addition to the previously reported data from the Phase 3 MOBILITY study where sarilumab demonstrated positive results in both signs and symptoms as well as in radiographic progression. We're on track to submit a BLA in the US by year-end, and a regulatory submission in Europe towards the end of next year.","One of the most exciting late-stage product candidates in our pipeline is dupilumab, our IL-4\/13 pathway blocking antibody which is in clinical studies in multiple indications. Our pivotal Phase 3 studies in the atopic dermatitis indication are fully enrolled and we expect to report data from these studies in the first half of next year. Our second pivotal study of dupilumab in asthma is currently enrolling patients. This Phase 3 study will explore two doses of dupilumab, 200-milligram and 300-milligram, administered every other week. As we have mentioned previously, following discussion with the FDA, we will only need to conduct this one additional Phase 3 efficacy study in this indication since our Phase 2b trial will be considered pivotal. Our Phase 2 study of dupilumab in the eosinophilic esophagitis is ongoing and currently enrolling patients.","Turning now to our other late-stage programs. NURSERY-PreTerm, our first Phase 3 trial of our antibody for RSV, is enrolling patients in the Southern Hemisphere where the RSV season is from May through October. A second Phase 3 trial in this indication is planned for later this year in the Northern Hemisphere.","I'm happy to report that fasinumab, our NGF antibody, is now in Phase 2b\/3 clinical trials. We expect to hear from the FDA in the second half about the partial clinical hold, which if lifted, will allow us to conduct studies that are longer than 16 weeks in duration.","Our EYLEA combination trials are ongoing. A Phase 2 trial of EYLEA co-formulated with our PDGF receptor antibody is underway and has been granted fast-track designation for the treatment of wet AMD. Our Phase I combination study of EYLEA co-formulated with our ANG2 antibody is also ongoing, and we expect to report data from this study later this year.","The Regeneron Genetics Center continues to make progress, anchored by our foundational collaboration with Geisinger Health System. We currently have about a dozen additional collaborations across a variety of therapeutic areas and remain on track to sequence 100,000 individuals by the end of this year.","With that update, I'd like to turn this call over to Bob Terifay.","Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President, Commercial","Thank you, George, and good morning everyone. This is a very exciting time in the history of Regeneron. Almost four years after its initial US launch, EYLEA or our aflibercept injection continues to demonstrate strong sales growth. In addition just last month, Praluent or alirocumab received US regulatory approval for the lowering of poorly controlled low density lipoprotein cholesterol in specific high-risk patient groups, and was shortly thereafter made available to patients who need it. Praluent was also given a positive recommendation by the European regulators, with EU approval expected in September.","Starting this with EYLEA. Second quarter US net sales grew 58% year-over-year. Net US EYLEA sales to distributors in the second quarter were $655 million. Underlying physician demand has continued to remain strong and grew sequentially quarter-over-quarter by 19%, representing the highest sequential quarter-over-quarter growth that we've experienced since the third quarter of 2012. Market research with retinal specialists indicates that a key driver of EYLEA growth in the second quarter is the continued positive impact of the results of the Protocol T study in patients with diabetic macular edema or DME.","As a reminder, this independent NIH-sponsored study explored the comparative effectiveness of EYLEA with ranibizumab and off-label bevacizumab and demonstrated that EYLEA provided greater efficacy despite one fewer injection and fewer laser treatments. The efficacy differences were particularly pronounced in the pre-specified group of patients whose vision was worse at study initiation. This group represents about 50% of all DME patients. These data have been viewed very positively by physicians and payers and were one of the biggest drivers of strong EYLEA growth in the second quarter.","According to a survey of 200 retinal specialists evaluating the reported usage of VEGF inhibitors in the second quarter of 2015 as well as a chart audit from 183 retinal specialists, EYLEA is now the market-leading product among FDA approved anti-VEGF drugs in all of our labeled indications. With our share of eyes growing quarter-over-quarter versus ranibizumab in DME and macular edema following retinal vein occlusion and remaining consistent relative to ranibizumab in the last quarter in wet AMD. Likewise, overall EYLEA is gaining market share from bevacizumab especially in DME. The share gain is coming from both switches as well as new patient starts.","Lastly, EYLEA growth is also coming from penetration into new physician practices that previously did not use EYLEA. Outside of the United States where we share EYLEA profits with our collaborator, Bayer HealthCare, second quarter EYLEA sales were $338 million, representing a 37% growth year-over-year on a reported basis, notwithstanding substantial adverse currency impact. In the second quarter, Bayer HealthCare received regulatory approval in Japan for EYLEA for the treatment of macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion or RVO.","Turning now to Praluent. Since it's only been 10 days since US approval, it's too early for me to provide any meaningful specifics about the ongoing launch. We are however pleased with our operational implementation of the launch. We received FDA approval for Praluent on Friday afternoon, July 24. We created and trained the field forces on the final customer-facing materials, certified them on contact, and made all launch materials available to the field teams over the weekend following approval. We had a full-field force deployment on Monday, July 27. We actually had our first prescription forms submitted to our reimbursement and patient services hub called MY Praluent on Sunday night, July 26. From the information that we have, it appears that the first patient dosed with commercial Praluent occurred on Monday morning, July 27.","I'd also like to spend some time talking about the eligible patient population for Praluent. We are gratified that the Food and Drug Administration has recognized a significant unmet medical need in a broad group of indicated patients, those with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which includes patients with a history of acute coronary syndromes or myocardial infarction, stable or unstable angina, coronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke or transient ischemic attack, or peripheral arterial disease presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin. These patients are receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy and are not at their LDL-C goal.","Praluent is also indicated for patients with a history of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy whose conditions are diagnosed based upon a combination of cholesterol levels, physical manifestations, family history, and genetic testing. Our health economics analysis indicates that there are approximately 8 million to 10 million patients in the United States who could be eligible for PCSK9 inhibitor therapy.","However, maximally tolerated statin therapy will and should remain the mainstay of therapy. With our educational efforts, we believe that more patients will likely go on and stay on statins, and therefore may be able to get to their goal on statin therapy alone. Other factors that will contribute to reduce the size of the actual PCSK9 inhibitor market include the resistance of some physicians to use biologic therapy for LDL-C reduction, physicians' reluctance to take on responsibility for prior authorization documentation, patients' unwillingness to inject themselves, and ongoing low physician and patient urgency to get LDL cholesterol under control.","As I've stated previously, the reimbursement environment is complex and will be carefully managed. Our goal has been to ensure that payers and healthcare providers understand the value that Praluent can offer to patients. And to that end, we are actively engaged in extensive discussions with payers. We expect that it will take several months for some commercial and government payers to conduct formulary reviews, make reimbursement coverage decisions, and begin to process patient claims.","Given these reasons, we expect an initial gradual uptake at launch. In response to potential delays in formulary decisions and reimbursement decisions, we're offering samples and free product to appropriate labeled patients who are waiting an insurance coverage decision. This may delay uptake in commercial sales reporting. For example, for Medicare Part D or government pay patients, there could up to a six-month coverage decision period. So for the next several months, performance cannot be judged based upon reported sales. This would understate both the volume of physician and patient adoption.","Outside of the United States, Praluent has received a positive opinion from the European CHMP with approval expected in late September. Our 18,000 patient ODYSSEY outcomes study is ongoing and we expect this study to be fully enrolled by year-end with completion expected by the end of 2017.","Turning now to sarilumab. The IL-6 inhibitor class has shown consistent double-digit growth in the United States year-over-year. If sarilumab is approved, it will be the second entrant in this class. With the availability of second agent in the class, we anticipate that increased awareness and education should contribute to further class growth.","We also continue on our pre-commercialization efforts for dupilumab. For example in June, we had a major presence at the World Congress of Dermatology meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia. With an educational booth and symposium focused on the pathophysiology of and impact of atopic dermatitis.","With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry.","Robert E. Landry - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone who has joined us today. Regeneron posted another strong financial performance in the second quarter of 2015 and we are very pleased with our financial results for the first half of the year. In the second quarter of 2015, we earned $2.89 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $338 million, which represents year-over-year growth in both non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income of 17%.","Regeneron's second quarter 2015 non-GAAP net income excludes noncash share-based compensation expense, noncash interest expense related to our senior convertible notes, loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with conversions of a portion of our convertible notes during the quarter and non-cash income taxes. Second quarter non-GAAP net income reflects cash income taxes expected to be paid or payable for 2015. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release.","Total revenues in the second quarter of 2015 were $999 million, which represented year-over-year growth of 50%. Net product sales were $658 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $418 million in the second quarter of 2014. EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $655 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $415 million in the second quarter of 2014, which represents an increase of 58%.","During the second quarter of 2015, EYLEA experienced a slight decrease in US distributor inventory levels as compared to the first quarter 2015 but remains within our normal one to two week targeted range. I also want to note that despite having launched almost four years ago, EYLEA experienced sequential dollar sales growth this past quarter of $114 million, the largest in the product's history.","As Len mentioned earlier, we are raising our US EYLEA net sales growth guidance for full-year 2015 over 2014 to be between 45% and 50% from our previous guidance of 30% to 35%. Ex-US EYLEA sales were $338 million in the second quarter of 2015 as compared to $247 million in the second quarter of 2014 representing a 37% increase on a reported basis.","On an operational basis, our constant currency basis sales increased approximately 64%. Sequentially, sales grew 17% when comparing second quarter 2015 versus first quarter 2015 on an operational basis. Product revenue from ex-US EYLEA sales is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer HealthCare.","In the second quarter of 2015, Regeneron recognized $107 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the United States. Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue for the second quarter was $134 million. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $195 million for the second quarter of 2015. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line item primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, and our share of profits or losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies.","As a reminder, while we get reimbursed for antibody-related commercial expenses that we incur, these along with the commercial expenses that Sanofi spends on the antibodies are included as expenses in the calculation of antibody profits and losses. In the second quarter of 2015, our share of losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies, primarily Praluent, was $46 million. This can be found in table four of our earnings release.","Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $330 million for the second quarter. Our unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators and R&D non-cash share based compensation expense, was $110 million for the quarter. Our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense.","Given the unreimbursed R&D expense for the first six months of 2015 and in light of the additional reimbursements associated with the recently executed immuno-oncology collaboration, we are lowering and tightening our guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $510 million to $550 million, which is lower than our previous guidance of $525 million to $575 million.","Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $142 million for the second quarter. As you might have noted, this is a significant increase when compared to the first quarter 2015. As we have said before, this was driven by higher commercialization expenses in anticipation of the launch of Praluent. For the full year, we project non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be between $610 million and $650 million, which is lower than our previous guidance of $650 million to $725 million. To be clear, the new SG&A guidance does not reflect any planned change in the combined investment we and our partner Sanofi are spending on the launch and commercialization of Praluent, but rather results from more of these expenses being incurred by Sanofi than by Regeneron.","Non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $60 million for the quarter. The components of this line item include the costs in connection with producing EYLEA commercial supplies, start-up expenses associated with our Limerick manufacturing site, and the most substantial component, the royalty expense in connection with our agreement with Genentech related to US EYLEA sales. As reiterated in earlier quarters, we are obligated to pay this royalty until May 2016, at which the point the payments will end.","As we had mentioned on last quarter's call, in 2015 we began paying significant cash income taxes as compared to prior periods. Our non-GAAP tax rate for this quarter and for the full year 2015 is based on an estimate of the cash taxes paid or payable which will be substantially lower than our GAAP effective tax rate. On a non-GAAP basis, our cash tax rate for the second quarter of 2015 and for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was approximately 23% and 18% respectively of non-GAAP pre-tax income.","The increase to the second quarter rate versus first quarter 2015 reflects an increase in our projected annual cash tax rate. This increase is due to a higher forecasted full year non-GAAP income before tax related to higher estimated US EYLEA net sales and cash taxes paid or payable on a portion of the upfront payments we will receive in connection with our new immuno-oncology collaboration with Sanofi. In addition, this quarter includes incremental cash tax related to first quarter earnings as the cash tax forecast in the first quarter used a lower estimated full-year cash tax rate.","Primarily as a result of these changes, we are raising and tightening our cash tax guidance as a percentage of non-GAAP pre-tax income to be between 15% and 22% for 2015 from the previously provided range of between 10% to 20%.","In light of our recent immuno-oncology collaboration with Sanofi, I'd like to discuss how you should model some of these financial components of this collaboration. As was outlined in an earlier press release, Sanofi has committed to an initial investment of up to $2.17 billion, which includes $640 million in upfront payments and a potential sales milestone of $375 million to Regeneron.","Regeneron currently anticipates that the nonrefundable upfront payments will be recorded as deferred revenue that is recognized over the related performance period beginning in the third quarter of 2015. Note that the deferred revenue balance from these upfront payments as of the end of 2015 is anticipated to be subject to taxation for cash tax purposes in the US in 2016.","In terms of expenses, we will recognize immuno-oncology collaboration research and development expenses in our P&L in the quarter in which they occur and also recognize as Sanofi collaboration revenue the portion of these R&D expenses that are reimbursable by Sanofi, similar to our antibody collaboration.","Accordingly, Regeneron will continue to incur unreimbursed R&D for its portion of the R&D that remains unfunded. These obligations include the following: Regeneron will spend up to approximately $1.1 billion under the immuno-oncology collaboration discovery agreement and Sanofi will reimburse us for up to $825 million of these costs. Regeneron and Sanofi will equally fund post proof-of-concept development for clinical programs, for which we are considered the development and US commercialization lead. For REGN2810, our PD-1 antibody that is currently in clinical development, a separate $650 million commitment has been established that will be equally funded by both companies. Regeneron is the development and commercial lead in the US for this program. In addition, Sanofi will fund 100% of any development costs associated with the immuno-oncology clinical programs for which they are considered the development and global commercialization lead.","Regeneron's recently filed 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2015, and a Form 8-K filed on July 31, 2015, provides further disclosure of our recent immuno-oncology collaboration with Sanofi.","Our capital expenditures for the first half of 2015 were $354 million. Given the first half spend and our remaining outlook, we are tightening our 2015 capital expenditure guidance to a range between $675 million to $750 million from $650 million and $750 million.","Our Raheen, Ireland, commercial manufacturing site, which is under construction, continues to represent our largest capital investment in 2015 and continues to progress as planned. Additionally, both the first half 2015 expenditures and full year 2015 guidance includes infrastructure expansions related to increasing our manufacturing capacity in Rensselaer as well as the ongoing expansion of our Tarrytown R&D and corporate headquarters in order to meet our continual growth outlook.","We ended the second quarter of 2015 with cash and marketable securities of $1.19 billion. With the recent execution of the immuno-oncology collaboration, we are expecting receipt of the $640 million in upfront payments from Sanofi shortly. As we have been reporting, we have been opportunistically repurchasing the warrants that we issued in 2011 in connection with our convertible debt. We intend to continue repurchasing these warrants up to an aggregate amount of $400 million.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Michael.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Thank you, Bob. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call to Q&A. As we'd like to give as many people a chance to ask questions as possible, we request you limit yourself to one question. Bob Landry and the IR team will be available after the call for follow-up questions. Thank you. Operator, you can please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, guys. Congratulations for a great quarter. The first question on the strength of EYLEA in this quarter. Bob, maybe can you give us a little bit more color in terms of whether you also see more penetration in AMD rather than just in DME and where that share is coming from?","And then secondly, just a question on Praluent. CVS' CEO just said on the earnings call this morning that they plan to employ a similar strategy to the so-called formulary exclusion strategy to manage their PCSK9. So, I was wondering what's your strategy if that happens actually from the payers. And then just a housekeeping question, are you going to block the IMS subscripts for Praluent or not? Thank you.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","That was three questions, Ying. So bad instruction following.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. Bob Terifay, please.","Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President, Commercial","Well in terms of EYLEA growth, the bulk of the growth is coming in DME, both in terms of growing the DME market overall for the anti-VEGF class, as well as taking market share from both Lucentis as well as bevacizumab. We do see some growth in RVO and some slight growth in wet AMD. But the majority of the growth that we're seeing is in DME.","In terms of your questions on Praluent, it's too early to talk specifically about payers, but we've always expected that the payers are going to want patients to step through maximally tolerated statin therapy in order to get access to Praluent. And that is our labeling. And so, it's not a surprise that people are advocating for patients to have been on maximally tolerated statin therapy. The IMS data, yes, we intend to utilize IMS data. So, you will see the IMS data in the audits.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Okay. Next question. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just another one on EYLEA for DME. You mentioned you're seeing new prescribers there. Are those retinal specialists or is there a broader category here? And then do you have any insight on referral trends from either ophthalmologists or endos to retinal specialists of DME patients? Thanks.","Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President, Commercial","So, the new practices are generally smaller ophthalmology practices that were rebuying Avastin because they were not familiar with all the reimbursement techniques in terms of buy and bill. But with the recent DME data, there's more interest in utilizing EYLEA.","With regards to referrals, as we've talked about on the last couple of calls, we are actively working with ophthalmologists as well as optometrists to build awareness of the need for regular screening for eye exams and to get patients to retinal specialists as soon as DME is diagnosed. And we're hoping some of the is starting to pay off.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the bispecific in the PD-1. On the past two calls you've characterized responses that you seen with those patients. I don't know if you'd be willing to give us some more detail around that. And if you're not, could you tell us when we might see that data? Is it possible to see that data at ASH this year? Thanks.","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","Yeah. We're waiting for the appropriate medical conference in which to provide more detail Thanks.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Mohit Bansal - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. This is Mohit filling in for Robyn. Congratulations on a great quarter. So, turning a little bit on your RSV program, could your Phase 3 trial be a pivotal trial given the plan is to enroll 24 patient in this trial? And what is the baseline risk of developing RSV in the babies you are enrolling in this trial? Thank you.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","I think you're asking about the RSV pivotal trials, whether it's Phase 3 and the last one the risk of enrolling infants or?","Mohit Bansal - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, the baseline risk of developing RSV in these patients. So because I mean, it seems like a natural history kind of study. That's why I am asking.","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","Right. No. These are considered to be pivotal studies and we've discussed very carefully with the FDA in terms of the infant population which is in fact intended to be a somewhat broader population of infants at risk. Thank you.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Craig Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Appreciate the chance to ask a question. George, can I just throw a couple of questions to, first, on the immuno-oncology side, you mentioned both that you have opted in and will be the commercialization partner for the PD-1, but also alluded to the fact that you may have a PD-L1. Could you give us a sense of your view of the relative merits of a PD-1 and a PD-L1, because superficially you might say that that was overkill. And then just on the RSV, again could you explain where you are in terms of having a final manufacturing process to take into pivotal trials? I mean, are you there yet? Can you scale up with the process you have?","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","Yeah. On the first question, we certainly feel that the signs suggest and maybe the early clinical data suggest that if anything PD-1, if anything should have somewhat broader efficacy than PD-L1. On the other hand, there may be some patients who might be able to tolerate a PD-L1 better in settings where for example, they maybe getting some toxicity due to for example inhibition of PD-L2. So we think it might be useful to have both components, but certainly we think that PD-1 should be more likely the broader foundational therapy.","On the second question, yeah, we're using our standard manufacturing approach, which we've used for all of our other clinical programs for RSV. So, we think it's certainly commercializable.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Great. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adnan Butt with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Adnan S. Butt - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Thanks. Congrats on the solid EYLEA number as well. So first, could you comment on the scale and scope of the sampling program? Will it require the same pre-authorization process that we would be expected of a paid script? And then is there a two-year follow-up of Protocol T data as well? And is that going to be as meaningful? Thanks.","Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President, Commercial","So in terms of the sampling, we have to obviously obtain physicians' signatures to be able to get access to the samples, but then it is up to the physician to determine which patients get access to the therapy.","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","In terms of Protocol T, yes, there will be two-year data and certainly we're very interested in seeing what that data will look like.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Great. Next question.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of John Newman with Canaccord. Your line is open, please go ahead.","John Newman - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question and I'd like to add my congrats on the EYLEA number, very strong. My question is regarding the development strategy for both PD-1 and PD-L1. We've seen a few companies around the fringes running studies in combination with \u2013 or running studies where two investigational drugs are being tested at the same time. And I'm just curious if that might be a strategy that you would discuss with the agency that could allow you to sort of maybe leapfrog some of your competition in the PD-1 and the PD-L1 space. Thanks.","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","Yeah. We are certainly exploring that opportunity. We agree with you that that is frankly going to be a necessary approach for the entire field to make appropriate progress in this very complex setting. So, I'm sure that we and a lot of other people are thinking and considering that approach.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Great. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Schwartz with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","You may be on mute, Joe.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Joe, you might be.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Or fell asleep.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We'll come back to Joe.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, guys. This is John (41:10) filling in for Mark. Congrats on the quarter. Just a quick one on the RSV program, if I may. So, I think you previously mentioned the half-life of the antibody could result in, so less frequent dosing. I was wondering if you've disclosed the dosing regimen of the antibody in Phase 3. Is it in fact less frequent than Synagis? Are you doing once per season dosing?","And then really fast on IO. I'm trying to better understand how the logistics of alternating the lead programs work. So, is it by order of filed INDs, or is it by when Sanofi opts in to the collaboration? And how would that work for a combination regimen? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Michael can take the second one. Then we'll go back to.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Yeah, that will be alternating at the time of opting in. And there is a mechanism for how to deal with combinations where you're combining two different products either in the discovery program or the license side. I don't know if I want to get into that detail. Perhaps after the call.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","But this is a good time to say that. This is Len. Our relationship with Sanofi, as George said in his opening remarks, has really been quite spectacular and has been built on many, many years of closely collaborating on every aspect of what we do, from discovery, to early development, to full development through scale up, and through commercialization now with Praluent. So I think the partners know how to work together, and this will be handled rather straight forwardly. The basic concept from your vantage point is that on half the programs, we'll be taking the lead, on half the programs they'll be taking the lead.","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","Yeah, just to elaborate on what Len says, I mean, we've done it before. We're going to just do what's right for the program. And we don't necessarily follow the contract because we have such a good relationship with Sanofi. If it makes sense not to alternate as per what's in the contract, we'll do what's right for the program.","In terms of RSV, yeah, we are certainly exploring less frequent dosing regimens in the pivotal studies and we have reason to believe that they might work, so we're hoping that the data might support that.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Thanks, John (43:23). Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Colleen Hanley - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Hi. This is Colleen Hanley in for Brian Skorney. Thanks for taking my questions. Two quick ones for you on Praluent. How will Praluent be distributed? Will it be through retail distributor or special channel? And you touched on this a little bit before, but do you think IMS prescription data services will be good surrogates for sales or will distribution be so selective that you can't really offer a decent capture rate? Thanks.","Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President, Commercial","So, I'll start with the IMS, it's going \u2013 as I said earlier, it's going to take several months for us to get to a sales reporting that is reliable based upon it taking some time to get reimbursement, patients being on samples, and patients being on free product. So when the IMS data comes out later this week, it's not going to be terribly reliable. It will improve over time. But again remember, not all of the specialty pharmacies report to IMS, so some of the data are projected. So obviously, ultimately it's going to be our actual sales data that are going to be more reliable.","In terms of Praluent distribution, we are distributing through a network of specialty pharmacies.","Colleen Hanley - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Great. Good questions, the next questions please?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to ask about the IO collaboration as well. So in addition to in-house combinations, will you also be looking outside of the Regeneron and Sanofi pipelines for potential combos? And do you have any residual concerns that IP potentially becomes an issue given the land grab that's currently going on in the field? Thanks.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","I'll \u2013 the first question, the answer is yes. We will be exploring all opportunities for combinations. So I don't have specifics, but there's no reason why we couldn't look outside the collaboration for novel combinations. That said, thankfully for us, we have George and his team and we have a plethora of things to do internally. And so those will probably definitely take precedence. In terms of IP, Len? Standard answer.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I don't think \u2013 we look at IP very carefully. We're pretty experienced and been in the antibody IP business for a long time. And we should just leave it at that.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay. Thanks guys.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Schwartz with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.","Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks for coming back to me. I was wondering if you could give us some insight into what is it about the IO antibodies that you're pursuing that makes you so enthusiastic about the potential to obtain better responsiveness or safety and tolerability? Yeah, you alluded to the response rates, that it sounds like you think you can improve upon it. Is it higher affinity for the target as was the case with dupilumab, other aspects of the technology that you can offer us some insight into your approach there?","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","Well, I think what's going to be required for success here is a really comprehensive approach and bringing to bear many different antibody candidates in the right settings, in the right combinations. And we have not only some of the more carefully characterized targets covered, but we also have a large number of innovative and novel targets. And we think that there's going to be a little bit of magic and maybe a certain degree of luck and a lot of science involved in figuring how to best do this. And this is what we think that we're historically strong at. So this is why we think that this is a great opportunity, because it is so early in the game here and it's going to be a complex business and the complexity I think plays to our advantages.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gbola Amusa with Chardan Capital. Your line is open.","Gbola Amusa - Chardan Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thank you for taking my call. Gbola Amusa from Chardan Capital. On EYLEA, on the beat, could you just confirm where dosing has gone year-over-year? We've seen for the overall market for example, dosing has gone from four per year to five to six to seven. So could you confirm that there weren't major changes there? And then secondly on your economic interest in wet AMD through gene therapy with your Avalanche stake and partnership, could you give any thoughts on the recent Phase 2a data on wet AMD? Or if it's too early for that, would you give us a sense on when we may get more visibility on your intentions with that program?","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. So, in terms Avalanche, Mike, you might want to comment on that.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Yeah. My comment will be, we're not going to comment on that. We'll let the process go out and you'll hear from Avalanche.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I might just remind everybody that the prime mover of the Avalanche deal for us was to get a look into gene therapy for eye diseases where there is no standard of care already and where gene therapy would be uniquely positioned as a therapeutic choice. So therefore, the risks, rewards of the programs would be greater. Nevertheless as Michael says, we will look at and review this data as we expect to.","Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President, Commercial","In terms of EYLEA dosing, we're trending very close to what we see in our prescribing information which is dosing every eight weeks. I'll remind you, if you look at the number of doses per year in the Protocol T trial, which had a different dosing regimen, they lined up pretty closely to what we saw in our own DME studies. So physicians are generally after an initial loading dose period, able to get patients out for at least eight weeks.","Gbola Amusa - Chardan Capital Markets LLC","Okay, so -","Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President, Commercial","No year-over-year \u2013 apologies, no year-over-year change drove the beat effectively. It was -","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So you're asking the question do we have more doses, which is driving the increase. No, we're not seeing more doses drive, per year driving net sales.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Great. And our next question.","Gbola Amusa - Chardan Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Thanks, Gbola. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Phil M. Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Let me add my congratulations on all the progress. Just a question on dupilumab and atopic dermatitis. In the adult pivotal program, can you remind us what you need to file? Can you file on the 16-week data, or do you need to wait for the 52-week data? And then similarly on atopic dermatitis for kids, what is the update on the pediatric development plan, and when could you start pivotal trials there? Thanks.","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","So in terms of the filing, we expect to have to do the 16-week data from two of the trials, but we'll expect to have one-year data from the longer-term trial for the initial filing. So we'll have thousands of patients in that initial filing.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","The other question is pediatrics.","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","Oh, pediatrics. I'm sorry. Those pediatric PK and other preparatory studies as well as getting into actual efficacy studies is really ongoing. There was a panel, a conference on this and the idea was that we should be moving sooner rather than later and not waiting for the outcome of our Phase III data to move into what can be fairly devastating conditions for pediatric patients. So that program is ongoing.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","All right. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. A couple on Praluent. I know you guys don't want to give too much detail on launch strategies, but is relaxing payment terms as you do with EYLEA initially part of the plan? If you don't want to answer that, when you think about the economics, the payback economics to Sanofi for Praluent, are those flexible depending on the launch trajectory? In other words, can you tweak those in a material way depending on the trajectory? Thanks.","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","The payback economics are based upon a percentage of profit, so it's already \u2013 it's all embedded in there and it's only based on the percentage. When the product turn profitable we pay a percentage, 10% of our profits back for repayment.","Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President, Commercial","In terms of the payment terms and remember EYLEA is a buy-and-build product under very different circumstances from Praluent, so we don't have the same terms.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Next question, operator?","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Thanks, Geoff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Biren Amin with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Biren Amin - Jefferies LLC","Yeah, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just on EYLEA. Could you review the physician assessments program that you're providing with the DME launch, because I believe you had a pretty robust program at the time of the wet AMD launch? And second question is on PD-1 Phase 1 trial. What tumor types are being enrolled in? What's the rationale for combination with cyclophosphamide? Thanks.","Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President, Commercial","So, our patient assistance program is consistent with all of our EYLEA indications. We have an income cutoff of $100,000 per patient in terms of income. And if they fall within that, they get access to the patient assistance.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","George, the question was on rationale for cyclophosphamide in PD-1.","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","Yeah, the notion is that cyclophosphamide might be, in a certain way, not blocking T-cell effectiveness and response while activating a certain type of immune activation pathway, so that it might work well to go in combination with PD-1. In terms of in our first studies, we're going after a board group of diverse patients in terms of cancers.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Operator, we have time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS. Your line is open.","Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for taking the question and congrats on really nice progress this quarter. I just want to go back to EYLEA. And, Bob, it seems like everything that you're describing here in terms of the gains that you've made commercially with EYLEA in really all settings should be practically sustainable, right? And yet this quarter, we've seen a 21% Q-on-Q growth that's a lot higher than we've seen in the recent three quarters or so, really the most we've seen in three years. So I guess what I'm getting at is, when you look at the guidance, it seems to imply reversion to single-digit growth for the remaining 3Q and 4Q this year. And I'm just trying to understand why shouldn't the gains that you've made be sort of sustainable? And it occurs to me that the guidance might just be conservative, but I'm just trying to understand if there are any other factors we need to consider that should drive a reversion in the growth. Thanks very much.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Bob may want to comment beyond the usual factors, which are includes seasonality, there's effects on the pent up demand that maybe were satisfied after Protocol T came out. Bob, anything else?","Robert E. Landry - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think our guidance, we feel very confident in. But yeah, we do model based upon what happens in previous years and we do see in the third and fourth quarter that there is with vacations and holidays and the risk of snow, that sometimes there is some seasonality.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Great. Thank you everybody for participating in this call. As I mentioned earlier, the IR team as well as our CFO, Bob Landry, is going to be available if there's follow-up questions.

Good morning, and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Third Quarter 2013 Conference Call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under Events and Presentations for 30 days. Joining me on the call today is Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President of Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer; Bob Landry, Chief Financial Officer; and Bob Terifay, Senior Vice President, Commercial.","After our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for Q&A.

Schleifer","Thank you, Michael, and good morning to everyone, and thanks for joining us on our third quarter 2013 earnings call. We are pleased to announce another quarter of strong earnings. Our third quarter non-GAAP net income rose to $277 million or $2.40 per diluted share, primarily as a result of continued growth of EYLEA, both in the United States and globally. You will hear more details about our financial performance from Bob Landry, our new Chief Financial Officer, who is participating on his first quarterly conference call.","As previously announced, Murray Goldberg, who has served as our Chief Financial Officer for almost 2 decades, has transitioned out of the position as CFO in anticipation of his retirement at the end of 2014. Murray's contribution was vital for the transformation of Regeneron from a development stage biotechnology company to one of the largest biotechnology companies in the world. For that, as well as for his wisdom and friendship, we will be forever grateful.","That said, Bob brings with him a strong set of skills and a breadth of domestic and international financial expertise that is critical as we continued to grow as a commercial enterprise, especially as we expand outside the United States. You will be hearing from Bob shortly.","Turning to our top line. EYLEA continued to grow in the United States during the third quarter, with net sales of $363 million, a 49% increase from the third quarter of 2012 and a 10% sequential quarter-over-quarter increase. EYLEA also performed well outside the United States, with x U.S. sales in the third quarter of $125 million, which represents sequential quarter-over-quarter growth of about 23%.","Bayer HealthCare is still in the early process of rolling out EYLEA around the world, so we can expect continued growth in the x U.S. sales and profit. You will hear more about EYLEA's commercial performance from Bob Terifay.","Before turning the call over to my partner and Regeneron's Chief Scientific Officer, George Yancopoulos, who will discuss our pipeline in greater detail, let me make a couple of quick comments about our research accomplishments since last quarter.","The last few months have been very productive. On today's call, you will hear from George about our multiple Phase III data readouts and new potential indications for EYLEA, reports of the first Phase III results of alirocumab, our investigational LDL cholesterol-lowering antibody, the progress with our Phase III program with sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody for rheumatoid arthritis, as well as exciting Phase III results with dupilumab, our IL-4 receptor antibody that was currently being studied in asthma, atopic dermatitis and now nasal polyposis.","I would specifically like to highlight that we announced today the submission of the supplemental BLA for EYLEA in the diabetic macular edema or DME indication. This substantial progress would not be possible without the efforts of a large number of dedicated and incredibly talented people at Regeneron. That is why I am particularly proud that Science Magazine just announced that Regeneron is once again the #1 place to work in the worldwide biopharmaceutical industry. I would like to take a moment to congratulate my colleagues at Regeneron and thank them for the efforts they have put forth.","With that, let me turn the call over to George who will discuss our pipeline in greater detail. He will be followed by Bob Terifay, our Senior Vice President of Commercial; and then Bob Landry, our Chief Financial Officer. George?","George D. Yancopoulos","Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today.","As Len said, the R&D team at Regeneron has continued to be very productive. We reported the positive Phase III results for EYLEA from the VISTA and VIVID trials in diabetic macular edema. And as we announced today, we recently submitted the supplemental BLA to the FDA for the DME indication. This submission is approximately one year ahead of our original plans. Outside the United States, our partner, Bayer HealthCare, also expects to submit their application for regulatory approval in DME by year end.","We also reported positive Phase III data with EYLEA from the VIBRANT trial in macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion or BRVO. The VIBRANT trial is the eighth positive Phase III study of EYLEA and was the first study to compare EYLEA against an active laser comparator in this indication. We intend to submit an application for regulatory approval in the BRVO indication in the coming months. If approved in both the DME and BRVO indications, EYLEA will have received regulatory approval in 4 different indications in the United States.","Our late-stage pipeline beyond EYLEA has continued to advance. Last month, we reported positive top line data from ODYSSEY MONO, the first Phase III trial of alirocumab, our investigational PCSK9 antibody for lowering LDL or the bad cholesterol. We are developing alirocumab in collaboration with Sanofi. Not only was this the first Phase III study to read out from our overall 23,000-patient ODYSSEY program which consists of 12 trials, but it was also the first Phase III study from this entire class of investigational PCSK9 antibodies to report data.","It is very gratifying to us that just as we were the first company to report the first human data for this potentially important new class of antibodies, we were also the first to report Phase III data from this entire class. All the trials in the ODYSSEY program, with the exception of ODYSSEY outcomes and the recently announced ODYSSEY CHOICE 1, are fully enrolled, and we expect to report data from these trials in 2014. As we have said before, together with Sanofi, we are planning the initial launch towards the end of 2015, with a global rollout in 2016 subject to regulatory and pricing approvals.","With regards to sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody being developed with Sanofi for rheumatoid arthritis or RA, we now expect to report top line data from the MOBILITY B Phase III trial by year end. In addition to MOBILITY, sarilumab is being studied in 4 other Phase III studies in RA. Apart from RA, we're also exploring the use of sarilumab in non-infectious uveitis and have recently announced a Phase II study of sarilumab, the SATURN study, in this indication.","Turning to dupilumab, our IL-4 receptor inhibitor. In October, we presented positive Phase II data in atopic dermatitis at a major medical conference. These data followed the positive Phase II data that we reported in asthma earlier this year. We are collaborating with Sanofi on developing dupilumab, which is now in Phase II clinical trials and 3 indications: Asthma, atopic dermatitis and nasal polyposis. We continue to be excited by this program and look forward to data from these studies in the future.","We have a robust antibody pipeline in earlier stages of development. In total, we are now developing 13 fully-human monoclonal antibodies, 7 of which are in collaboration with Sanofi. This quarter, we independently advanced a new antibody combination into the clinic.","With that overview, let me now turn the call over to Bob Terifay who will provide further details on the EYLEA commercial landscape in the third quarter.","Robert J. Terifay","Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. In the United States, as Len mentioned earlier, EYLEA net sales to distributors in the third quarter were $363 million. Year-to-date, net EYLEA sales were slightly over $1 billion. We continue to see strong physician usage of EYLEA, and we've raised our full year net sales forecast between $1.35 billion and $1.375 billion. Sales growth was anticipated to be somewhat tempered during the Thanksgiving and end of year holidays when patients are likely to postpone visits to their doctors.","Inventory held by distributors remains at the 1- to 2-week range. Although at the end of the third quarter, there was a slight increase in inventory days relative to the second quarter. To help provide more detail on the market dynamics, we will be sharing with you data from our market research survey that we conducted in the third quarter. As before, these data come from physician-based questionnaires, in this case, from 167 representative physicians. I will share with you the numbers as they were reported in the survey, which was conducted in the third quarter. But I'd like to remind you that these numbers are physician-reported estimates based on our survey.","Let me begin with the wet AMD indication. In the third quarter, physicians recorded that EYLEA had a 26% market share on wet AMD, with ranibizumab having a 25% share and off-label bevacizumab having a 48% share. Approximately half of the patients treated with EYLEA were patients continuing from prior quarters, 1\/4 for patients switching from other anti-VEGF therapies and 1\/4 for patients new to therapy.","Physicians report that wet AMD patients on EYLEA received treatment with a longer dosing interval compared to ranibizumab and bevacizumab. EYLEA patients received an intravitreal injection on average approximately every 8 weeks compared to patients receiving ranibizumab who were treated with a dosing interval of approximately 6 weeks and patients on bevacizumab who were treated with a dosing interval every 6 weeks.","Turning now to the second indication where EYLEA is approved in the United States. Macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion data from our market research survey suggests that during the third quarter, EYLEA achieved a 40% share of the approved anti-VEGF products in this indication. Highlighting that we are gaining momentum in this indication, 32% of our business in this indication came from new patients.","Turning now to our x U.S. EYLEA business where we split profits with Bayer HealthCare. Third quarter EYLEA net sales were $125 million. Bayer HealthCare reported that the majority of these sales continue to come from Japan and Australia. As reported by Bayer, EYLEA market share is 48% in Japan and 43% in Australia.","At the end of the third -- as of the end of the third quarter, EYLEA has received regulatory approval for the treatment of wet AMD in over 50 countries. EYLEA has also been recommended for approval in the EU in the macular edema following CRVO indication. For the remainder of the year, we expect Bayer HealthCare to embark on additional launches in both of these indications, following regulatory and pricing approvals. Just this week, in fact, EYLEA received pricing approval for wet AMD in France.","As Len and George mentioned earlier, we've submitted a supplemental BLA for EYLEA in the diabetic macular edema indication. We reported positive Phase III data from 2 trials earlier this year. We believe the DME market opportunity to be quite significant. There are 570,000 patients in the United States presenting with clinically significant diabetic macular edema each year. Currently, it is estimated that 228,000 patients are treated with anti-VEGF therapy.","Our market survey indicates the physicians intend to grow their use of anti-VEGF therapy in DME by 30% over the next year. We've recently also reported positive data for EYLEA from the Phase III VIBRANT trial in macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion or BRVO. It is estimated that approximately 78,000 patients are treated with anti-VEGF therapy for macular edema following BRVO in the United States each year.","Turning to ZALTRAP or ziv-aflibercept, Sanofi reported sales of $18 million for the third quarter. We expect continued x U.S. launches over the course of this year.","With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry.","Robert E. Landry","Thank you, Bob, and good morning to everyone. It's truly my pleasure to be participating for the first time as Regeneron's CFO. Regeneron is at a very exciting stage in its evolution, and I'm pleased to be a part of it. I look forward to getting to know and working with many of you in the coming weeks, months and years.","I'll now talk briefly about our performance in the third quarter, and I'll provide some color on the remainder of 2013. We are very pleased with our third quarter results. We earned $2.40 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $277 million, which represents a 27% increase versus the 3 months ended September 30, 2012.","Just to remind everyone, non-GAAP EPS excludes noncash share-based compensation expense, noncash interest expense related to our senior convertible notes and noncash income tax expense and is based on approximately 116 million fully diluted outstanding shares. A full reconciliation of all the adjustments to GAAP earnings are set out in our earnings release.","Total revenues in the third quarter were $597 million, which represented growth of 40% versus the quarter ended September 30, 2012. Net product sales were comprised of $363 million for U.S. EYLEA sales and $4 million in ARCALYST sales; in total, $367 million for the third quarter of 2013.","As Len mentioned, U.S. EYLEA sales grew 10% sequentially quarter-over-quarter and approximately 50% year-over-year. In addition to the sales growth, we were the beneficiary of a slight increase in wholesaler inventories this quarter. X U.S. EYLEA sales were $125 million and represented a 23% improvement versus the quarter ended June 30, 2013.","As a reminder, revenue from x U.S. EYLEA sales is recorded by Bayer HealthCare. You may notice a slight difference between what we are reporting as x U.S. EYLEA sales and what Bayer HealthCare previously reported. This is due to Japan where Santen Pharmaceuticals commercializes EYLEA under a co-promotion relationship with a subsidiary of Bayer HealthCare.","Our royalty in Japan is based on end use of sales reported by Santen, so we're using an x U.S. sales number that includes Santen's end user sales of EYLEA in Japan. Bayer HealthCare, however, reports their net sales to Santen rather than sales by Santen, so there are going to be differences each quarter between those numbers. Note that on this basis, second quarter x U.S. sales were $120 million -- $102 million compared to $125 million in the third quarter.","Our share of a net profit from x U.S. EYLEA sales in the third quarter was $46 million. This includes royalties that we received on EYLEA sales in Japan. After deducting $14 million in the quarter for reimbursement of development expenses at Bayer HealthCare previously funded, EYLEA x U.S. profit contributed $32 million to our Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue.","Adding the cost sharing of ongoing EYLEA development expenses, reimbursement of other Regeneron EYLEA expenses, amortization of upfront and certain milestone payments and $45 million in substantive milestone payments this quarter, total Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue was $89 million in the third quarter compared to $27 million in the third quarter of last year.","As a reminder, during the third quarter of 2012, x U.S. sales of EYLEA had not yet commenced, but there was a $15 million milestone payment. The $45 million of milestone payments that we recognized in the third quarter 2013 consisted of a $15 million milestone related to EYLEA approval in the EU and the CRVO indication and 2 sales milestone payments that were $15 million each, relating to aggregate net EYLEA x U.S. sales.","We anticipate earning another $15 million sales milestone payment in the fourth quarter based on continued x U.S.EYLEA sales growth script. Beyond 2013, we could earn up to $90 million in additional x U.S. EYLEA sales milestones, which we expect to earn in full by approximately the end of 2015.","Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $134 million for the quarter and represents an 8% decrease versus the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, primarily driven by a $50 million substantive milestone payment received in 2012 related to U.S. regulatory approval of ZALTRAP, offset by an increase in R&D and reimbursement for the 3 months ended September 30, 2013.","As explained on previous calls and as outlined in our 10-Q, the Sanofi collaboration revenue includes primarily reimbursement of our R&D expenses for pre-clinical and clinical development within our antibody collaboration and amortization of payments previously received from Sanofi, less our share of the losses associated with ZALTRAP.","Global ZALTRAP net sales in the third quarter, as reported by Sanofi, were $18 million. We recognize $7 million as our share of the losses in connection with the commercialization of ZALTRAP around the world. Let me reiterate what we have previously said. We are not expecting ZALTRAP to be profitable to Regeneron in the near term due to our obligation to repay Sanofi from our 50% share of ZALTRAP profits for 50% of the cumulative ZALTRAP development expenses that they have funded.","Turning to expenses. Non-GAAP cost of goods was $28 million in the third quarter 2013 compared to $20 million in the third quarter 2012. Included in COGS is our royalty obligation to Genentech related to U.S. sales of EYLEA, which remains in place until second quarter 2016. As in prior quarters, COGS continues to average less than 10% of product sales.","Cost of collaboration manufacturing, which is relatively new line item in our P&L, came in at $10 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2013. The cost of collaboration manufacturing includes our manufacturing costs for producing bulk material that our collaborators sell. This line item also comprises royalties that we are obligated to pay, including the Genentech royalties that we will pay until second quarter 2016 on sales of EYLEA that is manufactured in the U.S. but sold outside the U.S. This is not the total manufacturing cost of these products. About half of the cost of collaboration manufacturing is reimbursed to us by Sanofi and Bayer HealthCare through the individual collaboration revenue lines.","Non-GAAP SG&A expense for the third quarter 2013 was $80 million compared to $56 million in the second quarter 2013 and $40 million for the third quarter 2012. The increase in non-GAAP SG&A was largely driven by contributions we made for not-for-profit foundations that assist patients' pay for their medications. We are not expecting to see this same G&A expense level in the fourth quarter, but do expect to be on the top end of our previously provided guidance for full year GAAP SG&A expense of $225 million to $250 million.","Non-GAAP R&D expense for the third quarter of 2013 was $196 million compared to $160 million in the second quarter, an increase of 23%. During the third quarter, Sanofi and Bayer HealthCare reimbursed us a total of $141 million in R&D expenses. As a reminder, we record the R&D activity incurred in connection with our Sanofi and Bayer arrangements as a component of our R&D expenses, and record their reimbursement to us within the Bayer and Sanofi collaboration revenue line items.","The unreimbursed net R&D expenses for the third quarter 2013 after the reimbursement by Bayer and Sanofi were $55 million compared to $46 million in the second quarter. The increase in unreimbursed R&D this quarter was due primarily to higher R&D expenses on unpartnered early-stage antibody programs. We are tightening our full year 2013 non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense guidance to $225 million to $250 million from the previous range of $225 million to $275 million.","This full year unreimbursed R&D guidance assumes fourth quarter unreimbursed R&D of $80 million to $105 million, which would be significantly higher than prior quarters. This is primarily due to the terms of our antibody collaboration with Sanofi, which requires that following the first positive Phase III results for an antibody in the collaboration, we are responsible for 20% of the subsequent Phase III development costs for that antibody.","Therefore, following the positive results from ODYSSEY MONO, which were reported last month, we are now paying for 20% of the Phase III expense for alirocumab. Additionally, within the fourth quarter, we expect to incur unreimbursed antibody discovery research expenses beyond $160 million per year that is reimbursed by Sanofi.","While we are not prepared to provide specific unreimbursed R&D guidance for next year at this time, assuming continued success of the pipeline, including sarilumab and our unpartnered antibodies, we expect the quarterly rate of unreimbursed R&D to continue to grow during 2014. We anticipate providing further financial guidance at the JPMorgan conference in January 2014. As a reminder, non-GAAP SG&A and R&D expenses exclude noncash share-based compensation expense.","Turning now to taxes. For GAAP accounting purposes, in the third quarter, we recorded $84 million in income taxes, representing an effective tax rate of approximately 37% for the quarter. As we've stated before, at this current time, we do not expect to pay significant cash taxes through at least 2014, and as such, our non-GAAP earnings currently exclude any income taxes.","At the end of the third quarter, we had $775 million in cash and marketable securities and $856 million in trade account receivables, primarily related to EYLEA sales.","With that, I will now turn the call back over to Len","Leonard S. Schleifer","Thanks, Bob, and thank you, everyone else. I'd like to close the prepared remarks by highlighting a few things. Our business continues to perform well. We believe that EYLEA has room to grow, both through approval and additional indications, such as DME, BRVO, as well as the continued geographic expansion that is still in the early stages.","Over the mid to longer term, we expect our broad pipeline of antibodies, such as alirocumab, sarilumab and dupilumab, to drive continued growth. As Bob Landry mentioned, with the success in our pipeline, including the positive Phase III data with alirocumab, but also our own growing pipeline of wholly-owned antibodies, such as PDGF in ophthalmology, we expect our unreimbursed R&D expenses to increase in the fourth quarter of this year, as well as in 2014.","We feel confident in our approach and our broad pipeline that gives us multiple shots on goal. We look forward to discussing new molecules and technologies that are currently in earlier development and that we hope will advance soon.","I would like to now turn the call back over to Michael Aberman for questions and answers.","Michael Aberman","Thank you, Len. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] As you know, our team will be available in our office after the call for follow-up questions. Thank you. And operator, if you could please now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adnan Butt with RBC Capital Markets.","Adnan S. Butt - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The question I'm getting most frequently, and perhaps you can address this, is on outcomes and data being needed for the alirocumab study. And what gives you confidence that it will not be acquired first? And then can you explain a bit about your labeling strategy? Will it be initial targeted label then going over time? And which region do you expect to [indiscernible] first?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Okay. Thanks [indiscernible]. And then George, do you want to deal with the regulatory question there?","George D. Yancopoulos","Yes. We've had extensive discussions with the FDA. And as we noted, it's our understanding that assuming that the data is robust and that safety data is hopefully quite clear cut that all we'll need to do is to be substantially involved in executing our outcome study to be considered for approval. So we will not need to have an outcome study result at that time.","Robert E. Landry","And as far as your question on the label, we don't have any comment specifically on the label, but we will say that we have a very broad program that we believe covers just about everything one could think of in terms of the types of patients, the relative risk, the relative cholesterol, whether they have familial disorders, whether they've had a previous event and so forth. And we have dosing choices as well and we have a well-controlled, long-term safety aspect of the program, which we think is very important. So we are very pleased with the program as it's designed and how it's being conducted together with Sanofi.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Kantor with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jason Kantor - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I'm wondering if you could give us a synthetic quantification of the inventory impact in the quarter, either in terms of dollars or days. And in your survey, are you seeing that you are already having current use in DME? And if so, how much of your sales are in the DME indications?","Leonard S. Schleifer","All right. So the second question, we don't track our off-label uses, we don't reward on it. And so we really don't have any information for you on that. In terms of the inventory, we're not going to get into the -- how many minutes, hours, days or what-have-you of extra inventory we have, but it was just a slight increase on a relative magnitude. I think was on the order of slightly less than the increase was in the previous quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Roden with UBS.","Andrew R. Peters - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This is actually Andrew Peters in for Matt. A quick question on the PCSK9 program. In the Phase II, you guys ran fixed dose studies, but in the Phase III, you're looking at more of an up-titration, 75 up to 150. So it seems like you're looking at optimizing the LDL goal instead of maximizing the reduction. I was wondering if you could just go through the rationale there as it relates to whether you think there's a linear risk reduction with LDL or is it more about just reaching goal.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Well, I think the point is, is that physicians in this area are used to and like options for treating their patients. We have a very robust program which examines both fixed dosing in very large numbers of patients, as well as up-titration strategies. And I think, together, the collection of all of these studies are going to offer physicians and patients a large number of choices to satisfy what the individual patient's needs and what the individual doctors think that, that patient's needs are. So we'll have the ability if that patient needs it to drive the LDL down as quickly and as far as possible. In other settings where -- and that may not be needed, they could have a choice of a lower dose. And in even our program, we can allow for monthly dosing and so forth. So it's all about options and flexibility for the patients.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Raymond with Robert Baird & Co.","Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just doing some calculation, looking at your last couple of quarters of DSOs, it looks like the number is leveling off here a bit. I know -- or I think I've heard you guys talk about changing the terms perhaps at the beginning of the year, and I know you don't want to give a lot of detail on that, but can you maybe talk a little bit about when we might start to see that DSO number start to trend down?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes, we don't comment on these commercial terms. It's in the competitive environment, sorry.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Birchenough with BMO Capital.","Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just following up on some market trends. One, wondering if there's anything that you guys are planning to do or already doing to compete against the Lucentis discount program that might be your own discount program or sampling. Just wondering what you can do to eat in to that 24% share that they're retaining. And in DME, wondering how you think about position against the Lucentis 0.3 milligram dose, which is lower priced, and whether you need to discount in DME to gain meaningful market share.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes. Some of those details are obviously part of our competitive strategy that we really don't want to get into. We will say that based on what we've heard presented at medical meetings and the advisory panel, the reason for the lower dose of Lucentis in DME had to do primarily with this question of this dose-dependent safety question around deaths at a higher dose. We don't have a dose-dependent increase in that, and we studied the same doses we had in AMD. So we'll have to see whether or not that provides an advantage to patients or not. We don't have a head-to-head study, so we can't make a comparison about that. As far as the rebate program and things like that, we're not going to get into. I don't know, Bob, if you want to add anything about sampling or anything else you want to...","Robert J. Terifay","No, I think that any discussion of rebates or sampling is competitive situation we won't disclose. I will remind you that in DME, we have every 8-week dosing in our study which is differentiating from the competition which has monthly dosing in their labeling. And that should help offset any cost concerns on an annual basis.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes, that's a great point, Bob. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.","Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. A question for Bob Terifay. Your SG&A increased sequentially. I was wondering if you increased the headcount and the sales force in -- for EYLEA.","Robert J. Terifay","No, our sales force has remained consistent since launch.","Operator","Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Was just wondering if you could give us your take on the current version of the compounding bill that the Senate's poised to vote on this week. It seems that everyone who talks to someone in D.C. has a different interpretation.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes. I mean, you can imagine that we monitor that pretty carefully. And obviously, we believe that a single quality standard for all drug products, whether they're manufactured by companies such as Regeneron, or whether they are repackaged by a compounding pharmacy, patients and the physicians shouldn't have to worry that the drug is not meeting a single high-quality standard. We think that the current draft bill makes important headway in ensuring a more robust regulatory enforcement regime in the area of compounding and repackaging. And it clears the way possible legal impediments, the most important thing from our perspective. It clears away any blockage of the FDA's ability to enforce the law. And the requirement -- we believe that, that may require people to live up to FDA-mandated GMP-type standards when they repackage a drug. It sounds simple, but that process is rather complicated, and it's associated -- also, it's a risk and it needs to be properly regulated. That's our position. We think the current compounding bill will allow the FDA to do that. But of course, the bill hasn't been signed or passed just yet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So big picture, now that we've seen some stabilization in the market a little bit that you continue to grow, I was just wondering, do you still think fears around the sequester influencing Avastin's ability to keep share? And do you think that you can actually continue to take share over time from the AMD market, specifically the Avastin segment?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Bob, do you want to comment on that?","Robert J. Terifay","So we have seen a stabilization in Avastin share. Remember, we started when we launched with Avastin having a 65% share of the wet AMD market, that's down to 48%, but it is starting to stabilize as some physicians with the sequester payments have chosen to use Avastin. We still think there is room to grow in wet AMD. There are patients on a continuous basis who have to be switched from their existing therapy, and we believe there's opportunity there. And we will continue to fight it out in the marketplace with the branded molecule as well. We're also quite encouraged by the growth potential in Europe where the pricing approvals are just coming.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ying Huang with Barclays.","Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So first of all, can you tell us exactly what you asked for in the BLA for DME? Did you ask for both every 4-week and every 8-week dosing? And then can you tell me a little bit more about the status for development for the PDGF and NH2 antibody program in AMD?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Sure. It's a little bit premature to be discussing our ask in labeling and what-have-you, but we can remind you what we did study, which usually tracks what one submits obviously. We did study a program that had a fixed dosing that -- and then it went on to every 8-week dosing. So we're obviously going to be discussing our whole data set with the FDA. George, do you want to comment a little bit our thoughts about PDGF, what we think about the program and where it's going?","George D. Yancopoulos","Yes. Well, we are certainly hopeful that PDGF co-therapy will provide an incremental advance for patients. And on top of, of course, the anti-VEGF foundation therapy, and we think, of course, that it's going to be quite a while before we collectively as a community really understand whether it will be providing that sort of advance, that we know better than anyone a few letters difference, even in the 150-patient study, is a little hard to interpret and that you need a lot more data. But in our case, we're moving ahead. We're on schedule with the previous guidance we've given in terms of filing our IND and so forth. And we certainly think that if this co-therapy proves to have value, it'll be tremendously beneficial to the patients to have the opportunity to have a single injection coformulated product which we're hoping to be able to provide if the co-therapy is advantageous.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Good, thank you. Let me just come back to one other question that maybe we were a little bit abrupt in saying we don't comment on the DSO. I guess a point there is that we do expect that to trend down over the course of the next year as we tighten up the terms. But the specific commercial terms and the specific dates, we can't get into at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Citi.","Christopher Mortko","This is Chris in for Yaron. Had a question on your IL-6 program. Can you comment on how you think your compound is differentiated, given that the IL-6 base is becoming increasingly competitive with Actemra just getting approved subcu recently?","Leonard S. Schleifer","George?","George D. Yancopoulos","Yes. Well, we certainly think that the IL-6 space continues to be a very exciting opportunity. I think a lot of people believe that this target could provide a big opportunity for providing more benefit to patients. In our case, of course, we think that we'll have a convenient subcutaneous regimen that has the opportunity to be very competitive with the Actemra and the data that Actemra is producing subcutaneously. So we think that there's going to be room in this space for multiple agents, agents that will have slightly different profiles. And we're pretty optimistic that we're going to be second in class here for this very large opportunity offering, perhaps certain differentiation and advantages compared to Actemra.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoffrey Meacham with JPMorgan.","Carter L. Gould - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Carter on for Geoff. My question relates to Pfizer's announcement to move their PCSK9 into Phase III studies. In their comments last week, they mentioned targeting some subsegments of the hypercholesterolemia population. Do you have any comments on this and how your clinical development program maybe addresses these segments or not?","Leonard S. Schleifer","We wish our friends at Pfizer good luck. That's all we have to say about that their program at this point.","George D. Yancopoulos","Well, I think it's worth adding that we do think that our program is as robust and deep and targets as many interesting patient subclasses and does it as robustly as any other program that's being undertaken at this point in time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Raymond with Robert Baird & Co.","Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just a question on the shelf. You guys are in a decisively cash flow positive position. Can you maybe talk a little bit about the logic and thinking behind filing the shelf?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Bob? Bob Landry?","Robert E. Landry","Chris, it's Bob Landry. So I mean, the shelf is just kind of good everyday, housekeeping practice that we do. We've had a shelf in place that had expired in October of 2013. And again, I'd don't want anyone a kind to read into anything with regards to our future plans, with regards to the use of it. It's just good housekeeping practice to always have a shelf kind of in place and hence, the filing of that this morning.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes. We have no plans whatsoever to access the capital markets at this time.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from Adnan Butt with RBC Capital Markets.","Adnan S. Butt - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So your friends at Genentech Roche mentioned that they expect completion in DME around midyear. So do you wish them good luck as well? Is this priority of you?","Leonard S. Schleifer","I think they were wishing us good luck. But look, all of this kind of activity, this competitive activity is great for patients. When you bring additional choices of drugs that might make a difference in these terrible diseases, I think having more than one choice and each choice having lots of robust labels is a good thing. We look forward to competing in the marketplace with Lucentis if we're lucky enough to get the drug approved sometime next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Kantor with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jason Kantor - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was hoping that you can give us some sense of the timeline for data releases from some of your earlier-stage programs and the next data release from the PCSK9 program. And on the earlier side, I was interested in the [indiscernible] study and when you might have data from that.","Robert J. Terifay","Yes. We don't have any guidance for you this point on the earlier-stage stuff. We do expect on the PCSK9 lots of data next year. As you know, all of our studies, except the outcomes in the Q4 week are fully enrolled, which means we will be having lots of data and lots of it probably in the first half of next year. It's going to be a busy time for the space. We expect our competition to have lots of data, and I think everybody will be focusing on that. We do expect the additional data before the end of this year on our mid-stage -- first-stage [indiscernible] program with sarilumab. I'm not sure we're expecting any Phase II data this year with the dupilumab at this point. And that's about the status of the data flow. Lots going on, but we'll try and update you from time to time on how some of the early programs are doing, Jason.

Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Manisha. Good morning to everyone who has joined us on today's call and webcast. In my prepared remarks, I will focus on Regeneron's high level strategy. George will provide details on how our R&D prowess enables and supports that strategy. Marion will update you on the status of our commercialization efforts which will drive the realization of our strategy. And Bob will recap our financial results.","Let me begin with EYLEA. EYLEA has been a very successful product both in terms of how much value it brings to patients with vision threatening retinal diseases, as well as how many value it brings to our business. Since approval in late 2011, EYLEA has taken over as the market leading FDA approved anti-VEGF agent for retinal diseases. More than 15 million doses of EYLEA have been administered globally since launch. During the first quarter of 2018, global net sales of EYLEA were $1.6 billion. Clearly, at the moment, EYLEA is our most important product and naturally many of our shareholders have questions about the sustainability of the EYLEA franchise over the near and long term.","We believe that while competition is expected in the anti-VEGF space around late 2019, the therapeutic profile of EYLEA sets a very high bar and there were no products in late-stage development to our knowledge that are likely to have substantially differentiated product profile from EYLEA.","In addition, we see significant opportunities for growth based upon the aging of the population as well as the unfortunate but dramatic increase in the prevalence of diabetes. While EYLEA is well-penetrated in wet age-related macular degeneration, there remains a large untapped opportunity in diabetic eye disease. That is why we are focused on expanding our indications in diabetic retinal diseases.","Currently, EYLEA is indicated for the treatment of diabetic macular edema where we have the market leading branded anti-VEGF supported by the NIH-sponsored Protocol T study. Many diabetic patients can also suffer from eye disease without having diabetic macular edema and much of this results from a condition called diabetic retinopathy without macular edema.","Some of these patients are at high risk of suffering from catastrophic vision threatening complications. Later this year we plan to submit an sBLA for approval in diabetic retinopathy without DME based upon the striking initial results that were observed with EYLEA in the PANORAMA study at six months. We also look forward to longer-term results from the PANORAMA study where we will be evaluating the ability of EYLEA to prevent vision threatening complications.","But the success of EYLEA creates a challenge for Regeneron to diversify its revenue and profit base. I am pleased to say that we can now see the strategy we put in place many years ago starting to bear fruit. Our strategy was and continues to be to invest heavily in our internal research capabilities rather than look externally for new products. Though we do strategically combine our research capabilities with partners, such as Intellia, Alnylam and others, to collaboratively create new product opportunities.","So where do we stand? From a broad perspective, our strategy is working. We have six approved FDA medicines and 17 different product candidates in clinical development, all arising from our internal discovery efforts. But in terms of the specific near-term evidence of success from this strategy, I would like to highlight two areas, allergic diseases and immuno-oncology.","Our efforts to tackle allergic diseases began decades ago and resulted in Dupixent, a true pipeline in a product. Dupixent is currently approved for adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, and the launch in the United States is going quite well. We and our collaborator Sanofi are in the midst of launching Dupixent for atopic dermatitis in the rest of the world, which represents another very significant opportunity. Moreover, we're in the process of completing trials that would support the expansion of Dupixent into adolescent and pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis, which once again is another substantial opportunity.","But atopic dermatitis may be just the tip of the allergic iceberg, because we are seeing strong clinical evidence that Dupixent is active in a number of different allergic or so called Type 2 disease, we believe there was a remarkably broad and deep pipeline within Dupixent itself. And we, along with our collaborator Sanofi, have committed the resources necessary to fully execute our development plan for Dupixent.","We anticipate regulatory approval in asthma later this year and have Phase 3 trials under way in adolescent and pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis, pediatric patients with asthma, as well as adults with nasal polyps. Top line data from the Phase 3 nasal polyps study and the adolescent atopic dermatitis study are expected later this year. In addition, in the second half of this year, we plan to begin pivotal studies in COPD, another very large opportunity. We will also initiate a late-stage program in eosinophilic esophagitis and a Phase 2 program in peanut and grass allergies later this year.","Finally, we will be studying the potential of combining our IL-33 antibody with Dupixent in several of these allergic or Type 2 indications. In our view, the potential for the Dupixent pipeline is analogous to what happened when it was realized that the anti-TNFs were not just drugs for rheumatoid arthritis, but drugs for many different diseases involving overactivity of Type 1 immunity. We believe that the evidence thus far is compelling that Dupixent is not just a drug for atopic dermatitis, but has the potential to address multiple other allergic or Type 2 diseases. In short, we think that Dupixent may be able to bend the arc of allergic disease.","Now, let's turn to another pillar of our diversification strategy, and that is the area of immuno-oncology. Let me be clear, our goal is to become a major player in this space, and we believe that we have the science, tools, technologies and most importantly the product candidates to compete and win. Immuno-oncology has transformed the treatment of cancer and is turning out to be one of the largest commercial opportunities in the history of the biopharmaceutical industry. For example, the sales of anti-PD-1 antibodies across a number of cancers are currently at a $12 billion global annual run rate and still growing, driven in large part by use in non-small cell lung cancer. Our strategy in this important therapeutic area is proving to be spot-on in terms of the selection of molecular targets, engineering of complex drug candidates and the selection of the right initial disease states for development.","In terms of targets, we chose PD-1 over PD-L1 and that turns out to be the right choice in our opinion based upon the available data. Moreover, we leveraged our VelocImmune technology to select an excellent antibody and our clinical group selected a previously overlooked cancer, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC.","Cemiplimab, our PD-1 antibody, has produced breakthrough data in CSCC, and we are awaiting FDA action for this important indication. The response rates we have seen are amongst the highest reported for a solid tumor and served as the basis for our breakthrough designation by the FDA.","While CSCC is a significant opportunity by itself, non-small cell lung cancer is the largest indication where we are currently studying cemiplimab. Our positive early data from a small cohort of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer supports our decision to aggressively move forward in multiple settings of this disease. These data will be presented at the upcoming annual ASCO conference. Our first-line lung cancer study comparing cemiplimab monotherapy to chemotherapy is on track to complete enrollment around the end of this year or early next year. We expect cemiplimab to be the foundation of our immuno-oncology efforts for years to come.","Another component of our immuno-oncology strategy is our bispecific platform. We are combining our biological and technical capabilities to build molecules that combine tumor targeting and effective functions. Our CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody, entirely owned by Regeneron, is now making excellent progress in the clinic. You will hear more about this from George and at an upcoming medical meeting.","Other bispecifics include MUC16xCD3 and BCMAxCD3, both of which we anticipate advancing into the clinic this year. Additional CD3 bispecifics are moving towards the clinic. And over the course of this year, we will be giving you information about a new class of bispecific antibodies.","Much like Dupixent, we believe that cemiplimab has the potential to be a pipeline within a molecule, and we believe our bispecific platform is able to produce a steady stream of new drug candidates as well. Perhaps, most importantly, we see strong potential for combination treatments involving our PD-1 antibody and our bispecifics.","So to recap, we believe EYLEA has meaningful additional opportunity for continued growth. Our diversification strategy is clearly on track to deliver the full potential of the Dupixent pipeline and our immuno-oncology franchises, which position us well to continue commercial success, and we will continue to aggressively move the rest of our deep pipeline along as well.","With that, let me turn the call over to George.","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Len, and a good morning to everyone. The first quarter of 2018 has been very busy and productive from an R&D perspective, and I will provide some of the key highlights. Beginning with EYLEA, we reported positive data from the Phase 3 PANORAMA study in diabetic retinopathy. In this study, at 24 weeks, 58% of patients receiving EYLEA experienced a two-step or greater improvement from baseline on the Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale, compared to 6% of patients receiving sham injection, with a p-value of less than 0.0001. No new safety signals were observed. Importantly, this was the first time that any therapy demonstrated the ability to reverse disease progression in a study specifically designed to evaluate patients with moderately severe to severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema.","We will continue to evaluate these patients for longer durations to determine whether EYLEA treatment can prevent progression to neovascular vision-threatening complications and also to diabetic macular edema. We expect to make a regulatory submission in the United States later this year.","In March, at the Annual Meeting of the American College of Cardiology, we reported positive data from the 18,000 patient cardiovascular outcome study of Praluent, which compared Praluent to maximally-tolerated statins. These data showed that Praluent significantly reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events or MACE in these high risk patients and was associated with a lower rate of all-cause death.","Safety was consistent with previous trials and no new safety issues were observed. In a pre-specified analysis, the patients with baseline LDL cholesterol levels at or above 100 milligrams per deciliter, experienced a more pronounced benefit from Praluent, reducing their risk of MACE by 24% and their risk of death from coronary heart disease by 28%.","In additional post-hoc analyses of this pre-specified group, Praluent was associated with a 29% lower risk of death from any cause. These results are consistent with the recently published meta-analysis in the Journal of the American Medical Association that showed an association between more intensive LDL cholesterol lowering and a greater reduction in the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality in patients whose baseline LDL cholesterol was greater than 100 mgs per deciliter. We expect a regulatory submission to the FDA based on these data around the middle of the year.","Len has shared our enthusiasm for the Dupixent pipeline. Our regulatory submission for Dupixent for the treatment of uncontrolled asthma in adults and adolescents is currently under review by the FDA with a PDUFA date in October. Detailed results from the Phase 3 QUEST and VENTURE asthma studies will be presented at the upcoming meeting of the American Thoracic Society.","Our Phase 3 study of asthma in the pediatric setting is currently under way. We also have three ongoing Phase 3 studies of Dupixent in adolescent and pediatric atopic dermatitis. The first of these, in adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 years old is fully enrolled and we expect to report top line data shortly. Two pediatric studies, one in children aged 6 to 11 years old and the second in children aged 6 months to 5 years old, are currently enrolling.","Based on the scientific pathway, we believe that dupilumab could be used in a variety of additional allergic or so-called Type 2 immune conditions. We expect to report top line data from two Phase 3 studies of dupilumab in nasal polyps later this year. We plan to initiate, later this year, a study in patients with co-morbid conditions as well as our Phase 3 programs of dupilumab in COPD and in eosinophilic esophagitis. We also plan to launch Phase 2 studies of dupilumab in peanut and grass allergies in 2018.","Let me remind you that the human genetic findings from our Regeneron Genetics Center, together with our preclinical studies, support the hypothesis that blocking interleukin 33 might have additional benefits for some patients being treated with dupilumab in some of these diseases. A Phase 2 study in asthma of Regeneron 3500, our fully human interleukin 33 antibody, with and without dupilumab, is enrolling patients. We plan to initiate in the second half of this year Phase 2 studies of IL-33 and atopic dermatitis and COPD.","As you also heard from Len, one of the most important areas of our focus is the exciting field of immuno-oncology where we have multiple approaches towards harnessing the immune system to fight cancer. Founded on opportunities provided by our PD-1 antibody and by our emerging portfolio of bispecific antibodies.","Let me remind you that despite the excitement surrounding the PD-1 pathway, there have also been some sobering realizations. Early on, many thought that the PD-1 pathway blockade would be commoditized with a prevailing view that there would be many equivalent agents approved. As it now stands, many believe that antibodies against PD-1 are differentiated and more active than those against the PD-1 \u2013 PD-L1 ligand. Moreover, out of the two approved PD-1 antibodies, only one has been approved as monotherapy in first line non-small-cell lung cancer.","Finally, the PD-1 pathway has not demonstrated profound activity in many of the most prevalent cancer settings including breast cancer, prostate, colorectal, pancreatic and others. And even in settings like lung cancer where the drug is active, most of the patients still do not respond. Obviously, there is much room to provide much more benefit to many more patients in need.","Later this year, with the PDUFA date in October, we anticipate having the third FDA approved PD-1 antibody, cemiplimab, which would be the first approval in our comprehensive immuno-oncology development program. In addition to monotherapy opportunities with cemiplimab, we believe cemiplimab will be the bedrock upon which we plan to build additional combination therapies.","We have reported positive data for cemiplimab in metastatic and locally-advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, where we observed an overall response rate of around 47%, which is among the highest response rates seen in any solid malignancy to-date with a PD-1 antibody. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma will be the first indication for which we anticipate the approval of cemiplimab.","At the upcoming Annual ASCO Meeting, we look forward to sharing with you additional data in patients with unresectable metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. We will also be presenting the activity and durability from our pivotal Phase 2 cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma study. Importantly, we're also conducting studies in additional tumor types, including first and second line non-small cell lung cancer and cervical cancer.","As Len mentioned, first line non-small cell lung cancer is one of the most exciting opportunities for PD-1 blockade, but only one agent has demonstrated convincing monotherapy activity in this setting. Our program includes three key trials, which, if successful, could position cemiplimab as a major competitor in this space.","The first study is cemiplimab monotherapy versus chemotherapy in patients who expressed PD-L1 of 50% or greater. This study is ongoing and we expect enrollment to be completed later this year or early next year. The second trial of cemiplimab in combination with chemotherapy with or without ipilimumab versus chemotherapy alone in patients with PD-L1 expression of 50% or lower. This study is currently enrolling. Cemiplimab, in combination with ipilimumab with or without chemotherapy in patients with 50% or greater PD-L1 expression, this study would also include a pembrolizumab comparator arm. We plan to initiate this study around midyear.","Turning to our bispecific antibody platform, which provides monotherapy opportunities, as well as opportunities to combine with cemiplimab. Our lead molecule of CD20xCD3 bispecific continues to progress in the clinic. We would like to remind you that this is a wholly-owned molecule. This molecule could compete in indications, where CD20 antibodies, such as rituximab, are no longer efficacious, as well as where CD20 antibodies are currently the standard of care.","As we reported at ASH last November, at doses of 5 milligrams or greater, we observed 50% response rates and almost 80% disease control rates in heavily-pretreated rituximab refractory patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma without any dose-limiting toxicities. And thus, we were reporting that we were continuing to dose escalate our CD20xCD3 bispecific. At higher doses, we are now seeing encouraging signs of increased activities without any dose-limiting toxicities and we have not yet reached a maximally-tolerated dose.","We look forward to sharing more data at upcoming medical conference in the second half of this year. We believe our bispecific platform has the potential to deliver additional clinical candidates, including two, which are expected to enter the clinic later this year, our MUC16xCD3 and our BCMAxCD3 bispecifics. We are also advancing a new class of bispecific antibodies and hope to share more with you about this new class of bispecifics later this year.","Turning now to fasinumab, our NGF antibody for pain. An independent data monitoring committee evaluated the ongoing safety and efficacy of the clinical trials and recommended that the higher-dose regimens be discontinued based on their risk benefit assessment and that the program continue with the lower dose regimens. We are modifying the studies accordingly. We anticipate sharing top line results from the ongoing Phase 3 study later this year.","In the interest of time, I will not talk about many of the remaining programs in our pipeline. Addressing diseases ranging from an ultra-rare condition, such as fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva to highly-prevalent conditions involving muscle wasting and metabolic disorders. Please refer to our Form 10-Q, which is a description of all of our clinical programs.","I will now turn the call over to Marion.","Marion McCourt - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be on the call today. This is my first earnings call with Regeneron and it is a privilege to be part of this wonderful team. I'd like to start with EYLEA, where global net sales in the first quarter were $1.6 billion. EYLEA continues to be the market-leading branded anti-VEGF for retinal diseases in the United States. In the U.S., EYLEA net sales were $984 million, which represented about 70% of the overall branded market. Our dollar share of the branded market increased slightly year-over-year.","Based on a survey we conducted in the first quarter, we estimate that currently about 70% of U.S. EYLEA net sales come from wet AMD and about 25% from DME, with the balance coming from other smaller indications. With the aging of our population and the dramatic increase in the prevalence of diabetes, we expect significant future market growth.","Looking ahead, we see two major opportunities to grow the EYLEA franchise. The first is through additional indications such as diabetic retinopathy where we recently reported positive Phase 3 data from the PANORAMA study and expect to make a regulatory submission later this year. If approved in diabetic retinopathy, we expect that EYLEA could be used in the full spectrum of patients with diabetic eye diseases.","Secondly, diabetic eye diseases are dramatically underdiagnosed and undertreated and even when treated, it is frequently with suboptimal therapy. This is true both for patients suffering from diabetic macular edema as well as from diabetic retinopathy. We expect that our increased provider and patient outreach in education could result in more patients with DME being diagnosed and receiving therapy in the near term and similarly impacts diabetic retinopathy following potential approval in this indication. There are also many ongoing efforts, both from academia and the industry, to develop approaches to identify these patients before they go on to suffer catastrophic vision loss.","A further opportunity to strengthen the EYLEA value proposition is through dosing flexibility. EYLEA is currently approved for use on a monthly and every 8-week basis and we have submitted an application to the FDA for every 12-week dosing in patients with wet AMD with a PDUFA, FDA PDUFA date in August 2018.","We recognize that each patient requires a tailored treatment regimen and therefore, if this every 12-week label addition is approved, EYLEA will be the only approved drug in wet AMD to have the flexibility to optimally treat patients, regardless of whether they require fixed interval dosing of 4, 8, or 12 weeks. We remind you that our Phase 3 wet AMD studies patients were extended to the 12-week dosing interval only after they successfully met treatment goals and more frequent dosing intervals.","Turning now to Dupixent, global net sales in the first quarter of 2018 as recorded by our collaborator Sanofi were $131 million with U.S. net sales of $117 million. Underlying demand continues to be strong with total prescriptions, as well as the number of patients on treatment, up approximately 25% sequentially from the last quarter. Over 500 new patients were added each week during the quarter.","Moreover, we consistently see high persistence rates with over 90% of patients getting their first refill and over the course of the first year, approximately 83% of patients who started Dupixent remained on therapy. Over 10,000 health care providers have prescribed Dupixent through the first quarter and we're beginning to advance depth of prescribing among users with the nearly half of these HCPs having prescribed Dupixent to three or more patients.","Dupixent prescribers are highly satisfied, frequently referred to Dupixent as a drug that has been transformational to the lives of their patients and their treatment practice. We have recently commenced airing a national disease state awareness TV advertisement in order to increase awareness of atopic dermatitis and to encourage appropriate patients to seek further treatment. We also plan to (27:16) on air direct-to-consumer campaign in the second half of the year.","We have high expectations for Dupixent and are optimistic about continued growth in the U.S. market in adult atopic dermatitis in multiple planned launches throughout the world in this indication. In addition, we also anticipate meaningful opportunities for Dupixent in adolescent and pediatric atopic dermatitis, in adult and pediatric asthma and in other indications such as nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis.","U.S. Dupixent net sales in the first quarter were impacted by trade inventory movements, and to a lesser extent, high patient assistance program costs which are typical in the beginning of the year for specialty care products. We believe that a much better metric for assessing the launch and product potential at this point is to look at the total growth of prescriptions and the increase in new patients added, both of which were increased by 25% sequentially quarter-over-quarter and the high persistence rates.","As you heard from both Len and George, we've completed a regulatory submission for Dupixent in the asthma indication with our anticipated FDA PDUFA date in October 2018. We, along with our collaborator, Sanofi, are preparing for an anticipated launch in this indication later this year.","Turning to Praluent, global net sales in the first quarter as reported by our collaborator, Sanofi, were $60 million. We're very pleased with the positive data from the cardiovascular outcome study. We've continued to work with payers to implement our new commercial strategy and just earlier this week, we announced a payer agreement in which Praluent was selected as the exclusive PCSK9 inhibitor on the Express Scripts National Preferred Formulary. Regeneron and Sanofi have agreed to significantly reduce the net price of Praluent in return for straightforward access for appropriate patients and easing out-of-pocket costs. We continue to engage productively with several other payers. We plan to make a submission to regulatory authorities by midyear based on the cardiovascular outcomes data.","Global net sales of Kevzara as recorded by our collaborator Sanofi were $12 million in the first quarter. Kevzara is our IL-6R antibody for rheumatoid arthritis. Although the RA market is crowded it represents significant opportunity and we believe that Kevzara has a well differentiated product profile. Most notably, the improvement in radiographic disease progression. We have been working with payers to secure improved access for Kevzara. Simultaneously, we continue to work on driving the breadth and depth of prescribing across all health care providers.","In immuno-oncology, our team is moving full speed ahead and preparing for the potential U.S. and EU approvals of our PD-1 antibody cemiplimab as the first treatment for advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or CSCC.","This week we announced that the FDA accepted for priority review, our Biologics License Application for cemiplimab in CSCC with a PDUFA date in October 2018. A regulatory application in this indication has also been accepted by the European Medicines Agency and we expect a decision in the first half of 2019. In the U.S. we have hired and are training an experienced and specialized field-based team to ensure that we are ready to launch immediately following approval. Cemiplimab is a collaboration product with Sanofi where in the U.S. will be taking commercial lead and report sales.","In just three short years we've gone from initiating our first immuno-oncology clinical study to potentially having our first immuno-oncology treatment approved. Ultimately our efforts to advance cemiplimab as quickly as possible come down to the significant unmet need facing patients with advanced CSCC and our commitment to giving them an effective treatment option.","CSCC is the second most common skin cancer worldwide. It's estimated that about 750,000 patients are diagnosed annually in the U.S. The vast majority of these patients, somewhere between 96% and 98% are cured by surgery. Even so this leaves thousands of patients with unmet need. While estimates vary, they suggest that between 4,000 to 8,000 patients die annually. Today, there are no FDA or EMEA approved treatments for advanced CSCC, and these patients currently face a hard and long treatment journey.","We look forward to sharing updated data from both our Phase 1 and Phase 2 CSCC clinical studies this June at ASCO. Among the accepted abstracts are a first look at our proof of concept data for Cemiplimab in non-small cell lung cancer and a trial in progress poster for our anti-LAG-3 candidate Regeneron 3767, which is being studied as both a monotherapy and in combination with cemiplimab.","And with that I turn the call to Bob.","Robert E. Landry - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Marion, and good morning, everyone. During today's call I'll discuss our first quarter 2018 financial performance and provide updates to our full year 2018 guidance line items.","Regeneron's first quarter 2018 EPS of $4.67 per diluted share on non-GAAP net income of $537 million has established a solid start for the year. These results represent a 60% and 59% year-over-year increase in our non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income, respectively.","As a reminder, Regeneron's first quarter 2018 non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense and beginning in this quarter the changes in fair value of equity investments recognized in accordance with the company's recent adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-01. A full reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release, which can be found on our website.","Total revenues grew 15% year-over-year to $1.51 billion, driven by continuing strength in our flagship EYLEA franchise and higher contribution from commercialization of Dupixent. Partially offset by a lower revenue contribution from Sanofi in connection with the Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement that ended on December 31, 2017.","EYLEA net product sales in the United States grew 15% to $984 million compared with $854 million net sales in the first quarter of 2017. U.S. EYLEA distributor inventory experienced a modest increase as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, yet remained within our normal one to two-week targeted range. Additionally, U.S. EYLEA's gross to net percentage increased compared to first quarter 2017 due to slightly higher rebate provisions for government and commercial programs.","Ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales, which are recorded by our collaborator Bayer, were $624 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, representing an 18% operational and 29% reported increase on a year-over-year basis. In the first quarter of 2018, Regeneron recognized $232 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. compared to $175 million in the first quarter of 2017. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $248 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $194 million in the first quarter of 2017.","Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $189 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared with $210 million for the first quarter of 2017. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line item primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron incurred commercialization related expenses and the recognition of deferred revenue from the immuno-oncology up-front payments, partly offset by our share of losses in connection with the commercialization of antibodies.","A significant driver of the year-over-year decrease in Sanofi collaboration revenue was the 2017 expiration of the Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement. We recorded $48 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2017 related to reimbursements of our R&D expenses from this agreement as compared to no revenue this quarter. Offsetting this revenue decrease was higher Sanofi R&D reimbursement revenue associated with our increased investment in immuno-oncology and a decrease in our share of losses in connection with the commercialization of Dupixent, Praluent and Kevzara, which were a $75 million loss in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to a loss of $108 million in the first quarter of 2017. The lower share of loss was primarily attributable to Dupixent's first quarter 2018 sales in comparison to no sales in the first quarter of 2017, given the late March 2017 U.S. launch.","Global sales of Dupixent, Praluent and Kevzara, as recorded by our collaborator, Sanofi, for the first quarter of 2018, were Dupixent, $131 million; Praluent, $60 million; and Kevzara, $12 million. The split of U.S. and rest of world net sales for these collaboration products is set out in our press release.","In the first quarter of 2018, other revenue was $86 million versus $56 million during the first quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily due to reimbursements from our collaborator, Teva, for the continued development of fasinumab, our NGF antibody and the recognition of deferred revenue associated with this program from Teva and Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma. As a reminder, you can find a summary of the components of other revenue in the MD&A section of our 10-Q.","Turning now to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $458 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $434 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in non-GAAP R&D expense was the result of the continued late stage clinical development for cemiplimab and fasinumab programs, offset by lower clinical manufacturing costs. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total non-GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, was $278 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $188 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.","This increase was primarily driven by the expiration of the Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement at the end of 2017, resulting in lower reimbursements received from Sanofi during the first quarter of 2018, offset by higher reimbursements received from our collaborators for cemiplimab and fasinumab. Our press release includes the information required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. We are tightening our full year 2018 guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense to be $1.23 billion to $1.31 billion from our previous guidance of $1.23 billion to $1.33 billion.","Next, non-GAAP SG&A expense was $296 million for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $243 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. As noted in our February 28 earnings call, we originally guided the higher SG&A this year compared to 2017 due to the ongoing launches in Dupixent and Kevzara, an increase in EYLEA commercialization expense with an increased focus on diabetic eye disease, as well as commercialization expenses for the anticipated 2018 U.S. approvals for cemiplimab in CSCC and dupilumab for asthma.","Although we still expect higher non-GAAP SG&A in comparison to full year 2017 for the reasons explained above due to lower first quarter 2018 G&A in Praluent commercial expenses and lower forecasted SG&A spend in the second half of the year, Regeneron is tightening and lowering our full year 2018 non-GAAP SG&A expense to be $1.325 billion to $1.395 billion from our previous guidance range of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion.","Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses, a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue was $87 million for the first quarter of 2018. We are tightening our full year 2018 guidance for reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses to be $450 million to $485 million from our previous guidance of $450 million to $500 million.","Turning now to taxes, our effective tax rate in the first quarter 2018 was 18% compared to 42% for the first quarter 2017. The difference was primarily driven by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which lowered the U.S. corporate tax rate as well as improved results from our international operations as compared to the first quarter of 2017.","As we continue to assess the full impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and await additional regulatory guidance, we now expect our full year 2018 effective tax rate to be 15% to 18% versus our previous guidance of 15% to 19%. Our first quarter 2018 effective tax rate was lower than the new U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to the new foreign-derived intangible income deduction and the federal tax credit for research activities.","Over the next few years, we would expect Regeneron's effective tax rate to stay consistent with 2018 guidance in the mid-to-high teens. Future regulatory guidance under the Tax Cut and Jobs Act invariability of deductions for stock-based compensation could impact our future effective tax rate.","Now to cash flow and the balance sheet, Regeneron ended the quarter of 2018 with cash and marketable securities of $3.4 billion and generated free cash flow in excess of $500 million. Our capital expenditures for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $79 million. As a result of first quarter spend levels and a revised full year forecast, we are tightening our full year 2018 capital expenditure guidance to be $420 million to $480 million from our prior range of $420 million to $500 million.","Significant 2018 capital projects include the expansion of our manufacturing facilities in Rensselaer, New York and Limerick, Ireland, as well as continued renovations and expansion of our laboratory space within our Tarrytown, New York facilities.","With that, I would now like to turn the call back to Manisha.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Bob. Operator, this concludes the prepared remarks portion of our call today. We would now like to open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And first, we have Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So maybe Len and George, since you elaborated even more about the PD-1 plans. Given the recent data from Merck's KEYTRUDA and Bristol's OPDIVO in first line non-small cell lung cancer. How do you think your molecule would behave? Is it because you're designing the molecule in such a way that it's going to be more potent even than both? Or are you trying to explore a better combination strategy for PD-1?","And then a quick one on fasinumab, can you just elaborate a little more what causes the high dose to be dropped? Is it also the same side effects we see which is osteonecrosis. Thank you.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","George, go ahead.","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah. This is George. Thanks for the question. I think that as we try to line up, it is really pretty sobering that despite all the excitement and advances with PD-1 and PDL-1s in right now the most important setting and indication where they seem to be active in terms of the number of patients which is first line lung cancer. As we all know the data from the PD-1s has been quite disappointing. And even with OPDIVO, if you actually look at the data, it by far fails to meet the bar of KEYTRUDA.","So right now, unbelievably enough, there is only one, in our opinion, clear leader in the first line lung cancer space, and what we try to explain is that we've designed a series of studies which will test whether our molecule is in that class, is in the class of KEYTRUDA. We do believe, as you said, that we have a great technology that has succeeded in the past in delivering some of the first and best-in-class molecules, this VelocImmune technology.","And on top of that, as we've already described, we have this very impressive and comforting data in the squamous cell carcinoma indication which has some of the best data ever described in solid tumor settings for a PD-1 agent. So these combined to give us a lot of hope that our first-line cancer studies are going to deliver on the order of KEYTRUDA -like data which would make us basically a real major competitor in this space. So we are very excited about the opportunity and we're very hopeful that the molecule in the studies will come through.","In terms of your second question about fasinumab, as you already pointed out, there's a \u2013 this is a high-risk, high-reward program as we've described in the past. It's pretty well-demonstrated that the molecule has activity, but it also has certain side effects. It's not osteonecrosis, it's more defined as rapid progression of the osteoarthritis in some patients. And this is something that obviously has been seen with this class and with our molecule before. And so what the independent data monitoring committee did was they obviously took an analysis to look at the benefit and the risk that is the therapeutic benefit compared to their analysis of the risk coming from these rapidly progressive osteoarthritis events and they decided that we should terminate the upper two doses and continue with the two lower doses. And so we are planning to modify the studies consistent with their recommendations.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","I just wanted to add, Ying, that I think George said it and I said it, but it's worth saying again is that the potential for combinations with our PD-1 based upon bispecifics that you're aware of as well as a new class of bispecifics that we'll talk to you about later this year in our proprietary models is pretty exciting for us. So it's not only the monotherapy, although clearly the monotherapy is a huge opportunity as evidenced by the $12 billion run rate, the majority of which is a single immune-oncology agent with or without chemotherapy in lung cancer.","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Right. And when we use the term monotherapy, which is sort of \u2013 we're almost bundling monotherapy and traditional therapies like chemotherapy because as we described, many of our studies are in combination with existing therapies, and as Len said, we also have these new combination approaches that we're excited about.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Next we have Carter Gould from UBS.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Obviously a lot of focus on Dupixent after your partner reported last week. Can you maybe just give a little more detail on the commercial dynamics you're seeing, namely persistence on therapy. And I guess for Marion, how we should be thinking about IMS data as being predictive of the trends you're seeing in the market landscape. Thank you.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Right. I'll let Marion answer that question. But I \u2013 we don't get as bogged down as you do in trying to predict the exact quarter sales. We're looking at the metrics as Marion said, is how is the launch going. And I'll let Marion reinforce her earlier comments.","Marion McCourt - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure. So let me take, Carter, the persistence question first. And as I mentioned in two pieces, both very, very encouraging signs on persistence. First is that we see patients 90% of the time get refills after their first script. So that was one metric that I gave. The second one I gave was looking over a longer period of time of persistence and that was over the course of time since launch, patients on therapy over that duration at 83%. So two metrics, both quite encouraging.","I think the other comment is you're talking about some of the other data metrics that we would say is that what we're seeing in terms of demand and performance on the product is including the NBRx profile is very consistent with our long-term growth projections for Dupixent. So, we're on pace, as I mentioned with the NBRx number or new patient scripts on a weekly basis at about 500 per week through the quarter. That's 2,000 new patients a month getting their prescriptions filled for Dupixent. And we see that as a very strong growth signal. Certainly we're going to work to continue to advance performance but we see that demand going very well at this stage.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next...","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And we should just reinforce that once you try to look across other agents at what the persistent rates are over the course of the year, these numbers are really quite impressive and speak to the need and how satisfied patients are with the treatment.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","We have Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe as we think about your immuno-oncology strategy, when might we see some initial combo data? And really, is the big push here on the bispecifics or are you looking at other approaches as well? And then the second part of that is you guys have had a somewhat disruptive approach to pricing of your drugs. Is that how we should think about cemiplimab as well? Thanks.","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Well, maybe George will take the first part and Len will take the second part. But \u2013 so this is George. Yeah. We're obviously very excited about this sort of dual opportunity of cemiplimab and of our bispecifics, both individually and in combination. But as you also just pointed out, with cemiplimab we have just with that a sort of dual approach of combining with a series of more traditional agents as I described, traditional chemo therapeutic agents, other checkpoint inhibitors including others and our own, as well as things, for example, that we're collaborating with other people such as certain types of vaccines and so forth.","So that's one whole set of combination opportunities with cemiplimab. We have the bispecifics, which by themselves can be used individually or with existing therapies, but also combinations with the cemiplimab. And we, I think, have already announced that we have already started dosing patients with our first bispecific and PD-1 in combination and we hope that we'll be seeing data and be reporting on that as well. But the very exciting aspect of this for us is every one of our bispecifics can be evaluated individually but also we believe in combination with cemiplimab and other checkpoint inhibitors as well as with other agents and as well as with this new class of bispecifics that Len mentioned we will be disclosing over the course of the year.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And in terms of price, Terrence, obviously and if you're thinking about trying to model our opportunity both in CSCC and how we'll compete elsewhere, first of all, I might just say in CSCC you have to think about the fact that there's a reasonable sized patient population, although it's hard to know because there hasn't been an approved treatment for advanced disease, and also you should go back and look at our data. We can remind you later, that we have very long duration of therapy and many patients still on drug as of our last update. So that plays. In terms of the actual price, we like to price towards value. These are, I think, high value molecules to patients and we'll let you know what we come out with when we do.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","We have Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much and, Len, the question is, could you address some of what are now shibboleths (52:22) Regeneron? Things like no long-term guidance, no buybacks or dividends, no price increases, no product acquisitions. Given the fact that the company has lost more than 40% of its value over the last year, are you and the board reconsidering any of these sacred cows?","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So let's take them one by one. I'm not sure I've got to write them down. You said product acquisitions, what else did you say, Geoff?","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Price increases, buybacks or dividends, long-term guidance.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Slow down, slow down. I can't write that fast. Price increases, buybacks, go ahead.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Buybacks or dividends, long-term guidance.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Guidance. Okay. So let's take the easy ones. We have 6 approved drugs and 17 in the clinic. We have what I think of as one of the most prolific R&D engines in the industry. And we are not nearly as desperate as other companies are to fill up gaps in the pipeline, so it would be sort of senseless for us to compete in the market where people are dramatically over-paying and we have a tremendous pipeline of our own. But it doesn't mean we don't want to work with other companies. You're going to hear more opportunities for us to leverage the capabilities that we do with what other companies can do in some very exciting spaces we're working on. But in terms of just going out and buying a Phase 3 molecule that treats Parkinson's disease by some small molecule mechanism, that would just make no sense for us.","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And I think as Len mentioned, Intellia and Alnylam are very interesting examples, where we are, as Len said, leveraging our internal research capabilities with something that somebody else brings to the table, which we believe is very synergistic.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","In terms of guidance, we try and give guidance where the knowledge is asymmetric. But we don't think, Geoff, to be frank, it's our job to try and guess things that we don't have any more information about than you guys have, and we also don't want to spend a lot of our internal team's intellectual horsepower trying to guess what a given number of patients will be. That's kind of why you guys are overpaid. You are supposed to make those guesses.","So we don't have \u2013 Bob gives a lot of guidance on things that you don't have information about and there was a ton of it in there. But to give you product guidance and make guesses, I don't know. We don't want to get in that game, because that's not what really the game that the board is in or the company.","In terms of price increases, this is not an environment where you can take price increases easily. We have felt that growing by price increases is not our strategy. We'd rather grow by fundamental increase in the penetration or diversity of patients that can be on our approved drugs or bring new drugs to market, taking small price increases consistent with inflation or medical inflation is perfectly reasonable. But we don't want to be participating in the undoing of the industry, where there's so much emanate (55:37) towards us, and there's so much potential for bad government action, egregious price increases are not a strategy we think are worth the points.","In terms of capital allocation, I can assure you that the financial team and the board looks at this on a regular basis. We're well aware of all the data. We're data-driven. We know what you can do with dividends, with buybacks, with acquisitions, with bolt-on acquisitions, with internal discovery, with partner discovery, keep money in the bank. We've got them all, and we study them all, and I think we'll tell you about them as our strategy does or does not evolve. I think that covers your list, Geoff.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Next question please, operator.","Operator","We have Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, if I could just ask a couple of the underlying trends on EYLEA for the quarter, you talked about DME growth again. I mean, can you just describe how you see that market growing and is that market's growing faster or slower than the AMD market still? And then, just talk a little bit about \u2013 I mean, in past first quarters, you've seen some underlying dynamics either from patients finding it harder to get to the doctor, or things like that due to weather, maybe you could just describe if there were any of those issues in the quarter. Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","It's always hard to know. We had a good quarter with EYLEA despite the fact that there was some transient concern about intraocular inflammation, which based on our monitoring now, has returned to background levels, and we don't seem to have had any significant impact on the business there, which we're pleased with.","The product grew year-over-year. I don't think we've really yet made the big push in diabetes, because we have a good approval for DME, and patients do kind of get to the doctor, although there are a lot that don't. But we're looking to get the broader indication for diabetic retinopathy, and then in constant with that have a much bigger push to get patients to the doctor hopefully to have their diabetic eye disease treated.","We do see \u2013 so we haven't seen a big growth yet in diabetes, but we still see it. I should emphasize that while I said that AMD is well-penetrated, it's still growing by demographics. We're seeing an overall growth in the AMD market, because more and more people are living longer and so there are more and more people getting age-related macular degeneration. Okay.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question please.","Operator","We have Phil Nadeau from Cowen and Company.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe to follow up on those questions, two longer-term questions on EYLEA. The first on non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. In theory, it's a large market, although our consultants said it may be hard to get anti-VEGF adoption there. So can you talk about your plans to change the standard of care, in particular in a patient population within that larger group that would be most susceptible to anti-VEGF therapy? And then, second, on the competition you alluded to in your prepared remarks, we did see some new data from brolucizumab this week. Could you give us your perspectives on that data? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, so in the diabetic retinopathy, the needle mover from the people we talk to will be not simply or only the important thing of improving the diabetic retinopathy, but to prevent the onset of vision threatening diabetic retinopathy, the vision threatening complications, the sight threatening. And we're going to be able to look at those data from a PANORAMA study later this year. But I do think that this is like any other market, I mean, if you go back, I remember our Chairman, Roy Vagelos, told me that when he launched the first statin, the cardiologists told him, well, there's no real need for a statin, we can control all that with diet and exercise and that was the prevailing view.","So there is work that you have to do to change the practice of medicine based on data. It doesn't happen overnight. It takes really strong data, a really strong commercial effort. We're really excited how Marion has integrated so quickly into the organization and she's taken that on as something that's really important to us. So we're looking forward, over the years to come, to have success in that area.","There was a recent approval by the FDA by a small company of a untethered device. That is a device that could diagnose diabetic retinopathy and whether or not you should urgently see a retinal specialist merely by \u2013 that could sit in a drug store, it could sit in your general practice office, it could sit in your ophthalmologist, it could sit with the optometrist. And it's been approved, it doesn't need a doctor to administer. You just take a non-dilated picture of the retina. And so \u2013 and they've found sort of striking data, which the FDA approved the drug on. And I think more to come about how underdiagnosed this condition is when you have a powerful and broad screening. And there were a lot of other efforts just to do the exact same thing in terms of machine learning or, as you call it, artificial intelligence. So we think that when you have a treatment and we have the broad label then you can start to push at the front end of the people who could really benefit and I think there's a lot of them.","In terms of the RTH data, didn't see very much new there. What I heard about was that I think it was in the mid-80s percentile of those people who went on to the 12-week data, could stay on the 12-week data. But at the end of the day, you can slice this data up any which way you want. You're still getting about 50-odd-percent of people who can go to every 12-weeks. And based on \u2013 and they haven't identified people because if you look carefully, the people who don't succeed at 12-weeks are the ones that lost, I think, a significant amount of vision was one of the criteria.","So I think we have to see how all that plays out, what the label really looks like, and certainly, we wish them luck because we do \u2013 because I know they're listening to what I say, so good luck to them. But I also would say that if something comes along that can help patients, that's okay with us. EYLEA is a high bar and people should be chasing that, we hope, for years to come. George wanted to add one thing.","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, I wanted to expand on one thing that Len said. And, Phil, you referred to the fact that in some ways doctors are perhaps a little cautious about treating patients with diabetic retinopathy and they have views on that. I think one key aspect of the studies that we're undertaking right now, sort of like what we did with Praluent, is to define the patients who are at the highest risk of vision threatening complications. So you might imagine that everybody, patients and doctors, would be much more interested in using a very effective preventative therapy if they knew they had a very, very high risk of having a catastrophic event that could cost them their vision. So part of the aspect of our studies is not only to show that we're effective at preventing these events, but identifying the segment of the population that is at highest need for needing such a therapy because they're at such a high risk.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Next we have Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to ask about how we should be thinking with regards to the reimbursement landscape with PCSK9s going forward. Should we expect more exclusive contracts with payers similar to the one announced with ESI? And maybe more broadly along those lines, are you getting the sense of how payers are thinking about the best way to define a high-risk patient population that would benefit most from Praluent? Thanks","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","This is obviously a highly competitive space. There's another PCSK9 inhibitor out there, obviously. So we can't sort of peel back too much, but we are excited about the fact that there is a possibility to improve the access. Make it easy for patients to get the prescription that the doctor writes, that it will be approved and make it so the patients can afford it.","We also, the third pillar of all that which I don't want to get lost, is we want to make sure that there's some \u2013 a profit left for the innovators on both sides, so that we don't wind up racing to a place where there's no profit. So it's a delicate compelling marketplace. That's about all we with can say out there but we're working hard to get access and affordability.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question please. And also in the interest of time this will be our last question. But we will be available to answer questions following this call so please send me an e-mail and we'll set some time up for a follow-up call.","Operator","We have Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys.","Manisha A.

My name is Kevin and I will be your coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Michael Aberman, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations for Regeneron. Please proceed, Dr. Aberman.","Michael Aberman","Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' First Quarter 2012 Conference Call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under the Events and Presentations page for 30 days. Joining me on the call today is Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; George Yancopoulos, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Regeneron Research Labs; Murray Goldberg, Chief Financial Officer; and Robert Terifay, Senior Vice President, Commercial. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. ","I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call that are not historical in nature may be forward-looking statements about Regeneron and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events and our actual results may differ materially. Such remarks may include but are not limited to those related to Regeneron and its products and business, sales forecast, financial forecast, development programs, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, intellectual property and competition. All of which involve a number of risks and uncertainties. ","A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC, including its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, which we filed this morning. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise unless required by law. GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed on today's call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP are available in our financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website. Once our call concludes, the IR team will be available to answer further questions. ","With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Leonard Schleifer.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Thanks, Michael, and good morning to everyone. Before I get to the meat of today's call, on the occasion of today's milestone for Regeneron, I would like to say a few thank yous, as surely many thanks are owed to many, many people. I offer these thanks on behalf of both me and my good friend George Yancopolous. As most of you know, George is the lead inventor of EYLEA and is in fact responsible for our entire pipeline of technologies. ","George and I embarked on this professional partnership and exciting journal -- journey together many years ago with the firm belief that good science would lead to good drugs. I believe we were right although predicting the exact timing of things, as you well know, can be rather challenging. In any case, we owe great depths of gratitude to all of our colleagues over the years who have dedicated themselves to bringing drugs to patients, as well as the thousands and thousands of patients who have volunteered for our clinical studies. ","We also are greatly indebted to the physicians in the medical community for helping us with all of our clinical trials and for the partnership we have had with the FDA as we navigated the development process. Finally, thanks to our partners and all of our shareholders who have believed in us and help finance our efforts. ","Now back to business. Today, we are happy to report a very successful quarter and a true milestone for Regeneron as it was the first quarter in our history that we achieved profitability, both on the GAAP and non-GAAP basis as a result of product sales. ","This achievement was driven by the continued strong launch of EYLEA in the United States. EYLEA's unique product profile, as the only FDA-approved treatment for wet AMD labeled for less than monthly dosing that showed clinically equivalent efficacy to monthly ranibizumab, continues to resonate with patients and their caregivers, physicians and payers. ","As a result of this strong launch and first quarter sales of $124 million, we are increasing our full year U.S. EYLEA net sales forecast to between $500 million and $550 million. Meeting of this forecast would place EYLEA among the most successful biotech product launches. Given this new forecast, as well as our strong profit margin and the terms of our agreements with collaborators who fund a large portion of our R&D expenses, we also now believe we will achieve non-GAAP profitability for the full year 2012. ","Before we get into some of the details behind the launch and our updated forecast, let me highlight some other important accomplishments during this quarter. Turning first to our late-stage assets, the FDA recently granted priority review status to the ZALTRAP BLA for the treatment of previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer. We now expect 3 FDA decisions for our drug candidates in the second half of this year. ARCALYST for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering therapy, which has a PDUFA date of July 30; ZALTRAP for the treatment of previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer, which has a PDUFA date of August 4; and EYLEA for the treatment of central retinal vein occlusion or CRVO, which has a PDUFA date of September 23. Our regulatory department has never been busier with the FDA on these applications, as well as preparing for the upcoming ARCALYST Advisory Committee Meeting scheduled for May 8. ","Turning to our antibody pipeline, we have seen significant interest in the scientific and clinical communities in our potentially first-in-class lipid-lowering PCSK9 antibody, REGN727, which is part of our collaboration with Sanofi. During the quarter, we saw a Phase I data published in the New England Journal of Medicine and Phase II data presented at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology, including during a late-breaking clinical trial session. The data, which showed up to a 72% decrease in LDL cholesterol or bad cholesterol when adding REGN727 on top of existing statin therapy was encouraging to us and to many of the expert cardiologists who are seeing the data for the first time. ","This high level of interest was also evident in the broad media coverage of these publications and presentations. As we have discussed previously, Regeneron 727 demonstrated acceptable profile in these studies, acceptable safety profile in these studies. Now there's much -- still much work to be done in our anti-PCSK9 program as the data we presented were from Phase II trials. As such, we and Sanofi look forward to initiating our full Phase III program to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of 727 later in the second quarter, following feedback from U.S. and European regulatory agencies.","Another positive development from our pipeline this quarter was the FDA Advisory Committee's unanimous vote in favor of the ongoing development of anti-nerve growth factor, anti-NGF, agents in pain associated with osteoarthritis. We believe it could be an important role for these agents in the treatment of this pain and we hope to be able to provide an update on the development plans for our NGF antibody REGN475 in the next few months after discussions with the FDA. ","As a reminder, Regeneron now has sole rights to REGN475 with a royalty obligation to Sanofi. With that, let me turn back to the EYLEA launch, which, we can report, continues to exceed expectations. Net product sales to our distributors for the first quarter 2012 were $124 million, which includes a modest increase in our distributors' inventory of about $10 million. This implies approximately $114 million in sales to healthcare providers. ","Market research suggests the strong launch have been driven by several factors, including the high market awareness of EYLEA; physician and patient's belief in the value of achieving clinically equivalent efficacy to monthly ranibizumab, with less than monthly dosing; and their experience with EYLEA since the launch; also, the favorable perception of Regeneron as a pharmaceutical company; the belief that we are a different kind of company; that we listen to and deal openly and candidly, that the patient physician and payer communities is an important factor. ","As we've reported before, another important factor contributing to the strong EYLEA uptake is that we are penetrating both the community of patients who are initiating therapy for wet AMD for the first time, as well as patients switching from existing therapies, as I will describe in a moment. ","So let me turn to some of the metrics that we can share about the launch. Our market research has been relatively consistent with what we have seen from survey work done outside the company, such as the never-ending surveys reported by the investment community. ","Specifically, our survey data suggested approximately 40% of EYLEA patients are new to anti-VEGF therapy. This means that about 60% of EYLEA use has come from patients switching from other therapies. Importantly, prior Lucentis users account for the majority of switches at roughly 60%, but prior Avastin users are an important contributor at roughly 40%. ","The most common reason physicians report for why they switch patients to EYLEA are continued retinal edema despite treatment with Lucentis or Avastin and non-optic [ph] response to existing therapy and a desire to have less frequent injections and\/or office visits. In terms of our field force, we've been very pleased by the effectiveness and the reception they have received from the retinal community. ","As expected at this stage in the launch, we have seen rapid growth in the number of retinal practices ordering EYLEA and our distributors have now shipped EYLEA to more than 70% of the practices known to us to have used Lucentis in the past. While the launch is going well, reimbursement concerns remain an issue for many doctors, particularly while we wait for a permanent J code, which we expect to be assigned in January 2013. Meanwhile, extended terms are available to physicians' offices to allow ample time for them to receive reimbursement for EYLEA. ","We also expect reimbursement concerns to be alleviated by 2 recent developments. Since April 1, hospital outpatient facilities have been able to use a temporary C code for EYLEA, which automates the reimbursement process for this group of users. In addition, EYLEA has been assigned a Q code that goes into effect this July. A Q code is a temporary but specific code for EYLEA that can be used more broadly than the C code and which results in automated reimbursement. We believe that this will help streamline reimbursement process as we await the assignment of a permanent J code. ","As we've said before, we have seen reimbursement for more of the regional Medicaid carriers, secondary and supplemental insurers, commercial payers and private payers. We have also seen broad adoption by hospital formularies. ","As indicated in EYLEA we are increasing our full year 2012 EYLEA net sales forecast from $250 million to $300 million to $500 million to $550 million. So let me spend a few moments on this updated forecast. ","There 3 types of patients that will influence our continued sales and growth. The first is the new patients who are na\u00efve to therapy, the second is new patients to EYLEA who are switching from existing anti-VEGF therapy and the third are patients who have already been started on EYLEA or continuing patients. For the first group, new na\u00efve patients, we expect continued growth as some practices who have only started trying EYLEA expand into more patients, as well as continued growth in the early adopters. Here, reimbursement issues will remain a tempering factor. ","For the second group, new switches, we expect continued growth but there is some uncertainty as to how big this patient population is. For both of these new patient groups, given a 70% level of penetration of physicians' offices, we can also now expect a slowdown in the rate of new account growth. ","Lastly, other patients who are already switched and started on EYLEA. Our market research suggests that the majority of these patients will be treated with 3 initial monthly doses followed by less frequent dosing regimens. ","On the one hand, continued patient use of EYLEA provides an ongoing source of revenue but the switch to last week of dosing and potential discontinuations may moderate growth. The bottom line is that it's important to remember that EYLEA has been on the market for less than 6 months so we are really still in the early stages of this product launch with many uncertainties. In the first quarter, our surveys suggest that EYLEA is capturing approximately 10% of the anti-VEGF market for wet AMD, including off-label Avastin, which accounts for approximately 60% of that market. ","We believe there is room for continued growth as many of the practices that have ordered EYLEA have ordered only limited quantities and could increase the use as they gain experience and are reassured that there will be no major reimbursement issues. That said, there are factors, such as the switch by existing EYLEA users to less frequent dosing regimens, as I discussed a moment ago, that could moderate growth. ","Beyond the wet AMD launch in the United States, later this year, we expect an FDA decision on our supplemental BLA to expand the use of EYLEA to CRVO and by the healthcare plans to launch EYLEA into international market. ","With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Murray Goldberg, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our first quarter financial results.","Murray A. Goldberg","Thank you, Len, and good morning, everyone. As you might imagine, I'm particularly pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of 2012, the first time in Regeneron's history that we reported a profitable quarter on an operational basis. ","Total revenues in the first quarter were $232 million. This includes $124 million of EYLEA net sales and $4 million of ARCALYST sales. The gross-to-net adjustment for EYLEA sales were similar to last quarter at approximately 7.4%. Sanofi collaboration revenue was $85 million for the first quarter of 2012, which was similar to the first quarter last year. This item includes Sanofi's reimbursement to us for antibody and ZALTRAP R&D expenses that we incurred, offset by approximately $4 million in pre-commercialization expenses for ZALTRAP that Sanofi incurred and that we reimbursed them for. Our reimbursement at Sanofi is accounted for as contra revenue. ","Looking forward in 2012, this line will include growing pre-commercial expenses for ZALTRAP in preparation for a potential launch in a variety of countries at the end of this year and next year. Our share of these pre-commercialization expenses will potentially be at least partially offset by an approval milestone. Bayer collaboration revenue was about $12.5 million in the first quarter, and represents Bayer's cost sharing of some of the EYLEA development expenses that we incurred. ","As EYLEA launches globally, this item will also include our share of the profits and losses from commercialization outside the United States, as well as potential approval and sales milestones from Bayer. Cost of goods sold in the first quarter was $12.3 million or about 9.6% of net product sales. This includes an accrual for royalties payable to Genentech under the license and partial settlement agreement that we signed in December relating to ophthalmic sales of EYLEA in the United States. ","Non-GAAP research and development expense was $128 million for the first quarter this year compared to $122 million in the first quarter last year. The increase in R&D spending was driven primarily by higher R&D headcount and activities, partly related to our antibody collaboration with Sanofi and partly related to our own internal R&D efforts. To provide some perspective on the amount that we spend on internal R&D program expense, which excludes non-cash compensation expense, Sanofi reimbursed $84 million of this expense and Bayer reimbursed another $10 million. ","So our first quarter net R&D expense was $34 million this year compared to $31 million last year, that almost 75% of our R&D expense in the first quarter was reimbursed by our collaborators. A similar percentage was reimbursed for all of 2011. Our net R&D expense primarily represents spending on ARCALYST, on antibodies not in the Sanofi collaboration, some EYLEA clinical costs and investment in new discovery technologies. We anticipate that this net R&D expense will trend upward through the remainder of 2012 and could increase even faster as antibodies outside the Sanofi collaboration, such as our NGF antibody Regeneron 475, moved into advanced stage clinical trials. ","Let me also point out that not reflected in the $128 million total R&D number is the considerable spending by Sanofi and Bayer on our collaboration programs that does not flow through our income statement. In 2011, that averaged around $50 million a quarter. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $46 million for the first quarter. These SG&A expenses include the fully burdened cost of the EYLEA field force. While we do not expect EYLEA selling expenses to vary significantly quarter-to-quarter this year, in the event that ARCALYST is approved for the prevention of gout flares and patients initiating of uric acid lowering therapy, we anticipate that SG&A expenses could increase by $20 million to $30 million in the second half of the year to support the launch. This would bring full year non-GAAP SG&A to $180 million to $210 million, with the higher end of that guidance reflecting the potential ARCALYST launch in gout. ","As a reminder, non-GAAP R&D and non-GAAP SG&A expenses exclude non-cash share-based compensation expense. Turning with some delight to the bottom line, we reported non-GAAP net income of $40 million or $0.37 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2012. Non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense and non-cash interest expense related to our convertible notes. On a GAAP basis, we also had a profitable quarter with net income of $12 million or $0.11 per diluted share. ","As you will note, despite turning profitable for the quarter, we have not provided for a tax liability as we have released a portion of our full valuation allowance against our large balance of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits. When we transition into showing consistent profits, we will provide more guidance on the accounting treatment of these NOLs and tax credits. ","On a cash basis, we do not anticipate that we will have a cash tax liability for at least several years. Our non-GAAP fully diluted average shares outstanding in the first quarter were approximately 112.5 million shares and include about 14 million shares attributable to stock options and restricted stock that are accounted for using the treasury methods and about 5 million shares associated with our convertible notes that are accounted for using the if-converted method. ","With that, I'll turn the call back to Michael.","Michael Aberman","Thank you, Murray. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call to Q&A. I would like to give as many people a chance to ask questions as possible. [Operator Instructions] Our team will be available in our office after the call for follow-up questions. Thank you, and Kevin, if you could now please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess, the key question I have for you is you talked a lot about the 70% penetration into new physician offices. But it really implies that you're really being used in a fraction of patients. Can you give some color on where you think EYLEA is being used amongst the doctor community? Is it in more large practices or the community practice is starting to use EYLEA more? And where do you think the growth will come from?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Bob, do you want to comment on that?","Robert J. Terifay","So we're actually seeing a very good distribution of EYLEA use in all types of practices. The large volume practices, the academic practices, as well as a number of practices who don't broadly use Lucentis who have used and have switched from Avastin to EYLEA. So we're very encouraged about the use. As Len pointed out, what we're still waiting to see, and reimbursement is one of those hurdles, physicians are holding back a little bit on how much EYLEA they use, but we do have very good penetration in all segments.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Kantor with RBC Capital Markets.","Jason Kantor - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you give us some sense of how you're thinking now that you've done this AMD launch, how you're thinking about the CRVO launch and how much is that is built into your guidance and how you're thinking about that relative to the rapid uptake in AMD?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Right. So just on the guidance, our guidance, I think, should be viewed, for the most part, as our wet AMD guidance. Bob, do you want to comment about the launch of CRVO, if we were to get it labeled this year?","Robert J. Terifay","The CRVO is a much smaller market than the wet AMD market. It's -- about 30,000 patients in the United States have central retinal vein occlusion. The length of treatment of patients with CRVO could be much shorter. Some patients stop treatment at 6 months, although recent studies have shown that there are patients who will continue to benefit from anti-VEGF therapy for over a year. So we see the CRVO opportunity as an opportunity to broaden the label, to have the product more firmly established on formularies. Clearly the product will offer benefit to those patients who need it in CRVO but the real market opportunity will continue to be wet AMD.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Raymond of Robert Baird.","Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just another question on the launch, and maybe launch. Just curious if you have any visibility into the dynamics of patients transitioning from the Q4 week dosing, the loading dose, to the Q8 week dose. I'm sure you know some have -- worried about sort of hitting a wall of sorts. Our checks kind of indicate that maybe that's already started and maybe well underway. I wonder if you could maybe give some color as to what you're seeing.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes. We don't have patient level information on dosing. From surveys, what we hear is that the majority of docs use the 3 loading doses and then switch over to some less frequent regimen. Many will use the label, we hope, which is Q8 weeks but some continue to use on their own PRN or treat and extend. Obviously, the more difficult patients that start, who -- for example, some who might not have been able to even get by with monthly dosing of the anti-VEGF as some of these patients may stay on monthly dosing of our drug, which is of course also in our label. I think some of our highest utilization is in more rural areas where people have to travel far for their appointments and so the 2 --  the every 8 week dosing is appealing in those types of settings.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Birchenough with BMO Capital.","Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I wanted to drill down on the switch business and I'm just wondering if you have any metrics on what the switch opportunity is, if you think about the type of patients that are being switched, which the feedback we're getting is patients that have persistent fluid on monthly Lucentis and Avastin, and if you think about what's the proportion of the market that could be switched and when you think about what's already been switched. I'm trying to get a sense of what's in front of us in terms of new switch, if you could maybe give us some detail on that.","Leonard S. Schleifer","So maybe I'll ask George to comment on what's known from the data in terms of -- in some of the larger trials where a fraction of people still have fluid at the end of a treatment.","George D. Yancopoulos","So it seems from the large studies that even with monthly Lucentis use, up to 30% to 40% of the patients do not achieve complete anatomical control and correction. And the numbers actually from the CATT are even far higher for Avastin. So it seems as if there are a substantial proportion of the patients who might be able to benefit from a more potent anti-VEGF agent.","Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","If I could, can I follow up on that?","George D. Yancopoulos","Yes, go ahead, Jim.","Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes, I'm just trying to understand these buckets, new na\u00efve, new switch, already switched and just get a sense of what's the new na\u00efve patient pool, what's the new switch patient pool and what's the already switched patient pool, just so we can get a sense of what's in front of us in terms of growth opportunity.","George D. Yancopoulos","Yes, I might tell you that it, yes, in most surveys and most prescription audits, will show that in any given month, about 25% of eyes are new to anti-VEGF therapy. So 75% are continuing on anti-VEGF therapy. It's important that when we think about the switch market, there was a pent-up demand. There were a number of people who were coming in even more frequently than monthly due to edema and those patients were switched to EYLEA very, very quickly. So that's one of the reasons we\u2019re being cautious and not overestimating what the switch potential for the rest of the year is. We're encouraged by the switches we've seen, but there was a group of patients that were waiting for something new. We could tell you that of our switches, 60% of them came from Lucentis and importantly, 40% of them came from Avastin. We anticipate to continue to see switches. We just don't know at what rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just wondering if you can comment at all on monthly trends, March relative to February and then maybe anything in April relative to March that you're seeing, because as I run through the numbers, it seems like you saw a decent acceleration in March and I was wondering if there's anything that's driving that or if that's accurate.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes, we don't -- we're not able to comment on week-to-week, month-to-month beyond the quarter trends. We have to leave up that -- you'll have to figure that one out on -- by yourself. Even if we have data available for you today, the reliability early in the launch of all of this is -- you see fluctuations and I don't want to comment on what we're actually seeing, other than to say that I think we've taken a pretty careful look and try to model this in a number of different ways. We try to take into account the switches, the dosing reductions, we've tried to take into account discontinuations, share of new patients, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And you can build very complicated models or we can -- or you try to make more simplified models. But however we do it, we think that our guidance of $500 million to $550 million is the best bet one can make with the data we have on hand.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.","Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I think I'll switch over to one of the development projects. Can you talk about why you think Sanofi would've elected not to codevelop 475 right ahead of the Adcom?","Leonard S. Schleifer","I think that's probably a question that's better directed to Sanofi. I wouldn't presume to speak for them.","Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And the other 2 antibodies that you have in development that they have also elected not to codevelop, was there -- do you have plans to continue with those or are the data just somewhat underwhelming?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes. So none of the discontinuations, as far as I recall, have anything to do with a safety concern or certainly our view of the data. They have a very deep and broad pipeline. They're going to make decisions on what they want to develop and what they don't want to develop, what it fits into what they're up to. Nobody gets all these decisions right. Obviously, I think Regeneron is in a strong enough position with its pipeline, with more than 10 different things ongoing and multiple things going in the clinic each year that we certainly don't have to continue anything that George and his team feel don't make the cut, either in terms of likelihood of technical success, safety concerns or market opportunity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Biren Amin of Jefferies.","Biren Amin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Is your assessment that doctors are prescribing EYLEA in Medicare patients only with supplemental insurance? And would co-pay assistance by the company potentially help increase penetration in patients without supplemental insurance?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Bob, you can comment on that, but I'll say that direct co-pay insurance to Medicare patients is something that we cannot do. Bob?","Robert J. Terifay","So we have actually -- we've seen physicians use the product in all market segments, Medicare without a supplement, Medicare with a supplement, and we have seen significant commercial payer uptake. There are additional delays in reimbursement, often that is paperwork that's not filled out appropriately, there's also an ongoing, which in the Medicare computer database, which delays payments. But we're seeing use across-the-board. In terms of co-pay, as Len pointed out, anyone that is on a government pay program, it is not -- the companies cannot provide direct co-pay assistance. We can refer those patients to foundations, independent foundations who can help them. The company does work nongovernmental patients in states where it's allowed have a co-pay assistance program and we have seen some use of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mani Mohindru with ThinkEquity.","Mani Mohindru - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","So I just wanted to drill down a little bit more on practices that were heavy -- that are heavy users of Avastin. What sort of is your ongoing market research and feedback from your field force suggesting in terms of physicians who are traditionally used to using more Avastin? How are they viewing Lucentis -- I'm sorry, EYLEA, now that it's in the market? Are you seeing that they're also using the higher adoption in those practices as well?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes. The interesting thing is that the switch rate from our switch patients is not -- it's less, that's 40% of our switches on Avastin, 60% are Lucentis. But it's not drastically less and especially because of the fact that you would imagine that there are some people, but not as many as you might have thought, are on Avastin because of the financial inability to afford Lucentis or afford the co-pay, but there are many who are on it for other reasons, patient and doctor choices. And obviously, we view those as a potential source for us to grow our market share as doctors get familiar with the product and I think we are seeing that. We are definitely seeing people who we -- primarily Avastin users using switches and new patients with our product. But it's still early going and as I said, our overall penetration in the entire market is only in the approximately 10% range so we have lots of opportunity. But the Avastin market is clearly something. Since it's the majority of the market, it's clearly something we are focusing our attention on. Obviously, early on in the launch, as Bob told you on our last call, we focused on calling on the people who are were using branded therapy and were high users of Lucentis and as I've said, we've penetrated about 70% of those that were known to us. But still, now there's an opportunity to continue to push not only those, but obviously the Avastin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Citigroup.","Kumaraguru Raja","This is Kumar Raja taking in for Yaron Werber. Earlier in the year, you said that approximately 20,000 vials were shipped to the docs in 5 to 6 weeks at the quarter. Can you tell us what this number was in the last [indiscernible] March 31?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes. We're not going to get into the -- I'm sorry, we're not going to get into the weekly or monthly or beginning of the quarter, end of the quarter shipments.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company.","Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Len, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the market dynamics, looking at what Lucentis posted, which was more or less flat sales and then the big growth that you guys put out. But it does seem like the market is growing and it's still kind of unclear where are those patients coming from. Were there patients who were off therapy because Avastin and Lucentis weren't working for them or is it more rural patients who didn't want to go on Avastin and Lucentis are now coming to use EYLEA? Could you talk a little bit about what's going on in the market so much?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Sure. Well, if you do the math, about a quarter of our sales came from people who would switch from Avastin as a loss of the sales to Lucentis and it would reflect a growth of the market. Frankly, we really appreciate your surveys because we find them to be very consonant with our surveys so they serve as a nice check. But all of the work is still -- I just want to emphasize, your work, our work is still survey data and what doctors actually do, what they're going to do, what they did, that doesn\u2019t necessarily come through entirely accurately in the surveys, so we caution everybody, just be careful with that and the most reliable information obviously is the sales number for the quarter that we've given you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham of JPMorgan.","Michael E. Ulz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is actually Mike in for Geoff. Just had a quick question on the EYLEA launch. Just wondering if you guys have a sense of what the discontinuation rate was in 1Q?","George D. Yancopoulos","I don't have that information available, but I'm just guessing -- frankly, I'm guessing that is pretty low because it's -- people usually try it for several months before they make a continuation or discontinuation decision, that's just a guess.","Michael E. Ulz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And then if I can ask a quick follow-up, just curious what percentage of docs have been formerly reimbursed so far in 1Q?","George D. Yancopoulos","We -- I don't have that information available.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Birchenough of BMO Capital Markets.","Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just 2 quick ones, I guess. You mentioned 10% share of anti-VEGF therapy, what's your share of VEGF na\u00efve patients? And then the second part was just, I was wondering if you can give us an update on timelines for the DME Phase III trials.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Right. So the survey -- remember, this is survey responses. It's about the same. The 10% is about the same of new patients and old -- as well as treatment experienced patients. Is that correct, Bob?","Robert J. Terifay","Yes, that's correct.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Okay. So survey -- that's survey data. As far as DME, that's going along very nicely. As I said, our first -- as I've said in the past, our first study is already enrolled, our U.S. study and our ex-U.S. study. I don't have the latest update, but if it's not completely enrolled, it's all but enrolled at this point.","Michael E. Ulz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And just as a follow-up. Do you guys have any insight into what the implications of the recent Medcak [ph] meeting might be for reimbursement for the category and whether there might be some prospect for EYLEA or reimbursement in DME in advance of data? I know you can't promote to it, but any insights on the Medcak panel implications?","Leonard S. Schleifer","So I'll turn it over to Bob to give a little bit of back ground on this Medcak meeting and what implications he thinks it could have for reimbursement.","Robert J. Terifay","Well, first of all, as you pointed out, even if reimbursement was offered, we would not be able to or would not promote EYLEA for DME until we got FDA approval of the indication. The Medcak sort of left things with uncertainty. They went back and they're going to continue to examine the possibilities. There was no clear path decision. So right now, the individual carriers are making decisions as to what they reimburse or don't reimburse in DME. I have -- from what we've been hearing, this is probably going to be continued discussions and no firm conclusions for quite a while.","Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Have you seen any carrier decisions where they didn't include EYLEA reimbursement in DME?","Robert J. Terifay","At the present time, EYLEA is reimbursed by carriers for AMD only.","Operator","Our last question comes from Mani Mohindru with ThinkEquity.","Mani Mohindru - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","Maybe just switching gears here and talking about ARCALYST heading into the panel on May 8. What are your expectations going into the panel in terms of outcomes and in terms of what happens with canakinumab, completely acknowledging that it's not an apples-to-apples comparison, but just wanted to get your comparison.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Right. So I think it would be inappropriate at best to lay down our expectations of how our panel is going to act, that's really their business. I know that George and the team are working hard to prepare for this. And we think we have a strong package and we think our package is distinguished, both in its indication and the -- as well as the contents of our package compared to canakinumab, but I think that the Advisory Committee is coming up in a little over a week, so we'll get to see pretty soon.","Michael Aberman","Okay. Well, thank you, operator and thank you, everyone for participating in today's call. As mentioned earlier, myself and some others from the Investor Relations team will be available for follow-up calls if you have any further questions.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.  We will conduct a question and answer session towards the end of the call.  As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Aberman, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations for Regeneron.  Please proceed, Dr. Aberman.","Dr. Michael Aberman","","Thank you very much.  Good morning and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals\u2019 Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2011 conference call.  An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under Events and Presentations for 30 days.","Joining me on the call today is Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; Murray Goldberg, Chief Financial Officer; and Robert Terifay, Senior Vice President, Commercial.

Once our call concludes, the IR team will be available to answer further questions.","With that, let me turn it over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","Thank you, Michael, and good morning to everyone.  I apologize in advance \u2013 I have a cold and a cough, and there\u2019s been nothing coming from the labs to deal with it.  I want to state that this is our very first quarterly conference call.  Some of you may say it\u2019s about time, but we think now it\u2019s time we start as we transform ourselves into a commercial company to start having these calls.","2011 was truly a transformational year for us.  It was the year when we advanced our vision of becoming not only a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company, or a FIBCO, but also hopefully a long-term biopharmaceutical growth company.  We submitted three BLAs in the U.S. and celebrated the approval and launch of a potentially major product, EYLEA.  We also reported positive Phase II results for two antibodies in our collaboration with Sanofi which are now in Phase III testing.  In a survey conducted by the Journal of Science, we were voted the second best biopharmaceutical company to work for.","As we look forward to 2012, we see another exciting year ahead of us with the continued launch of EYLEA for wet AMD in the U.S. and the potential for FDA approval for our products or product candidates in three new indications:  EYLEA for central retinal vein occlusion, ZALTRAP for previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer, and ARCALYST for the prevention of gout flares.  Beyond the U.S., we see potential approvals and launches across the globe for both EYLEA and ZALTRAP with our partners, Bayer Healthcare and Sanofi.","Turning to the launch of EYLEA for wet AMD in the U.S., we are pleased to report that the launch continues to go extraordinary well and exceeds our expectations on many fronts.  Only a relatively short time ago in early January, we reported that our fourth quarter 2011 EYLEA sales were 24.8 million, which was many-fold higher than most analysts were predicting for the six weeks of sales at that time.  We also provided a preliminary forecast for 2012 EYLEA U.S. sales of 140 to 160 million.  As we said back then, this forecast was based on only six weeks of sales data.","With another six weeks of EYLEA sales results, we have some added confidence in the EYLEA sales trends.  In the first six weeks of 2012, we have seen an increase in weekly demand from a large number of doctors and practices, good repeat ordering trends, favorably reimbursement trends, and positive feedback from physicians.  In fact, we have now shipped over 30,000 vials to physicians offices since our launch in November.","As a result, we are increasing our 2012 EYLEA net sales forecast from 140 to 160 million, up to 250 to 300 million.  To be clear, while we have an additional six weeks of information, the launch is still early and therefore this is significant uncertainty inherent in this forecast.  ","The benefit of less than monthly dosing with efficacy that is clinically equivalent to monthly ranibizumab appears to have resonated strongly with the AMD community, as has our pricing.  We believe that EYLEA with its less frequent dosing offers an attractive new treatment option and provides an important alternative to wet AMD patients and physicians.  With over 30,000 vials shipped to physicians, we are also gathering our post-market safety data to file our first post-marketing safety report with the FDA.  In doing that, we can report that there have been no new adverse events not seen in our clinical trials described in our label or that were inconsistent with the known risks of intravitreal injection.  As many of you know, intravitreal injections with anti-VEGF therapy are associated with known complications, particularly ocular complications such as endophthalmitis and retinal detachments.  ","Post-injection intraocular inflammation, such as sterile endophthalmitis, is a known risk following intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents and triamcinolone, incidence rates that are reported in the literature and can vary from 0.02 to 0.3% and has also been reported to occur in clusters.  There have been approximately 14 cases of adverse events consistent with sterile endophthalmitis and a single isolated case of culture-positive endophthalmitis reported to Regeneron with the use of EYLEA since launch.  This translates to a rate of 0.05% per injection, similar to that which we\u2019ve seen in our clinical trials and within the range that has been reported with other anti-VEGF agents.  Eleven out of the 14 cases of sterile endophthalmitis were reported by a single group practice of six retinal specialists, and 9 of these 11 cases were accounted for by a single physician within the practice.  The cases could not be traced to a single lot of drug nor a single delivery of commercial vials.  Vials from the same lot have been used widely throughout the country, including the other physicians in this practice.  ","Excluding this one practice, the rate of intraocular inflammation reported to Regeneron following EYLEA was approximately 0.01%, or 1 in 10,000.  We are working closely with the practice involved to better understand this cluster and in the process of disseminating the information we have learned to retinal physicians.  We have informed the FDA as per the normal course.  To be clear, we do not believe that the data available indicates that EYLEA is responsible for this cluster.  ","In terms of reimbursement, the comprehensive program that we have rolled out, including EYLEA 4U and extended commercial terms, have been very well received.  We have now received parts of reimbursement from all of the regional Medicare administrative contractors, giving us confidence that payors do understand the important of EYLEA as an option for patients with wet AMD.  We have also seen positive responses in reimbursement from many of the commercial payors.  This is not to say that we don\u2019t have more work to do and do not face continued reimbursement hurdles, until we receive a permanent J code, which is expected in January 2013.","While EYLEA and wet AMD is the focus in the near term, we view EYLEA as a pipeline within a product and are working diligently towards advancing EYLEA in other indications, namely central retinal vein occlusion where we have filed a supplementary BLA and have been granted a PDUFA date of September 23, and diabetic macular edema where we have two Phase III studies that are ongoing, one of which \u2013 the U.S. study \u2013 is fully enrolled.  We plan on initiating shortly a Phase III study in branched retinal vein occlusion.","Our ex-U.S. collaborator, Bayer Healthcare, has submitted regulatory applications for EYLEA in wet AMD in Europe, Japan and other countries, and we expect approval in these territories beginning in the second half of this year.  Bayer has also started a Phase III trial in wet AMD in China in the fourth quarter of 2011.  We believe that this is an important market as evidenced by the fact that in 2010 there were approximately 540,000 newly diagnosed wet AMD patients over the age of 50 in China.","EYLEA is a driver of both near-term and long-term value to the Company and its shareholders, but Regeneron is more than just about EYLEA.  We firmly believe that we have the key elements that are fundamental to achieving sustained long-term growth, namely near and long-term revenue drivers, a pathway to profitability that is driven by the profit margins of our products and product candidates and the attractive terms of our collaboration agreements, a wide, strong and rapidly advancing pipeline, and our solid infrastructure of people and manufacturing capabilities.  ","Our commitment to transform science into medicine is reflected in our robust and rapidly advancing pipeline.  In 2011, we filed a supplemental BLA for ARCALYST for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering therapies and have been granted a PDUFA date of July 30 of this year.  We also initiated UPSURGE, a long-term safety study of ARCALYST.  We, along with our partner Sanofi, have submitted a BLA for ZALTRAP for previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer for which we expect a regulatory decision in 2012.  Sanofi has also filed a marketing application for ZALTRAP in the EU.  ","We also reported positive Phase II data from two late stage antibodies in our pipeline, PCSK9 in hypercholesterolemia, and sarilumab, our anti-IL6 receptor in rheumatoid arthritis and have advanced two new antibodies into the clinic.  Both the PCSK9 and the sarilumab programs are continuing to advance to Phase III this year.  Both programs address significant market opportunities.  We look forward to presenting results from two of the Phase II PCSK9 trials at the upcoming American College of Cardiology meeting where one of the trials will be presented in a later-breaker session.","Our pipeline now has a total of 10 antibodies in the clinic, eight of which are being developed in collaboration with Sanofi.  At Regeneron, we have always believed that good science wins out and the approval of EYLEA was proof of the validity of this belief.  We are well positioned to continue to make important advances in therapeutic areas where there is unmet need and significant commercial opportunity.","With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Murray Goldberg, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our fourth quarter and full-year financial results.  ","Murray Goldberg","Thank you, Len, and good morning to everyone.  This morning we reported total revenues in 2011 of about $446 million for the full year and $123 million for the fourth quarter.  In the fourth quarter, this includes net product sales of $24.8 million for EYLEA and $5 million for ARCALYST.  Our gross to net adjustment for EYLEA was 7.3%.  ","Cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter was $3 million or about 10% of net product sales.  This includes an accrual for royalties payable to Genentech under the license and partial settlement agreement that we signed in December relating to ophthalmic sales of EYLEA in the United States.  From a cash perspective, we\u2019re not obligated to make any payments to Genentech until cumulative U.S. sales reach $400 million; then, we\u2019ll make a one-time payment of $60 million.  Thereafter we\u2019ll pay royalties until May 7 of 2016 of 4.75% on cumulative sales between $400 million and $3 billion, and 5.5% on cumulative sales over $3 billion.  In terms of accounting for these payments, we are accruing royalty expense as we recognize sales of EYLEA using a blended mid-single digit royalty rate that reflects both the $60 million payment and royalty obligations based on our estimate of cumulative sales through May 7, 2016.","Non-GAAP research and development expenses rose 6.4% in 2011 to about $497 million, principally in connection with our Sanofi antibody collaboration.  Non-GAAP SG&A expenses doubled in 2011 to $94 million, primarily related to the commercialization of EYLEA.  We expect further increases in SG&A expenses in 2012 as we prepare for the launch of ARCALYST for the treatment of gout flares.  Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses exclude non-cash share-based compensation expense.  ","We reported a non-GAAP net loss of $34 million or $0.37 per share for the fourth quarter, and a non-GAAP net loss of $161.7 million or $1.79 per share for the full-year 2011.  Non-GAAP net loss excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense and non-cash interest expense related to our convertible senior notes.  ","For the fourth quarter, we reported a GAAP net loss of $53.4 million or $0.58 per share.  For the full-year 2011, we reported a GAAP net loss of $221.8 million or $2.45 per share compared to a net loss of $104.5 million or $1.26 per share for the full-year 2010.  All these per-share values are for both basic and diluted per-share calculations.","In October 2011, we completed a private offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 1 7\/8ths% convertible senior notes.  Following this, we ended 2011 with approximately $811 million in cash and securities.  We believe that financially we\u2019re in a comfortable position to support the required investment, not only for the continued commercial launch of EYLEA but also for the launch of ARCALYST in gout and ZALTRAP in colorectal cancer, as well as for advancing our pipeline and driving us toward profitability.  ","In terms of financial guidance, as you heard from Len, we\u2019re updating our EYLEA net sales forecast from the previous 140 to $160 million to a new range of 250 to $300 million.  We continue to expect COGS for EYLEA, including royalty expense, to be under 10% of net sales.","Thank you, and with that I will turn the call back to Michael.","Dr. Michael Aberman","","Thank you, Murray, and thank you Len.  That concludes our prepared remarks.  We\u2019d now like to open the call to Q&A.  As we\u2019d like to give as many people a chance to ask a question as possible, we request that you limit yourself to one question and our team will be available in our office after the call for follow-up questions.  ","Thank you, and Operator, can you please give instructions and open the call for questions.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you.  Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question, please press star then one on your touchtone telephone.  If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, you may press the pound key.  Once again, if you have a question, please press star then one.","Our first question is from Jim Birchenough of BMO Capital.  Your line is open.","Jim Birchenough \u2013 BMO Capital","Hi guys.  Congratulations on the strong launch.  I just wanted to follow up on the sterile endophthalmitis clustering at that one center.  Is there any working hypothesis on what might be underlying that, and I\u2019m interested in particular if whether these cases were in treatment-naive patients or in switch patients, and maybe just a bit more detail on that would be helpful.  Thanks.","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","Thanks, Jim.  What we know \u2013 there is no firm hypothesis at this point.  We\u2019re looking at everything.  We do know that these patients, we believe they were switched from both Avastin or Lucentis.  The doctors there are experienced, so we\u2019re not sure what\u2019s different.  We do know that they\u2019re using a different needle than the one that we supply.  We don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the issue.  Frankly, these clusters occur and sometimes you just never figure it out, but we\u2019re continuing to do this.  They were also in na\u00efve patients and well.  ","I\u2019d say this and remind you, that when you give 30,000 injections, you expect to get some rate of sterile intraocular inflammation as just a fact of intravitreal injections, and these things tend to occur in clusters.  Sometimes people figure it out.  You\u2019ll see in our letter to the FDA that one person figured out it was\u2014one group figured out it was a needle; another group could never figure out what it was.  So we\u2019re going to continue to try and figure this one out as well.","Jim Birchenough \u2013 BMO Capital","Okay, thanks Len.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from Jason Kantor of RBC Capital Markets.  Your line is open.","Jason Kantor \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thank you and congratulations as well.  Just a couple questions on the launch and how you\u2019re tracking it.  I\u2019m wondering as you\u2019re doing your guidance, what are your assumptions for the drop-off in the rate of injection going from once a month for three months, then dropping off \u2013 are you assuming that there\u2019s a flattening or even a down quarter at any point this year?  And I guess when you\u2019re looking at what patients are coming on the drug, how many of these are switching versus newly diagnosed or na\u00efve patients, and is the market actually growing with the introduction of EYLEA because more people are coming back onto therapy?","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","So Jason, thanks for your question.  You\u2019ve asked all the questions that I\u2019ve been asking.  Unfortunately, I haven\u2019t been getting answers because we don\u2019t really have the answers.  We are seeing a significant amount of switching, so we don\u2019t know for those patients how many doses they\u2019ll actually get.  We are seeing new patients.  We don\u2019t know what the practice pattern will be out there.  We have modeled this in a variety of ways; and as I said, these forecasts have inherent uncertainty in them.  I wish I could give you more specifics; we just don\u2019t have them.","Jason Kantor \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","So you don\u2019t have any sense of what percentage of your patients are coming from\u2014are switching from other drugs, or--?","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","My guess is that the majority are coming from switches, and we\u2019ve heard lots of comments that people are switching even their more difficult patients; but we don\u2019t have any formal data yet.","Jason Kantor \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from Josh Schimmer of Leerink.  Your line is open.","Josh Schimmer \u2013 Leerink Swann","Thanks for taking the question, and congrats as well on the strong launch.  Maybe you can give us a little bit of color in terms of the reimbursement process, what hiccups, if any, are out there, if you\u2019re expecting that to improve over the course of the year, and what feedback you have from specialists in terms of their comfort level at this point with reimbursement and whether that\u2019s going to improve over the year as well.  Thanks.","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","Thanks for your questions, Josh.  I\u2019ll turn that to Bob Terifay, our head of commercial to answer that, please.","Robert Terifay","Yes, so as Len pointed out in the conference call, the Medicare carriers are all now reimbursing for EYLEA, and as you know, the vast majority of these patients are covered by Medicare.  We also do have reports of commercial coverage.  The real concern that offices have before they widely adopt the product is to ensure that not only is the 80% covered by Medicare reimbursed but also that the patient co-pay is covered, and we are seeing the co-pays work through although the insurers that cover co-pays don\u2019t move as quickly to change their systems, so that is resulting in offices going slowly up front to make sure that they\u2019re going to get reimbursed.  That will be the situation over the next several months until all the coverage settles out.  ","As I say, the Medicare carriers are covering.  We are seeing more and more commercial payors coming on board, and thus far the offices are beginning to see the payments come in, so actually things are where we would have expected at this point in a launch with a temporary J code.","Josh Schimmer \u2013 Leerink Swann","And does your guidance assume growing comfort with the reimbursement, or are you just still kind of waiting to see how that goes as well?","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","Our guidance tries to take into account all of those factors, Josh; but as you can imagine, there\u2019s so many unknowns, certainly there is some impediment to this launch because of the lack of a permanent J code and some of these reimbursement issues, co-pays and what have you.  Nevertheless, the launch is going pretty well; but a lot of uncertainties in terms of dose, number of doses, how many people are going to be loaded, will doctors hopefully file the label or will they do a treatment extend or some other paradigm.  We\u2019ve tried our best to model all this, and that\u2019s how we came up with the new guidance for you.","Josh Schimmer \u2013 Leerink Swann","","Got it.  Thanks so much.","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","Thank you.  Our next question is from Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank.  Your line is open.","Alethia Young \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Hey there, it\u2019s Alethia in for Robyn today.  Congrats on the great guidance.  Just a couple questions on the specifics behind EYLEA.  The run rate looks very strong, but how penetrated is the drug in the community versus bigger stars, and just similar, how big a factor was stocking in doctors\u2019 offices and what\u2019s your expectations on that?","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","So maybe I\u2019ll cover the second, and Bob will cover the first.  In terms of stocking, our estimate is that doctors don\u2019t keep much supply at all, perhaps a week at most.  The distributors, maybe one to two weeks at most, I would say.  Now, in terms of the other part of your question in terms of\u2014Bob, you want to deal with that?","Robert Terifay","So in terms of penetration into practices, what we do know is that approximately 38% of practices that buy Lucentis have bought EYLEA, so we have penetrated the offices pretty well and we do see a good distribution of our usage across practices.","Alethia Young \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from Chris Raymond of Robert W. Baird.  Your line is open.","Chris Raymond \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Thanks for taking the question.  I just wanted to make sure I understand the math a little bit here, and I jumped on a little bit late, so if you guys covered this already.  But if I count 30,000 vials that you\u2019ve shipped so far and you back out the last six weeks of 2011, are we talking 20,000 vials through mid-February?  Is that kind of the way the math goes?","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","Yeah, 30 minus 10 is 20, correct.  We\u2019ll go with that.","Chris Raymond \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Thank you.  And so are we thinking that\u2014so your numbers, if you think about gross to net adjustments, et cetera, that you\u2019re talking roughly 34 million for the first six weeks of the year?","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","You know, I\u2019ll let you do the math because I don\u2019t want to be nailed down to specifics, et cetera, et cetera.  But I think you\u2019re basically on the right track.","Chris Raymond \u2013 Robert W. Baird","And was there any dynamic between weekly numbers beginning of the year to, say, mid-February?","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","Yeah, that I can\u2019t tell you; but I can tell you from the first six weeks to the last six weeks, so before the new year to after the new year, there was definitely a pick-up after the new year.  And not surprising because a lot of docs\u2014first of all, it was a brand-new launch, and second of all coverage tends to change for patients around the end of the year, and so a lot of doctors actually waited until after the new year so once they started treatment, they knew their coverage wouldn\u2019t be changing out from underneath the patient.  So we definitely saw an uptick, an increase in the rate from pre-new year to post-new year.","Chris Raymond \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from Steve Byrne from Bank of America.  Your line is open.","Steve Byrne \u2013 Bank of America","Hi.  Len, you mentioned the incidence of wet AMD in China.  When you consider just total prevalence in that country and taking into consideration government and\/or private payor coverage in those larger cities, how would you estimate the market opportunity in China, say versus Europe?","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","Yeah, that\u2019s a great question.  I don\u2019t really know how to do that one, and I haven\u2019t been focused on it because this is something that Bayer takes the rowing oar on for us in our partnership.  While we split the profits 50\/50 outside the United States and we are obviously very interested, they do the mechanics out there and they\u2019re much more in touch with these markets.  We can try and ask them and get back to you, Steve.  I don\u2019t know the answer.","Steve Byrne \u2013 Bank of America","","And just a follow-on to that, do you view that 300 patient study in China as being sufficient for approval?","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","I think also we should defer that question to Bayer.  I\u2019ll find out.  I think that the goal would be that when you combine it with our other studies and you have a Phase III study there, that we would hope we could get approval.","Steve Byrne \u2013 Bank of America","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from Biren Amin of Jefferies.  Your line is open.","Biren Amin \u2013 Jefferies","Yeah, thanks for taking my questions, and congratulations on the quarter.  I was curious \u2013 what dynamics are driving the switching from Lucentis to EYLEA, and also have any Medicare plans denied reimbursement to date that you know of?  Thanks.","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","Right.  So as far as the switching goes, I imagine \u2013 and we\u2019ve been to several of the medical meetings where we\u2019ve heard this \u2013 that the patients who do not get what the doctors consider an adequate response to either Lucentis or Avastin, because there\u2019s been switches to both, are looking to try something that might give the patients an opportunity to do better.  That\u2019s a fairly typical dynamic when a new product comes to the marketplace \u2013 many doctors will look at their difficult to treat or patients they don\u2019t think are doing optimally well.  And I want to say this \u2013 we see this both in Lucentis and Avastin patients, so I would have to say that that dynamic is definitely at play here.","Bob, do you want to address the other question about reimbursement?","Robert Terifay","Yes, in terms of any rejections, in the presence of a miscellaneous J code, there are two potential codes that can be processed on the paperwork for a given insurer, and sometimes if somebody marks down one of them, that particular insurer will not process the paperwork.  So what we have seen is the claims have been sent back to offices and then we work through the appeals process, so it seems to be primarily paperwork-oriented.  We have had no outright rejections of EYLEA at the current time.","Biren Amin \u2013 Jefferies","Fantastic.  Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from Mani Mohindru of ThinkEquity.  Your line is open.","Mani Mohindru \u2013 ThinkEquity","Thanks for taking this call and a great first call.  Quick question \u2013 I saw that you mentioned that you\u2019re expanding into BRVO.  Could you elaborate a little bit more on the opportunity in the BRVO market?","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","Bob, you want to address just in terms of the number of patients and things like that \u2013 approximately, do we have that?","Mani Mohindru \u2013 ThinkEquity","Or on the (inaudible) doing there, and what kind of a market it opens up for you beyond wet AMD and the end CRVO?","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","So I\u2019ll give you a broad\u2014BRVO in terms of market size falls in between the size of the CRVO market and the AMD market.  So it will add a fairly substantial additional market opportunity for EYLEA.  As you mentioned, Lucentis is now approved in branch retinal vein occlusion, and physicians are responding very well to the use of anti-VEGFs in that setting.","Mani Mohindru \u2013 ThinkEquity","Thank you.  I\u2019ll step back in the queue.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from Yaron Werber of Citigroup.  Your line is open.","Yaron Werber \u2013 Citigroup","Yeah, great.  Thanks so much and congrats \u2013 very nice launch.  If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to sneak in two quick questions.  AMD and DME, I\u2019m not sure if you can answer at all, are you seeing any usage yet off-label in that setting?  And then I had a question about expenses, if you don\u2019t mind.","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","As far as we know, the predominant use of the product is in AMD; and it\u2019s cost, we don\u2019t discuss that, we don\u2019t promote it, so we really wouldn\u2019t even be in a position to get feedback if they were using it.  But from what we hear spontaneously at the conferences and what have you, the discussion is centered virtually completely around AMD, as it should.","Now, I didn\u2019t hear your second question?","Yaron Werber \u2013 Citigroup","Depending on what we model\u2014I mean, if you look at the model, the two biggest questions \u2013 number one, what\u2019s EYLEA going to sell, but you\u2019ve given us great color there.  If we can kind of start thinking about what are you going to record from the collaboration revenue with Sanofi and then kind of what your expenses are going to be, but I guess where I\u2019m going with this is there any scenario by which you could be profitable this year?","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","Murray?","Murray Goldberg","Let me first comment in terms of your question about R&D, which is obviously the largest expense item on our income statement.  For the most part at this point, those expenses are related to the antibody collaboration and those are reimbursed by Sanofi, so they\u2019re two big numbers \u2013 the R&D expense and the reimbursement from Sanofi \u2013 but for the most part, they offset to the extent they\u2019re related to the antibody collaboration.","Is there a scenario in which we could be profitable this year?  There is, depending obviously on how big EYLEA\u2019s sales are.  As we pointed out earlier, the gross margin on EYLEA sales is quite high \u2013 90% of so \u2013 and so depending on how large EYLEA\u2019s sales were, we could be there.  But in terms of the forecast sales that we\u2019ve provided today of 250 to $300 million, we do not believe that that would get us there, with the usual caveats of depending on what happens to other R&D expenses that are not reimbursed, et cetera.","Yaron Werber \u2013 Citigroup","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from Geoff Meacham of JP Morgan.  Your line is open.","Geoff Meacham \u2013 JP Morgan ","Hi guys, thanks for taking the question.  Just one on the intraocular inflammation \u2013 I guess it seems like a fairly common A for the class, but it would be helpful to get a history here.  Was this something that you guys picked up from the field on your own, or just something that the FDA saw on the AERS database that kind of prompted you guys?  And I have a quick follow-up.","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","No, we picked this up through reporting\u2014reports that come directly to the Company, and we\u2019ve been in contact with our medical affairs people with this specific practice as we saw this cluster beginning to emerge.  ","You had a second question?","Geoff Meacham \u2013 JP Morgan","Yeah, second question just is anything else that you\u2019ve seen beyond the intraocular inflammation that is different from the Phase III\u2019s, just on the adverse event side?","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","No, there\u2019s no new signals at all, Geoff; and even this intraocular inflammation is something that if you look at the letter we sent off to the Agency, you can see we gave the history there that we\u2019ve seen intraocular inflammation in our trials, and frankly it\u2019s been well reported in the literature; and you talk to experienced retinal physicians, they all tell you they see it on occasion.","Geoff Meacham \u2013 JP Morgan","Fantastic.  Okay, thanks.","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from Phil Nadeau of Cowen & Company.  Your line is open.","Phil Nadeau \u2013 Cowen & Company","Good morning.  Let me add my congratulations on the launch.  Question on 727 and the PCSK9 class.  There\u2019s a potential competitor of yours out there who is saying that the FDA sent letters to all the PCSK9 developers, and this competitors characterizes the letters as basically requiring event studies for approval.  I was curious whether you or Sanofi has received such a letter, and whether you\u2019d characterize it the same way?  Do you think that event studies will be necessary?","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","No, I think you may be mixing up two things.  The only letter that we know has been circulated is some general comments that a preclinical review had largely based on pre-clinical theoretical data of what happens if you lower cholesterol too much, and suggesting some preclinical experiments that we should use to address them; and if we didn\u2019t, that that would be a labeling-type issue. As far as outcome studies, we have not received any communication and I don\u2019t believe any other competitor has said publicly that we\u2019re aware of that they\u2019ve received a communication that an outcome study will be required prior to approval.","As for our working assumption now based on our conversations, but obviously these things can change, our working assumption is that we would have a large Phase III safety and efficacy database, and at the time of our submission and obviously approval, we would be well underway for an outcome study, but that outcome study would not be required prior to approval.  Of course, if the FDA sees something in the safety database that raises questions, then they could switch appropriately so to require an outcome study.  But as of now, we don\u2019t believe that\u2019s going to be necessary prior to the initial approval.","Phil Nadeau \u2013 Cowen & Company","Okay, great.  Thanks for answering my question.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from Jim Birchenough of BMO Capital.","Dr. Michael Aberman","And Operator, this is going to be the last question.","","Jim Birchenough \u2013 BMO Capital","","Hi guys.  Thanks for letting me get back in with a follow-up.  Maybe for Bob, just trying to get an understanding of potentially the tail here, and that would be hospital formularies where you\u2019re trying to get EYLEA on formulary.  It doesn\u2019t happen immediately.  We\u2019re hearing about some centers that are finally getting EYLEA on formulary.  Can you give us a sense of what penetration you have there, Bob?","Robert Terifay","As you pointed out, Jim, we are starting to see the major eye centers come on board with formulary approvals, but several institutions take several months; so I can\u2019t quantify the percent of hospital formularies but I can tell you that some of the major centers have come on within the last few weeks.  ","Jim Birchenough \u2013 BMO Capital","All right, thanks guys.","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","Okay.

(Operator Instructions). As a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I would now turn the call over to your host, Dr. Michael Aberman. You may begin.","Michael Aberman ","","Thank you, operator. Good morning, every and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Fourth Quarter and Year End 2013 Conference Call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under Events and Presentations for 30 days. Joining me on the call today is Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President of Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer; Bob Landry, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bob Terifay, Senior Vice President of Commercial.","After our prepared remarks we'll open the call for Q&A. I would also like to remind you that, remarks made on this call include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, those related to Regeneron and its products and business, sales and expense forecasts, financial forecast, development programs, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, intellectual property and competition.

Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP are available in our financial results press release, which can be accessed at our website at www.regeneron.com. Once our call concludes, the IR team will be available to answer further questions.","With that let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Thank you, Michael, and good morning to everyone. 2013 was another great year for Regeneron. The EYLEA franchise continue to grow steadily in the U.S. and globally our late-stage pipeline made significant progress, we invested in several new R&D initiatives that we hope will position us for the next leg of growth in the future and we expanded our geographic footprint.","Starting with EYLEA fourth quarter 2013 EYLEA U.S. net sales were $402 million and full year 2013 EYLEA U.S. net sales were $1.409 billion, representing a growth of approximately 70% from the full year 2012. EYLEA also performed very well outside of the United States with net sales of $184 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 and full year 2013 ex- U.S. EYLEA sales of $472 million. ","Bayer HealthCare continues to be strong collaborator and we look forward to their continued execution of EYLEA launch outside the U.S. as countries in Europe, Latin America and Asia start contributing in 2014.","As we look forward to the balance of 2014 there are number of potential growth drivers for EYLEA. As we have previously announced, in the U.S. we have granted a PDUFA date of August 18th for the diabetic macular edema or DME indication. Yesterday, we reported positive two year data from the VISTA-DME which George will discuss shortly. We believe that diabetic macular edema could ultimately be a big opportunity as wet AMD based on disease incidence. And we expect our fourth indication Macular Edema following Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion or BRVO to be filed with the FDA by the end of the first quarter.","Taking all these factors into consideration we estimate full year 2014 U.S. EYLEA net sales of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion which represents approximately 25% year-over-year growth. We expect that a significant part of that growth will come towards end of the year following potential U.S. regulatory approval of EYLEA and DME. Our 2014 EYLEA guidance does not include any significant change from the compounding environment.","Based on the continuous strong uptick of EYLEA in ex-U.S. markets where it's been launched so far, and Bayer HealthCare's ongoing rollout of EYLEA around the world plus expansion to new indications, we anticipate continued growth in ex-U.S. Sales in 2014 as well. You will hear more about the commercial performance of EYLEA from Bob Terifay. ","We recognize that EYLEA is a key driver of near-term growth and we are committed to ensuring that this franchise remains strong over the long run as well. To that end, in the first quarter of this year, we initiated clinical development with a combination of EYLEA and an antibody to PlGF receptor in the short co-formulated individual injection and I am happy to report that the first patient has been dosed in this trial. A similar program combining EYLEA with our antibody to ANG2 also in a single individual injection is expected to start by year end. ","Turning to research efforts. We have robust and advancing pipeline that include three late stage antibodies, Alirocumab, our PCSK9 antibody in Phase III trial for lowering LDL cholesterol; Sarilumab, our IL6 receptor antibody in Phase III trials for rheumatoid arthritis and a Phase II study in non-infectious Uveitis; and Dupilumab out IL-4 receptor alpha antibody which blocks both the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways and is in clinical development for asthma atopic dermatitis and nasal polyposis. We anticipate starting a Phase III trial with Dupilumab for atopic dermatitis later in 2013.","With this late stage pipeline and potential new indications for EYLEA, we could have five major regulatory submissions and\/or approvals in the next five years. We have also maintained our focus on our earlier stage pipeline and our R&D initiatives. These include our entry in the field of Immuno-oncology with our bi-specific platform, the commencement of our human genomics initiatives with the launch of Regeneron Genetic Center and our collaboration with Geisinger Health System and our R&D efforts in developing antibody drug conjugates. You will hear more about these programs from George Yancopoulos shortly.","In 2013, we undertook some important measures that further expand Regeneron's footprint in New York as well as globally. We are in the process of enlarging our campus at Tarrytown where two new R&D buildings are under construction. We started the expansion of our manufacturing facilities in Rensselaer and we are in the process of expanding our manufacturing capacities into Ireland and optimizing our global supply chain.","With that let me turn the call over to George Yancopoulos, Regeneron's Chief Scientific Officer who will discuss our pipeline in greater detail. He will be followed by Bob Terifay, our Senior Vice President of Commercial and then Bob Landry our Chief Financial Officer. George?","George D. Yancopoulos","","Thank you Len and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. As Len mentioned, Regeneron's pipeline has been advancing rapidly in the fourth quarter of 2013 witnesses a lot of this progress.","Let me begin with EYLEA. As we have previously reported the FDA has accepted for filing our supplemental BLA for EYLEA in the diabetic macular edema or DME indication and we have been granted a PDUFA date of August 2014. Our ex-U.S. partner Bayer HealthCare has also submitted an application for Marketing Authorization Europe in this indication. EYLEA is now approved for two indications, Wet AMD and Macular Edema Following Central Retinal Vein Occlusion or CRVO in the U.S., EU Japan and other countries around the world. ","In terms of DME, just yesterday we announced the two year results from the Phase III VISTA DME trial. These results showed that the improvement in vision compared to laser photocoagulation therapy that was seen after one year of treatment with EYLEA 2 milligrams does either monthly or every other month after five initial injections was sustained after two years of treatment. ","It is important to emphasize that in this long-term study, EYLEA dose every other month resulted in visual acuity benefit that was similar to that achieved with monthly dosing. It is also worth noting that 43% of the patients in the VISTA study were not treated na\u00efve and in fact had received prior anti-VEGF therapy. ","In this trial EYLEA was generally well tolerated with a similar overall incidence of adverse events, ocular serious adverse events and non-ocular serious systemic adverse events, across the EYLEA treatments groups and the laser control group. The types and incidents of adverse events were consistent with what is expected with VEGF inhibition. Additional details from the three years VISTA DME study can be found on our press release that was issued yesterday. ","All data will be presented in an upcoming medical conference. In the fourth quarter, we reported positive data from the Phase III VIBRANT trial of EYLEA in macular edema following Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion or BRVO. We expect our supplemental BLA for BRVO to be filed by the FDA by the end of the first quarter.","As Len just mentioned our late-stage antibody programs are also progressing well. In terms of alirocumab our antibody for lowering LDL-cholesterol in the fourth quarter we reported positive Phase III results from the ODYSSEY MONO trial which studied alirocumab in the monotherapy study. Additional details from the monostudy will be presented at the upcoming Annual Meeting of the American College of Cardiology. While most of the ODYSSEY program is studying alirocumab dose every other week we have also initiated two studies, ODYSSEY CHOICE I and CHOICE II that explored monthly dosing.","As we have said before, we and Sanofi expect to submit an application for alirocumab for regulatory approval in early 2015 outside the U.S. and later in 2015 in U.S. While this is a very competitive space we believe that our robust [vertically] designed Phase III programs distinguishes us. ","Our Phase III program is designed to assess the primary efficacy endpoint at 24 weeks, many of the ODYSSEY trials will continue in a double blinded fashion through 12, 18 and 24 months thus creating substantive data exposure in terms of patient years.","Specifically the double-blinded exposure active drug in our Phase III ODYSSEY program excluding ODYSSEY outcome will total approximately 5,000 patient years. This patient exposure will allow for robust characterization of the safety and efficacy of alirocumab prior to the outcome study. Our program studies treatment with every other week and monthly dosing regimens with the ability to titrate dosing which will allow healthcare providers to tailor therapy to suit individual patient needs. ","The ODYSSEY program is studying treatment with alirocumab in several key patients populations including the first study when patients were confirmed to be statin tolerant, those with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia where we are studying the largest cohort of such patients as well as those hypercholesterolemia patients with poorly controlled LDL cholesterol despite treatment with current standard of care, which are typically statins. ","Our studies have been designed to offer important insights in patient populations with high unmet needs. For example our statin tolerance study also includes the statin exposure component designed to further enhance our understanding of this population and ensure that we have appropriately characterized these patients as truly statin intolerant. We look forward to reporting results to these trials starting in mid-2014.","Turning to Sarilumab our IL-6 receptor antibody, which is in late stage development in rheumatoid arthritis, we reported positive pipeline data from the Phase II MOBILITY study in the fourth quarter of 2013. This study met all three co-primary endpoints, namely, one an improvement in the symptoms of RA at 24 weeks as measured by the HR20 score. Second an inhibition in the progression of structural damage at week 52 as measured by radiography and three an improvement in physical function as measured by a changing baseline in the [Hack DI] score. ","Important patient receiving the higher 200 milligrams dose of Sailumab administered every other week showed a 90% reduction in the progression of joint damage as assessed by radiography. In the MOBILITY trial there was a higher incidence of treatment emerging adverse events leading to withdrawal in the Sarilumab treatment groups compared to placebo and was 13.9% in 2 ml group, 12.9% in 150 ml and 4.7% in the placebo group. Infections were the most frequent reported adverse event and were reported with higher incidence in the Sarilumab group compared to placebo or in combination with methotrexate. ","Among patients treated with Sarilumab a dose dependent decrease in mean cancers was observed serious infections were not associated with Grade 3 and Grad 4 neutropenia MOBILITY study. Increases in mean LDL cholesterol and transaminases were observed. These Phase III findings were consistent with those expected from block data via IL-6 pathway.","We believe Sarilumab have the potential to be a very competitive product profile with the flexibility of both low dose and high dose subcutaneous regimen couple with every other week dosing which could offer a good option for patients. Despite the advanced that TNF-alpha have made in management of patients with RA, approximately 40% of patients are inadequately control as assessed by [HVR 20 and GAS 28 scores].","We believe that there is a significant need for new therapies for the treatment of RA. We will be reporting full data from the MOBILITY study in an upcoming medical conference. There are also four more Phase III studies of Sarilumab in RA that are ongoing with expected read outs beginning in 2015. Besides RA, we are also exploring Sarilumab in a Phase II trial in non-infectious Uveitis in the statin study.","Turning to dupilumab. We reviewed this IL-4 receptor alpha antibody as one of most exciting programs in our pipeline. Based on our clinical data so far locking both Interlupin 4 and Interlupin 13 has impressive effects in a variety of PH2 mediated diseases. In recent years the independence of PH2 mediated disease such as arthritis and atopic dermatitis has increased significantly. ","Dupilumab is currently in clinical trials for asthma, atopic dermatitis and nasal polyposis. In 2013 the Phase 2a study of dupilumab in asthma was named the clinical advancement of the year by Scripps and dupilumab is currently in Phase 2b in asthma. We will be presenting data Phase 2a study in atopic dermatitis at the upcoming meeting of the America Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology also known as AAAAI and we expect to see Phase 2b study data in this indication in the second quarter of 2014. ","We plan to initiate a Phase 3 trial in atopic dermatitis in 2014 as well. Though not life threatening, a atopic dermatitis can significantly impact the patient's quality of life. It is estimated there are 2 million patients in the United States with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Dupilumab is also currently in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in nasal polyposis. ","I would now like to now spend a few minutes talking about our earlier pipeline and our recent R&D initiatives. In the past months there has been growing interest in the fields of immunotherapy and oncology. We are keenly interested in this area and are exploring use of bio-specific antibody that target tumor antigen and the CD3 receptor on T-cells to harness the oncolytic properties of T-cells. Our first such bio-specific target CD-20 and CD-3 and is expected to enter the clinical later this year.","As Len mentioned we are now investing in tremendously expanding opportunities seen in genomic with launch of Regeneron Generic Center in our collaboration with Geisinger Health System. We intent to sequence and genotype a minimum of 1,000 consent patients volunteer samples in the next few years, making this one of the largest sequencing endeavors undertaken.","We believe with the state-of-the-art sequencing and informatics tools that are now available, our expertise in mass genomic and access to a broad sample of the identified patient records and samples from patients volunteers we're extremely well positioned to validate the relationship between genetics and human disease. ","Our goal is to turn human DNA sequence into medically actionable information. We hope this will transform the way that we conduct drug development from early target discovery through to our late-stage clinical trials. We hope this would help to our collaborators such as Geisinger transform their ability to deliver better healthcare to their patients in a more timely and cost efficient manner.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Bob Terifay who will provide further details on the EYLEA commercial landscape.","Robert J. Terifay","Thank you George and good morning everyone. In the United States as Len mentioned earlier, EYLEA or intravitreal aflibercept injection net sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 were $403 million and full year 2013 EYLEA net sales were slightly over $1.4 billion. As we described at a recent investor continue, when we first disclose our 2013 U.S. EYLEA net sales results, the fourth quarter sales based on slowdown for Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays but were also helped by modest inventory build at the end of the year.","Now I will provide more detail on the market dynamics. We will be sharing with you some qualitative data from our market research survey that was independently conducted in the fourth quarter. As before this data come from physician-based questionnaires, in this case from 200 representative physicians. I will share with you with you the numbers that were reported in this survey. But I would like to remind you that these numbers of physician reported estimates, based on our survey. ","Let me begin with the Wet AMD indication. In the fourth quarter of 2013 according to our surveyed physicians we had approximately half of the branded anti-VEGF market. The branded anti-VEGF market continues to represent about half of the total wet AMD market. ","Turning now to the second indication for which EYLEA is approved in the United States, Macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion our data from our market research survey suggest that during the fourth quarter EYLEA achieved over 40% share of the approved anti VEGF products indication. ","The branded market represents 45% of the overall macular edema following CRVO indication. As Len and George mentioned earlier the FDA has accepted our supplemental BLA for EYLEA in diabetic macular edema or DME. And we've been granted a PDUFA date of August 18, 2014. DME could be as a big market opportunity as wet AMD. ","It is estimated that approximately 600,000 patients are diagnosed annually with clinically significant diabetic macular edema in the United States. Of these patients about 40% are treated with anti-VEGF therapy. ","We also expect our supplemental BLA for EYLEA for the treatment of macular edema following branched retinal vein occlusion or BRVO be filed in the United States before the end of first quarter 2014. In 2014 we expect U.S. EYLEA net sales to be between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion. We anticipate continued net sales growth in the United States from a growing number of patients diagnosed with wet AMD increasing market share of Macular edema following CRVO and a potential launch in diabetic macular edema late August 2014. ","Please keep in mind that as Len mentioned given potential inventory normalization in the first half of the year and the potential DME approval in late August the growth in U.S. EYLEA net sales may occur more towards the second half of 2014. ","Turning now to the ex-U.S. EYLEA business where we split profits with Bayer HealthCare. Fourth quarter ex-U.S. EYLEA net sales were $184 million. The strong fourth quarter growth is a function of continued ex-U.S. rollout. EYLEA has approximately 40% to 50% of the market in wet AMD in Germany, Australia and Japan, and has recently launched in additional countries in Europe including the UK and France. As of the end of 2013 EYLEA has received regulatory approval for the treatment of wet AMD in over 50 countries. EYLEA is also approved in the EU in macular edema following CRVO indication. ","Through the remainder of the year we expect Bayer to embark on additional launches in both of these indications following regulatory and pricing approvals. Let's put the EYLEA opportunity outside the United States in to context. ","Bayer HealthCare is still in the early stages of launch. Today EYLEA only accounts for about 17% of the overall branded ex-U.S. anti-VEGF sales. There is a significant opportunity for continued growth outside of the United States. Bayer has also submitted an application for marketing authorization in Europe for DME. With that let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry. ","Robert E. Landry","Thank you Bob and good morning to everyone. As Len mentioned in his opening remarks Regeneron experienced strong financial performance throughout 2013. In the fourth quarter we earned $2.24 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of 259 million and we earned $8.17 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $935 million for the full year. ","This represents growth in non-GAAP net EPS of 52% for the three months and 75% for the full year 2013 compared to the same period of 2012. As a reminder non-GAAP EPS excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense related to our senior convertible notes and non-cash income tax expense. In 2012 it excluded the release of the valuation allowance. A full reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release. ","Total revenues were $610 million in the fourth quarter and $2.1 billion for the full year of 2013 which represented growth of 47% for the three months and 53% for the year ended December 31, 2013. Net product sales of $406 million in the fourth quarter were comprised of $402 million of U.S. EYLEA net sales and $4 million of ARCALYST rilonacept net sales. For the full year 2013 U.S. EYLEA net sales were $1.4 billion and ARCALYST net sales were $17 million. ","As Bob mentioned fourth quarter U.S. EYLEA sales benefited from an increase in distributor inventory. Specifically at the end of the fourth quarter 2013 U.S distributors held a little over two weeks of inventory which is higher than the typical range of one to two weeks that has been held by distributors. This increase in inventory may have been in part due to the tightening of commercial terms that went into effect on January 1, 2014. So far this year inventory levels appear to be returning to the more customary one to two week range and if this continues it would impact sales in the first quarter of 2014. ","For 2014 we expect full year U.S. EYLEA net sales to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. This guidance includes the expected approval of EYLEA for DME in the third quarter of 2014 but does not include any change in the compounding environment. ","Ex-U.S. EYLEA sales were a $184 million in the fourth quarter and $472 million for the full year 2013. Product revenue from ex-U.S. EYLEA sales is recorded by Bayer HealthCare. We recognized $44 million in the fourth quarter as our share of net profits from ex-U.S. EYLEA sales which was after repayment of $15 million in development expenses to Bayer HealthCare and $102 million for the full year 2013 after repayment of $58 million. ","Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue was $86 million for the fourth quarter and $220 million for the full year 2013. During the fourth quarter of 2013 Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue included $25 million in milestone payments comprised of a $10 million milestone related to EYLEA approval in Japan for the treatment of macular edema following CRVO and one sales million payment of $15 million. For the full year 2013 Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue included a total of $70 million in substantive regulatory and sales milestone payments as compared to $25 million in 2012. ","Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was a $111 million for the fourth quarter and $430 million for the full year 2013. Included in the Sanofi collaboration line are three key components, our share of losses in connection with ZALTRAP which was $8 million in the fourth quarter and $31 million for the full year, reimbursement of Regeneron incurred R&D expenses which was a $112 million in the fourth quarter and $459 million for the full year and amortization of upfront and other payments previously received from Sanofi. Global ZALTRAP net sales as reported by Sanofi were $20 million for the fourth quarter and $70 million for the full year 2013. ","Turning to expenses non-GAAP R&D expenses were $234 million in the fourth quarter and $743 million for the full year 2013. If we net out R&D reimbursements from our collaborators and our R&D stock-based compensation from our GAAP R&D expense line item our net non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D was a $115 million for the fourth quarter and $263 million for the full year 2013 which is slightly higher than the top range of our guidance for 2013 of $250 million. Please note that in our press release issued this morning we have included all the information required to calculate our unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D numbers. ","For 2014 we would like to reiterate our previously provided guidance of non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $425 million to $475 million. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D spend is driven by three factors: Our obligation to pay for 20% of the Phase III Alirocumab and sarilumab clinical development expenses following the first positive Phase III results as reported in the fourth quarter 2013 for each of these antibodies and advancing un-partnered pipeline which now includes six antibodies, a variety of new technologies such as antibody drug conjugates and bio-specific antibodies in our recent proprietary R&D initiative such as those in the area of human genomics. ","Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $61 million for the fourth quarter and $249 million for the full year 2013. We expect non-GAAP SG&A expense in 2014 to be in the range of $330 million to $380 million. This increase in 2014 is due to an increase in our contribution to independent co-pay foundations that assist qualified patients in satisfying their co-pay requirement and an increase in the branded prescription drug fee that we are assessed as part of the patient protection of Affordable Care Act. ","As a reminder non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses excludes non-cash share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $34 million in the fourth quarter and a $116 million for the full year 2013. This translates into gross margin of approximately 92% of sales for the full year. As a reminder COGS includes royalty expenses in connection with our agreement with Genentech related to U.S. EYLEA sales which we're obligated to pay until the second quarter of 2016. Cost of collaboration manufacturing was $14 million in the fourth quarter and $37 million for the full year 2013. ","Turning now to taxes, at the current time we do not expect to pay significant cash taxes for at least mid-2015. As such we expect that our 2014 non-GAAP earnings will continue to exclude any significant income tax provision. It is too early for us to provide specific cash tax guidance for 2015 at this time. Over the long term with the expansion of our international operations we expect to achieve a tax efficient operating model. The foundation of this operating model will be the establishment of a new manufacturing facility in Ireland and the migration of certain intellectual property related to our ex-U.S. EYLEA franchise in our late stage antibody pipeline to Ireland.","We currently project that the benefits of our investment in our global operating model will begin to be reflected in our effective tax rate commencing in 2014. You will notice that on a GAAP basis the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter for our GAAP earnings was 51.1% and 40.5% for the full year 2013. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate in 2014 to be similar to that experienced in the fourth quarter 2013. The increase in GAAP effective tax rate is a result of near term expenses incurred outside the U.S. in connection with our expansion of our international operations.","Our capital expenditures for the full year 2013 were $156 million which is significantly greater than our capital expenditures of $49 million in 2012 which is primarily driven by our expansion of leased facilities in Tarrytown, New York and our owned facilities in Rensselaer, New York. We expect capital expenditures for 2014 to be $350 million to $425 million as we continue to invest in our Tarrytown and Rensselaer facilities and purchase and commence renovations on a new manufacturing facility in Limerick, Ireland.","We ended 2013 with cash and marketable securities totaling approximately $1.1 billion compared to approximately $600 million at the end of 2012. We also have trade accounts receivable of $787 million at the end of 2013. ","With that I'd now like to turn the call back over to Len.","Leonard S. Schleifer ","Thanks Bob and thank you everybody else. 2014 is a promising year for us. We believe that we have the key elements that are required for long term growth, deepening our existing franchise advancing our broad and active pipeline investing in new technologies such as new initiatives in human genomics and expanding our presence globally. With that I would now turn the call over to Michael.","Michael Aberman ","Thank you, Len. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. As we'd like to give many people a chance to ask questions as possible we again request you to limit yourself to one question. Our team will be available in the office after the call for follow up questions. Thank you and operator and if you could please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And the first question is from Adnan Butt of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Adnan Butt - RBC Capital Markets","Hi good morning everyone. I will start with a tax question you touched a bit on this but can you give us a bit more on what IP is actually overseas at this time and what IP you intend to take, is it just EYLEA or could it be more than that? And then secondly when does this start to impacting tax and maybe you can give some high level thoughts on what statutory tax rates are and then what they would be with the amounts of things that you are planning to take overseas? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer ","Sure. Hi, this is Len. As far as what intellectual property has been migrated we are not going to go into details of that, but I should say that it's not limited to EYLEA and it can be any and all and we are doing that as we view it as appropriate. As far as what the impact on the tax rate I think Bob said is that in 2017 it might began to have an impact but we are not going to get into the details unless Bob do you have anything further you want to add?","Robert E. Landry ","Yeah I'll just give you a little bit more color on as you would expect we do have kind of net operating loss carry-forwards going forward of approximately $460 million and then we obviously have federal and state credit tax credits forwards going forward of roughly $120 million. That will allow us not to pay significant tax cash tax through at least mid-2015. I had said obviously this is subject to change based on various factors that may come about, but that's our current position today. ","And again as Len said we are kind of taking the right steps as you'd expect a company like us to take going forward and we won't get into specificities of these with regards to the migration of the IP but as Len said you can rest assured it's not just EYLEA and that coupled with kind of our new manufacturing facility that we're getting kind of in the ground in Ireland will allow us to get favorable tax rates beginning in kind of that 2017 year.","Michael Aberman","Right next question?","Operator","The next question is from Ying Huang of Barclays. Your line is open. ","Ying Huang - Barclays Capital","Good morning, guys thanks for taking my question. First I would like to ask you to elaborate your thought on the VISTA data because we saw the arterial and trauma and related events and also the death rate there picking up. I was wondering if you could comment on the regulatory indication for that arm and then what you might see as the positioning in the competition in the DME landscape. ","And then secondly it sounds like you guys are seeing somewhat like steady stage market share for EYLEA in wet AMD market. So I was wondering if you have any long-term strategy in growing share in that market. ","Leonard S. Schleifer ","First of all, that's two questions. Compound question which would you prefer to have answered. We'll start with the DME -- we're not going to get into the details of our regulatory discussions but other than to say that we've made our submission, the FDA has filed the package and we are on track we think for PDUFA date based on our submissions in August of this year. ","In terms of the data we were very pleased with the data George do you want to add anything on that?","George D. Yancopoulos","Yeah, as this is also very highly scrutinized area because of concerns about anti-VEGF agents with regard to systemic adverse events and the so called AT\/PT events as well as deaths. And of course we found it very comforting that are systemic, serious systemic adverse events were similar between all groups as was the -- our serious adverse events declined by the AT\/PT criteria. ","And in terms of death it's very important to point out that the 2 milligram every other month group, which produced data virtually identical to that of the monthly group was numerically very similar to that of the laser control group, the monthly group did have numerically a higher number but that was not even normally significantly different from the laser control group. ","So overall we are continuing to wait for the second study but I think that in the field we're pretty comforted by this data. ","Leonard S. Schleifer ","All right just to emphasize what George is saying about this, the 2-8 in similar, for the 2-4 in terms of the efficacy that should not be under appreciated that's just exactly how those curves overlap in terms of efficacy between the alternate month group and the monthly group. Bob do you want to have comment about market share?","Robert E. Landry","Yeah, so first of all I would remind you as we pointed out that despite the fact we launched several years after Lucentis we added even market share in wet AMD with Lucentis and we made $1.4 billion last year. So we're very encouraged with the performance of EYLEA. Future growth will come primarily from new patients and we have implemented a number of strategies to try to pick up more new patients to the marketplace. ","I think the biggest challenge to growth for both us and Lucentis is the fact that despite the change in the compounding landscape there has been very little change in the use of Avastin in the marketplace. And that's probably the major obstacle for both products at the current time. ","So I'll just say and I anticipate a question on the compounding our projections don't assume any significant change in the compounding environment. That is not to say there might not be some of laws rewritten but and the FDA has said that there are no compounding exceptions that are applicable to biologics, the new lower of compounding does not grant these waivers to biologics but how the FDA will enforce that and whether that will change things is yet to be determined. ","We wait to see what the FDA will do. Of course our long standing opinion has been we're in favor of choice. We think it's good that patients can choose, they can choose right now between three alternatives, be it Avastin, be it Lucentis and EYLEA we are interested in having choice is good but we would like to have only a single quality standard in terms of the manufacture and preparation of the product. Next question, Michael. ","Operator","The next question is from Chris Raymond of Robert Baird. Your line is open. ","Chris Raymond - Robert Baird & Co.","Yeah, thanks. I was just wondering if you could maybe comment on so you've discussed it with FDA here you have got your -- I am sorry your PDUFA date -set. Any updates on likelihood of a panel in front of that for DME? ","Leonard S. Schleifer ","Yeah I mean I think the FDA reserves the right to call a panel if they need one, we've had no indication to-date that there will be one, but it's not too late if they choose to but right now they haven't. I don't know if that's helpful but that's the way it works. ","Chris Raymond - Robert Baird & Co.","Okay. Thanks. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jason Kantor of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is open. ","Jason Kantor - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse ","Great. You answered my compounding question, so I'll ask another which is on the human genomics effort, this is obviously a very big project and I am just wondering if there will be sort of any interim kind of announceable events where you give progress updates on anything that might be coming out of that or is this something that is going to go somewhat radio silence for years until a drug pops out of this program versus something we can expect updates on? ","Leonard S. Schleifer ","Yeah, maybe George can give you some perspective on that. ","George D. Yancopoulos ","I think we are viewing a situation where the program can impact every aspect of everything that we do and I can tell you we've already had results that have impacted how we think about, how we design our programs and so forth. So this is the continuous data. We will certainly be taking advantage of it in a continuous fashion of course we hope that there will be some huge breakthroughs that will also lead to important new therapeutics opportunities. And we also anticipate that there will be a lot of publishing going on continuously also not only from our selves but importantly from our collaborators such as Geisinger.","Jason Kantor - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse ","Could you expand on what you mean by you've already seen impact to some of your thinking around your programs. What are you referring to? ","George D. Yancopoulos","Yeah, it's probably a bit premature to get into those details, Jason. So but stay tuned this is an exciting area. ","Jason Kantor - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse ","Thank you. ","Leonard S. Schleifer ","Okay. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. ","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank ","Hi, guys thanks for taking my question. So maybe you could frame for us how to think about the data for the IL-4 IL-13 compound given that you are going to have a couple of data sets in the next six months. Just what would be, what is the data set that we should be focused on and what are your thoughts on IL-4 in asthma? Thanks. ","Leonard S. Schleifer ","George? ","George D. Yancopoulos ","Well, certainly very soon as we announced in the first quarter we will be getting data from our Phase IIB study in atopic dermatitis. We certainly hope that, that data will confirm and extend the data to-date and as we indicated we think that, that is a very large opportunity on itself and it's an earlier program in terms of moving towards the market and towards approval in asthma. In terms of asthma obviously we are going to be doing the Phase IIb and we are going to be anticipating that data in terms of also confirming what we've seen to-date better establishing our dose relationship and going forward into the real cause. ","Leonard S. Schleifer ","Yeah, and just to be clear the data coming up at the Quad AI at the end of this month would be the Phase IIa data. And then as George indicated we will be additionally getting Phase IIb data perhaps later this quarter or the second quarter. So lots going on in the atopic dermatitis area and the asthma Phase IIb program is very large study that's well underway in terms of enrollment. So this is a pretty exciting area for us. ","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank ","Okay. Thanks. ","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs ","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Maybe another on the pipeline front. Was just wondering the EYLEA PDGF co-formulation trial, if you could give us any more insights on the design there, that will include EYLEA control arm, when we might get some data? And then maybe your thoughts on that target and given what we are seeing from the competition out there? Thanks. ","Leonard S. Schleifer ","Well in terms of the target we've said many times that it's potentially interesting to combine PDGF and EYLEA. We also think it's potentially interesting and maybe more interesting to combine [inaudible] and EYLEA. And I think other people can speak to their own data but we don't view this as a done deal just yet and I don't George you want to get into it that or not give anything on trial design. ","George D. Yancopoulos"," I don't think we're going to be talking about the details of our trial design at this point. But as Len said we're very excited about the fact that we have the opportunity to combine both of these agents in terms of either the PDGF agent or the anti-agents in the same as intro-vitrial formulation as EYLEA which I think if either of these agents can walk for a substantive advantage I think that would be very attractive and convenient to patients for getting a single injection with both the agents in it. ","Okay. Next question. ","Operator","Yes the next question is from Geoff Meacham of JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Carter L. Gould - JPMorgan","Hi this is Carter on for Jeff. Congrats on a good quarter. A question related to the differentiation strategy for sarilumab do you think you can differentiate versus [actamer] strictly in the basis of the reduction of progression in joint damage, in case of pretty comparable -- ","Leonard S. Schleifer ","I don't think it's appropriate for us to be doing any cross trial comparisons at this point if at all let's wait until we get our data and then I think the rheumatology community will be able to assess, I think as George indicated in his talk the fact that we have both two different dosing regimens that we've been able to demonstrate I think reasonable data with both may afford a nice choice given subcutaneously et cetera. By the way give regard to Geoff because this is fourth time in all that somebody stood in for him and we hope he's okay. ","George D. Yancopoulos","So I just wanted to add to that we think the field is far from knowing the best way to use biologics as you already heard there is a substantial number of patients who don\u2019t respond best to TNS and I think that it's both an issue of the right trials being done and trial designs and so forth. The best get the best biologic to the best patients and I think that\u2019s going to be important way of expanding the opportunity of anti-VEGF agents in general in this space. ","Operator","The next question is from Yaron Werber of Citi. Your line is open. ","Yaron Werber - Citigroup","Hi everybody and thanks for taking my question. I don't know how you are going to let me sneak in two questions because I know you might not answer the first one. The first on just for Bob the DME market can you give us a sense how much of it is branded now versus sort of Avastin I am trying to get a sense how much is the [inaudible] and then if you don't mind I have a second one. I just don\u2019t understand the biology for you guys may be for George and for Len, -- EYLEA sort of synergies versus PDGF and EYLEA synergy. ","I am just trying to get a sense help us understand evaluate it little bit and why may be take - testing them separately and is there even an opportunity to test them all together as a triple, so plenty of questions in there? ","Leonard S. Schleifer ","So Yaron those are good questions we'll deal with both of them. First Bob can you comment on the -- so in terms of DME obviously for a number of years it was not an improved product so Avastin was the dominant player in the marketplace since Lucentis has launched they have rapidly penetrated the market. But they are not at the same 50-50 split as in the wet AMD market it's more like 60% of Avastin 40% Lucentis from the survey data that we have. ","That said with the launch of Lucentis the anti-VEGF market in DME is growing so we're very encouraged that over time the DME market, as I said only right now only a portion is getting into anti-VEGF therapy. But we expect that to change and especially when you look at the data which indicates patients really should not be receiving laser. If they get laser early on from what we saw in our year two data they never really catch up when they get anti-VEGF therapy.","So we believe there is a major opportunity for anti-VEGF therapy to be used earlier in the treatment of clinically significant DME. ","Okay. So George you want to comment on relatively pre-clinical or whatever data if you have anything want to say that PDGS and Avastin and whether or not a combination makes any sense at all? ","George D. Yancopoulos","Well right now we view the pre-clinical data is actually stronger for ANG potent II. They both are acting predominantly on the blood vessels as opposed to PDGF which is acting on the smooth muscles. So I guess theoretically there is some rationale a possibility of the three way combination but I think actually first we are going to have to -- as a field to convincingly demonstrate that either agent on top of anti-VEGF have a substantial advantage. ","Okay, next question.","Operator","The next question is from Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is open.","Matthew Roden - UBS ","Hi, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the progress. I just wanted to ask you about the market share trends here. Can you speak to whether or not the market share in AMD and CRVO you report is representative of what you see if you limited that sample to just patients starting therapy or switching therapy? ","And then related as you think about launching into DME, is there anything you can learn from your experience here in AMD and RVO together with the dosing advantages and things like that could result in sort of the super market share gain in DME with EYLEA than you had in the previous indication, thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer "," ","Yeah, I would say we were pretty pleased with how quickly we got market share and I am not sure we have much to add on that. Bob do you want to come on that?","Robert J. Terifay","I think I don\u2019t want to split it out our survey data for new versus switched patients, what I would say is that the majority of our business that is not on -- from continuing patients is now on new patients which is very encouraging. We\u2019ve really got that pool of switched patients earlier on and now it\u2019s we\u2019re fighting it out to get new patients, by new patients our share in new patients is greater than our share in switches. ","With regard to the DME growth I think that the opportunity is similar to what we saw in with wet AMD, there is a dissatisfied group of patients who will be switched and our real opportunity is to grow the market because quite frankly laser therapy is not appropriate and most patients were set with DME with central vision and we have to get that message out.","Matthew Roden - UBS ","Right, obviously that bothers you post the approvals hopefully which is due in August of this year, okay.","Leonard S. Schleifer ","Okay, next question.","Operator","Next question is from Joseph Schwartz of Leerink. Your line is open.","Joseph Schwartz - Leerink Swann LLC","Thanks a lot. I was wondering if you could talk about how you've designed your antibody against PDGF and what science supports going after the receptor versus the lag end and PDGF data versus other sub units.","Leonard S. Schleifer ","Yeah, I think that's a little bit proprietary so we will have to duck that one. But we will give you another question if you have one.","Joseph Schwartz - Leerink Swann LLC","Thanks, how about are you detecting any potential changes in the way physicians are reimbursed for inter vitrial injections.","Leonard S. Schleifer ","Bob, do you have any comment or question about that? ","Robert J. Terifay","Over the short term there are no anticipated changes but right now the whole health care environment is uncertain so I can't talk about what might happen in the future.","Joseph Schwartz - Leerink Swann LLC","Okay, alright, great thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from [Rachel Span] of Bank of America, your line is open.","","Unidentified Analyst","Just two quick ones, just to make sure I understand your guidance for sales in the first quarter and your inventory comments, are you actually guiding for 1Q sales that are lower than the fourth quarter reported sales? And then to follow up on the DME comments, it sounds like that there will be because Roche has already kind of said that the market, if I am interpreting their comments correctly, is around $250 million in sales for DME in U.S. now and I understand it is going to grow. Just sounds like there's overall there is a much smaller pool of patients to switch and we ought to be thinking about DME in the context of your comments. I just want to make sure I understand if it's as big as AMD that\u2019s really several years from now as opposed to in the next two years. Is that so?","Leonard S. Schleifer ","Yeah, good question. The second question, in terms of the size of the DME markets you are correct. We are launching into a market that is much less mature than the AMD market that is assuming we get approval we will launching into a market there is much less mature and therefore you are correct the number of actual switches available might be less. ","On the other hand our statement that the market could be as large really was a demographic statement relating to the number of patients with DME and the fact that the disease is often bilateral, the number of eyes that could be needed to be treated. And the fact that a significant fraction of the market is now still laser at least according to the several meeting that I have been the people feel that laser user usage will be decreasing dramatically. ","In terms of we did not give specific sequential quarterly guidance but you are correct that we were suggesting that there could be a negative effect of on the first quarter of this year based on inventory realignment and plus the growth that we're predicting. As I said it's tilted more towards the second half of the year especially post the approval of DME if it comes in August. ","Robert J. Terifay","So Len I think one thing people need to keep in mind when they're looking at about $250 million number is that Lucentis is dosed at a 0.3 milligram dose in DME. So it's three-fifth of the price in AMD. So you really can't compare AMD and DME numbers. ","Leonard S. Schleifer ","Okay, good questions, thanks. So we have time for couple of more I think? ","Michael Aberman","Yes two more questions operator? ","Operator","Yes sir, the next question is from Phil Nadeau from Cowen & Co. Your line is open. ","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co.","Yeah thanks for taking my question, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a question on Alirocumab, just wondering if you could give us an update on the outcomes trial how's it proceeding and then a related question what is the rate limiting factor to filing Alirocumab in U.S. is it that the outcomes trial has to have a certain percentage of enrollment or are you going to wait for the data from the trial. ","Leonard S. Schleifer ","Yeah so I think what we've said is that we're not going to comment on the specifics of our outcome data progress enrolment et cetera because it is a very competitive field. We have indicated that in terms of what's required for filing with the FDA wanted to see some progress and I am not going to get some specifics there but they were looking at progress in terms of the number of events and a blinded setting in one group or the other overall number of events. ","So they knew the progress was -- so the progress of the trial was moving along but we don't want to get into the specifics there either because each program they have its own nuances. So hope that helps. Next question. ","Operator","The final question is from Biren Amin of Jefferies. Your line is open. ","Biren Amin - Jefferies & Co., Inc.","Len, a question on your competitors they are working at more and frequent delivery of anti-VEGF could you may be share your thoughts on EYLEA and your efforts on -- around this, thanks. ","Leonard S. Schleifer ","Yeah we continue to look at alternative delivery systems whether it would be through genetic approaches whether it would be through delivery devices or what have you as far we know one of our competitors had something in Phase I for quite some time now and we haven't seen that progress. We don't know much more than you do. And we don't have anything in the clinic as yet but I can assure you we look at this area very carefully and we'll see whether or not going to be this combination will make a difference as well. Okay, Michael? ","Michael Aberman","Well, thank you -- thanks everybody we appreciate you participating in our fourth quarter call. We look forward to a great 2014 and with that I would like to close the call. ","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note, the conference is being recorded.","And I will now turn the call over to Dr. Michael Aberman.","Michael S. Aberman - Senior VP-Strategy & Investor Relations","Thank you, operator. And good morning and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals First Quarter 2016 Conference Call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under Events and Presentations for 30 days. Joining me on the call today are: Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President of Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer; Bob Terifay, Executive Vice President, Commercial; and Bob Landry, Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A.","I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, those related to Regeneron and its products and businesses, sales and expense forecasts, financial forecasts, development programs, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, intellectual property and competition. Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected in such statements.","A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, which was filed with the SEC this morning. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","In addition, please note that GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed on today's call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP are available in our financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website at www.regeneron.com. Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions.","With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Michael. A very good morning to everyone who has joined us on the call and webcast today. The first quarter of 2016 was busy and we have a lot to share with you today. Our strategy remains, as always, to focus our unique capabilities in drug discovery and development on bringing important new medicines to patients in need. George will provide you with some of the recent exciting progress we have made in that regard.","From a high-level perspective, we had positive data readouts from three Phase 3 programs: Praluent for lowering the LDL cholesterol in the apheresis setting, sarilumab in rheumatoid arthritis, and dupilumab in atopic dermatitis. We also reported positive data from a Phase 2\/3 study in osteoarthritis for fasinumab, our NGF antibody for pain. And we continue to make good progress with our earlier-stage assets and discovery efforts.","Turning to our marketed products, EYLEA has continued to deliver solid growth and we are able to increase our guidance for the year. Praluent's launch is still ongoing and has obviously faced a difficult reimbursement environment. While we fully understand payers' efforts to control costs, we do have serious concerns that appropriate patients are having undue difficulty getting approval for Praluent. We continue to be optimistic over the long term that Praluent will provide an important cholesterol-lowering option to many patients. Bob Terifay will provide more detail on EYLEA and Praluent. Following that, Bob Landry will provide more detail on financial results for the first quarter of 2016, as well as updated guidance.","Finally, we are approaching the potential approval and launch of two new products, sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, is under review with the FDA; dupilumab is being developed for a number of indications and we are targeting completion of our rolling BLA submission from moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in the third quarter of 2016.","With that, let me turn the call over to George.","George D. Yancopoulos - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories & Chief Scientific Officer","Thank you, Len. And a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. Let me begin with an update on EYLEA. In addition to the Phase 2 co-formulated combinations of EYLEA with rinucumab, an antibody to the PDGF receptor, and nesvacumab, an antibody to Angiopoietin-2, we have also commenced PANORAMA, a Phase 3 study of EYLEA in non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy in patients without diabetic macular edema, or DME, which will evaluate whether EYLEA can improve their retinopathy.","Additionally, the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network, or the DRCR, initiated a related clinical study called Protocol W to evaluate the potential of anti-VEGF therapy in preventing worsening of severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. This study will explore every 16-week dosing of EYLEA, which is the only anti-VEGF treatment being investigated in this study.","In February, we received two new results from Protocol T, a government-sponsored study in patients with DME comparing the safety and efficacy of EYLEA versus Lucentis and Avastin. The primary efficacy endpoint for that study was at one year, which showed significantly better vision gained with EYLEA than either with Lucentis or Avastin. The second year of the study was not designed to rigorously compare the anti-VEGF agents, as the second year results were increasingly confounded by variable dosing frequency as well as additional or adjunctive therapy, such as laser.","Along these lines, it is important to point there was a greater number of injections and substantially more use of laser associated with Avastin treatment than the overall population. Despite this, when compared with Avastin, EYLEA demonstrated a statistically significant five-letter gain, or an entire line of vision, in patients with poor vision at baseline. At two years, the rates of most ocular adverse events were similar across the three study groups. There was, however, statistically significant lower rate of arterial thromboembolic events, including non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction and vascular death in the EYLEA group compared with the ranibizumab group.","Our Praluent launch is underway and Bob Terifay will provide further details on the commercial front. Our 18,000 patient ODYSSEY outcome study is ongoing. The Data Monitoring Committee for this study has completed the first interim analysis when 50% of the total events had accrued based on unblinded study data. In addition to reviewing the safety data, the DMC performed a futility assessment and recommended the study continue with no changes. We remain blinded to the actual result of this analysis and the study is ongoing. A second interim analysis for futility as well as overwhelming efficacy could potentially occur in the second half of 2016, when 75% of the targeted primary events have occurred.","In March we reported positive data from the Phase 3 ODYSSEY ESCAPE study in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia who required chronic weekly or bi-weekly apheresis. Apheresis is an invasive, expensive and time-consuming therapy given to the patients with the highest cholesterol levels and the greatest need. Our studies show that Praluent reduced the need for apheresis by 75% compared to placebo and 63% of Praluent patients no longer required apheresis compared to 0% of the patients in the placebo arm. Praluent is the only PCSK9 inhibitor that has been studied in this apheresis setting, which represents some of the most severe hypercholesterolemic patients.","The adverse events that occurred more frequently in the Praluent-treated patients were injection site reactions and myalgia. We expect our Supplemental BLA for the once-monthly dosing regimen of Praluent to be filed in the second quarter, which, if approved, will expand our dosing flexibility options.","Turning now to our late-stage pipeline, where we've had some very positive news. I'd like to start with sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody which is under review by the FDA for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In March, we announced positive data from the Phase 3 MONARCH study of sarilumab versus HUMIRA, which demonstrated that sarilumab was superior to HUMIRA in the monotherapy setting in improving signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis at 24 weeks.","This was the first head-to-head study in the monotherapy study using a subcutaneously administered IL-6 inhibitor. The use of IL-6 inhibition in the monotherapy setting has been growing and these data provide us with a competitive product profile. Data from the MONARCH study will be included in our European submission, which is expected mid-year 2016.","Turning now to dupilumab, our IL-4\/13 blocking antibody, where we recently announced positive top-line data from the SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 monotherapy Phase 3 studies in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. These were the first Phase 3 studies of a systematic therapy to demonstrate a significant improvement in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and confirm the positive data we had seen in our Phase 2b study. Overall, the studies demonstrated significant improvements in measures of disease severity, skin clearing, itching, quality of life and mental health. We expect to present detailed data from the SOLO studies in an upcoming medical conference.","We continue to expect top-line data from the Phase 3 CHRONOS study, which explores dupilumab in combination with topical corticosteroids, in the second quarter of 2016. We expect to complete the rolling BLA submission for dupilumab in atopic dermatitis in the third quarter of 2016. We remind you that dupilumab has received Breakthrough Designation from the FDA for this indication in adults.","In the first quarter of 2016, we initiated LIBERTY AD CAF\u00c9, a Phase 3 study of dupilumab to support our European submission. This study investigates dupilumab with concomitant topical corticosteroids in adult patients with atopic dermatitis who are not adequately controlled with or intolerant to or ineligible for systemic cyclosporine A treatment.","In addition to the studies in the adult setting, we also plan to initiate a Phase 3 study in the atopic dermatitis indication in the pediatric population once we have data from the ongoing Phase 2 pediatric study that is now fully enrolled. We expect these Phase 2 data in the second half of the year.","We're also investigating dupilumab in other indications, including asthma, where we are currently enrolling our 1,700-patient pivotal study. We're also advancing clinical development in indications, such as nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis.","For fasinumab, our NGF antibody, earlier this week we announced positive data from our Phase 2\/3 study in osteoarthritis, which provides us with our first safety and efficacy data with our subcutaneous dosing regimen. This was the first completed study using an antibody to NGF that performed extensive imaging of knee, hip and shoulder joints at screening and throughout the trial. Interestingly, we found that subchondral insufficiency fracturing and even osteonecrosis were present in this population at screening.","Further, our findings in patients following fasinumab treatment are consistent with prior data, suggesting that there may not be a substantial increase in rapidly progressing osteoarthritis when an NGF antibody is used in the monotherapy setting. That said, this is a relatively small trial and we look forward to data from the much larger clinical studies that are underway.","We have also seen some exciting developments in our earlier-stage programs. I'd like to spend a few minutes on two areas, our efforts in genetics and our recent collaboration in the arena of gene editing. In March, we published a paper in The New England Journal of Medicine based on research that was conducted at the Regeneron Genetics Center, or the RGC. The publication showed that inactivating mutations in a gene called Angiopoietin-like 4 were associated with a significantly reduced risk of coronary artery disease in humans. This is a great example that demonstrates how our efforts in the area of precision medicine can link genetic mutation information with real-world health outcomes to make actionable discoveries.","Many of the findings from the RGC are already being used to inform Regeneron's robust and integrated R&D programs and give us the ability to incorporate large-scale sequencing into our discovery and pipeline approaches. It also demonstrates the advantages of our unique combination of technologies. Using our proprietary VelociGene technology, we developed animal models that corroborated the human genetics finding and we were able to use our VelociGene platform to create a fully human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of ANGPTL4 that reduced triglyceride levels in mice and non-human primates.","We are also advancing a Phase 2 program of Regeneron 1500, an antibody to ANGPTL3. ANGPTL3 is thought to play a central role of lipoprotein metabolism and there are genetic data that show that patients with homozygous inactivating mutations of this gene report greater than 50% lower levels of LDL, HDL and triglycerides. Initial data from a small study in homozygous patients will be presented at the upcoming Annual Meeting of the National Lipid Association.","We recently entered into collaboration with Intellia Therapeutics with the aim of advancing CRISPR\/Cas gene-editing technology into in vivo therapeutic development. This was a logical fit for us, given our long-standing expertise on genetic engineering combined with our industry-leading human genetics research with the RGC, which is already identifying important genetic targets. We believe that combining these capabilities with Intellia's technology holds real promise for serious diseases that have been historically difficult to address and expands our ability to help patients where antibody-based therapies may not be the optimal approach.","We continue to make progress in immuno-oncology. REGENERON 2810, our PD-1 antibody program, has entered a Phase 2 potentially registrational study in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. We'll be presenting some preliminary Phase I data at the upcoming Annual ASCO Conference.","With that, I would like to turn over the call to Bob Terifay.","Robert J. Terifay - Executive Vice President, Commercial","Thank you, George. And good morning, everyone. During the first quarter of 2016, we continued to see strong sales growth for EYLEA, or aflibercept injection, both in the United States and the rest of the world. We've made substantial progress in securing access and reimbursement for Praluent, or alirocumab, among U.S. payers. In addition, the European launch for Praluent continues to progress. We also are now preparing for the potential U.S. launches of sarilumab and dupilumab over the next 12 months to 15 months.","Starting with EYLEA. First quarter U.S. net sales grew 44% year-over-year. Net U.S. EYLEA sales for the first quarter was $781 million. Net ex-U.S. EYLEA sales in the first quarter were $419 million, which represents 44% growth year-over-year on a reported basis. We continue to see quarter-over-quarter increases in our U.S. market share leadership for EYLEA in the FDA-approved anti-VEGF market, both in terms of dollar sales as well as injections as reported by 207 retinal specialists in our quarterly Market Research Survey.","We're encouraged about future growth opportunities for EYLEA based upon the recently reported two-year results of the independently conducted Protocol T comparative study of EYLEA versus ranibizumab versus bevacizumab in patients with diabetic macular edema.","However, I should point out that we are closely monitoring pressures on EYLEA sales as the year progresses. There are currently a series of proposals for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services regarding physician reimbursement for physician-administered Medicare Part B buy and bill drugs, which could lead towards physicians favoring the use of off-label repackaged bevacizumab, or in large volume retinal practices, ranibizumab, due to the provision of direct-to-physician financial incentives from the manufacturer.","Regeneron believes that EYLEA is clearly differentiated from both bevacizumab and ranibizumab. Physicians and patients should not be denied access to any drug therapy that is deemed appropriate. Therefore, we and scores of other manufactures, patient advocacy groups and industry associations will or have already submitted objections to CMS and Congress recommending the physician's choice be preserved and alternative schemas to reduce healthcare costs should be explored.","Turning now to Praluent. As reported by Sanofi, net sales in the first quarter were $13 million, which understates the actual physician and patient demand. As we reminded you over the last several quarters, we anticipated that it will take some time for commercial and government payers to conduct formulary reviews, make reimbursement coverage decisions and begin to process patient claims. I'm pleased to tell you that, as of April 1, approximately 74% of commercially insured lives and 91% of Medicare-insured lives have access to Praluent.","We've recently seen an improvement in the number of prescriptions that are successfully being filled. Highlighting our improved coverage as well as our share of voice among healthcare professionals, the most recent nationally syndicated Prescription Audit for the week ended April 22, 2016 indicates that Praluent captured approximately 50% of new prescriptions in the class.","Unfortunately, due to unprecedented strict management utilization management criteria and very tedious prior authorization paperwork and documentation that the pharmacy benefits managers and health plans have put in place, many patients who are eligible for treatment with a PCSK-9 inhibitor have not had their prescription filled. Frustrated by this process, healthcare professionals are limiting their prescriptions to the sickest of patients and prescription volume for the PCSK-9 inhibitor class is limited.","We're focusing our efforts improving the prescription process through the payers and specialty pharmacies. We're also working with physician's offices to ensure the prescription process is better understood on a payer-by-payer basis. Over the last several weeks, we've seen two payers loosen the utilization management criteria, removing the requirement for prior ezetimibe therapy. ODYSSEY OUTCOMES data, if positive, will be a key driver in shaping the future success of Praluent.","Outside of the United States, Praluent was approved in the EU in September of 2015, with product now available in several countries. Reimbursement discussions are currently underway with several governments across Europe. Outside the United States it remains a difficult reimbursement market, with some countries awaiting OUTCOMES data.","We've submitted a BLA to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for sarilumab, our interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis, and have been granted a PDUFA date of October 30, 2016. We will be co-promoting sarilumab with Sanofi-Genzyme in the United States and are actively recruiting our field-based team. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made over time.","We're excited about the potential U.S. launch for sarilumab. Given the central role of interleukin-6 in the inflammation contributing to the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and, more importantly, disabling joint destruction, we believe that IL-6 inhibitors should be used early following tumor necrosis factor, or TNF, inhibitor failure. Recently issued U.S. and European guidelines support the use for IL-6 inhibitor class in earlier lines of treatments, and this is particularly relevant for those patients who can not take combination therapies with methotrexate.","With multiple players competing in the anti-IL-6 marketplace, this should contribute to improved physician awareness and understanding of the inadequacy of TNF inhibitor cycling and the need for early IL-6 inhibitor treatment. Subcutaneously administered sarilumab has strong clinical data in terms of the improved signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and prevention of bone damage in methotrexate inadequate responders. Similar improvements in the signs and symptoms of RA had been reported in TNF inhibitor inadequate responder population.","We continue to prepare for the potential U.S. launch of dupilumab, our IL-4 and IL-13 inhibitor, which we expect in 2017. There are approximately 1.6 million patients with inadequately controlled moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in the United States. We'll be co-promoting dupilumab in the United States. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made at a later date.","With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry.","Robert E. Landry - Senior Vice President-Finance & Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone who has joined us today. In the first quarter of 2016, non-GAAP net income per diluted share decreased 11% to $2.57 versus first quarter of 2015 and non-GAAP net income of $293 million decreased 13% versus first quarter of 2015. Regeneron's 2016 non-GAAP net income primarily excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense and includes an adjustment for income taxes. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release.","Total revenues in the first quarter of 2016 were $1.2 billion, which represented year-over-year growth of 38% over the first quarter of 2015. Net product sales were $784 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $545 million in the first quarter of 2015. EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $781 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $541 million in the first quarter of 2015, which represents an increase of 44%. Sequential quarter-over-quarter growth was an increase of 5%.","During the first quarter of 2016, EYLEA experienced a slight decrease in U.S. distributor inventory levels as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, but continues to be within our normal one-week to two-week targeted range. As Len mentioned, we are updating our full-year 2016 U.S. EYLEA guidance to be year-over-year growth of between 20% and 25% from the previously provided guidance of approximately 20% growth.","Ex-U.S. EYLEA sales were $419 million in the first quarter of 2016 as compared as to $292 million in the first quarter of 2015, representing 44% increase on a reported basis. On an operational basis or constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 48%. Product revenue from ex-U.S. EYLEA sales is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer.","In the first quarter of 2016, Regeneron recognized $146 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the first quarter of 2016 was $180 million. I'd also like to take this moment to highlight our recently expanded collaboration with Bayer following our agreement to jointly develop the co-formulation of our antibody to Ang2 in EYLEA.","In connection with this agreement, Bayer made a $50 million upfront payment to us, which was a receivable at March 31, 2016. And Regeneron has the potential to earn up to $80 million in development milestones. The $50 million upfront payment has been deferred and will be recognized over the estimated performance period. Similar to our EYLEA agreement, Regeneron has exclusive commercial rights within the U.S. and will retain all of the profits from any U.S. sales.","Finally, a reminder for the EYLEA franchise. The second quarter of 2016 will be the final quarter in which we incur the royalty expense in connection with our agreement with Genentech related to global EYLEA sales. In fact, I'm pleased to announce that this royalty will officially end in two more days.","Turning now to our Sanofi collaboration. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $220 million for the first quarter of 2016. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses and our share of profits or losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies. In the first quarter of 2016, our share of the collaboration's losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies, primarily Praluent, was $99 million, which can be found in Table 4 of our earnings release. Netted within the collaboration losses were the global sales of Praluent as recognized by our collaborator, Sanofi, of $13 million for the first quarter 2016.","Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $392 million for the first quarter. Our unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as total GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators and R&D non-cash share-based compensation expense, was $164 million for the first three months of 2016. Our press release includes all the information that's required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense.","For 2016, we'd like to reiterate our previously provided guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $875 million to $950 million. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $230 million for the first quarter 2016. We continue to expect non-GAAP SG&A expense in 2016 to be in the range of $925 million and $1 billion.","Before I move on from our operating expenses, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the new guidance component we announced this morning, Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, which represents reimbursement of internal and external costs in connection with preparing to commercialize or commercializing, as applicable, Praluent and sarilumab and, effective in the first quarter of 2016, dupilumab. This is a line item found within Sanofi Collaboration Revenue and is referenced in Table 4 of our press release. Going forward, we believe that providing guidance for this number will help in modeling the Sanofi Collaboration Revenue line item. For the first quarter of 2016, the reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses was $73 million and we expect this expense in 2016 to be in the range of $320 million and $370 million.","Turning now to our non-GAAP tax adjustment. Cash tax as a percentage of non-GAAP pre-tax net income for this quarter continues to be lower than our GAAP effective tax rate primarily due to the tax impact of non-cash share-based compensation. On a non-GAAP basis, cash tax as a percentage of non-GAAP pre-tax net income for the first quarter of 2016 was approximately 38%. For 2016, our guidance for cash tax as a percentage of non-GAAP pre-tax income remains at 35% to 45%. As previously reported, this includes a one-time tax of approximately $222 million related to the Sanofi immuno-oncology agreement. I'd also like to reiterate that the non-GAAP tax impact of the immuno-oncology upfront payment will be spread equally throughout 2016.","Our capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2016 were $104 million. Given our latest review of capital expenditures, we are tightening and lowering our full-year 2016 capital expenditures guidance to a range of $550 million to $625 million from $580 million to $680 million. These expenditures continue to build on our manufacturing expansions in 2015, which include expanding our facilities in Rensselaer, New York and Limerick, Ireland, as well as the continued expansion of our Tarrytown, New York headquarters.","We ended the first quarter of 2016 with cash and marketable securities of $1.4 billion. As we've previously mentioned, we have been opportunistically entering into agreements to reduce the number of our outstanding warrants that we issued in 2011 in connection with our convertible debt. In the first quarter of 2016, we paid $242 million to reduce these outstanding warrants.","Before I conclude my remarks, I would briefly like to highlight certain financial components of the recent collaboration with Intellia Therapeutics. The April 2016 agreement grants Regeneron access to Intellia's CRISPR technology platform, as well as the right to discover and develop up to 10 targets on an exclusive basis over the course of the six-year agreement. In return, we paid a $75 million upfront payment to Intellia, which we anticipate recording as R&D expense in the second quarter of 2016, but plan to exclude from non-GAAP net income. The agreement also requires Regeneron to purchase up to $50 million of Intellia's shares contingent upon Intellia consummating its initial public offering.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Michael.","Michael S. Aberman - Senior VP-Strategy & Investor Relations","Thanks, Bob. Operator, at this time, we will open up the call for our Q&A period.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question is from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you very much and appreciate the chance to ask a question, but also the 10-Q being filed today is very helpful with all the detail. I suppose a couple of questions. George, first, on dupilumab. Now you have the first Phase 3 readout. What incrementally have you learned from that in terms of the profile of dupilumab and how does that alter what you might focus on and potentially invest in for that molecule in the future?","And then, secondly, just on Medicare Part B. You alluded to that and called it out in your risks and in the Q. What are you learning in the comment period and will you be submitting comments or are you aware of other comments? And do you think there's any chance that this is going to be modified or altered in schedule or scope? Thank you.","George D. Yancopoulos - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories & Chief Scientific Officer","All right. Well, this is George. I'll take the dupilumab question. I guess the most important thing that we learned from the two Phase 3 studies in atopic dermatitis was, number one, that we confirmed the impressive efficacy and the important benefit to patients in essentially every single efficacy readout that we explored. So, obviously, that's very gratifying and comforting when one actually sees data that is as promising as your earlier data and suggests it can really make an important difference to moderate to severe patients who really need new therapies to attack their disease.","In addition, the safety profile was also very comforting. And we report extensively on it and it really does suggest that it's going to have a very important benefit\/risk profile for patients. I think that basically for atopic dermatitis, it really means that it's all green lights and all speed ahead and that we're really excited that we could be really bringing forward, as the FDA has designated, a Breakthrough Therapy for these patients that need it.","As you know, we also have a pivotal study in asthma that's already been read out and we're in the midst of our first Phase 3, which is now our second confirmatory study, in that indication as well. So dupilumab is a very, very exciting program. And as I already told you about today, I told you that in terms of the atopic dermatitis population, we're also moving to the pediatric population there as well, which is also an important unmet need area. Bob?","Robert J. Terifay - Executive Vice President, Commercial","In terms of the Part B, we fully understand that healthcare costs need to be appropriately controlled in this country. However, the approach that has been proposed by Medicare Part B would limit options for physicians and patients to give appropriate therapies to patients who need them.","For example, in the case of the retinal space, you could lead to physicians being required simply by the economics that are in place to force them to use an off-label repackaged bevacizumab, which, at least in the Protocol T trial, was shown in DME not to be as effective as the other therapies. They could be forced to use this for economic reasons.","We see that a number of manufacturers as well as a number of Congressmen and patient advocacy groups recognize that you have to preserve physician choice. And so there will be a number of complaints and letters going into Congress, including our own.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, just to add on it, there are literally hundreds of Congressmen who have said that this should not be done. There are others who've said that the unintended consequences that we're concerned about must be managed. The retinal groups, the ophthalmology groups and that's not to mention all of the other interested parties, such as cancer and what have you. So I think many observers, of which we're not experts on, but many observers in Washington would suggest that this seems unlikely. But we're certainly going to do our best on this as well.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much.","Michael S. Aberman - Senior VP-Strategy & Investor Relations","And I'm going to remind people to try to keep themselves to one question. I'll let this one slide this time, Geoff.","Operator","And our next question is from Chris Raymond from Raymond James.","Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Yeah, so just one question here. So just on the PD-1, I'm sort of struck by the news that this cutaneous squamous cell trial could be pivotal. Yeah, I know Sanofi broke that news last week, but I was wondering if you could provide a little more color on where this trial fits in with the overall development plan? Just looking at clintrials.gov (sic) [clinicaltrials.gov] (34:44), there's not a ton of detail. And obviously there's a lot of breadth of labeling potential with that type of molecule. If you could maybe talk about where you plan to take this, that'd be great.","George D. Yancopoulos - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories & Chief Scientific Officer","Well, we are implementing a highly integrated and very comprehensive effort in immunotherapy. And this is obviously a very competitive area and I think that there's a lot of room for people to make inroads here, provide new approaches and new benefits to patients and really make a difference in certain disease settings and just think that we have a very robust and highly integrated and comprehensive effort here, and we intend to hopefully deliver important new approaches to patients.","Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks.","Michael S. Aberman - Senior VP-Strategy & Investor Relations","Okay, next question?","George D. Yancopoulos - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories & Chief Scientific Officer","Yep.","Operator","Our next question is from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on all the pipeline progress. So just wondering for dupi, I know it's a little bit early, but as we just think about the launch trajectory...","Leonard S. Schleifer - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Taking a shot at dupilumab. I think the fact is obviously we can't answer that directly, Terence. And since we and all of us, everybody has been wrong multiple times, that these things unfold as they unfold. The factors to consider obviously is that you're already obviously seeing the PBMs taking notice of this. I saw this in somebody's report that this is the next big class that they're worried about. There are a lot of patients out there that might fit our label, assuming we get the label. But I'm sure there's going to be utilization management, make sure they've tried their topical steroids or whatever that they really have the right diagnosis, et cetera, et cetera,","Now, whether there'll be \"warehousing of patients,\" people lining up to get it, it's just really impossible for us to tell. But I would suspect that this will be one of those launches that will be patient-driven that as people get on the drug, if the results in the real world are anywhere as close to the results we've seen in our Phase 3 trial so far, I'm sure that that patient drive will be tremendous, because this is a terrible disease that people have been suffering with for decades, adults now who have it, without anything at all new to really help them and make a difference.","And if you look at, whether you measure this by quality-of-life metrics, the increased risk of suicide, just the terrible burden that this puts on patients, we're optimistic that this drug can make a difference for them. So we're hopeful for a good launch. But how the actual ramp and whether it takes us a while to get it going and what the coverage looks like and all that, just too early to tell.","Next question?","Michael S. Aberman - Senior VP-Strategy & Investor Relations","Next question, operator?","Operator","Our next question is from Adnan Butt from RBC Capital Markets.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, good morning. This is Arshad (38:06) on from Adnan. Thank you for the question. Could you please put the fasinumab safety data into context, given that the FDA seems to have already been focused on safety in general?","Leonard S. Schleifer - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, maybe I'll make a brief comment and if George has anything to add, obviously he's welcome. Our feeling, as George said in his talk, is that we did something which we think was pretty important, which is we did an extensive and detailed screening of patients with X-rays and MRIs before they were ever exposed to drug. And that demonstrated that some of these things that people were concerned about might be somewhat induced by drug were really fairly prevalent in the population, whether they be insufficiency fractures or whether they be osteonecrosis or so on. So I think that that was important.","And I do think that the FDA has come around to thinking that this has to be looked at carefully and that's what we're doing. And the right patients have to be studied and that's also what we're doing. They also have had concerns about whether or not any one of these drugs individually or as a class could have effect on sympathetic nerves and sympathetic nervous system function. We also looked at that pretty well and we'll have more to tell you about that in upcoming meetings. But we didn't see any evidence at all.","So that so far things look reasonable, but, I think as George said, it's a small study and we're underpowered to pick up very small increases in some of these things and that's why we're going to study thousands and thousands of patients in our Phase 3 program.","George D. Yancopoulos - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories & Chief Scientific Officer","Yeah, and to add to that, I think that one of the biggest underlying fears for this class, certainly by outside people, but also by ourselves, was that the very small increase in certain arthropathy events, certain joint pathologies, that were seen particularly in combination with NSAIDs, but also a small increase even in monotherapy, might actually be reflecting a much bigger, somewhat invisible, problem that there was a bigger, destructive process that would then be seen over longer periods in time and so forth.","And this is why we did this, as Len said, this extensive imaging of both the index joints but also non-index joints to see whether overall the skeleton was really changing. And as we've already said, the thing that was very gratifying was that, unfortunately for these patients suffering from this important problem, there is already significant skeletal pathology at baseline. These patients have these so-called subchondral insufficiency fractures and you can even see undiagnosed osteonecrosis in these patients and so forth.","And these events, both in the index and the non-index joints, were not dramatically increased by treating with NGF. And one fear, for example, was that these asymptomatic subchondral insufficiency fractures may be happening much more frequently with drug and then eventually leading to much higher incidences of events down the line. And so it was very comforting not to see this. That said, there remains, as with any drug and certainly with a drug this active, there will continue to be risks associated with treatment. But one has to balance that with all the benefits that could be provided.","Pain is a very serious problem for a lot of people, especially people suffering from osteoarthritis. And the options, obviously, as you know, are quite limiting with no new mechanism of action drugs added to this field for decades. And so the possibility and the opportunity of a new mechanism of action class that might have a different profile and also different risk profile as compared to, for example, opiates and NSAIDs and other drugs with serious risks, we're think can offer important options for patients.","Michael S. Aberman - Senior VP-Strategy & Investor Relations","This is Michael. I just want to make sure I added because, when talking about pain, you really have to keep in the context of really what is an epidemic in the United States in terms of drug opioid abuse and overdose, with quadrupling in the number of opioid deaths in the past number of years. As well as from the CDC website, nearly half a million people died from drug overdoses from 2000 to 2014. Almost 80 Americans die every day from an opioid overdose. So I just think we have to keep into context that having new pain medicines is really important.","George D. Yancopoulos - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories & Chief Scientific Officer","Yes. Okay, good. Next question?","Michael S. Aberman - Senior VP-Strategy & Investor Relations","Next question?","Operator","Our next question is from Ying Huang from Bank of America.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just first on the CMS proposal again. I think you guys mentioned in DME you do have superiority against some of the other medications. But in AMD, I was wondering if you guys can provide your thought on whether it could be classified as so-called therapeutically similar class and, therefore, to be subject to a reference pricing in the second Phase of that demo?","And then also on the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trials. I know that trial is 90% powered to show 15% CV risk reduction. Maybe you guys can provide us on whether you think the payers would be excited about that 15% CV risk reduction. Thank you.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","So, Ying, which question do you want answered? Because Michael's holding up a sign that says one question, even though he loves you. He said, which one does he want?","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Len, you're the boss.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Not true. Which question, Ying?","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Maybe second. It's probably more important from my perspective.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well, I think that the OUTCOMES data, as we saw with ezetimibe, it's not simply a matter of statistical significance. I think what people will be looking for is the robustness and the quality of the dataset, et cetera, et cetera. Certainly we powered the study based on expert input of where they thought that would be, if we saw the result, that would be a meaningful result for patients.","But, of course, it's not just one number, it's not just a statistical significance. You want to see how the whole dataset looks like. And I think somebody said about ezetimibe, they have statistical significance, but, if you blinked, you could miss it. And we tried to design a study and set the parameters such that if we saw the result, we could feel confident about it that we were making a difference in these outcomes to patients.","Robert J. Terifay - Executive Vice President, Commercial","Ying, I can't leave the EYLEA one hanging out there, I'm sorry. If you...","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate that.","Robert J. Terifay - Executive Vice President, Commercial","...remember back to the VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 studies, we actually designed studies that compared ourselves to what was the standard of care branded agent, which was ranibizumab monthly. And we studied EYLEA both monthly as well as every eight weeks. And what we saw is very similar results with the EYLEA every eight-week dosing to the Lucentis every four-week dosing. This is a major advantage to elderly patients who can't get into the physician's office on a regular basis. And so they are not therapeutically equivalent; EYLEA has a longer durability of effect.","I would also point out there are data in a subset of patients in the VIEW studies that indicates that there are patients who are more refractory to anti-VEGF therapy, especially those who've received prior anti-VEGF therapy who may need more anti-VEGF treatment. And what we're seeing in those patients, we're able to dry them up better with EYLEA than with Lucentis.","George D. Yancopoulos - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories & Chief Scientific Officer","This is George, I also have to make a few comments here. And I think really Bob touched on an important point, that our drug showed compared to the, at the time, optimum standard of care that doubling the interval could produce at least as good results from the terms of visual acuity, but also even better results in terms of controlling vascular leak and retinal swelling and so forth.","And I think that we all have to really consider that maybe \u2013 and I hate to say it, because some people are going to say, hey, you know, don't challenge the physicians here. But I think the physicians here, and we understand the limitations of the real world in practice, are doing a huge disservice to patients in terms of the systematic undertreatment that is probably occurring in this field.","There is an enormous drive to try to get patient less trips to the office, less injections. And you've probably seen the release of recent data with long four-year and five-year follow-on. And after you take the patients over the more controlled phases of the study where they're getting, in general, in most studies, monthly treatment on a very carefully monitored treatment, they essentially lose almost all their vision gain over these later years of four-year and five-year follow-ups.","And we believe that the data and the evidence suggest that this is really due to systematic under-treatment, patients getting less and less treatment. And particularly in that setting, if you want to deliver the best care to patients, you should be delivering the best agent that has the longest duration of action. And we think that the only agent that's really demonstrated that convincingly is EYLEA.","And so I think to save patient's visions, you saw the long-term trials, patients are losing visions. Physicians are not doing the right things by their patients. They're systematically under-treating. And particularly in those settings, they should be getting the best drugs that protects patients against this vision loss.","Michael S. Aberman - Senior VP-Strategy & Investor Relations","Okay.","George D. Yancopoulos - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories & Chief Scientific Officer","And it would be a disservice if, in fact, incentives and so forth are driven to the use of an inferior agent, which will cost patients. Think about it, you're a patient who can't drive. You're a patient who can't read. You're now given a drug, all of a sudden you gain two lines, three lines of vision. That changes the world literally for you, okay? You could do things you can't do before. And now we develop a system that allows you to lose that? I think that we have to think about how we want to practice medicine in this country if we create a situation that allows that.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think the physicians, George, are right there with you. And it would be hard for me to imagine that once the physicians are heard on this subject, that an off-label, inferior product based on a government study could set the standard.","George D. Yancopoulos - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories & Chief Scientific Officer","Okay. Next question?","Michael S. Aberman - Senior VP-Strategy & Investor Relations","Yeah, next question, please?","Operator","Our next question is from Robyn Karnauskas from Citigroup.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on all the innovation. I feel like one of the few companies where there's so much going on the call and you provide clarity.","I guess I'm going to go sarilumab and ask a question about the opportunity. Because Sanofi does highlight this a lot and I feel like those of us on the Street are more skeptical about the opportunity. Help us understand what your view is of sarilumab and how you think about this. It's a competitive space, there's stuff coming up behind it from AbbVie. How are you thinking about the strength of that data? And do you have any understanding of the strategy and how you could take share from the current market or expand the current market? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","So, Robyn, thanks for your comments about innovation. Obviously, George and I have tried to build a company for the last three decades that is truly driven by science innovation, so we appreciate you taking note of that. And Bob can comment without giving away all of our intricate strategy on what the opportunity for IL-6 might be.","Robert J. Terifay - Executive Vice President, Commercial","Robyn, as I pointed out earlier, I think that when Genentech launched ACTEMRA into the U.S. marketplace, it was very much a market dominated by growing TNF inhibitors. And they were a single company trying to educate on the role of IL-6 in rheumatoid arthritis and the potential benefits of using an IL-6 inhibitor earlier.","It is always more beneficial, we've seen this, for example, in the statin class, where, as more and more statins became available, they grew the market. We believe that this is the opportunity for this class, that we educate physicians more, one, is as I said earlier, on the central role of IL-6 in both the signs and symptoms of RA, but as well as in joint destruction, which we feel is very important. Physicians need to understand, they shouldn't stay with a TNF inhibitor, which over time, each additional TNF inhibitor does not deliver the efficacy that they received with the first TNF inhibitor. So there's a benefit of moving to a new class. And IL-6 really does have a central role, both in symptoms as well as bone destruction.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Also, just to add, there's some historical accidents have occurred here in the order the drugs came along and having to do with pricing. And with methotrexate being the mainstay, it's a very cheap drug, it's effective. But it's not the most innocuous drug in the world from its side effects and what have you. And there are many people who, I'm told, particularly women, who don't like being on the product and that there really seems to be movement towards monotherapy.","And, remember, methotrexate, some have argued that for some drugs, methotrexate provides the immunosuppression for the biologics so that any immune-related, if you will, blockade of effect doesn't appear as quickly. Suffice it to say, maybe George can comment on that more, but I can say that when we look head to head against the market leader, AbbVie, in the monotherapy setting, you've seen our data. We had a superior result.","Robert J. Terifay - Executive Vice President, Commercial","And I also do, just to finish the story, sarilumab is not a me-too drug. I don't want to do cross-comparison trial data right now, but I think if you look at the prescribing information for subcutaneous ACTEMRA and you look at the results we reported with our product, we are very encouraged about the product profile that our product, which has higher binding affinity to IL-6, is going to offer in the marketplace.","Maybe George wants to comment on that.","George D. Yancopoulos - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories & Chief Scientific Officer","I think it's important to just highlight a few things, because, once again, it all comes down to the patients and doing the best by the patients. And I think, as Bob and Len already mentioned, if you look at the science, it doesn't necessarily make sense to start all patients, particularly patients in monotherapy settings, with a TNF. And that may be a historical accident. It also doesn't make sense to just continue patients cycling on TNF if there is an alternative that can deliver them better symptomatic relief.","And so we think that there's enormous opportunity for this class. And importantly in this class, and as Bob said, one of the most important things that I think that patients and physicians are concerned about is irreversible bone loss. That's one thing that you can't get back and that's one thing that's looked at in this field.","And as you know, ACTEMRA is now growing through a subcutaneous formulation. And if you look in the label, according to the subcutaneous formulation that's used there in terms of inhibition of the irreversible bone loss, there's less than 50% inhibition by the subcutaneous formulation in terms of ACTEMRA in terms of the irreversible bone loss. If you look at our study, we offer two doses, and if they both get approved, our higher subcutaneous dose gives greater than 90% inhibition of irreversible bone loss.","So, as Bob said, these are not identical agents. This is not a me-too. There's important differences. And there's an important opportunity to do better by patients in terms of the monotherapy setting and in terms of not just cycling through drugs that maybe aren't working for the patients and putting them on a different mechanism of action drug.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","I'll also say that there have been, let me call it, commercial gains that have been played out there in that in negotiations that have gone on with the PBMs where people have used certain multiple indications as a way to drive use in other indications from what we can tell. And I think the PBMs are sort of wising up to that and moving to indication-specific pricing and negotiations. And so we actually feel that we might be entering the market at a reasonably good time where, with a lot of dynamics going on and a good product, you can make inroads.","Now, I don't think this is going to be an easy road. And I don't think you can just assume that we're going to jump in and grab huge market share right off the bat, but I think we can build this into a significant opportunity over time. It's more of going to be like a slow and steady.","Michael S. Aberman - Senior VP-Strategy & Investor Relations","All right. Next question?","Operator","Next question is from Alethia Young from Credit Suisse.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on everything you have going on there. Just going back to the Praluent trends that you said in your script. I guess you said that Praluent got 50% of the new scripts. Can you talk about what behavior might be driving that 50%? Is it something that you're adjusting or changing that's resounding in the profile?","Leonard S. Schleifer - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think it's hard to know for sure. And we only have another minute here, so I don't want to get into great detail. But one thing that is important is that there's new coverage that's come into play, particularly in the Medicare space, which was really only recently coming on. And those plans that chose, which was most of them, a single agent as the priority drug, we were I think selected about 90% of the time. So, I think that there's some new coverage, new utilization management. And obviously, we're working hard at this.","But I don't think you can consider one week a trend, whether it's going one direction. It's just a data point. But right now the market seems to be split roughly more or less equally based on that data point. How that goes over time, obviously that's what the competitive marketplace is all about.","George D. Yancopoulos - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories & Chief Scientific Officer","But I think our most important effort right now has to be on making sure that the right patients get access to drug. And that's really where both companies are focused. It's an important thing for the class. The patients who need drug have to get an opportunity to have access to it.","Michael S. Aberman - Senior VP-Strategy & Investor Relations","Operator, we have time for just one last question.","Operator","And our last question is from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for fitting me in. I just had two related Praluent questions. You said that two payers had loosened their criteria. I'm wondering if you can just be more specific about that, who they were and exactly what they loosened. And then you were talking about an improvement in the number of Rxs that were filled. Is that just more people getting through the utilization management criteria, or could you just be more specific about that comment as well? Thanks.","George D. Yancopoulos - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories & Chief Scientific Officer","Sure. Our contracts with the payers don't allow us to disclose the specific ones who've changed their utilization management criteria. But what I can say, as I did earlier, what they did is removed a trial period of 12-plus weeks of ZETIA after maximally tolerated statin therapy from their utilization management criteria. That was setting up a delay in access to PCSK9 inhibition. The physicians were having to put them on ZETIA and then wait. And it was causing a real backlog for the doctors. So, that has been removed by two of the payers.","In terms of the improvement of the number of people going through the hub. I think what I could say is, one, as Len said, payers have come on board now. And, especially Medicare patients, now are getting access to therapy. I think the other thing is that the physicians as well as the specialty pharmacies are better understanding how to make the prescription process better.","Now, it's not easy right now. We continue to work on improving it. But at least it has gotten better for some patients.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","So, just one last comment. This is Len. In our effort to answer all your questions, what we're trying to do is give you some insight into our thinking, like why we went forward with something. We're not trying to make cross-trial comparisons, per se. We're trying to give you an idea of why we went forward and what we saw or how we felt we were differentiated. What we can say out in the marketplace obviously will be limited based on what we actually get in our various labels that are pending.","And, with that, I would just say that we're pleased that the innovation machine continues to turn and produce lots of exciting things that we'll hope to update you in the scientific literature and in presentations that are upcoming. Lots of things George did not get a chance to talk about that are exciting.","So we appreciate your interest and we hope to continue to be able to update you over time. Thank you very much.","Michael S. Aberman - Senior VP-Strategy & Investor Relations","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Michael Aberman, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations for Regeneron. Please proceed, Dr. Aberman.","Michael Aberman","Good morning and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' fourth quarter and full year 2012 conference call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website, under events and presentations for 30 days.","Joining me on the call today is Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President of Regeneron Labs and Chief Scientific Officer; Murray Goldberg, Chief Financial Officer; and Robert Terifay, Senior Vice President, Commercial. After our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for Q&A.","I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call that are not historical in nature may be forward-looking statements about Regeneron and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events and our actual results may differ materially. Such remarks may include but are not limited to those related to Regeneron and its products and businesses, sales forecasts, financial forecasts, development programs, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, intellectual property and competition, all of which involve a number of risks and uncertainties.

Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law.","GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed on today's calls. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP are available in our financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website. Once our call concludes, the IR team will be available to answer further questions.","With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.","Leonard Schleifer","Thank you, Michael, and good morning everyone. 2012 was a good year for Regeneron, as it marked our transformation from a development stage company to a profitable biotech company, driven by the highly successful launch of EYLEA or aflibercept injection, one of the top product launches in the history of our industry.","With fourth quarter EYLEA U.S. net sales of $276 million, and 2012 full year U.S. EYLEA net sales reaching $838 million. We are pleased to report that fourth quarter '12 was our fourth consecutive profitable quarter with non-GAAP net income of $171 million or $1.47 per diluted share, and full year non-GAAP net income of $530 million or $4.66 per diluted share.","As a reminder, non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash compensation expense, non-cash interest expense and non-cash income taxes, all of which Murray will discuss in greater detail later.","The ability to deliver such strong earnings with over $0.5 billion of non-GAAP profit in the first full year that EYLEA was on the market, while continuing to invest in our robust pipeline highlights the unique business model we have created at Regeneron. The EYLEA launch continues to go very well and we expect strong growth in the U.S. in 2013, as Bob Terifay will describe in more detail.","As we announced earlier in the year, we estimate full year 2013 EYLEA U.S. net sales will grow approximately 50% to between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion. Outside the U.S., our partner Bayer HealthCare has launched EYLEA across multiple geographies, including Japan, Australia and several countries in Europe and South America.","In the fourth quarter, the first quarter of sales, Bayer recorded ex-United States EYLEA net sales of approximately $19 million. We will not comment on the details of the ex-U.S. launch on this call, as that should be left to our partner Bayer HealthCare to discuss. But we can say that we are very pleased with the progress to date.","We are also pleased with our regulatory achievements in 2012. We received approval for EYLEA in the United States in the second indication macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion. And our partner Sanofi received U.S. approval in August 2012 for ZALTRAP in combination with FOLFIRI for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that is resistant to or has progressed following an oxaliplatin regimen. And just last week, Sanofi received approval for ZALTRAP in the European Union.","While ZALTRAP will not have the same impact on our net income as EYLEA, because of a smaller market opportunity and our repayment obligations to Sanofi, especially in the early launch years. ZALTRAP U.S. net sales as reported by Sanofi are off to a strong start, with U.S. net sales of $23 million in the fourth quarter of '12 and $32 million from the launch in late August and until the end of last year.","Our pipeline also made significant advances in 2012, which George will discuss in a minute. While 2012 was a transformational year, we see a bright future with the ongoing global launch of EYLEA, expansion of EYLEA into new indications, and the additional opportunities in our pipeline.","With that, let me turn the call over to George Yancopoulos, my partner and Regeneron's Chief Scientific Officer, to discuss our pipeline in a little more detail. George will be followed by Bob Terifay, Senior Vice President of Commercial, who will elaborate on our commercial activities. And finally, Murray Goldberg, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our financial performance during 2012 and provide some guidance for 2013 expenses. George?","George Yancopoulos","Thanks, Len. 2012 was also a good year for Regeneron's research and development organization, and I will highlight a few accomplishments and upcoming milestones from our pipeline.","For EYLEA, as you just heard from Len, we received approval and an additional indication in 2012, macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion. We also initiated an additional trial in patients with macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion, and we fully enrolled our U.S. and ex-U.S. Phase 3 DME trials.","We look forward to getting the topline results from the one-year primary endpoint for the ex-U.S. DME Phase 3 trial, VIVID-DME by the end of the year. As a reminder, for DME in the EU, a one-year primary efficacy endpoint is required for regulatory approvals. While in the U.S. it has been a two-year efficacy endpoint.","Turning to Regeneron727, our PCSK9 antibody targeting lowering of LDL cholesterol, for which we have just had the generic name approved alirocumab. In 2012, we presented and published positive Phase 2 data and subsequently initiated a 22,000 patient Phase 3 program ODYSSEY, which includes an 18,000 patient cardiovascular outcomes trial.","While the majority of the Phase 2 results will emerge in 2014, we now expect the first Phase 3 trial in the program ODYSSEY MONO to have data available in the third quarter of 2013. While this is a small trial in a monotherapy setting, it will represent the first Phase 3 trials results for PCSK9 program.","In 2012, we also fully enrolled the first of our Phase 3 trial for sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody called the SARIL-RA-MOBILITY trial. We initiated an additional Phase 3 trial SARIL-RA-TARGET, and will shortly initiate additional Phase 3 trial in the SARIL-RA program.","Just last month, we announced that we have positive proof-of-concept data for our IL-4 receptor antibody, Regeneron668, for which we also have a generic name, dupilumab, in two allergic diseases, atopic dermatitis and allergic asthma. We are particularly excited about this program as these diseases remain areas of a high degree of unmet medical needs and we believe it's locking both the IL-4 and 13 pathways, with our antibody has the potential to be a disease modifying therapy.","Obviously, it is still early in terms of drug development, but we look forward to presenting the atopic dermatitis data at the American Academy of Dermatology Meeting in March, in Miami, and the asthma data at a conference later in the year. We anticipate starting Phase 2b trials for both indications in the middle of this year.","Before turning the call over to Bob Terifay, I want to also mention that we will focus in our investor calls, in our late-stage pipelines we invest a lot of time and resources to our early-stage pipeline, technology development and our discovery efforts. Therefore, I want to quickly highlight some of these efforts. Specifically, we have made significant progress in our bispecific antibody program, our long-acting antibody program, one that which we call Catch and Release, as well as our antibody-drug conjugant or ADC efforts.","We hope to provide more details on these programs as the year progresses. But like our VelocImmune platform, we believe we are developing best-in-class approaches with these next generation antibody like therapeutics.","With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Bob to provide an update on the EYLEA launch.","Robert Terifay","Thank you, George. We're very pleased with the rapid acceptance of EYLEA and the successful U.S. launch. In fact, according to our calculations EYLEA represents the third most successful launch in the history of the U.S. biopharmaceutical industry. This success is a reflection of the truly differentiated product profile for EYLEA as well as the strong execution by our commercial team, both in the field as well as inside in supporting roles.","In the fourth quarter, we continued to see strong uptick for EYLEA, despite some challenges that we face that included Hurricane Sandy on the East Coast and the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. During the fourth quarter, overall penetration of EYLEA into the wet AMD market continue to grow both in terms of newly treated patients as well as those switching from bevacizumab and ranibizumab.","Based on the updated qualitative market research surveys that we conducted during the fourth quarter, in terms of unit volume, bevacizumab represented 47% of treated eyes, ranibizumab 30%, and EYLEA captured approximately 22% of the wet AMD market. Of the patients, who were newly treated with EYLEA approximately 65% were new to anti-VEGF therapy and 35% were switches from existing therapy. Importantly, during the fourth quarter we continue to gain new accounts, many of them were previously mainly bevacizumab users.","Also during the fourth quarter, we saw the beginning of our penetration into the macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion or CRVO market. Our qualitative market research during the quarter suggest that we gained 10% of the CRVO market at the end of 2012. We hope to continue that momentum in CRVO throughout 2013. As a reminder, our market research is based on position questionnaires, and therefore is qualitative in nature.","Patient access remains very important for Regeneron. Our EYLEA 4U program has become a valuable resource for patients, physicians and their practices, to help ensure that patients who need EYLEA have access. As an example of our commitment to patient access, this year we've significantly increased our charitable donations to independent foundations to provide co-pay assistance.","Just last month, EYLEA received a permanent reimbursement code or J-Code from Medicare. Since EYLEA is a buy and build product, confidence in reimbursement is an important factor in the prescribing decision for many physicians. We believe that the permanent J-Code will make some physicians more comfortable using EYLEA. We're already seeing faster turnaround times for claims processing from the Medicare carriers.","Turning to our guidance for EYLEA U.S. sales for 2013. We considered multiple factors, including on the positive side: one, the carry-over wet AMD patients, who started EYLEA treatment throughout 2012; two, the permanent J-code that we received last month; three, the ongoing launce in macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion; and four, continued share gains from both ranibizumab and bevacizumab in the wet AMD market.","This may be partially offset by the slowing and new account acquisition, and an increased duration between injections, as patients move from the initial monthly dosing period. With those factors in mind, you've heard that we forecast U.S. EYLEA sales for 2013 of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, which represents an approximately 50% increase over 2012.","Outside of the United States, Bayer has launched EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD in Japan, Australia, and several European and South American countries. As you may know, the actual market launch in Europe occurs in the staggered fashion, as each country has a different process for obtaining pricing approval.","That said, we're pleased with the progress to date and the feedback that we're getting from Bayer, which you'll hopefully hear from them about in the next few weeks, when they do their earnings call. Net U.S. sales reported to us by Bayer for the fourth quarter were $19 million, largely from Japan and Australia, the first countries where the product was launched outside of the United States.","I'd now like to turn from ophthalmology to oncology, where we made our first foray in the third quarter of 2012 with the U.S. approval of ZALTRAP, also known as ziv-aflibercept, for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer was progressed following treatment with an oxaliplatin-containing regimen that could have included bevacizumab. We co-commercialized ZALTRAP with our collaborator Sanofi. Sanofi, however, is currently responsible for the field based selling effort.","Interest in the uses of ZALTRAP and its approved medical setting, where historically there was no therapies demonstrated to improve overall survival in combination with the standard of care chemotherapy regimen FOLFIRI continues. This is highlighted by the $23 million in net sales recorded by Sanofi in the fourth quarter of 2012, and $32 million between launch in late August through the end of last year. With the recent approval of ZALTRAP in the EU, we look forward to the launch fallout throughout 2013.","With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Office, Murray Goldberg.","Murray Goldberg","Thank you, Bob, and good morning to everyone. I'm very pleased to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2012.","As Len noted at the outset of this call, but certainly warrants repeating, the fourth quarter of 2012 was our fourth consecutive profitable quarter with non-GAAP net income of $171 million or $1.47 per diluted share. Full year non-GAAP net income was $530 million or $4.66 per diluted share.","This strong bottomline performance was driven by U.S. EYLEA net sales of $276 million in the fourth quarter and $838 million for the full year. EYLEA inventory held by U.S. distributors at the end of the year was consistent with prior quarters at about one to two weeks of sales.","Sanofi collaboration revenue was $105 million for the fourth quarter and $424 for the full year. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line includes reimbursement of our R&D expenses for pre-clinical and clinical research within our antibody collaboration and any ZALTRAP R&D expenses, recognition and\/or amortization of upfront and milestone payments, and our share of the profit or loss associated with the ongoing launch of ZALTRAP.","In the fourth quarter of 2012, Sanofi reported $23 million of ZALTRAP net sales in the U.S., and the Sanofi collaboration revenue line included a $6 million loss for us, associated with global pre-marketing activities and the U.S. launch of ZALTRAP. For the full year 2012, ZALTRAP U.S. net sales were $32 million, and the Sanofi collaboration revenue line included a $26 million loss for us, associated with global pre-marketing activities and commercialization of ZALTRAP.","Our share of loss in 2012 was more than offset by a $50 million milestone payment we received in August 2012 related to ZALTRAP approval in the U.S. As a reminder, we do not anticipate a meaningful positive contribution from the commercialization of ZALTRAP in the near-term, because of our obligation to repay Sanofi from our share of ZALTRAP profits, where 50% of the ZALTRAP development expenses that they have funded.","Bayer collaboration revenue was $22 million for the fourth quarter and $70 million for the full year. Similar to the Sanofi collaboration revenue line, Bayer collaboration revenue includes cost sharing of EYLEA development expenses that we incurred, recognition and\/or amortization of upfront and milestone payments, and our share of net profit from EYLEA sales outside the United States.","For the full year 2012, Bayer collaboration revenue included a total of $25 million in milestone payments. A $15 million milestone payment that we received in the third quarter for marketing approval of EYLEA in Japan and a $10 million milestone payment in the fourth quarter for pricing approval of EYLEA in Japan.","In the fourth quarter, Bayer reported net sales of EYLEA outside the U.S. of approximately $19 million. As with Sanofi and ZALTRAP, as EYLEA becomes profitable, we are obligated to repay Bayer a 50% of the ex-U.S. EYLEA development expenses that they have funded. Each quarter that repayment is equal to the lesser of 5% of the outstanding repayment obligation or our share of that quarter's ex-U.S. EYLEA profits.","During the fourth quarter of 2012, our share of collaboration profit from sales of EYLEA outside the U.S., including royalties on sales in Japan was $4 million. This was fully offset by our repayment obligation to Bayer. At the end of 2012, our remaining repayment obligation to Bayer was approximately $273 million. The components of both the Sanofi and Bayer collaboration revenue lines are detailed in our Form 10-K for 2012, which we expect to file tomorrow and will also be shown in future quarterly filings.","Non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $30 million or 10.6% of total net product sales in the fourth quarter, and $83 million or 9.7% of total net product sales for the full year. As a reminder, COGS includes royalty expense in connection with our agreement with Genentech relating to ophthalmic sales of EYLEA in the United States.","Turing to R&D, non-GAAP R&D expense was $163 million in the fourth quarter and $572 million for the full year. If we net out R&D reimbursements from our collaborators from our R&D expense line, our net non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense was $48 million for the fourth quarter and $157 million for the full year. Thus, more than 70% of our R&D expense was funded by Sanofi and Bayer.","As you may remember, we had guided towards fourth quarter unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense of $50 million to $90 million. Actual unreimbursed R&D expense in 2012 was below guidance, partly because our NGF antibody program remains on clinical hold. So we did not initiate our planned Phase 3 program in 2012.","That said, we do expect a significant increase in unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense in 2013 compared to 2012, with expenses of $275 million to $325 million. This increase in non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense is largely due to increased spending on EYLEA clinical programs compared to 2012, including the Phase 3 DME and BRVO trials; advancing unpartnered antibody programs such as Regeneron1400, which targets ErbB3; and three other antibodies to undisclosed targets through to proof-of-concept stage; and increased spending on early stage technologies, such as antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific antibodies and longer-acting antibody technologies.","In addition, as George mentioned, we expect results from one of the Phase 3 ODYSSEY trials for Regeneron727 or alirocumab later this year. If these data are positive, it would trigger the real-time sharing of 20% of subsequent Phase 3 development expenses for the ODYSSEY program. Estimates of all these expenses are included in our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D guidance.","Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $46 million in the fourth quarter and $172 million for the full year. We expect non-GAAP SG&A expense in 2013 to grow to $215 million to $235 million. This increase is largely due to two items; an increase in our contribution to independent co-pay foundations, as Bob mentioned, and the branded prescription drug fee that was part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. As a reminder, non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense exclude non-cash share-based compensation expense.","Turning to taxes. As we discussed in our last quarterly call, even though we have accumulated a large amount of NOLs in tax credits that could offset future taxable income, under GAAP, prior to the fourth quarter of 2012, we had a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets due to outstanding history of operating losses. As a result, we did not include any deferred tax assets on our balance sheet.","In the fourth quarter of 2012, in our GAAP earnings, we recognized a non-cash tax benefit of $336 million, primarily as a result of releasing substantially all of valuation allowance associated with our deferred tax assets. The decision to release the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter was made after we determined that it was more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would be realized.","One significant factor that influenced this decision was that our cumulative profits over the prior three years turned positive in the fourth quarter of 2012. As this income tax benefit is non-cash, we excluded it from our non-GAAP earnings.","Looking forward to 2013 and beyond, despite the significant net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards available to offset future cash tax liabilities, we expect to begin to recognize book income taxes in our GAAP earnings, using an estimated tax rate, which is expected to approximate statutory tax rates of around 40%.","That said, given the magnitude of our existing NOL and tax credit carry forwards, plus anticipated additional tax deductions we expect in connection with future employee exercises of stock options, we do not expect to pay any significant cash income taxes through at least 2014. Therefore, for our non-GAAP earnings we will continue to exclude non-cash taxes until we begin paying significant cash income taxes.","At that time, we anticipate that we will no longer exclude non-cash income tax expense from our non-GAAP net income. It's worth noting, that as our business operations expand outside of the United States, in a few years we could start to see a downward trend in our GAAP effective tax rate.","Turning to the bottomline as I said earlier, we reported non-GAAP net income of $530 million or $4.66 per fully diluted share for the full year 2012. Non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense related to our convertible senior notes, and non-cash income tax expense or benefit, including in 2012 the non-cash benefit from releasing substantially all of the valuation allowance associated with our deferred tax assets.","Our non-GAAP fully diluted average shares outstanding were approximately 117 million shares in the fourth quarter and approximately 115 million shares for the full year. The full year 2012 non-GAAP fully diluted average shares outstanding include about 16 million shares attributable to stock options, restricted stock and warrants, accounted for using the treasury method, and about 5 million shares associated with our convertible notes, accounted for using the if-converted method.","At December 31, 2012, we had approximately $1.2 billion of cash, marketable securities and trade receivable compared to $839 million at the end of 2011. In 2012, this consisted of $588 million of cash and marketable securities and $593 million of trade receivables almost all related EYLEA sales.","As you will recall in connection with the launch of EYLEA, we offered our distributors extended payment terms, and they in turn offered physicians extended payment terms of up to six months, to provide ample time for physicians to receive reimbursement for Medicare and other insurance providers for their EYLEA usage. Now that we have a permanent J-Code, we expect these EYLEA payment terms to decrease overtime, and thus the days that our EYLEA trade receivables, our outstanding, will also decrease.","Thank you. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Len.","Leonard Schleifer","Thanks, Murray, Bob, George. To wrap it up, 2012 was a great year, but we believe the future will be bright with the expansion of EYLEA globally ahead of us, and a robust product pipeline advancing.","With that, let me turn the call back to Michael for the question-and-answer portion of the call.","Michael Aberman","Thank you, Len. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call to Q&A. As we'd like to give as many people a chance to ask questions as possible, we do request you limit yourself to one question. As a reminder, our team will be available in our offices after the call for follow-up questions. Thank you. Operator, you can now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank","A question around market trends, you mentioned that Avastin now is about 41% of eyes, EYLEA 22%, I think you said Lucentis 37%. In the previous data set, these were up, there was EYLEA 20%, Avastin 50%, and Lucentis 30%. So I'm trying to understand has there been a shift according to your market research of Avastin to Lucentis, and have you seen any impact from compounding pharmacies in the New Year?","Leonard Schleifer","I can let Bob comment and Robyn thanks for the question. But before he does, just to really emphasize the point, these are qualitative research and they're not really intended to be able to track precisely market share from survey to survey into overtime. And Bob, you want to elaborate on that?","Robert Terifay","Yes, I agree, Len. The way we do the survey is we try to pick a representative sample of 200 retinal specialist but we do vary it as we go out overtime. So it's very hard to trend specific numbers. What I could tell you is that it does seem that Avastin sales are slowly declining with the launch of EYLEA. I don't think you can read that Lucentis is growing from Avastin sales. I think it was just the distribution of physicians that we had in the surgery.","In terms of the compounding question, we do see physicians are concerned. There are some safe there where the physicians are having to write prescriptions or spreadsheets with all the patients for whom compounded Avastin is being used but there has been no major market shift as of yet.","Michael Aberman","I just want to make sure. I think you mentioned some of those numbers wrong. So just I want to clarify what our survey results were, it was 47% for bevacizumab, 30% for ranibizumab and 22% for EYLEA.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Adnan Butt with RBC Capital Markets.","Adnan Butt - RBC Capital Markets","A bit more on guidance, if you can. Can you tell us, what share you expect from wet AMD and CRVO and maybe you can shed some light on CRVO. Do you expect similar dynamics to the wet AMD market there?","Leonard Schleifer","Bob, do you want to take that?","Robert Terifay","Let's start with the CRVO. We expect to see a slower uptick in CRVO. We're not seeing as many switches in the CRVO market and part of that maybe related to our labeling, which calls for monthly dosing in CRVO but we do expect to see continued growth in CRVO, just at a slower pace than wet AMD. In terms of giving market share guidance, we're not doing that at this time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Jason Kantor with Credit Suisse.","Jason Kantor - Credit Suisse","One of the things on your guidance, just want to understand your R&D and SG&A expense part of it. You kind of had big step ups in Q4 for both, and I'm wondering if those are sort of new going-forward levels to expect or if there is some aspect of the expense that was increased in Q4? And then if you could also quantify a little bit better on a quarterly or annual basis, what that 20% of the Phase 3 cost of ODYSSEY might look like?","Leonard Schleifer","So Murray will handle some of the guidance questions, which I think he may have covered in his talk and he can elaborate on it. As far as the expense is specifically related to the ODYSSEY trials, we're really not in a position to talk about, that's kind of competitive information.","Murray Goldberg","Also, how much that will cost us really depend on what trials are ongoing and how fast they are enrolling patients and what those costs are. We will try to incorporate some estimates into guidance, but we don't really have specific numbers on that that we can share with you at this point.","The reasons for that you are expecting increases in 2013, as I highlighted with EYLEA, now that's a two Phase 3 DME programs are fully enrolled. So those expenses have picked up in the BRVO trial is at Phase 3. That is also moving ahead. And then we have these other antibodies that are earlier stages, that are unpartnered, that will be eating up those expenses on our own as well as some investment and technologies.","In terms of the fourth quarter run rate, I indicated that the un-reimbursed R&D was $48 million for the fourth quarter. If you annualize that you'd get to roughly $200 million, but we've actually guided to a full year 2013 of $275 million to $325 million. So we're actually expecting an uptick from what we saw in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs","I was just wondering if you could remind us the DME trials about the design, of the different dosing arms and how we should think about, I guess, the importance of the every other months arms, just given how Roche centers for DME? And then the second question I had was REGN1500, is that the VEGF-antibody that you guys are developing or is it going after a different target?","Michael Aberman","In terms of the trial design for the DME trial, these are trials versus laser and there is two different dosing arms for EYLEA and every four week dosing arm as well as an every eight week dosing after a loading dose. Was your another question regarding the DME? Again, the European trial has a primary endpoint at one-year and U.S. trial was designed with the two-year primary endpoint.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs","I guess, just wondering how important, I guess the every eight-week dosing arm is in your opinion given kind of the pricing dynamics in DME with Lucentis?","Leonard Schleifer","Again, I think, we designed the trial to have both arms. Obviously, we demonstrated clinically equivalent efficacy in the wet AMD setting, we'll have to wait and see what the DME data show. I think it is little premature to talk about our strategy there; a, before we see our data; and b, before we launch in that indication. And you had a second follow-up question?","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs","Regeneron1500?","Leonard Schleifer","No, that's not our PDGF antibody.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Robert Baird.","Chris Raymond - Robert Baird","I know you're probably not going to be interested in going into too much detail on this, but have you had any discussions with Sanofi since the HSR notice. And can you give us any color on what they perhaps might have communicated to you, as what their intensions are going forward?","Leonard Schleifer","And my answer is, I'm not really interested in going into too much detail on that. It might be worth just taking this moment to explain that some of the HSR rules are somewhat outgained. But it might be worth just explaining as we understand and in terms of general, that the basic point is that when you want to acquire a stock in a company, if the stock that you own plus the stock that you want to acquire is over a certain threshold and that threshold is $500 million as adjusted, I believe it's $700 million now, you need to file a pre-action notice with the government and get approval.","It's an odd thing, because it doesn't matter the fact that the stock wasn't valued $500 million or $700 million, as the case maybe when they've bought it, even they it we'd appreciate it if they wanted to buy anymore shares, even a single share they needed to file this notice and get approval. I hope that clarifies at least in mechanics.","Chris Raymond - Robert Baird","So I wondered if you could also maybe give us an update on the status of the VEGF, PDGF combo as it relates to with the opt-in rights that Sanofi has on that drug. Where does that stand?","Robert Terifay","I think what we've said, all the antibodies and their collaboration are subject to opt-in we're happy to move forward either with or without Sanofi and depending no matter how that goes?","Leonard Schleifer","They have no rights to EYLEA just to clear.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough with BMO Capital.","Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital","I'm going to push my luck with the two-part question, but just the quick question from your survey. Do you have a sense of what market share you have in the frontline setting for the treatment na\u00efve patients? And then the second part of the two-part is, could you maybe just discuss the competitive landscape as you see it. Your thoughts on the competitive risk from the DARPin, but more broadly, whether you guys are considering any BD activity to try and stay on top of the emerging anti-VEGF therapy that might be competitive?","Leonard Schleifer","Let's take it in reversal. In terms of BD activity, I would say in a global sense, we look at all kinds of activities from discovery and development internally to BD to making sure that we're staying at the front of this obviously very important area. As far as how we view the DARPin's out there, George, you want to comment on that?","George Yancopoulos","Obviously, the DARPins are a long way off and there has been very little real data available on them. I guess, a lot of people were disappointed at this weekend the Angiogenesis meeting at Bascom Palmer that the investigators were allowed to really speak any further beyond the easy published data, but they did review to published data to see whether there was really any evidence in the publications to support the possibility that the anti-VEGF DARPin would have any advantages compared to existing agents.","I guess the conclusions that were reached at the presentation at the Angiogenesis meeting is that it didn't seem that they had any advantages, for example, the published data supporting the half life when interpreted by the investigators suggested that if anything, the half life was the same or actually shorter then some of the existing agents out there? And of course, we already know that they had some safety issues in their early studies and until yearend, hundreds if not thousands of patients, one can't really assess the actual safety situation.","So as I said, obviously it's very setting. There is a lot of question. We're following it very interested fashion. But as Len said, I mean, we not only have following outside developments, but we believe we have a lot of internal efforts that will keep us state-of-the-art and the leader in this field.","Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital","And now, there was a question on Jim or Bob, do you have any comment on whether or not our frontline market share, we have any information on that, I don't know if we have granularity on that?","Robert Terifay","Yes. So we're very encouraged. Our new business is ticking up quite well. We had a 20% market share in the new segment in the fourth quarter.","George Yancopoulos","Overall, unit volumes including Avastin and Lucentis.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citi","I'm going to ask you kind of a two questions. One, Lucentis had a label change, literally just very recently, where they are talking about PRN dosing after three months, but the label does sort of call out to be sub-optimal. What are you hearing from (inaudible) is that in any way probably you think will gain a little traction. And then secondly, just I'm not sure if you can help us understand in the guidance, how many injections you're kind of baking in this year versus last year?","Leonard Schleifer","So I don't think we can give you the specifics on the number of injections that are in our models. So you'll have to fly that, when you sell for your own. In terms of the recent Genentech label, you're correct, that the label, they did get a PRN dosing, that was specifically called out that it was not as effective compared to monthly dosing.","And then it required regular assessment. By comparison of course, not that you can't compare a product profiles per se, but you can compare labels. And our label says that you can with every other month dosing after loading those there is no monitoring requirement. And you had clinically equivalent efficacy. So we're very pleased with where our label is.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America","Your Santen partner in Japan has reported the penetration in wet AMD with EYLEA, is I think somewhere in the 25% range, after just a couple of months. Is that pace in line with your expectations? And maybe moreover is it specific to the demographics there or do you think that there is some broader conclusion about markets where you don't have much meaningful off-label of Avastin using the potential for EYLEA to penetrate?","Leonard Schleifer","The only thing I can say that is I'll give you qualitative answer. I know you've kind of asked the semi-quantitative question, but the qualitative answer is that Santen is an extremely good partner for Bayer and Regeneron in Japan. Obviously, they are a top ophthalmology company with a lot of reach to the physicians. So we're excited about how the launch is going and you'll get a little bit more color on that I think from Bayer.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.","Geoff Meacham - JPMorgan","Just on the PCSK9. I know it's competitive. What your competitors recently talked about not needing outcomes data for approval but needing it for a broader physician adoption. I just wanted to get your guys perspective on that when you think about the opportunity in this market?","Leonard Schleifer","So yes, you're correct and that competition the as well as we have stated that we do not believe the results of an outcome study are required for approval for a cholesterol lowering indications. But you're also correct that if you and you look back to the statins, if you have and if and when you can get in the label outcomes data, obviously that becomes more compelling to physicians in terms of uptake.","But I think that there is a sufficient unmet medical need here in terms of the millions of patients who either can't tolerate statins or can't get the goal at statins and who need more cholesterol lowering, that we're excited that this presents a very strong opportunity for our product.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau with Cowen.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen","My question is actually on sarilumab. Could you give us some sense of when we're going to see the Phase 3 data from that compound and what data you think you need to produce in order for it to get good acceptance in what's your relatively product field?","Robert Terifay","As we mentioned the MOBILITY trial is fully enrolled. That's our first Phase 3 trial. I think we expect those data probably towards early '14, is the timeline there. As you know, we've announced initiation of additional trials with sarilumab. We think we have a very robust program. And while it's crowded field, we do believe if you look at how the IL-6 class is doing, I mean we do think the class matters.","And recently our competitor Roche reported very great sales from Actemra. I think you'll see these classes is gaining acceptance as a very important treatment paradigm for patient too remove arthritis. So we're excited to unveil our complete Phase 3 program, which you should see relatively soon and at that time we can discuss in more detail what the package will look like.","Operator","Our next question comes from the Ted Tenthoff with Piper Jaffray.","Ted Tenthoff - Piper Jaffray","One quick question and I know we'll see a lot more detail in the K tomorrow, when it comes to recognition of the Bayer overseas sales and the offset, will all of that be included in the collaborative revenue line overall. Is that were all of that's going to tucked in?","George Yancopoulos","Yes, Ted. The sales doesn't show up anywhere in our income statement. Our share of the profits is one of the components of the Bayer collaboration revenue line and we've detailed that as I said in the 10-K and in future quarterly filing. But that's our share of the loss and then in the case of EYLEA our share of the profits, and then from that we subtract our repayment obligation to that particular quarter will be the net profits that we will recognize that will be part of the collaboration revenue line for Bayer and then the detailed and the breakout of that would be in the MD&A.","Ted Tenthoff - Piper Jaffray","And Murray, since I have you, can you repeat what you said about R&D guidance for 2013?","Murray Goldberg","We said that the un-reimbursed R&D expense would range between $275 million to $325 million is our current best estimate.","Operator","Our final question comes from Biren Amin with Jefferies.","Biren Amin - Jefferies","Just wanted to maybe ask you if you could share with us how we should think about the price of EYLEA in the European market?","Leonard Schleifer","That's a question that's not easily answered because it's not one market and there is many geographies and different pricing and discounts and what have you. And it's frankly quite complex, but back to Bayer, when they do their call coming up in not too distant future.","Michael Aberman","So with that let us conclude. Let me once again say, how pleased we were to transform the company to a profitable company and return somewhat value in terms of rewarding our shareholders, but we have a lot of exciting things to look forward to.

We will conduct a question and answer session towards the end of this conference call.  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Michael Aberman, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations for Regeneron.  Please proceed, Dr. Aberman.","Dr. Michael Aberman","Thank you, Operator, and good morning and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals\u2019 second quarter 2012 conference call.  An archive of this webcast will be available under Events and Presentations for 30 days.  Joining me on the call today is Dr. Leonard Schleifer, the Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; George Yancopoulos, Executive Vice President, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Regeneron Research Labs; Murray Goldberg, Chief Financial Officer, and Robert Terifay, Senior Vice President, Commercial.  After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the call for Q&A.","I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call that are not historical in nature may be forward-looking statements about Regeneron and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.  Actual events and our actual results may differ materially.  Such remarks may include but are not limited to those related to Regeneron and its products and business, sales forecasts, financial forecasts, development programs, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, intellectual property and competition, all of which involve a number of risks and uncertainties.  A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron\u2019s filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 which we filed this morning.  Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law.  ","GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed on today\u2019s call.  Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP are available in our financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website.  Once our call concludes, myself and the IR team will be available to answer further questions.","With me, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","Thanks, Michael.  Good morning to everyone.  In terms of the agenda for today, following my brief introductory remarks, George Yancopoulos, Chief Scientific Officer, will provide an update on our pipeline.  Bob Terifay, Senior Vice President of Commercial, will then provide an update on the EYLEA launch, and Murray Goldberg, our Chief Financial Officer will wrap up with financial highlights before I offer some concluding remarks and we open the call for questions and answers.","Today we are happy to report a very successful quarter as our team continues to execute on the ongoing launch of EYLEA, also known as intravitreal aflibercept injection.  We saw strong quarter-over-quarter growth with U.S. net sales of $194 million, representing a 57% increase over the last quarter.  Given the trajectory of the launch to date, tempered by the potential for less frequent dosing as doctors increase the interval between injections of EYLEA, we are increasing our full-year U.S. EYLEA net sales forecast to between 700 and 750 million from a prior 500 to 550 million.  If we achieve this new forecast, EYLEA will become one of the best drug launches in the history of the biotechnology industry.  In a few minutes, Bob Terifay will go into some more details on the launch.","Importantly, the strong EYLEA sales growth translated into even stronger earnings growth where we saw non-GAAP net income rise more than 2.5-fold from $40 million last quarter to slightly over $100 million in the second quarter of 2012, which translated into non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share of $0.90.  Obviously we are pleased by both the performance of EYLEA as well as its ability to fuel the Company\u2019s earnings.  The ability to translate sales growth into strong earnings growth while still investing heavily in our robust and internally discovered pipeline that includes 10 antibodies into addition to our three traps, highlights our relatively unique business model.","Our PDUFA date in the U.S. for our SBLA for EYLEA for CRVO is September 23, and an approval would further expand the EYLEA opportunity.  As a reminder, the strong commercial results for EYLEA only reflect the launch of EYLEA in the U.S.  Outside the United States, our partner Bayer Healthcare has already receiving marketing approval in two countries \u2013 Australia and Colombia \u2013 and we are awaiting regulatory decisions in the EU, Japan, and other countries.  We expect the global launch to start toward the end of the year.","To that end, during the second quarter Bayer Healthcare consummated an agreement with Santen, the market-leading ophthalmology company in Japan to co-promote EYLEA in Japan.  We think this will accelerate the launch and further bolster the opportunity in Japan.","Beyond EYLEA, we await FDA action on our application to market Zaltrap or aflibercept injection for intravenous infusion in combination with a Folfiri chemotherapy regimen for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that was previously treated with an oxalplatin-containing regimen.  We are also advancing our robust pipeline, including our late stage Phase III programs:  sarilumab targeting the IL6 receptor, and Regeneron 727 targeting PCSK9.  Let me highlight PCSK9 briefly because that is a program that is generating a lot of excitement, not only within Regeneron but within the clinical community and pharmaceutical industry.","Surely, we have a lot of competitors but we believe we are in the lead and are committed to trying to stay in front.  We and our partner, Sanofi, just announced that we have initiated our broad 22,000 patient Phase III program known as Odyssey.  In addition, Sanofi has formed a dedicated development unit for the program, emphasizing their commitment to this important investigational agent.","With that, let me turn to our Chief Scientific Officer, George Yancopoulos, to highlight some of the important achievements in our pipeline during the second quarter.","George Yancopoulos","Thanks, Len.  Our clinical and regulatory teams continue to be extremely busy with three BLAs currently under review at the FDA and regulatory decisions expected in the next few months.  First, Zaltrap for the treatment of previously treatment metastatic colorectal cancer has a PDUFA date of August 4.  We are only a few days away from the PDUFA date and are hopeful for a timely approval.","While we do have a substantial development cost repayment obligation to Sanofi that will limit our recognition of any profits for Zaltrap for some time, Zaltrap potentially represents our first commercial foray into oncology.  As a reminder, we have been pioneers in the field of angiogenesis, so it is particularly satisfying to be able to look forward to making Zaltrap, our VEGF trap, available to patients.  Moreover, in our clinical pipeline are two antibodies to novel angiogenesis targets \u2013 angiopoieten 2 and Dll4 \u2013 that have the potential to improve upon VEG-F inhibition alone. ","Second, we had previously submitted our SBLA for EYLEA for the treatment of central retinal vein occlusion, or CRVO, which has a September 23 PDUFA date.  We also will be following the upcoming FDA advisory committee meeting on anti VEG-F therapy for DME very closely as both of our Phase III trials for EYLEA in DME, Vista DME and Vivid DME, are fully enrolled.  As a reminder, outside the U.S. approval in DME can come within one year of efficacy data while in the U.S. current FDA guidance requires two years.  ","We have also started enrollment in a Phase III trial for branch retinal vein occlusion, or BRVO; and finally, we are less optimistic for the supplemental BLA for ARCALYST, or rilonacept, for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering therapy, which has a PDUFA date of July 30.  As most of you know, an arthritis advisory committee convened by the FDA voted against approval of ARCALYST in this indication.  While the advisory committee\u2019s decision is not binding on the FDA, we have low expectations for an approval in this indication at this time and are working to determine the appropriate path forward.  We continue to market ARCALYST for the treatment of CAS.  ","Turning to our antibody pipeline, we now have advanced two antibodies from a broad antibody collaboration with Sanofi into Phase III testing \u2013 Regeneron 727 for cholesterol lowering, and sarilumab for rheumatoid arthritis.  As Len mentioned, Regeneron 727 is our cholesterol lowering PCSK9 antibody which continues to garner a great amount of interest from the clinical community as a potential first-in-class new treatment for high cholesterol.  During the second quarter, we presented positive Phase II data at a late-breaking session of the European Atherosclerosis Society and also announced publication of these data in The Lancet.  Our Phase II program as a whole showed that Regeneron 727 can significantly reduce LDL cholesterol, also known as the bad cholesterol, up to more than 70% in a variety of settings, including in patients who are not at goal on maximum doses of other background lipid lowering therapies such as high dose statins.  In the Phase II program, injection site reactions were the most common adverse event, and rare cases of hypersensitivity reaction were also reported.","With that in mind, Sanofi and Regeneron announced just a few days ago the launch of the 22,000 patient global Phase III program for PCSK9, called Odyssey, which will consist of more than 10 clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Regeneron 727 in a broad range of patients.  This will be the first Phase III program evaluating a PCSK9 targeted therapy.  As described in our press release last Friday, the Phase III program will test the efficacy and safety of Regeneron 727 in a variety of patients with high unmet medical needs, such as patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and those with elevated cardiovascular risk who cannot reach their LDL cholesterol goals with current standard lipid lowering therapies.  The market opportunity is large, with 10 million patients in the U.S. alone who are not at goal despite being on existing therapies.","LDL cholesterol lowering remains the primary objective for the management of hypercholesterolemia, and this has been supported by a large body of data.  Based on our end of Phase II discussions with the U.S. and European regulatory authorities during the second quarter, we expect LDL cholesterol to be the primary endpoint for our regulatory filings and the basis for our initial approval.  Obviously, this depends on an acceptable safety profile in the Phase III studies and no sea change in the regulatory view around LDL as a valid surrogate endpoint.  The Odyssey program includes a large cardiovascular outcomes trial that will enroll approximately 18,000 patients and will start later this year.  We expect this trial to be well underway at the time of the BLA filing for Regeneron 727, but we do not anticipate that the final results of that trial will be a prerequisite for filing.","Sarilumab, our subcutaneous IL6 receptor antibody for rheumatoid arthritis continues to enroll patients in the Phase III mobility trial.  There is growing excitement about the IL6 class of drugs, given data recently presented for ACTEMRA, or tocilizumab, an approved IL6 antibody, in a head-to-head study versus Humira, or adalimumab, the leading anti-TNF for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.  There are 2.7 million patients treating worldwide for RA each year.  We look forward to initiating additional sarilumab Phase III studies with our partner, Sanofi, later this year.","Another positive development for our pipeline, as we mentioned on our last call, was an FDA advisory committee\u2019s unanimous vote in favor of a role for the ongoing development of anti-nerve growth factor \u2013 anti-NGF \u2013 agents for pain associated with osteoarthritis.  Pain represents an enormous unmet need and it is estimated that 25 million patients worldwide suffer from moderate to severe osteoarthritis, and about 4 million of them are intolerant to or poorly responsive to existing therapies.  We also can report that we have had discussions with the FDA and look forward to updating you on the clinical development plans for our anti-NGF antibody, Regeneron 475, once they are finalized.  As a reminder, we have full sole rights to Regeneron 475.  ","I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Bob Terifay to provide an update on the EYLEA launch.","Robert Terifay","Thank you, George.  Our commercial organization is thrilled with the reception that EYLEA has received in the wet AMD market, as evidenced by the 56% growth in our net product sales for the second quarter to $194 million.  We believe that there are several factors that have contributed to the huge strength of our launch.  Our market research suggests that EYLEA enjoys an increasing level of market awareness.  This market awareness, combined with the fact that EYLEA offers clinically equivalent efficacy to monthly Lucentis, or ranibizumab, with the convenience of less than monthly dosing; and secondly, that many doctors continue to switch patients from Lucentis and off-label Avastin, or bevacizumab, to EYLEA has allowed to establish what we believe is a very strong foothold in the wet AMD market.  ","Based on qualitative market research surveys that we conducted towards the end of June of 2012, EYLEA has now been used in approximately 90% of all accounts where Lucentis has been used, up from the 70% that was reported in the first quarter.  Clearly, this indicates that some of our growth this past quarter came from an increase in the number of accounts that are using EYLEA.  In terms of penetration and\/or market share within these accounts, our market research suggests that EYLEA has now captured approximately 14% of the overall wet AMD anti-VEGF market by volume.  This is an increase from the 10% market share that we estimated on our first quarter earnings call.","Based on qualitative market research survey results, we estimate at the time of our survey, patients continuing on EYLEA represent approximately 40% of our sales.  Thirty-five percent comes from wet AMD patients new to anti-VEGF therapy, and the remaining 25% come from patients switching from other anti-VEGF therapies.  In terms of our switches, our new market research indicates that about half of the switches are coming from Avastin.  Both efficacy and the convenience of less than monthly dosing are cited as the key drivers for starting our na\u00efve patient and switching a patient to EYLEA from either Avastin or Lucentis.  ","In order to better understand the dynamics of this market, including the reason why patients switch to EYLEA, we look forward to the upcoming American Society of Retinal Surgeons meeting in Las Vegas in August where there will be a special session devoted to independently prepared presentations from several retinal practices around the country reporting on their initial experiences with EYLEA in this specific patient population of switches.  ","There are several factors that influence a successful drug launch.  One of the key drivers for a buy and bill product such as EYLEA is successful reimbursement.  To this end, we\u2019ve made an effort to streamline and facilitate the reimbursement process.  We continue to see successful reimbursement from all of the regional Medicare carriers, secondary and supplemental insurers, and commercial and private payors.  All targeted commercial payors are now covering EYLEA with several commercial payors now have published coverage policies.  We have also seen broad adoption by hospital formularies.","We expect to receive our permanent J-code in January of 2013 and anticipate that this will further streamline the automated EYLEA claims process and provide an additional degree of comfort to those accounts who might have been sitting on the sidelines, awaiting confirmation that reimbursement would not be an issue for them.  In the meantime, on July 1 our temporary Q-code for EYLEA went into effect.  A Q-code is a temporary but specific code for EYLEA that results in automated reimbursement.  To ensure as seamless a transition as possible to the Q-code from the miscellaneous J-code, we have in place a team of regional business managers who are working closely with physician office managers to facilitate reimbursement.  We\u2019ve already seen that certain Medicare carriers who had slow processing turnaround times for claims submitted using a miscellaneous J-code have already processed claims more quickly using the EYLEA-specific Q-code that only became available on July 1.","While these sales metrics are reassuring and we expect continued growth in EYLEA usage, we are mindful that it is unrealistic to expect this pace of growth to continue for the remaining two quarters of the year.  With more and more of our sales coming from patients continuing on EYLEA treatment, we do expect an impact on patients moving from the monthly loading dose phase to less monthly dosing regimens, including the every-other-month dosing regimen recommended in the EYLEA prescribing information.  We also expect to see a decline in the number of patients available in each practice to be switched to EYLEA from other VEG-F inhibitors.","In addition, since we\u2019ve now penetrated about 90% of the accounts that are known to have used Lucentis, we expect a slowdown in the rate of new account growth.  On the other hand, as doctors gain experience with EYLEA in both na\u00efve patients and switches, we also expect further share gains in both of these segments.  Bottom line is that we expect continued growth for EYLEA but at a slower rate in the second half of the year.  ","As a result, we are increasing our full-year EYLEA U.S. net sales forecast to 700 to $750 million.  If our new forecast is achieved, it would make EYLEA one of the top biopharmaceutical product launches of all time.","Turning outside the United States, which we expect to be a significant contributor to EYLEA growth in 2013 and beyond, EYLEA was recently approved for the treatment of wet AMD in both Australia and Colombia.  In addition, our partner Bayer Healthcare has filed for the wet AMD indication in Europe and Japan and we anticipate approval and launches on a country-by-country basis in Europe and Japan starting at the end of this year and continuing throughout 2013.  Bayer has also announced that they plan to submit a filing and CVRO indication shortly following ex-U.S. wet AMD approvals.","As Len mentioned earlier, Bayer entered into a co-promotion agreement with Santen in Japan.  We and Bayer expect this agreement will allow EYLEA to have broader and faster reach into the Japanese ophthalmology community.  As part of this agreement, we\u2019ve converted our profit split in Japan into a tiered royalty of between 33.5 and 40% on EYLEA net sales in Japan.","While the EYLEA launch is only just the beginning, its initial early success increases our confidence that EYLEA can continue not only to deliver near-term growth through the continued launch in wet AMD in the United States and shortly outside the United States, but also long-term revenue growth through expansion into new indications globally.  ","Now let me turn it back to Len.","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","Thanks, Bob.  Before moving to Murray to review the financial results, let me take a moment to address the competitive landscape in wet AMD and our long-term vision for Regeneron and ophthalmology.  EYLEA represents the culmination of years of internal research and development for Regeneron in the field of angiogenesis, where we were early pioneers and made seminal discoveries.  We were not the first anti-VEGF to reach the market for the treatment of eye diseases; in fact, EYLEA is the third approved anti-VEGF product after Macugen and then Lucentis.  However, our goal is for EYLEA to become the global market leader.","Given this history, we are very aware that research and innovation will not stop at EYLEA, and patients and physicians will be looking for the next innovation in the treatment of wet AMD.  Thus, we continue to invest in research to not only find ways to improve EYLEA but also to find novel approaches and targets to treat wet AMD and other eye diseases.  For example, in the Sanofi collaboration we are developing an angiopoieten 2 antibody for cancer that, based on preclinical data, may also have potential to be developed for the treatment of diseases of the eye.","Over the last several years, our scientists have also been exploring the role of platelet-derived growth factor, or PDGF, in angiogenesis.  We currently have a high affinity PDGF antibody in pre-clinical development that we expect to be in the clinic in 2013.  As a reminder, Sanofi has certain option rights to our antibodies.","It is important to note that a blocking PDGF does provide an added benefit over VEG-F inhibition alone in diseases of the eye.  We believe it is important to try and develop a potent inhibitor, combine it with the best VEG-F blocker, and attempt to develop it as a single co-formulated injection if possible.  Importantly, we know firsthand how long and difficult the road to the market can be, as it took approximately four years from the first patient enrolled in our Phase III EYLEA program to our initial launch in the U.S.  As such, from what we see in the competitive landscape now, we don\u2019t expect any new entrants to the wet AMD market before the 2017-2018 time frame.  That said, we are committed to investing to maintain our leadership position through continued innovation.","With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Murray, who will review our second quarter financial results.","Murray Goldberg","Thank you, Len, and good morning to everyone.  I\u2019m very pleased to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of 2012 which brought Regeneron to a new milestone with over $100 million of non-GAAP profit in a quarter.  Total revenues in the second quarter were $304 million.  This included $194 million of EYLEA net sales and about $6 million of ARCALYST net sales.  The gross to net adjustment for EYLEA sales was similar to last quarter at approximately 7.5%.  For EYLEA, this quarter\u2019s distributor inventory remained consistent with prior quarters at about one to two weeks of inventory on hand.  As a result, EYLEA net sales included a modest increase in distributor inventory of about $10 million.","Collaboration revenue was $98 million in the second quarter.  This primarily included Sanofi\u2019s reimbursement to us of $92 million for antibody and Zaltrap R&D expenses that we incurred, offset by approximately $8 million in pre-commercialization expenses for Zaltrap that Sanofi incurred and that we reimbursed them for.  Our reimbursement to Sanofi is accounted for as contra-revenue.  ","Looking forward in 2012, this line will include growing pre-commercialization expenses for Zaltrap in preparation for potential launch in a variety of countries at the end of this year and next year.  Our share of these pre-commercialization expenses would potentially be at least partially offset by an approval milestone of $50 million if we were to receive regulatory approval from the FDA.  ","Bayer Healthcare collaboration revenue was about $9 million in the second quarter and primarily represents Bayer\u2019s cost-sharing of some of the EYLEA development expenses that we incurred.  As EYLEA launches globally, Bayer Healthcare collaboration revenue will also include our share of the pre-commercialization expenses and our share of the profits and losses from commercialization outside the United States, as well as potential approval and sales milestones from Bayer.","Cost of goods sold in the second quarter was $22 million or 10.9% of net product sales overall and about 10.5% for EYLEA.  This includes royalty expense in connection with our Genentech license agreement relating to ophthalmic sales of EYLEA in the U.S.  It also includes inventory write-offs and reserves of approximately $6.5 million that increased cost of goods sold for the quarter.","Non-GAAP R&D expense was $136 million for the second quarter this year, about the same as in the second quarter last year.  If we back out R&D reimbursements from our partners during the quarter from our R&D line, our net non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense for the second quarter was $37 million compared to $34 million in the first quarter.  We anticipate that this net R&D expense will continue to trend upward through the remainder of 2012 and would increase much faster if antibodies outside the Sanofi collaboration, such as our NGF antibody Regeneron 475, move into advanced stage clinical trials.","Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $40 million for the second quarter this year compared to $20 million in the second quarter last year.  The increase in SG&A expense versus last year is primarily due to the fully-burdened cost of the EYLEA field force and other EYLEA commercialization-related expenses.  In April, we provided full-year non-GAAP SG&A expense guidance of 180 to $210 million.  In the event that the FDA does not grant approval for ARCALYST for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering therapy, which is what we currently expect, our non-GAAP SG&A would be on the lower end of that range.  As a reminder, non-GAAP R&D and non-GAAP SG&A expenses exclude non-cash share-based compensation expense.","Turning to the bottom line, we reported non-GAAP net income of $102 million for the second quarter which is equivalent to non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of $0.90.  Non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense and non-cash interest expense related to our convertible senior notes.  On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $77 million or $0.70 per diluted share.  For the full year, we expect to be profitable on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis.","As you will note, despite turning profitable for the quarter, we have not provided for a tax liability as we have released a portion of our full valuation allowance against our large balance of net operating loss carry-forwards and other tax credits.  When we transition into showing consistent profits, we\u2019ll provide more guidance on the accounting treatment of these NOLs and tax credits.  On a cash basis, we do not anticipate that we will have a cash tax liability for at least several years.","Our non-GAAP fully diluted average shares outstanding in the second quarter were approximately 115 million shares and include about 16 million shares attributable to stock options, restricted stock, and warrants accounted for using the treasury method, and about 5 million shares associated with our convertible notes accounted for using the if-converted method.  ","At June 30, we had $597 million of cash and marketable securities compared to 811 million at year-end 2011.  The decrease is primarily attributable to the extended payment terms on EYLEA sales.  As you will recall, in connection with the launch of EYLEA, we offered our distributors extended payment terms and they in turn offered physicians extended payment terms of up to six months to provide ample time for physicians to receive reimbursement from Medicare and other insurance providers for their EYLEA usage.  At June 30, our trade receivables totaled about $350 million, almost all related to EYLEA sales.  Now that we are in the ninth month of launch, those receivables have begun to be paid down though the account balance continues to increase because of our growing EYLEA sales.  For the second half of this year, we currently expect to be cash positive.","Thank you, and with that I\u2019ll turn the call back to Len.","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","Thanks Murray, Bob, George.  This was truly another great quarter for Regeneron.  Let me conclude today\u2019s call by making a few comments about the bigger picture for Regeneron.","This quarter marks another step forward towards our goal of becoming a leading biopharmaceutical company, as well as a long-term growth company for investors both in terms of revenue and earnings.  At a time when many large pharmaceutical companies are cutting back their research, shutting down major research centers and looking externally for innovative science and product opportunities, we are investing in research, investing in our people, and expanding our manufacturing capacity.  We are also seeing our past investments and collaborations bear fruit with a robust pipeline that has multiple BLAs under review at the FDA, 10 antibodies in the clinic, two of which are in Phase III, and additional new antibodies expected to enter the clinic by the end of this year and each year thereafter.  ","All of these products and product candidates were invented at Regeneron by Regeneron scientists and Regeneron Laboratories, led by George Yancopoulos, our Chief Scientific Officer and my partner since the founding of the company over 20 years ago.  This is an exciting time for Regeneron, and I want to again thank our dedicated employees who have helped us achieve our goals, the many investors who have stuck with us for a long time, patiently waiting to see us reach this point, and all the patients, their family members and physicians who have participated in our clinical trials and will continue to contribute to our future.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Michael for questions.","Dr. Michael Aberman","Thank you, Len.  That concludes our prepared remarks.  We\u2019d now like to open the call for Q&A.  As we\u2019d like to give as many people a chance to ask questions as possible, we do request that you limit yourself to one question.  The IR team will be available in our office after the call for follow-up questions.","Thank you, and Operator, if you could please open the call for questions.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.","Steve Byrne \u2013 Bank of America","Hi.  I wanted to drill into your survey results a little bit more, Bob.  You mentioned 14% share of wet AMD by volume.  I assume that\u2019s by patients.  I was wondering if out of that 35% that is for patients na\u00efve to anti-VEGF, can you comment on what your share is of that pool of patients, what portion of those are being treated with EYLEA relative to alternative VEG-Fs?","Robert Terifay","","So Steve, to clarify, the way we have calculated our share is based upon eyes, so the equivalent of that would be a vial of drug.  In terms of market share, I just need to remind you \u2013 these were market shares projected by physicians in a qualitative survey in June.  It is not based on a chart audit or anything, so it\u2019s physician perceptions.  Now, what they\u2019ve reported is that the market share overall, as well as the new patient market share, are fairly similar at about 14%; but again, it\u2019s qualitative.  It\u2019s not a chart audit.","Steve Byrne \u2013 Bank of America","And one geographic region I didn\u2019t hear mentioned about was Brazil.  Is Bayer looking into the opportunity in that country?","Robert Terifay","Bayer is looking globally.  We haven\u2019t discussed filing strategies outside of EU and Japan as of yet.","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","But you can be sure that over time they\u2019ll be in every significant market.","Dr. Michael Aberman","Great.  Next question, please?","Operator","The next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.  ","Alethia Young \u2013 Deutsche Bank","This is Alethia on behalf of Robyn.  Congrats, guys, on a strong quarter, not only in rev but in earnings, too.  Can you just talk about what you\u2019ve learned in the U.S. that would be applicable around the doctors for the global launch of EYLEA, please?","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","Yeah, it\u2019s a good question.  When we launched the product, of course, we were very pleased that we had what you would say is a front-line label \u2013 that it\u2019s indicated for the treatment of wet AMD.  But of course, doctors tend to try a new drug in their most difficult patients, and what we learned is that that turns out to be a great strategy for us because they were very pleased with how that turned out, whether it was switches or people who weren\u2019t getting adequate response or still wet, and you\u2019ll hear more about that in the presentations, I think, from some of these practices in the retinal meetings in August in Las Vegas.  But I would say that the big thing to remember is that the EU and the rest of the world are not one market like the United States is, so you don\u2019t know exactly how things are going to play; and this may play great in one place and in another place it may be driven solely by negotiating price, and someplace else it may be just driven by how well the sales people there are ready.  But I think that if there\u2019s one overriding thing that we\u2019ve learned and I think Bayer obviously has learned is that the docs like the product, so the more we can get doctors to start using the product, that becomes our best selling effort.","Dr. Michael Aberman","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Raymond with Robert Baird and Company.","Chris Raymond \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Thanks.  You know, I\u2019m not sure I caught all the detail that you had on your developmental efforts with the anti-PDGF and the angiopoieten 2.  Could you maybe just go back and give a little bit more detail \u2013 is it your plan to develop a co-formulated VEG-F PDGF therapy, or is this separate?  And are these two agents \u2013 PDGF and angiopoieten \u2013 are you going to pursue these in parallel?  Can you maybe just give us a little bit more detail on that, please?","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","Right.  I don\u2019t want to get into the details of our development plans and strategy, because this is a competitive area.  But let me just make another comment or a reiterated comment I made when we presented our opening remarks, which is that the effect that\u2019s been reported to date with a PDGF aptamer was a rather modest effect of about four letters difference between Lucentis alone, and it took two different injections to get that.  What we think the lesson there is, is that (a) there should be caution, and if there\u2019s more questions we can drill down why there should be caution, of whether or not that is going to repeat in further studies; second, we believe that a modest effect size like that would best be delivered to the marketplace if you had a co-formulated \u2013 that is, you could inject once into the eye.  And finally, we believe that if you\u2019re going to go down this path, you want to go down the path with the best PDGF blocker that you can, and the aptamer\u2014we don\u2019t think that the aptamer necessarily\u2014like anything else, the first one may or may not be necessarily the best one.","Dr. Michael Aberman","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi, thanks for taking the question.  Congrats on another solid quarter.  I guess I had two \u2013 one is on the guidance front.  If you can just maybe give us your thoughts on where you see the greatest uncertainty in your guidance.  Is it either at the front end so that new patients coming on, or is it at the back end in terms of the transition from induction to maintenance dosing?  And then just a follow-up on the PDGF front \u2013 can you tell us, maybe walk us through some of the challenges of potentially including two antibodies in one injection?  And that\u2019s it for me, thanks.","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","So Bob, if you want to deal with the first question, and then we can deal, George, with the second one.","Robert Terifay","Sure.  So we are encouraged by the survey results that indicate that we have an annuity of patients at this time; the continuing patient segment is growing.  Now remember, the dosing for patients is three initial monthly doses followed by dosing every eight weeks, and we do see that in both the na\u00efve as well as the switch patients, that the dosing interval is expanding beyond that four weeks after the initial loading dose period.  So we\u2019ll see fewer injections in those continuing patients once they get past the initial monthly loading dose phase.","However, we do see growth in new patients, which is exactly where we expect to get our revenues from; and as you would expect, there was a pool of patients ready for switching that is not drying up but decreasing because there was some pent-up demand.  So I think what you\u2019ll see is fewer injections in the continuing, decreased overall number of switches, and we\u2019ll have continued growth in the new.","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","How that equation gets solved obviously creates the uncertainty in the marketplace.  George, do you want to address the issues of co-formulation and things like that?","George Yancopoulos","Well the good news about trying to combine or co-formulate two very similar types of biologics is that the technical or scientific hurdles are relatively minor, so there really aren\u2019t too many technical hurdles with co-formulation.  Of course, there will be regulatory issues, and probably the most difficult issue is of course trying to get the dose and the regimens correct.  Obviously, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all aware, that\u2019s the most complicated thing about this, and it\u2019s going to take a large number of studies and attempts and so forth to figure out if there is a benefit to adding a second agent, how best to dose, and interval and frequent that second type of an agent.  It\u2019s going to be obviously very challenging for the whole field, including for us, to do that.","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","George, could you address the reproducibility of small effects and what we\u2019ve learned in that?","George Yancopoulos","Right.  I guess what Len is referring to is in the existing Phase II data with the PDGF agent, there was an apparent difference of about four letters with the double dosing, giving two injections of both the PDGF agent as well as an anti-VEGF agent.  And obviously these results are very interesting and exciting, and they suggest that there may be a combination benefit.  On the other hand, reason for concern and caution is simply that obviously in small studies like these, the relative differences between two dose groups, even if in a particular study it may appear statistically significant, are not necessarily always reproduced when done again.  ","So just to give you a very simple example, two dosing groups that look in our integrated analysis to be no different, two different dosing regimens that we tried in our large Phase III program where each study was more than twice as large as the reported PDGF study, in one study the relative difference between agents was four letters, and then in the other study the relative difference between the two agents went two letters in the opposite direction, meaning that there was a six-letter swing between the two studies, which as I said each one was more than twice as large as the Phase II studies just reported for the PDGF agent.  So though there\u2019s reason to be excited, and we\u2019ve certainly been pursuing this pathway for many years, and as Len said we think we may have a top candidate for combination type studies, there\u2019s a lot of reason for caution about whether there really is a benefit; and even if there is, I think there\u2019s going to be a lot of effort required to figure out how to optimize such a co-therapy.","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","Good, George, and I think we\u2019ll go on to the next question.  One last point before we go on on that issue is that one has to be careful also about how selective these patients were, how generalizable it is.  You don\u2019t know if diabetics were treated and there were other restrictions.  So I think there\u2019s a lot of time and things to be done and learned.  We\u2019re clearly paying close attention.","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Birchenough with BMO Capital.","Jim Birchenough \u2013 BMO Capital","Hey guys.  Let me add my congratulations.  Just on the market dynamics and trying to anticipate what proportion of patients might go from induction to maintenance dosing, right now as you look at patients on EYLEA, what proportion are getting monthly dosing versus every two month dosing?  And then just wondering if you can help size the treatment-na\u00efve market in AMD, how many new patients do you see coming on each quarter and what\u2019s the share\u2014if you can remind us, what\u2019s the share there in the na\u00efve patients?  Thanks.","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","","Bob?","Robert Terifay","So I\u2019ll start with the na\u00efve patient.  New patients in the wet AMD market coming in are roughly 25 to 30% of the overall market.  In terms of where things are settling out on the dosing, it\u2019s really too early because we constantly\u2014as you saw, we have people who are just staring EYLEA, a fairly large group that are, even when they are switched, are generally being started on a monthly loading dose, period.  So we\u2019re seeing the dosing interval go out over time.  I think we\u2019ll have a better sense in future earnings calls, but it would be premature to give you a specific time right now.","Operator","The next question comes from Yaron Werber with Citi.","Yaron Werber \u2013 Citi","Hey, congrats also.  Great quarter.  If you don\u2019t mind, I just have kind of two questions.  One, just help us understand the timing in Europe for approval.  It was filed back in June last year, so we\u2019re now kind of almost 14 months into it.  So why would the approval be all the way at the end of the year and not earlier than that, and I\u2019m just talking about the approval, not the actual reimbursement approval.  And then secondly just as a follow-up to the discussion on the aptamer PDGF, if you look at the previous data \u2013 again, admittedly small patient numbers, but very interesting data.  It showed really a remarkable ability to dry the eyes.  I think one of the concerns is the total number of injections will go down over time as people do treat and extend and they\u2019re using OCT.  So what are your thoughts on that?","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","So on the first one regarding the timing, I think Bayer is in charge of that and the timing is what they\u2019ve said.  You can pursue that further with them.  As far as the PDGF and the drying of the eye, you know, you might recall\u2014you have to remember what it\u2019s being compared to.  Lucentis, from our studies, our own head-to-head, had less dry eyes than EYLEA did, and so you\u2019re talking about eyes that are not completely dry as it is under anti-VEGF therapy.  And you should also, obviously, remember that there is not a perfect correlation between drying of an eye and visual acuity.  ","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Biren Amin with Jefferies.","Biren Amin \u2013 Jefferies","","Yeah, thanks for taking my questions.  I wanted to maybe focus on the EYLEA DME ongoing Phase III program, and after the briefing documents released yesterday, it seems FDA prefers proportion of patients gaining three lines over a three-year period, and given the (audio interference) is designed for visual acuity changes at two years at baseline, would you expect to revise Vista trial design based on FDA commentary?","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","I think we\u2019ve had a pretty good discussion with the FDA about our trials, and if after the results of this advisory committee meeting, if there\u2019s anything to do, obviously we\u2019re going to watch it carefully.  The FDA accepts both types of endpoints as long as there\u2019s a certain magnitude of effect, and I believe our trial design is also a little bit different.  We have an active control of laser versus they had rescue, so the trials are not exactly analogous but we feel comfortable right now with our trial design.  But of course, we\u2019ll look at it in light of what gets discussed.","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Mani Mohindru with ThinkEquity","Mani Mohindru \u2013 ThinkEquity","Hi, thanks for taking my questions, and my congrats to your team as well.  I just wanted to get a better sense of your guidance.  You know, you keep coming and surprising us, so trying to see what your thought process is in your updated guidance.  Are you including any CRVO estimates there, and are you also taking into account some impact of the newly implemented Q-code that just went into effect earlier this month?  Trying to get a sense if those two things are playing into your new guidance.  And on the Q-code front, I know it\u2019s very early, but have you seen any kind of impact in the few weeks that it\u2019s been on?  Thanks.","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","So two points \u2013 we never plan or project or incent based on anything but the proved indication, so that estimate is based solely on our view of the approved marketplace.  But we can\u2019t be sure, of course.  We don\u2019t always get the data to be sure of what it\u2019s doing, so it\u2019s our best guess, okay?  And you say we\u2019re surprising you \u2013 we get surprised as well, and so it really is our best estimate.","The other question you had is whether the Q-code has seen any effect.  I think in Bob\u2019s opening remarks, he said that we\u2019ve already seen just since July 1 claims getting paid based on Q-codes.  That obviously only took a few weeks, because we\u2019re only a few weeks into July, to get paid, which is a large decrease in the time to pay compared to\u2014prior to the Q-code in some cases.","Bob, you want to amplify on that?","Robert Terifay","So as Len said with regards to the CRVO, we\u2019ll wait and see when the claim comes; but I\u2019d just remind everyone, CRVO, although it\u2019s an important indication to add to our breadth of claims for EYLEA, CRVO in terms of the number of patients eligible for anti-VEGF therapy is about 10% of the wet AMD patient population.  So CRVO is going to be a fairly small marketplace, but it does expand the utility of EYLEA if we get that claim.","Dr. Michael Aberman","Okay, next question?","","Operator","Our next question comes from Joseph Schwartz with Leerink Swann.","Joseph Schwartz \u2013 Leerink Swann","Thanks very much, and congratulations on the outstanding performance.  I was wondering, just to follow up on your last statement, why did you not pursue branch retinal vein occlusion when you did the central RVO studies?  Thank you.","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","In fact we are pursuing it; it\u2019s just a matter of there\u2019s a lot going on.  We had AMD, DME, CRVO, and BRVO is enrolling as we speak.","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Ted Tenthoff of Piper Jaffray.","Ted Tenthoff \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Great, thank you very much, and my congrats too.  Just as you come and look to the upcoming PDUFA dates, in particular with respect to Zaltrap, what are your preparations with Sanofi for potential launch there, and what else should we be expecting from that program over the next 12 to 18 months?","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","Right, so I think that Sanofi is a highly experienced player in the oncology marketplace.  They\u2019re taking the rowing oar on that.  Obviously, we work with them and we meet communities and all that, but we\u2019re going to rely heavily on their really outstanding experience in this area.","In terms of what\u2019s to come over the next month, I think that either George or I mentioned that this is the beginning, we hope, of our entry into oncology, and clearly we would like to make the effects of anti-VEGF therapy even better for patients.  While there is clearly a survival effect in our studies, we would like to have seen a bigger effect and we think perhaps by combining it in a clever way with several, one or more of our anti-angiogenesis agents that are already in the clinic or trying to identify patients who might do better or not have side effects of what have you, we certainly are trying to amplify those effects.","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau  with Cowen & Company","Phil Nadeau \u2013 Cowen & Company","Good morning.  Thanks for taking my questions, and let me add my congratulations on the quarter.  Just a couple of follow-up questions on the\u2014","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","I missed that.  Sorry, go ahead.  You broke up here.","Phil Nadeau \u2013 Cowen & Company","Oh, sorry.  I just said let me add my congratulations on the quarter.  Just some follow-up questions on the Q-code.  Could you tell us from a physician or patient perspective how much easier this makes the logistics of prescribing EYLEA?  Is there any less paperwork, or is it just that claims get paid back faster?  And then related to that, if claims are getting paid back faster, can you give us some sense of how much longer you\u2019re going to keep your extended payment terms?","Robert Terifay","Yeah, so many of the carriers required under a period where we had a miscellaneous J-code additional paperwork such as copies of the approval letter, documentation of the claim, the use for wet AMD, and that did require extra paperwork for the offices and oftentimes there\u2019s been a changeover in the computer systems that process claims, and there\u2019s been a slowdown especially on these manual-type claims.  So with the Q-code, many of the carriers have said they don\u2019t\u2019 require that documentation upfront any more because there is now a specific code for EYLEA, so it is easier for many offices to file.  And as we\u2019ve said, we have seen in some of the carriers around the country that were slow on claims processing because of these manual procedures, that\u2014we only got the Q-code on July 1 and we\u2019re seeing claims come through already in some of those practices, so it\u2019s very encouraging.","Dr. Michael Aberman","I think we have time for one more question, Operator.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with JP Morgan ","Geoff Meacham \u2013 JP Morgan ","Good morning, guys.  Thanks for taking the question.  Just a few on the PDGF \u2013 so you guys are in Phase I next year, but just curious if you\u2019ve actually selected a single antibody candidate so far, and maybe anything you can tell us about what you\u2019ve seen I models in combination with EYLEA.  And then the third part to this is\u2014I guess, should we infer from the PDGF that your bias is to develop one organically and to not partner?  Thanks.","Dr. Leonard Schleifer","All great questions, but I think we probably have said more than we are comfortable saying, frankly.  We don\u2019t want to get into much more detail since it\u2019s a pretty competitive space, Geoff.","Dr. Michael Adler","All right, so that wraps up the call for today.

Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions.","With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Manisha. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call and webcast today. It has been an incredibly productive first half of the year for Regeneron with the launch of two important new medicines and we are looking forward to continued progress in the second half of the year. EYLEA, a flagship anti-VEGF drug for the treatment of a variety of retinal diseases, delivered strong results in both the U.S. and ex-U.S. markets.","In the U.S., we experienced an 11% year-over-year growth in net sales during the quarter. We are proud that U.S. EYLEA net sales have grown steadily since the launch in 2011 without ever having taken any price increases. This growth has been driven by new patients and new indications.","The launch of Dupixent, our breakthrough IL-4\/IL-13 inhibitor for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, is underway. Though it is still early, we are happy to report that the launch continues to progress extremely well, and most important, we have been very pleased with the positive reception that Dupixent has received from patients and physicians, along with the progress we have made with payers.","In terms of the pace of the launch, we have seen a steady flow of both prescriptions written for new patients, as well as prescriptions filled for new patients, without any evidence of a bolus effect. We know from patients that atopic dermatitis can have a terrible impact on their lives, so we are glad that we are hearing positive anecdotes about how patients are responding to Dupixent in a manner consistent with the effect we saw in our clinical trials program.","The teams at Regeneron and Sanofi have been working together to improve patient and physician awareness, and ensure that those eligible for Dupixent are able to receive the drug. Bob Terifay will provide detailed metrics about this exciting launch.","We're encouraged by the clinical progress that we are making with dupilumab in indications beyond atopic dermatitis. The most advanced of these is asthma, where we expect top-line Phase 3 data from a second pivotal trial later this quarter, with a potential U.S. regulatory submission in the fourth quarter of this year. George will address the asthma indication in greater detail.","In May, we received approval for and launched Kevzara, our IL-6 receptor antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in the United States. Kevzara marks the sixth FDA approved drug for Regeneron. We are proud that these six approved drugs, along with our pipeline of 17 product candidates, have all been discovered by the scientists at Regeneron. As you all know, it is rare for any biopharmaceutical company to bring a single drug all the way from discovery to commercialization. To have done it six times is a tribute to our people and their efforts. Regeneron discovered drugs had over $1.5 billion in global net sales in the second quarter of 2017.","Turning now to Praluent. We are awaiting the opinion of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit following the oral arguments that occurred in early June. We continue to believe that the law, in fact, support our position. Our 18,000-patient cardiovascular outcome study is ongoing and we expect to report data from this study in early 2018. We and our collaborator, Sanofi, are committed to optimizing the potential benefit that this important drug can bring to patients.","Our immuno-oncology programs continue to advance. At the June annual ASCO meeting, we presented positive clinical data from our PD-1 antibody program in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. George will provide additional details on these, as well as the progress we are making with our other immuno-oncology programs. We are preparing for a busy second half with multiple important data readouts and continued pipeline progress. You will hear more about that \u2013 some of these programs from George.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to George.","George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. We believe Regeneron is a very different type of company, in that it was founded by and is led by physicians and scientists dedicated to a science-first approach to bringing new medicines that can make important difference in patients' lives. This commitment, supported by a talented and longstanding team of scientists and strategic investments in internal technology development, has today produced what many believe is one of the best pipelines in the industry. And as Len mentioned, all of our approved and investigational therapies were discovered in our own labs by our own people.","I will provide a general update on our R&D progress today and highlight two Phase 3 programs, for which we expect to have data readouts in the second half of this year. These are dupilumab in asthma and REGN2810, our PD-1 antibody in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. I'd like to begin with one of our most exciting late-stage program, Dupixent, also known as dupilumab, our interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 blocker, which was approved in March by the FDA for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when these therapies are not advisable. In addition to the FDA approval, we have recently granted a positive opinion by the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy. We expect to receive EU approval in the third quarter of 2017.","In the pediatric atopic dermatitis setting, we are currently enrolling a Phase 3 study of dupilumab in patients 12 to 17 years of age. In the second half of the year, we expect to initiate two additional studies in the younger atopic dermatitis patients; the first in children between the ages of 6 and 11, and the second in children between the ages of six months and five years. We believe that dupilumab has potential to benefit a variety of allergic or atopic conditions. And we are investigating the use of dupilumab in several of these, including asthma, eosinophilic esophagitis, and nasal polyps.","Today, I'd like to focus on the potential opportunity in our most advanced indication, asthma, where we expect top-line data later this quarter from our pivotal Phase 3 study LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST. Data from our previously reported positive Phase 2 study are considered pivotal and will support our regular submission, which we anticipate in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Phase 3 LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study enrolled approximately 1,800 adult and adolescent patients with persistent uncontrolled asthma.","In this study, patients will randomize to one of two dupilumab arms, 200 milligrams every other week or 300 milligrams every other week, or placebo; patients who are on background therapy of medium to high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus a second-controller medication, such as a long-acting beta-agonist or a leukotriene receptor antagonist. The study has two primary endpoints, the annualized rate of asthma attacks or exacerbations over the 52-week treatment period and the absolute change from baseline in FEV1 at week 12, a measure of lung function, both of which will be assessed in the overall patient population.","I'd like to remind you of data from our previously reported positive Phase 2b study, which was conducted in a patient population similar to the one we are studying in Phase 3. This Phase 2b study randomized 769 patients with moderate-to-severe asthma, who were uncontrolled despite treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonist. The results from this study demonstrate that dupilumab administered at 200-milligram every other week or 300-milligram every other week, in combination with standard-of-care therapy, demonstrated a significant 12% to 15% improvement in FEV1 at week 12 over the standard-of-care alone, as well as there is a significant 64% to 75% reduction in exacerbations over standard-of-care alone. Importantly, these positive response were seen in both the patient population with high blood eosinophils, believed to be a marker of the allergic disease patients, as well as the overall study population.","The most common adverse event in the study was injection site reaction, which was more frequent in dupilumab dose group at 13% to 25% compared to 12% in the placebo group. The incidence of infections was balanced across treatment groups, as was the incidence of serious adverse events. We believe that if the Phase 3 LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST data demonstrate efficacy both in terms of reduction in exacerbations and an improvement in lung function in all comers, including the subset of patients with high eosinophil count, as well as the subset of patients with low eosinophil counts, it would be an important differentiating factor. No approved biologic has demonstrated robust improvement in lung function, as well as profound reduction in exacerbations, in the overall asthma population, including both these important subsets of patients.","In addition to the LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study, we're also conducting another Phase 3 study, LIBERTY ASTHMA VENTURE, which is designed to determine the efficacy and safety of dupilumab, while reducing the use of oral corticosteroid in patients with severe oral steroid dependent asthma. Top-line results from this study will be reported by the end of 2017 and are anticipated to be part of our regulatory commission. We are also investigating the use of dupilumab in younger patients with asthma, with an ongoing Phase 3 study in children ages 6 to 11 years old.","Turning now to other potential and important indications where we are investigating dupilumab. We currently have two Phase 3 studies ongoing in patients with nasal polyps. We're also planning a Phase 3 study in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis, following recent positive results from a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study. These results will be presented in detail at an upcoming medical conference. We're also planning studies of dupilumab in patients with food allergies.","According to data from the Centers for Disease Control, or the CDC, allergic diseases are the sixth leading cause of chronic illness in the United States and have reached epidemic proportion. There is a tremendous amount of scientific debate on the drivers behind this increased incidence and prevalence. Our collective data from the dupilumab clinical studies suggest that deviation of the immune system triggered by over-activity of the IL-4\/IL-13 axis may be the key driver of many, if not most, allergic conditions. So-called allergic patients with an overactive IL-4\/IL-13 pathway often suffer from more than one manifestation at a given time. For example, patients with asthma or atopic dermatitis often also suffer from severe respiratory or food allergies, and the combination of multiple allergic conditions can be quite devastating for an allergic individual. The possibility that a single biologic may simultaneously help many of these related allergic conditions would be very exciting and important to many patients.","Just as important, it would be ideal if such a correction of allergic disease could occur without inducing concurrent immunosuppression. All our studies to-date indicate that unlike many other biologics that target the immune system which often produces immunosuppression and side-effects such as infections, dupilumab does not appear to be an immunosuppressant. Rather dupilumab appears to be an immunomodulatory agent that blocks the pathologic overactivity of IL-4\/IL-13 driven allergic responses.","I would now like to talk about another important area of research for us at Regeneron, and that is the field of immuno-oncology. Despite all the early successes and excitement in the field, cancer remains a challenging area, and there have been a recent string of disappointments with several development programs. Just last week, another highly anticipated trial exploiting a PD-L1 antibody alone and in combination with the CTLA-4 antibody yielded disappointing data. These developments underscore that the field is still in the very early stages of fully understanding how to exploit and optimize the power of immuno-oncology.","In contrast to some of the recent disappointing results elsewhere, recent developments with our PD-1 antibody have been positive. The ASCO conference in June this year was an exciting time for us. We presented important data with REGN2810, our PD-1 antibody, in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC, which is the second most common skin cancer after basal cell carcinoma and the second deadliest skin cancer after melanoma.","It is estimated that there are approximately 4,000 to 8,000 deaths annually in the United States from CSCC. For patients with advanced CSCC, there are limited treatment options and no standard of care. The data that we presented at the ASCO conference were the pooled results from two expansion arms in metastatic or inoperable locally or regionally advanced CSCC from 26 patients in our 392-patient Phase 1 trial. These CSCC data demonstrated that treatment with REGN2810 led to an overall response rate of 46%, including two complete responses according to investigator's assessment and a disease control rate of 69%.","The median progression-free and overall survival were not reached at the data cutoff date, with a median follow-up of 6.9 months. The adverse event profile was generally consistent with agents in this class. Based on these encouraging results, we are conducting larger efforts in metastatic and locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Recent discussions with the FDA indicate that if these data are robust, they could form the basis of a regulatory submission in the first quarter of 2018.","Work on developing REGN2810 in other indications continues, where we are currently enrolling a Phase 3 study in our non-small cell lung cancer indication, a Phase 2 study in basal cell carcinoma and additional earlier studies in other indications as well. We're also exploring the use of our PD-1 antibody in combination with novel vaccines in oncolytic viruses.","Our second checkpoint inhibitor, REGN3767, an antibody LAG-3, is currently enrolling patients in two studies; one in monotherapy and one in combination with our PD-1 antibody. Additionally, our bispecific CD20\/CD3 antibody, REGN1979, is also being studied in the clinic as both a monotherapy and in combination with our PD-1 antibody. In the second quarter, we were granted orphan drug designation from the FDA for REGN1979 for the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL.","Our EYLEA business continues to be strong and we remain committed to maintaining our leadership position. Part of this commitment is to help educate the community on the importance of regular dosing with anti-VEGF therapies. Real world evidence indicates that many patients receiving anti-VEGF therapies are not being optimally treated, resulting in more widespread vision loss than is necessary. This decreases patients' quality of life and results in substantial cost to society, particularly when leading to blindness and disability. There has even been a bias that chronic sustained VEGF inhibition may account for the inability of most patients to maintain their vision over the long-term.","Our long-term data with the VIEW extension study, which followed wet AMD patients treated for approximately four years using EYLEA in a standardized and fixed regimen, show that for the first time the initial gain seen with any anti-VEGF agent can be largely maintained for the long-term. This was the first time that such data have been demonstrated with any anti-VEGF agent. This is in contrast to long-term studies with other anti-VEGF agents using flexible dosing regimens, such as the CATT study, which resulted in loss of the early visual acuity gains that were achieved with monthly dosing.","Taken together with additional real-world data, this suggests that under-treatment with anti-VEGF agent is a serious disservice to patients and a major public health issue. We believe the overall data in this felid indicate that the treatment goal of anti-VEGF therapy should be chronic, sustained, and potent VEGF inhibition. Many elderly people are needlessly losing vision and going blind. We are committed to doing a better job to address this issue.","In the second half of this year, we expect to report top line data from two Phase 2 studies; one in wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD, and another in diabetic macular edema, or DME, of EYLEA in combination with nesvacumab, an antibody to angiopoietin 2. The primary endpoint in these studies will be assessed at 36 weeks, and we expect top-line results from these studies in the fourth quarter of 2017. These results will help us understand with a combination of EYLEA with an antibody to angiopoietin 2 can improve upon the already high bar that has been set by EYLEA.","PANORAMA, our Phase 3 study of EYLEA in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema continues to enroll patients. The primary endpoints of this study will be assessed at week 24 and at week 52. A separate Phase 3 study in this indication, PROTOCOL-W, which is being conducted by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network, or the DRCR, continues to enroll patients. This study will explore every 16 week dosing of EYLEA, which is the only anti-VEGF treatment being investigated in this study. We plan to submit our supplemental BLA for EYLEA dosed every 12 weeks by the end of the year.","Moving on to Praluent, our PCSK9 inhibitor antibody for lowering LDL cholesterol, we expect in the first quarter of 2018 top-line data from the ongoing 18,000-patient ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study. If these results are positive and recognized in formal treatment guidelines, we believe this would allow for greater uptake of drugs in this important class.","In addition to our efforts with Praluent in cardiovascular disease, we are also developing evinacumab, our antibody to angiopoietin-like 3, for the treatment of Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia, or Homozygous FH, in severe forms of hyperlipidemia. Following positive data from a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in patients with Homozygous FH, we plan to advance evinacumab into a Phase 3 trial in Homozygous FH. Additional studies in hypertriglyceridemia and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia are also being planned.","As a reminder, evinacumab has been granted both orphan drug as well as breakthrough destination by the FDA for the treatment of Homozygous FH. In May of this year, we published data in the New England Journal of Medicine showing that people with inactivating mutations of angiopoietin-like 3 have an approximately 40% reduced risk of coronary artery disease and significantly lower levels of key blood lipids, including triglycerides and LDL cholesterol.","We were able to identify these mutations through our genetics efforts at the Regeneron Genetics Center. Furthermore, we published Phase 2 clinical data that demonstrate that blocking angiopoietin-like 3 with evinacumab in patients with Homozygous FH who are in lipid-lowering therapies resulted in an additional 49% reduction from baseline in LDL cholesterol at week four. A reduction in other key lipid parameters, including Lp(a) and triglycerides, was also observed.","Kevzara, or sarilumab, our interleukin-6 receptor antibody for rheumatoid arthritis, has received regulatory approval in Canada, the United States, and the EU. In terms of clinical development for sarilumab, we are currently enrolling patients in a Phase 2 study in Polyarticular-course Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis, or pJIA. We are also advancing our Phase 3 program for fasinumab, our Nerve Growth Factor antibody for pain, where we dosed the first patient in our Phase 3 efficacy study in osteoarthritis pain. We remain on track to initiate a Phase 3 efficacy study in chronic lower back pain in the second half and we continue to enroll our long-term safety study.","In the second half of the year, we expect to report top-line data from our Phase 3 program with REGN2222, also known as suptavumab, a wholly-owned antibody that we are investigating for prophylaxis of respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. RSV infections represent a substantial burden and is estimated that over 20% of infants under the age of six months require medical attention for RSV annually. This study explores two dosing regimens; suptavumab administered either once or twice during RSV season in preterm infants.","Development in other parts of our early-stage pipeline continue to advance and I would like to highlight a few of the programs. Our Activin A antibody, REGN2477, is in clinical development for the treatment of the rare disease Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva, or FOP. In the second quarter of 2017, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA and we anticipate initiating a Phase 2 clinical study in the second half of 2017.","We're also studying our Activin A antibody in combination with our GDF8 antibody in settings where there may be benefit to promoting muscle growth. REGN3500, our interleukin-33 antibody, is in Phase 1 clinical studies in patients with asthma and REGN3918, our wholly-owned C5 antibody, has now entered clinical development.","Before I conclude, I want to say a few words about the ending of our Antibody Discovery Agreement with Sanofi, which Bob Landry will discuss in more detail. Praluent, Dupixent, Kevzara, REGN2810 are our anti-PD-1 antibody. REGN3500, our anti-IL-33 antibody, and REGN3767, our anti-LAG-3 antibody, were all discovered and initially developed under this Antibody Discovery Agreement. Praluent, Dupixent, Kevzara, and REGN3500 will continue to be developed and commercialized, as applicable, with Sanofi under the Antibody License and Collaboration Agreement.","REGN2810 and REGN3767 will continue to be developed with Sanofi under the immuno-oncology collaboration. We believe that our collaboration with Sanofi is one of the most productive arrangements in the history of the biotechnology industry and we look forward to continued collaborative efforts with Sanofi in the future.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob Terifay.","Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. EYLEA continues to be the market leading product among FDA approved anti-VEGF agents for all that's approved indications in the United States, with a 73% market share in terms of dollars in the second quarter of 2017 compared to 69% market share in the second quarter of 2016. In the second quarter of 2017, U.S. net sales of EYLEA, or aflibercept, were $919million versus $831 million in the second quarter of 2016, which represents growth of 11% year-over-year. Ex-U.S. net sales of EYLEA in the second quarter of 2017 were $542 million compared to $486 million in the second quarter of 2016, which represents growth of 12% on a reported basis.","For the second \u2013 six months ended June 30, 2017, U.S. EYLEA net sales grew 10% year-over-year compared to the first half of 2016. The overall branded anti-VEGF market in the U.S. grew by 7.4% in the first half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2016. These numbers indicate that EYLEA growth is driven by overall growth in the market, as well as an increase in market share.","As George noted, we're preparing for the submission this year of data to the FDA from the second year of our Phase 3 wet AMD studies, which shows that approximately 50% of patients were able to be treated with every 12-week dosing. We are also continuing to enroll patients in a Phase 3 study, a non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.","Turning now to the recent launch of Dupixent, or dupilumab, in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. As reported by our collaborator, Sanofi, global net sales for Dupixent in the second quarter were $29 million. These sales largely reflect end-user demand in the United States, with negligible contribution from inventory build. We are pleased with the way the launch is tracking and the prescriptions are trending ahead above a recently launched biologics in dermatology. As of last week, over 5,000 healthcare professionals had prescribed Dupixent, with over 13,000 prescriptions written.","Over the past two months approximately 750 new patients per week have received a prescription for Dupixent from the healthcare provider. During the past two months, approximately 500 patients per week, who are new to the brand, have had prescriptions filled.","On the market access front, things are progressing well. As we previously communicated, the two largest pharmacy benefits managers, Express Scripts and CVS, provided immediate coverage from launch with utilization management criteria that are consistent with the Dupixent label. We continue to work with payers to try and ensure that all appropriate patients are able to access Dupixent and expect to have broad market access by the end of the year. Outside of the United States, Dupixent has received the positive CHMP recommendation in July of this year, with the launch expected in Europe later this year.","Turning now to Kevzara, or sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Net global sales to the end of the second quarter were $1 million. It is still very early days, given that Kevzara was approved and launched in the United States towards the end of May. The initial feedback from physicians has been positive and we are working on building market access. We have received EMEA approval of Kevzara in the EU, with the launch beginning in August.","Turning now to Praluent, or alirocumab. As reported by Sanofi, net sales in the second quarter were $46 million worldwide, with the U.S. accounting for $33 million of the total. While we continue to be disappointed by the uptake of the PCSK9 inhibitor class, we are encouraged by ongoing discussions with payers with respect to improvement in utilization management criteria. Earlier this week, CVS announced that it would provide co-preferred access to Praluent through its CVS Caremark commercial formularies, which cover approximately 25 million lives.","We remain optimistic about the long-term potential for this class. The potential resolution of our patent dispute with Amgen and anticipated cardiovascular outcomes data for Praluent in early 2018 could have an impact on demand. We remain committed to our efforts to improve Praluent access and bring this important product to more patients who can benefit. We're also proceeding with our potential regulatory filings and commercialization planning for Dupixent in asthma and REGN2810, our PD-1 inhibitor, in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.","With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry.","Robert E. Landry - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Regeneron posted strong second quarter 2017 financial results driven from the continued strength of our global EYLEA franchise. We're particularly pleased with achieving these results during a period where, together with our collaborator Sanofi, we have launched in the U.S. and are preparing to launch ex-U.S. two significant products, Dupixent and Kevzara. During today's call, I will discuss our financial results and highlight changes to our full year 2017 guidance line items.","In the second quarter of 2017, we earned $4.17 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $487 million. This represents a year-over-year increase in both non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income of 48%. Regeneron's second quarter 2017 non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense and the loss on extinguishment of debt, and includes the income tax effect of non-GAAP reconciling items. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release, which can be found on our website.","Total revenues in the second quarter of 2017 were $1.47 billion, which represented year-over-year growth of 21% over the second quarter of 2016. Net product sales were $924 million in the second quarter of 2017 compared to $834 million in the second quarter of 2016. EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $919 million in the second quarter of 2017 compared to $831 million in the second quarter of 2016, which represents an increase of 11%. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $1.77 billion versus $1.61 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of 10%.","We are raising our estimated full year 2017 U.S. EYLEA net product sales growth guidance to approximately 10% over 2016. Similar to the first quarter of 2017, EYLEA experienced another modest decrease in U.S. distributor inventory levels during the second quarter and remained within our normal one to two week targeted range. Ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales, which are recorded by our collaborator Bayer, were $542 million in the second quarter of 2017 as compared to $486 million in the second quarter of 2016, representing a 12% increase on a reported basis. On an operational or constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 16%.","In the second quarter of 2017, Regeneron recognized $191 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the United States. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the second quarter of 2017 was $210 million.","Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $222 million for the second quarter of 2017. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line item primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred commercialization-related expenses, and our share of profits or losses in connection with the commercialization of antibodies.","In the second quarter of 2017, our share of losses in connection with the commercialization of Praluent, Dupixent, and Kevzara was $122 million. This can be found in Table 4 of our earnings release. This loss includes our share of increased spending related to the ongoing Dupixent and Kevzara launches in the United States, as well as preparations related to launching Dupixent and Kevzara in other territories. We continue to proactively manage our marketing and selling expenditures in the global commercialization of Praluent with our collaborator Sanofi.","Netted within these losses were the global sales of Praluent, Dupixent, and Kevzara, as recorded by our collaborator Sanofi. For the second quarter of 2017, global net sales were Praluent $46 million, Dupixent $29 million, and Kevzara $1 million. Dupixent net sales in the second quarter largely reflect end-user demand and negligible contribution from inventory build. There were no material Dupixent sales outside the U.S.","Before I move on from the Sanofi antibody collaboration line, I'd like to inform you that the Antibody Discovery Agreement will be ending in accordance with its terms without any extension on December 31, 2017. The Antibody License and Collaboration Agreement, the Immuno-Oncology Discovery and Development Agreement, and the Immuno-Oncology License and Collaboration Agreement are not impacted by the expiration of the Antibody Discovery Agreement. The $130 million of 2017 annual funding from Sanofi under the Antibody Discovery Agreement is expected to be fully utilized by the end of the third quarter of 2017.","In the second quarter of 2017, other revenue was $114 million versus $23 million as of the second quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily due to the achievement of milestones in connection with our collaboration agreements related to the development of fasinumab with both Teva and Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma. In the second quarter 2017, we recognized a $25 million substantive milestone from Teva and a $30 million substantive milestone from Mitsubishi. For further details, you can find a summary of the components of other revenue in the MD&A section of our 10-Q.","Turning now to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $440 million for the second quarter of 2017. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total non-GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, was $196 million in the second quarter of 2017. Our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense.","We are lowering and tightening our full-year 2017 guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $925 million to $965 million from our previous guidance of $950 million to $1.025 billion. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $262 million for the second quarter of 2017. We are tightening and lowering our full year 2017 guidance of non-GAAP SG&A to $1.12 billion to $1.16 billion from our previous guidance range of $1.14 billion to $1.2 billion.","Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue, was $87 million for the second quarter of 2017. We are tightening and lowering our full year 2017 guidance of Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses to $370 million to $400 million from our previous guidance range of $385 million to $425 million.","One last operating expense I'd like to review is our cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing. As a reminder, this line item primarily reflects the cost incurred to manufacture commercial supplies for our collaborators. The increase to $61 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 versus $28 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was primarily driven by higher than historical manufacturing losses.","Before I conclude my prepared remarks with a review of taxes and our liquidity position, I do want to highlight an out-of-period adjustment to reflect a correction in our accounting for the lease of the Tarrytown, New York facility that was recorded in the second quarter of 2017. The adjustment resulted in the recognition of a $30 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the March 3, 2017 lease transaction and a corresponding decrease to property, plant, and equipment. These adjustments consisted entirely of non-cash adjustments, and therefore had no impact on our previously reported amounts in the statement of cash flows. Further details can be found in our most recent 10-Q that was filed earlier this morning. This loss on debt extinguishment has not been included within our non-GAAP results.","Turning now to taxes. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2017 was approximately 26% as compared to approximately 33% for the second quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, we are tightening and lowering guidance for our effective tax rate to be in the range of 27% to 31% from the previous range of 32% to 38%. This updated guidance reflects higher actual and forecasted tax deductions from stock option exercises, given the recent increase in our stock price, as well as lower forecasted losses in foreign jurisdictions. As stated on previous calls, there will be volatility in our effective tax rate on a quarter-to-quarter basis, since the tax benefits of stock-based compensation is included based on actual exercises in a quarter.","From a cash flow and balance sheet perspective, we ended the second quarter of 2017 with cash and marketable securities of $2.3 billion, a level consistent with March 31, 2017. Despite strong quarter 2017 operational results, our cash flow from operations in the second quarter was adversely impacted due to three factors. Higher inventory levels to support our two recent launches, plus more EYLEA inventory to support increased demand; higher Sanofi, Bayer, and trade accounts receivable; and higher cash tax payments. The tax payments included the final payment related to the Sanofi immuno-oncology collaboration upfront that we received in 2015.","Our capital expenditures for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2017 were $55 million and $105 million, respectively. We are lowering and tightening our full year 2017 capital expenditure guidance to be in the range of $250 million to $285 million from our previously provided range of $300 million to $350 million.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Manisha.","Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Bob. Jason, we'd now like to open the call for Q&A. In the interest of time, we request that you limit yourself to one question. We will be available in the office after the call for follow-up questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning. Congrats on strong quarter and thanks for the question. I want to ask about EYLEA. It sounds like your competitor, Lucentis, in the U.S. is experiencing actually quarter-over-quarter sequential decline in the sales in 2Q. So I was wondering what contributed to the strength in EYLEA and also what has changed since you guided single-digit growth in the beginning of the year.","And then quickly on Dupixent, any reason why we should see a strong inflection of additional patients add every week, instead of just steady NRx every week? Thank you.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Bob, do you want to handle the EYLEA question?","Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. EYLEA, as we pointed out earlier, has grown due to a growing in the market, which is partially related to the demographics in the marketplace, and also has grown in terms of market share. We believe some of that growth in market share is related to the positive data we've seen with EYLEA in diabetic macular edema. And in terms of a decline in Lucentis, there is multiple factors that could contribute to it, including any discounting they're doing, which relates to gross-to-net differences.","With regards to Dupixent, we have payers coming onboard on a regular basis. As I said, we expect broad market access by the end of the year. Patient claims are still making their way through the pipeline in many cases, so we do expect more perceptions being dispensed. And we continue to educate on disease awareness to let patients, who've been disenfranchised from the system, get back into their physicians and benefit from the product.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, Ying, let me just amplify a little bit on the Dupixent question there. Remember, the first question that we all were interested in, would there be a bolus, would there be a large number of patients who would get a prescription very soon after launch, and then the number of prescriptions written go down dramatically. We did not see that. We've seen a very steady number of prescriptions written, as we indicated, somewhere \u2013 over the last couple of months it's been very steady on a weekly basis.","The way that number could \u2013 so we are very pleased that there's no bolus. Obviously, this is what the system, if you will, can churn out right now. How could that grow? We can see in \u2013 I'm just talking about on the written prescription side, not the filled side, that that could go \u2013 obviously, if we see an increase in the number of prescribers, which takes time, but we are starting to see that, or whether or not the prescribers start to write prescriptions for patients who are not just more severe patients. We're seeing from what we can tell and hear that, as you would expect with the launch of a new class of drug, that patients who have been prescribed the drug, typically are the most severe of the patients.","So those are ways that the number could up, but first stop in this was to make sure there wasn't just a bolus and it was all going down, which we can now say at least over the first period of this launch, that's not the case. Next question...","Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question please.","Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Len, I think it is important to mention that now as these patients are coming back to their physician, we're hearing many of these patients are having very, very positive results in terms of reduced lesions and improved itch, and that is really contributing to patient satisfaction.","George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, I just wanted \u2013 this is George. I want to point out a couple things. Despite the mechanics of the healthcare system and reimbursement and rebates and all this, I'd like to think that physicians and patients are still driven quite a bit by how the drugs are actually performing and making a difference in their lives. So I'd like to think that one of the reasons that EYLEA is growing in market share is because of the recognition by physicians and patients of what a difference it's making in their experiences. And I think as Bob points out, we hope to see that the same will continue to be true as we're seeing from the early reports on Dupixent.","And I think another very important thing to realize about Dupixent is also the long view. As I noticed in my remarks, we are developing this for a very large number of allergic indications. The data right now, the early data and including pivotal study data is all very promising, so long-term growth in dupilumab is going to be by the recognition that it may be an important drug for many different allergic conditions, starting with asthma and going onward, and moreover that in a single-patient, hopefully, we'll be able to show in convincing way that in single patient it will able to simultaneously benefit multiple of their allergic conditions. And so we think that if the medicine is doing and bringing the sort of benefit that we think it's doing to the patients that that recognition will drive, of course, use because of the benefit it provides.","Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question please.","Operator","We have Chris Raymond from Raymond James.","Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. I've got a question on the pipeline. So, Len, I heard you say in a recent meeting \u2013 I heard you highlight REGN2810, your PD-1, when you were asked to talk about which pipeline program excites you the most. So I think we know the clinical plan that you guys have outlined is unique. You guys have seized on what looks like a pretty novel and quick path to market. But maybe if you could talk about the biology of the molecule that makes you think that sort of head-to-head this should be better maybe than other more advanced PD-1s. Just maybe talk about what drives you to highlight that molecule as the most exciting pipeline drug.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. I'm going to let George field with that question, but before I turn it over to him, I just wanted to point out that this is tough business. And if you look at each of our programs and what's been going on around us, it's been quite remarkable. If you just think about it, in the PD-1 space, which George will get into in a bit more, we've seen failures of PD-L1 to deliver survival benefits where PD-1 agents have. We've seen a failure of a PD-1 agent where another PD-1 agent was successful.","In the PCSK9 space, we've seen the failure of one agent to get to market because of issues in, from what I understand, immunogenicity. In the IL-4\/IL-13 space, we've seen people historically have failed with even going after the right target and people having failed by going after the wrong target, such as going after IL-13, and maybe people not getting even optimal results going after IL-5.","If you think about EYLEA, we've seen lot of explanations about why people shouldn't be able to get long-term benefit in it. The savior for this was going to be PDGF. An anti-VEGF therapy was banned. You've heard George, I think, put out a very convincing case that that's just not the case and the PDGF has fallen by the wayside.","Just yesterday in the IL-6 space, you've seen a group of people who chose IL-6 ligand instead of the IL-6 receptor, and that didn't seem to go so well, at least based on the vote of the advisory panel. So I just want to say that there is a lot that goes on and maybe the guy who makes all these choices for us and seems to have gone pretty good in the batting average can comment on the PD-1 space. George?","George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. I was going to actually bring up a lot of the same examples as Len just did. In terms of pointing out how really difficult this business is, how it really is so challenging, and it's really such a industry of failure, because the bar is rightfully set so high. I mean, we want to be bringing forward important, effective, and safe medicines to patients, and that, frankly, is probably the single hardest thing that we as a society actually do in terms of discovering and developing products.","And while I was reading my comments, I have to say I was shocked and stunned at how productive our people have been over so many years to produce so many product candidates and, as Len said, I'm a big track record guy. Over and over again, we've made the right decisions about which targets, about picking and selecting the right \u2013 out of many candidates, the right candidates to bring forward. And over and over again, we more likely than not have been proven right. And I think that this is something that is incredibly vastly underappreciated in this industry, how much of a role institutional knowledge plays and having a senior experienced leadership team that has the capability to over and over again make these decisions and pull on their collective memories to help make these sort of decisions. And if you go anywhere else and you look how long the people who are making these decisions have been around at that particular place, and it's just a couple of years.","Here, our senior management team at all levels \u2013 I'm not just talking about me and Len and the other most senior people, but we have in general people 15, 20 years who have been leading various efforts and we have enormous collective memory and institutional memory here. And it's only with that then you can have that sort of track record that can lead to the discovery of dozens and dozens of product candidates and be moving them forward, and in more cases than not be making the right decisions and making your bets. And whether it's picking PD-1 as opposed to PD-L1 and picking the right PD-1 antibody or picking IL-6 receptor versus IL-6 and picking the right IL-6 receptor antibody, or picking the right antibody for PCSK9 or picking the right target in the field of allergy, which nobody else happened to have picked in the entire world. This all comes from incredible internal genius and institutional memory that is very rare and, as I said, represents one of the hardest things we do as a society. The track record in the rest of the world is overwhelmingly one of failure. And, no, not everything we do will work, not anything we do will succeed. We have an amazing track record because of this institutional memory and the genius that we have here.","Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","We have Geoff Porges from Leerink Partners.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much. I just wanted to follow up on the questions about Dupixent, particularly the launch. You mentioned that 13,000 patients have been prescribed Dupixent. But could you tell us how many of those have converted to filled prescriptions?","And then secondly, Bob, could you give us a sense of what \u2013 of the patients that have had one filled prescription, what proportion of them are filling a second and ideally a third prescription, i.e., what's the treatment persistence after patients have started on Dupixent? Thanks very much. Just want to try and clarify how this is going.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Well, Geoff, this is Len. I mean, I think that Bob can comment if he has the number on how many patients we think have actually converted. There is obviously a lag. I think the interesting metric for us is that the number of new prescriptions written over the last several months, each week has been in the steady range of around 750 new patients per week, and there's been a steady new patients to the brand, as judged by IMS-type data, of over 500. So, that gives you a little bit of an idea. That's, obviously, not the same \u2013 it's not the 750 that got the prescription this week are the ones that are getting the prescription filled. But that gives you an idea of where the launch is sort of \u2013 how it's at least been behaving on a weekly basis for the last several months. Bob, do we have an idea of how many patients are actually on product at this time?","Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","I think it's fair to say that most patients have received one or two prescriptions based upon the timing of the launch. So to talk about adherence, it's too early to get into the specifics of that.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Okay.","Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","We have Alethia Young from Credit Suisse.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter. I guess just one on the complement program, when might we be in the position to get some of the early data and how are you kind of thinking about dosing in that program or is maybe that's something you're going to find out in the Phase 1? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, it's a little bit early to tell you much about that, but we \u2013 of course, we'll try and get all the information we can out of that Phase 1 program. When we have it, we'll make it available. Next question.","Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question.","Operator","We have Robyn Karnauskas from Citigroup.","Robyn Karnauskas, Ph.D. - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So just a question on the asthma study. So I know you mentioned that patient populations are different, but are there \u2013 or similar, but are there any differences between the Phase 2b and the Phase 3 that you think are notable? And I think you're stratifying patients by use of eosinophil counts. What happens if you are only successful in high eosinophils but not among the low eosinophil counts? Thanks.","George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, I think that, as I described in my comments, the populations are actually very similar. Obviously, when you have such a successful study, you do your best to reproduce it with the least number of modifications and changes. I mean, our first study was rather standard. It wasn't that we did anything so special, other than that we studied both the all-comer population, and then we looked in both the high and the low Eo subset.","We designed our study to look in the all-comer population, but we also designed to look in the high Eo population. If our data is limited to the high Eos, it would be a little less differentiating perhaps than we think it might be compared to other agents that are out there in development right now. But as you know, the real excitement is if it's positive in the all-comer population, nobody else has data that shows that a biologic can really affect the all-comer population.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Okay. I think we have time for just one more question today.","Operator","We have Carter Gould from UBS.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. For Bob, I guess, thanks for all the color. I guess, I recognize it's early in the launch, but generally speaking, for those plans that have opened up access, how satisfied are you with step edit, prior authorization criteria in place? And for those that have yet to open up access, can you characterize how those conservations are going? Is it really just sort of inertia from the plans focused on rebates or step edits versus them sort of just taking a dug-in stance? Thank you.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So just very quickly in the interest of time, we can say about a third of the places where decisions have been made, they've been made according to the label and we're very pleased. About another third, just roughly speaking, have made decisions which is slightly more restrictive. They might have \u2013 require topical calcineurin inhibitor as opposed to just a topical corticosteroid. A few of those required systematic steroids. And there's still another 35-or-so percent that we're working on, which some of them have automatic blocks and some it just takes time, but we hope to, as we said, get broad access towards the \u2013 by the end of the year. Sanofi and Regeneron are working very hard at this, and I think I would have to characterize this based on other metrics we looked at other launches that's going very well in this modern era. Okay.","Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","All right. I know many of you were in queue and didn't get a chance to ask your questions. Just send us an e-mail and we'll make sure to follow-up with you. Jason?","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","All right, operator.

Schleifer","Thanks, Michael. Good morning to everyone, and thanks to so many of you who are joining our second quarter 2013 earnings call. Before I turn the call over to Bob Terifay to discuss our commercial operations and Murray to discuss our financial results, let me provide some big picture thoughts, as well as highlight the exciting clinical news and regulatory update that we reported this morning regarding EYLEA in diabetic macular edema or DME.","We are very pleased with the global performance of EYLEA, including our sales in the U.S. and our partner, Bayer Healthcare Sales, outside the U.S. U.S. sales were $330 million this quarter, which represents a 70% year-over-year growth. The x U.S. launch continues to do well with net sales of $96 million. Our profit share on these x U.S. sales was $34 million and contributed $19 million to our bottom line after accounting for our repayment obligation to Bayer HealthCare for development expenses. Outside the U.S., many of our launches are under way, and we look forward to the continued roll out across the EU and other countries around the world.","Beyond the x U.S. launch, new indications represent the next leg of growth for EYLEA. To that end, we launched into the Central Retinal Vein Occlusion, also known as CRVO market, in the United States in September of last year, and we recently announced that the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use or the CHMP issued a positive recommendation for EYLEA for macular edema following CRVO. We also reported positive Phase III data for EYLEA in the MYRROR trial in myopic choroidal neovascularization or mCNV, and our partner, Bayer HealthCare, expects to file for regulatory approval in Asia later this year. We also expect to report top line data from the VIBRANT trial of EYLEA in branch retinal vein occlusion, or BRVO, later this year. The most recent news, however, on the indication front for EYLEA, as I'm sure you're all aware, is that this morning, we and Bayer HealthCare announced positive Phase III data from the VISTA and VIVID Phase III trials in diabetic macular edema. We plan to file for regulatory approval in both the U.S. and EU by the end of the year, which is approximately 1 year ahead of schedule in the United States.","As we detailed in our press release this morning, both the 2 milligram every 4-week dose and the 2-milligram every 8-week arms of the VISTA and VIVID trials achieved the primary endpoint of improved visual acuity of 1 year compared to laser photocoagulation therapy. Importantly, both EYLEA dosed monthly and dosed every other month following 5 monthly injections demonstrated similar improvements in visual acuity. In the VIVID-DME trial and x .S. trial after 1 year, patients receiving EYLEA 2 milligrams monthly had a mean change from baseline in best corrected visual acuity of 10.5 letters with a P less than 0.0001 and patients receiving EYLEA 2 milligrams every other month after 5 initial monthly injections had a mean change from baseline of best corrected visual acuity of 10.7 letters to be also less than 0.0001, and this was compared to patients receiving photocoagulation, with a mean change from baseline and best corrected visual acuity of only 1.2 letters.","In the VISTA-DME trial, a primarily North American trial, after 1 year, patients receiving EYLEA 2 milligrams monthly had a mean change from baseline best corrected visual acuity of 12.5 letters, P less than 0.0001, and patients receiving EYLEA 2 milligrams every other month after 5 initial monthly injections had a mean change from baseline in best corrected visual acuity of 10.7 letters, P also less than 0.0001 compared to patients receiving laser photocoagulation who had a mean change from baseline in best corrected visual acuity of just 0.2 letters. In these trials, EYLEA was generally well-tolerated with a similar overall incidence of adverse events, ocular serious adverse events and non-ocular serious adverse events across the treatment groups and the laser control group. Arterial thromboembolic events, as defined by the Anti-Platelet Trialists' Collaboration, which included nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarctions and vascular deaths, also occurred at similar rates across the treatment groups and the laser control group. Adverse events were typical of those seen in other studies in patients with diabetes receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy.","The most frequent ocular treatment emergent adverse events observed in the VIVID and VISTA trials included conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain and vitreous floaters. The most frequent non-ocular treatment emergent adverse events included hypertension and nasopharyngitis, which occurred with similar frequency in the treatment groups and the laser control group. As in wet AMD, we believe that the every-other-month dosing could provide an important potential benefit to patients and physicians. There were a number of secondary endpoints and analyses that were conducted, which strongly support the primary results, and we look forward to presenting a more complete data set at upcoming medical conferences.","Now turning to the regulatory aspect. As we indicated in this morning's press release, we now plan to submit applications for regulatory approval both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. later this year. In the U.S., this represents an approximately 1 year acceleration from our previously anticipated submission date. The decision to file for regulatory approval in the U.S. based on a 1-year primary endpoint rather than the typical 2-year primary endpoint was made following extensive discussions with the FDA. DME represents a significant market opportunity, one that many believe could be as large as, if not larger than, the market opportunity in wet AMD, and Bob Terifay will provide additional details on the DME market opportunity.","Before turning over to Murray and Bob, I would like to discuss our late-stage pipeline, which we believe will drive long-term growth. On that front, our 2 Phase III programs, alirocumab for hypercholesterolemia and sarilumab for rheumatoid arthritis, have continued to make good progress. ODYSSEY is a broad Phase III program for alirocumab. It includes over 10 clinical studies that are currently ongoing. Today, we announced another Phase III study for alirocumab called ODYSSEY CHOICE, and we intend to initiate for the end of the year. This critical trial will study alirocumab dosed every 4 weeks, all other ODYSSEY trials studied every 2 weeks dosing, and we remain confident that every 2-week dosing will provide the majority of patients with the preferred convenient patient-friendly option. We want, however, to be able to provide patients and physicians a once-monthly dosing regimen if desired. Later this year, we expect to report top line data from the Phase III ODYSSEY MONO trial. It's important to remember, while this will be the first Phase III data to be reported from this class of antibodies with approximately 100 patients, the MONO trial is only a small piece of the ODYSSEY clinical program with the majority of our trials leading out in 2014.","Our Phase III sarilumab program is ongoing, and we expect to report initial data earlier next year from the Phase III MOBILITY trial. We also started 2 new Phase III rheumatoid arthritis trials with sarilumab this quarter, the COMPARE and ASCERTAIN trials, and we'll soon initiate our first trial with sarilumab outside of rheumatoid arthritis, the Phase II statin trial of sarilumab in noninfectious uveitis.","Turning to our earlier stage pipeline, this quarter saw the presentation and publication of data from our IL-4R inhibitor, dupilumab, in the New England Journal of Medicine. It is not common for a Phase II trial to be published in the New England Journal of Medicine, and we believe this highlights the excitement generated from this potentially novel approach to treat allergic-type disease. We believe that blocking the interleukin 4 and interleukin 13 pathways with dupilumab could be an effective mechanism to treat multiple allergic conditions, and that we may have the ability to impact one of the fundamental drivers that could have applicability in the growing epidemic of allergic diseases. Of course, we need to test this in larger studies, and to that end, we and Sanofi now have 2 Phase IIb trials of dupilumab that are ongoing, one in allergic asthma and the other in atopic dermatitis, and look forward to results in these trials in the future.","Turning to our early-stage programs. This quarter, we moved 2 new antibodies both against undisclosed targets into the clinic, and discontinued the development of 1 early-stage antibody. In addition to our 3 marketed products: ARCALYST, EYLEA and ZALTRAP, we now have a total of 12 antibodies in clinical development. We take pride in our science-first approach and the fact that all 12 of our pipeline antibodies have originated from in-house Regeneron research.","With that, let me turn the call now over to Bob Terifay, our Senior Vice President of Commercial, who will elaborate on our commercial activities; and finally, Murray Goldberg, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our financial performance during the first quarter of 2013. Bob?","Robert J. Terifay","Thank you, Len, and good morning, everyone. EYLEA sales continue to show strong physician-demand growth both in the United States and outside the United States. In the United States, net sales to distributors in the second quarter were $330 million. Inventory held by distributors remains at the 1- to 2-week range, although there was a modest reduction in inventory in Q2 relative to the first quarter.","We continue to see strong physician usage of EYLEA, and we have raised our full year net sales forecast to between $1.3 billion and $1.35 billion. Our qualitative market research, which comes from physician-based questionnaires that was conducted in the second quarter, indicates that in terms of eyes treated, EYLEA now represents almost half of the U.S. wet AMD market for approved products, with approved products accounting for more than half of the overall marketplace. As discussed in our first quarter call, due to the recent sequester-related decrease in Medicare reimbursement for Medicare Part B or buy-and-bill drugs such as anti-VEGF agents, our research suggests financial concerns amongst some retinal specialists, which favors the use of off-label bevacizumab. Once again, based on qualitative market research, in the second quarter, approximately 60% of the EYLEA-treated eyes were continuing on EYLEA from previous months. 18% were switches from bevacizumab and ranibizumab, and 21% were new to anti-VEGF treatment highlighting that the pool of patients available for switching is reaching steady-state levels. New patients represented a larger share than switch patients in EYLEA market share for the first time. In our survey, physicians report positive clinical responses to EYLEA that meet or exceed their expectations in 72% of treated eyes. In the majority of the remaining patients, it's too early to assess response to therapy. From the survey, physicians now estimate that wet AMD patients on average achieve a dosing interval of 7.2 weeks for EYLEA, as compared to 5.4 and 5.9 weeks with ranibizumab and bevacizumab, respectively.","In the macular edema following CRVO indication, for which EYLEA has received regulatory approval in the United States, our qualitative market research indicates that during the second quarter, EYLEA achieved a 40% share of the approved anti-VEGF products, with approved products accounting for 45% of the overall marketplace. In our survey, physicians reported positive clinical responses to EYLEA in CRVO that meet or exceed their expectations in 69% of treated eyes. Again, in the majority of the remaining patients, it's too early to assess response to therapy.","Turning now to our x U.S. EYLEA business, where we split profits 50-50 with Bayer HealthCare, second quarter EYLEA net sales were $96 million. While at the end of the second quarter, EYLEA was available in 29 countries, second quarter sales were primarily from Japan, Australia and Germany. Bayer reports that current market share is 56% in Japan, 48% in Australia and 22% and growing in Germany. Over the course of 2013, we expect Bayer HealthCare to embark on launches in additional countries as regulatory and pricing approvals for EYLEA wet AMD are achieved.","More recently, we're pleased with the positive recommendation and reimbursement decision from the U.K.'s NICE, along with a positive statement from The Royal College of Ophthalmologists, in which they said, \"The advantage of EYLEA over existing treatment is its longer duration of action in the eyes, which can lead to fewer intraocular injections.\" In addition, an application for marketing authorization for EYLEA for the treatment of macular edema following CRVO received a positive opinion for approval by the European CHMP. Additional applications in macular edema following CRVO are pending in Japan and other regions. Furthermore, Bayer HealthCare intends to file x U.S. marketing applications for EYLEA in Myopic CMV before year-end.","Let's spend a moment to discuss the DME market opportunity if EYLEA is approved for marketing in that indication. In the United States alone, there are 570,000 patients diagnosed with clinically significant diabetic macular edema. Currently, 40% of these patients are treated with an anti-VEGF agent, which continues to grow each quarter since the launch of ranibizumab for that indication in 2012. Moreover, we expect -- we estimate that almost half of the DME patients may have bilateral disease, therefore, the market opportunity for EYLEA DME could be at least as large as the opportunity in wet AMD.","Finally, turning to ZALTRAP or ziv-aflibercept, Sanofi reported sales of $19 million for the quarter, which is up 32% from the first quarter of 2013. This growth is driven primarily by growing sales in the first quarter of full launch in Germany and the United Kingdom. We look forward to continued s U.S. rollouts for launch over the course of 2013.","With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Murray Goldberg.","Murray A. Goldberg","Thank you, Bob, and good morning. Len and Bob have already provided the highlights of EYLEA sales in the U.S. and the rest of the world. So I'll go directly to the second quarter P&L. Total revenues in the second quarter were $458 million, including U.S. EYLEA net sales of $330 million and ARCALYST net sales of $4 million. Non-GAAP net income was $198 million or $1.73 per diluted share compared to $1.78 per diluted share in the first quarter of this year. The decrease is primarily due to 2 $10 million license payments we made to Sanofi in May that I'll describe later, and royalty expense related to the Genentech license settlement that we entered into also in May.","Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue was $31 million. This includes $19 million from our share of x U.S. profits, including royalties in the case of Japan on total x U.S. EYLEA sales of $96 million. It is also net of the $15 million payment to Bayer HealthCare in the quarter for reimbursement of development expenses that they previously funded. Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue also includes cost sharing of ongoing EYLEA development expenses, reimbursement of other Regeneron EYLEA expenses and amortization of upfront and milestone payments. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $86 million for the quarter. This includes reimbursement of our R&D expenses for preclinical and clinical development within our antibody collaboration and amortization of payments previously received from Sanofi, less our share of the losses associated with ZALTRAP. ZALTRAP net sales in the second quarter were $19 million compared to $14 million in the first quarter of 2013. ZALTRAP is now approved in 30 countries around the world, and commercialization activities are underway and commercialization and pre-commercialization expenses are being incurred. Our share of ZALTRAP losses in the quarter was $8 million. As we've said before, we do not expect ZALTRAP to be profitable to Regeneron in the near term due to our obligation to repay Sanofi from our 50% share of ZALTRAP profits for 50% of ZALTRAP development expenses that they have funded. At the end of 2012, that repayment obligation was $419 million.","Sanofi collaboration revenue in the second quarter was also reduced by 2 one-time $10 million upfront payments that we made to Sanofi relating to the acquisition of full lines to the PDGFR antibody and to the Ang2 antibody in ophthalmology. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $27 million in the second quarter compared to $29 million in the first quarter. Included in COGS is our royalty obligation to Genentech related to U.S. sales of EYLEA. As in prior quarters, COGS continued to average less than 10% of product sales.","Let me also highlight a new line in our income statement, cost of collaboration manufacturing. Previously, this have been combined with cost of goods sold because it was not very large. Cost of goods sold is the manufacturing costs, including royalties, of goods that we sell and that are included in our net product sales line, namely, U.S. EYLEA and ARCALYST. Cost of collaboration manufacturing is the manufacturing cost, including royalties, that we directly incur related to goods that we manufacture and that are sold by our collaborators, specifically, ZALTRAP and EYLEA outside the United States. This is not the total manufacturing cost of these products since we only provide the bulk material, and our collaborators incur additional costs such as for finishing and packaging. While cost of collaboration manufacturing includes our manufacturing costs for making both material that our collaborators sell, this line item currently consists primarily of royalties that we are obligated to pay, including the Genentech royalty that we pay until around mid-2016 on sales of EYLEA that is manufactured in the United States, but sold outside the United States.","Since we just signed the Genentech royalty agreement relating to x U.S. sales this past May, the second quarter cost of collaboration manufacturing also includes some catch-up royalties for EYLEA sales outside the U.S. prior to the second quarter. Going forward for the next couple years, we expect cost of collaboration manufacturing to average around 7% to 8% of total ZALTRAP and x U.S. EYLEA sales. Approximately half of the cost of collaboration manufacturing is reimbursed to us by our collaborators through the collaboration revenue line.","Non-GAAP SG&A expense in the second quarter was $56 million compared to $51 million in the first quarter. We are revising our non-GAAP SG&A expense guidance for 2013 to $225 million to $250 million, up from the previously provided range of $215 million to $235 million. Non-GAAP R&D expense for the second quarter was $160 million compared to $154 million in the first quarter. This included unfunded R&D expenses of $46 million compared to $44 million in the first quarter. As a reminder, unfunded R&D is the difference between our total non-GAAP R&D expense, and the amount that is reimbursed by our collaborators. We expect unfunded R&D expenses to increase in the second half of the year for several reasons, including the potential for us to begin to share Phase III costs for alirocumab and the cost of advancing our own unpartnered programs. That said, we are updating our full year 2013 non-GAAP unfunded R&D expense guidance to $225 million to $275 million, down from the prior $275 million to $325 million. As a reminder, non-GAAP SG&A and R&D expenses exclude non-cash share-based compensation expense.","As I mentioned, for the second quarter of 2013, we reported non-GAAP net income of $198 million or $1.73 per fully diluted share. Non-GAAP EPS excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense related to our senior convertible notes and non-cash income tax expense, and is based on approximately 115 million fully diluted outstanding shares. A full reconciliation of all the adjustments to GAAP earnings are set out in our earnings release.","Turning now to taxes. For GAAP accounting purposes, in the second quarter, we recorded $60 million in income taxes, representing an effective tax rate of just over 41% for the quarter. For the rest of the year, we expect the GAAP tax rate to also be in the low 40% range. As we've stated before, we do not expect to pay significant cash taxes through at least 2014. At the end of the second quarter, we had $711 million in cash and marketable securities and $768 million in trade account receivable primarily related to EYLEA sales for a total of about $1.5 billion.","With that, I would now like to turn the call back over to Len.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Thanks, Murray. The second quarter was another exciting quarter at Regeneron with strong EYLEA growth, driven by the continued growth in the United States and the ongoing successful x U.S. launch. New indications for EYLEA continue to build momentum with the diabetic macular edema data and regulatory update highlighting the future opportunities. And of course, our pipeline continues to march forward with the first Phase III data of alirocumab, our LDL lowering antibody, expected later this year.","I would now like to turn the call back over to Michael.","Michael Aberman","Thank you, Len. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our team will be available in our office after the call for follow-up questions. Thank you, and operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question is from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just had a question on DME. I guess, can you tell us what percent of patients had vision gain in this study? Or can you say if it was at least as good as Lucentis? And then any commentary on current off-label use of EYLEA for DME?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes, on the second, we really don't have any information. We don't promote, and we don't really even track any off-label use of a product. As far as the first one, the investigators want to present the details of the study at the upcoming scientific meetings. I can say that the endpoints like you're talking about, strongly correlate, obviously, with best corrected visual acuity. So the results are strong, and we look forward to presenting them to -- later this year at a medical conference.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can I ask one follow-up?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes, go ahead.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On PCSK9, I noticed you guys are moving to once-a-month schedule now as well which is on par with Amgen. Just what drove the change in your thinking there? Because I know you guys had focused on the every other week for a while, but just curious what data drove that decision.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes. So if you look at the cholesterol-lowering market historically, you can go to many a cocktail party, and some of these say, why take Lipitor, I take Crestor, I take 10 milligrams, I take 20 milligrams. That tends to individualize therapy and titrate therapy in this area. So we thought that since our drug could perform for many patients on an every monthly dosing regimen, we have that data -- it's not new data. It's based on the data we had from our earlier pre-Phase III work. We thought it made sense to include some of that in our Phase III package, so that overall, doctors and patients would have a good choice of regimen and doses and titrate-ability, et cetera. So nothing really new there. Our drug has always been had -- the same PK as we've always had, obviously, and we expect that we should be able to have Q4 week dosing for many of the patients who would be good, but for those who need more, we'll have the Q2 week.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And is that the same formulation? You'll be using the same device?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes, we're not going to get into all the details because this is pretty highly competitive, but we think our delivery systems will be a competitive asset. We have a partner who's delivered lots of products. And they deliver more, injected insulin probably than anybody else in the world, as far as I know, and so this is an important part of our program.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Raymond of Robert Baird.","Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So I'm kind of intrigued, Bob mentioned an inventory reduction at distributors, is it possible you could maybe give us a little bit more detail around exactly what that in dollar terms that impact was? And I guess, sort of, should we expect to see a benefit or some impact in Q2 -- or, I'm sorry, in Q3?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes, it's hard to predict how the fluctuations will go from quarter-to-quarter even from week-to-week. I think Bob mentioned that in this particular quarter, we still had inventory that was in the 1- to 2-week range with a modest drawdown of inventory. Can't tell how or what our distributors will do so we really can't predict that.","Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And okay, and if you're taking follow-ups, can I ask one?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Go ahead. One follow-up. And Michael?","Michael Aberman","Len's a softy.","Leonard S. Schleifer","I'm easy. I'll take as many questions you like. Michael's tough within the limit, but future questions, it's only one. You can get a follow-up.","Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just a quick one here. So despite our calculation, it looks like DSOs actually went up slightly, Q1 to Q2. Can you maybe talk a little bit about -- I know you've been talking about titrating down your terms. Can you maybe give us some color on the dynamics there and when we should expect to see that start to move down?","Murray A. Goldberg","Yes, well, the day sales outstanding going up because we have -- the sales have been going up through the quarter. We did adjust the terms down earlier in the year, and that will start to flow through later in the year. The terms are still a bit long so it'll take a while for that to show up but we -- by the end of the year, the day sales should go down for that reason because of the lower terms.","Operator","Yes, the next question is from Steve Byrne of Bank of America.","Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So, Bob, if I understood the data you're provided in your market research correctly, it sounds like Avastin's share of wet AMD is less than 50%, and in the balance, Lucentis still has more share than EYLEA. If I heard that correctly, and we assume Avastin was roughly 2\/3 of the market 2 years ago, it would suggest you've taken more share from Avastin than Lucentis, and is that what you would have expected, say, 2 years ago? And what do you think is leading to the stickiness of Lucentis?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Right, so good question. Bob will elaborate on it. But the quick response is that I don't think your premise is quite accurate. If you look even at Roche's call, they show their graph of Lucentis uptake in the United States. And when we came to market, that turned down quite significantly, and they mentioned that only because of DME approval did it turn up. So I would say we took market both from the Avastin market as well as from the Lucentis market. Some of the stickiness with Lucentis, obviously, it's a product that's been around for a while so people are using it. They stick on it. The others, they do have a rebate program, which we don't have, which could be, we think, influencing the marketplace quite seriously. So those are the facts. Bob, anything to add on that?","Robert J. Terifay","No, I'll just say that Len is right on. We actually are basically at a 50-50 split with Lucentis right now. We have taken significant share away from them, but we've also been successful in penetrating the Avastin market, and we expect wet AMD to continue to grow in the United States.","Operator","Yes, the next question is from Jim Birchenough of BMO Capital Markets.","Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just a quick 2 part question. Just to follow-up on the prior question, is there anything that you're considering in your own rebate program trying to get into that other 50% of the Lucentis share? It seems like that's a big part of the stickiness, and now that things are starting to stabilize, I'm wondering if you'd consider a rebate program? And on DME, just wondering if the dynamic that's allowed you to file a year ahead of schedule might also allow for a more rapid review, i.e. a Priority Review?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Right, good question and a good way to get around Michael's ban on 2 questions, ask one 2-part question. I'm all for it, Jim. As far as the first question goes, I don't think it'd be appropriate on this call to discuss our commercial strategies and some of the details on what we're going to do. It's a competitive marketplace out there. As far as the acceleration and the potential for priority review, obviously, Priority Review is something that you apply for at the time of your submission. We did that for age-related macular degeneration. We made our case, and we'll make our case again, of course, but that's up to the reviewers at the FDA so it's a little bit -- it's way too early to speculate. As far as the decision to move from the 2-year endpoint to a 1-year endpoint, that is something that came after substantial discussions with the agency. I must say we've been dealing with the agency -- I've been dealing with them for several decades now, and they continue to demonstrate that they are a science-based and evidence-based agency, and that our discussions with them were working through what's the data, what's the science, what's best for patients. I think they had that same goal in mind as we did, and so that's how we arrived at our decision to file a year early.","Operator","Yes, the next question is from Ying Huang of Barclays.","Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Congratulations on the DME data. So Len, can I ask a 3-parter question here?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Ying, it's okay, with me, Michael...","Michael Aberman","Guys, we have a lot of people who want to get through so be really mindful of your colleagues.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes, there you go.","Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So firstly, I want to ask about the safety here. Obviously, you see a lack of imbalance in the arterial events here, but specifically, what about the CV death? And then how much does that lack of safety signal between the 2 different dosing arms play into the decision of FDA allowing you to file based on 1-year data?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Right. So yes, you're asking for some detail on the APTC deaths, if I heard you, Ying. Well, look, looking at deaths was very important, given the safety findings that were found with the other approved anti-VEGF agents to treat DME, and we did not find any dose-dependent increase in deaths with EYLEA in these results, and specifically, the number of APTC-defined deaths where the same in all arms with 2 APTC deaths in each of the study arms, including the laser pulling the data across the 2 studies. So 2, 2 and 2 APTC deaths. So we're very pleased with that, and so we'll see whether or not that gets us any differentiation or not.","Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then also, can you outline the opportunity for EYLEA in DME here in terms of, obviously, your growth for your franchise in the U.S. market?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Right. So diabetes is a big problem. There's 25 -- no, there's about 25 million people in the United States who have diabetes and maybe 2 million people are going to be diagnosed each year with that. If you're over age 65, you've got about a 25% chance of having diabetes so diabetes itself is a big problem, and there's probably several million or more people who have diabetic retinopathy and somewhere between the 0.5 million and 1 million people who have diabetic macular edema and many of them need treatment in both eyes. So this could be a very significant market opportunity for us, but more importantly, it's a potential for us to bring a new therapy to patients who really have a need. Diabetic-related eye disease is the most common cause of blindness in young people, and diabetic macular edema is the main cause of blindness in diabetics. So we're thrilled that we might be able to bring something to patients as additional choice for this disease. Bob, do you want add anything there?","Robert J. Terifay","No, I think it's a significant growing market opportunity. About 280,000 patients are treated each year with anti-VEGF agent. That keeps growing quarter-over-quarter. And we're very encouraged by the results of our studies, which indicate that patients can be dosed every other month with this disease where compliance is a challenge and many of the people are still in the workplace, and so this may be a new treatment option that's convenient for patients if it does get approved.","Operator","The next question is from Robert Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank.","Alethia Young - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Alethia Young, in for Robyn.","I just want to get a little bit more flavor on we're -- looking at the Avastin and the sequester, do you think there's still an opportunity to take share in Avastin beyond the sequester, and kind of can you talk about that U.S. opportunity there?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes, I think the physicians initially did not understand the adjustments to reimbursement that occurred to the sequester so I think there was some confusion over the previous quarter. People are starting to figure out the reimbursement situation, and there's -- the market research indicates there's still an opportunity to take share from Avastin.","Operator","The next question is from Jason Kantor of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jason Kantor - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Most of my EYLEA questions have been asked, but I just wanted to see, can you give us any idea about what the indications your new drugs that you put into the clinics are going after. And now that the 1 drug fell out of the clinic, can we learn anything about what that was and what your decision process was to take that out of the clinic?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes. So Jason, we don't like to get into the specifics of a very early-stage pipeline because it really doesn't generate much value in the investment community at this point, but it's important for our long-term strategy, and what targets we choose is a fairly competitive area. I can say that the good news about Regeneron is that we have plenty of drug candidates to put into the clinic, to choose from, and plenty in the clinic to keep us fully occupied. So we're able to make decisions if we see something that doesn't look good, doesn't do what we hoped it might, then we'll kill it. And we, of course, would rather kill these things early, which we can do privately and rather than have public funerals when you're in Phase II or Phase III. So I mean, having a big pipeline and a robust research organization, I mean, George Yancopoulos and his team are perhaps the most prolific research organization in the biotechnology industry by many metrics. So we continue to benefit from that, and we hope to continue over the long haul.","Jason Kantor - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Well, if I can't get you to talk about the undisclosed stuff, can you talk about the rationale from moving sarilumab into non-infectious uveitis and what the timing is there?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Well, I can tell you that the rationale is that non-infectious, meaning it's not caused by infection, inflammation of the eye, primarily uvea, is an important disease that we think could be driven by inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 6, and we've got some data to support that. And we think we've got a clinical trial that is getting underway that will be able to give us a good answer whether that this is a good area. Remember, uveitis is one of those diseases that you do see -- occasionally, you see it in children, in syndromes associated with rheumatoid arthritis, without it, it could be autoimmune. So there's a pretty good rationale and other data that we have on this.","Operator","The next question is from Adnan Butt of RBC Capital Markets.","Adnan S. Butt - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And since I like Michael, I will ask one question, but I'll make it a pointed one. So for alirocumab, do you expect less variability in this every 4-week trial and is that enough to get it added to the label or will you need more?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes, I think that, obviously, we're doing the study as we hope that this will be sufficient to get us to the label. There are lots of ways to look at success in treating patients with cholesterol. The endpoint, the area under the curve, how many patients hit their goal, and I think that this is -- this isn't a disease where you have to get it right immediately. It's not like you're treating an acute myocardial infarction, where if you mess up, it's an enormously bad consequences to a patient. Here, you want to get it right, and doctors want to make sure they get the right and the most convenient and the most compliant doses. So I think our strategy's a good one here.","Robert J. Terifay","But Len, there is one thing. We are not abandoning every 2-week dosing regimen. The research shows that every 2 weeks is right now favored by patients and physicians. It's not seen as inconvenient. We just wanted to offer another treatment option with the monthly dosing.","Operator","Yes, the next question mission is from Huron Weber of Citi.","Kumaraguru Raja","This is Kumar, in for Huron. So what is the status of the FDA clinical hold on the anti-NGF antibody? And once the hold is lifted, what are the next steps?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Right. So the only thing we can say at this point is that Pfizer's had a conversation with the FDA that they relayed to the public on their call that suggested after they finish completing some preclinical data, they'll be able to come off clinical hold, and they expect to be in the Phase III program some time, I think, in the first part of next year. We don't have any specific information. We are still on clinical hold at this time, but obviously, we'll keep you advised and how discussions go and what progress we're making in that area.","Operator","Yes, the next question is from Josh Schimmer of Lazard Capital Markets.","Joshua Schimmer - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","For EYLEA in DME, maybe you can discuss reasons to expect either the same or different levels switching from Avastin and Lucentis to EYLEA as compared what you've experienced in the AMD setting?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Well, it's obviously hard to predict. We do hear that patients are not always satisfied with their current treatments. We did have anti-VEGF experienced patients in our trials so we know that you can safely switch, at least, that's what the data to us shows. Obviously, we have to submit all those to the agency, but I imagine that there'll be a pent-up demand for that as well. I think you saw that the launch of Lucentis in DME, notwithstanding the fact that Avastin was treating people, there was very brisk uptake it seemed there based on what you can glean from the Genentech close information. Still, I'm optimistic about that. Bob?","Robert J. Terifay","There are patients, including in our trial, that were not doing well on other therapies that were switched, and seem to have done well, and so I think there will be a marketplace for us when we launch.","Joshua Schimmer - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Is that unmet need comparable between DME and AMD...","Robert J. Terifay","I think it's too early to speculate on that.","Operator","The next question is from John Newman of JMP Securities.","John L. Newman - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but I just wanted to ask, are you still maintaining the same timing in terms of when you will put your PDGF antibody into the clinic?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes, guidance hasn't changed on that. We hope to get, I think, later this year going on the eye studies with either the Ang2 and\/or the PDGF this year.","Operator","The next question is from Matthew Harrison of UBS.","Matthew Harrison - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about compounding and if you're seeing any share shift related to Avastin there, and then maybe your opinion on the bills that are in Congress right now and their potential impact.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes, so there's really -- there's no obvious sea change with people who have massively left Avastin to go to either Lucentis or EYLEA. The -- it seems like the based on surveys, the market share for Avastin has somewhat stabilized at around half the market. As far as predicting what this Congress will do, it's extremely difficult. There are many bills out there, the Senate health bill, there's some House bills. We believe it's been our position that at the end of the day, patients can have a choice. Doctors can have a choice. They should have choices, but there shouldn't be a hidden choice in choosing one product which has a higher quality than another. And that we believe that -- so therefore, all products sold should meet the same FDA-mandated standards in terms of quality. Beyond that, and we hope that that's what the legislation will advance, and that's been our position on this both publicly and in discussions we've had in Washington. So just to state it succinctly, we believe in choice. We have no problem with patients choosing Avastin, choosing Lucentis, choosing EYLEA, but we believe in a single standard so that patients don't have to worry about quality of the product they choose.","Operator","Next question is from Geoff Meacham of JPMorgan.","Anupam Rama - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Anupam Rama, in for Geoff Meacham. I think you mentioned that the dosing interval was 7.2 weeks for EYLEA. Just wondering if you could help us put that into context of what you've been seeing over the last several quarters and how that's impacted sort of quarter-over-quarter growth that you're seeing in the U.S. and what you expect the dosing interval will sort of may trend in the future.","Robert J. Terifay","So we have 2 groups of patients that are treated with EYLEA. One group of patients who were recalcitrant to previous anti-VEGF therapy, those patients are generally started off with the monthly dosing regimen and then the physicians extend the treatment interval over time, hoping to get good efficacy with the reasonable interval. The other group are those patients who were new to the therapy. Patients new to therapy generally are getting dosed closer to the every 8-week language that is in our prescribing information. The 7.2 is very encouraging in that the switch patients seem to be getting out further in the dosing interval week. We started with an interval that was about 6 weeks so we're up 7.2 now. I think you'll see in AMD that, that interval probably will stay in the 7.2- to 8-week range. So obviously, as we've stated all along, as the dosing interval increases, the number of doses per quarter do decline so we're dependent upon getting new patients into the marketplace, and that's where our success have been in this quarter.","Operator","The next question is from Joseph Schwartz of Leerink Swann.","Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","I was wondering, do you expect your PDGF antibody to have any advantages over first-generation agents in terms of things like binding affinity or hitting more receptor subunits? Anything that can compete on use basis similar to what's driven your and Lucentis' strength versus the first-generation anti-VEGFs?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Well, I think we just have a more -- important task first is to establish whether or not anti-PDGF at all works in this setting before we decide which is the best agent. So far, there's been 1 large Phase II trial. But even in our trials, our large Phase III trials, you see several other differences that you can see early on. In trials, you see this all the time. That is you see random fluctuations. In our trial, it's interesting. We were asked about deaths, we saw 2 deaths, APTC and everything. And then in low -- 1 study, 1 low-dose group had 2 cancers, and in another adverse event, they had more of something else, and so you see these differences. And in our study, you'll see when the data comes out, the slight difference between the monthly in one study and the every other month was probably just a difference in the groups because were they were different almost from the beginning before they switched every other month. So what I'm trying to say is that job #1 is to do another robust study and see if PDGF really works. If PDGF really works, then I think the advantage that we'll have is that we hope to be able to combine it in a single syringe so it's one shot. So that's a big difference in having to give 2 shots, in our view, but still a long way to go between whether or not this is actually going to make a difference in patients.","Operator","The next question is from Biren Amin of Jefferies.","Biren Amin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I guess just from the regulatory filing in the U.S., will FDA be requiring a 2-year update on efficacy and safety from VIVID VISTA?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Well, I don't know. We don't know what they'll require at the end of the day. What we do know is that based on discussions, we think that the 1-year data that we have from these 2 trials will be adequate for them to review our application, and hopefully we'll be able to get it approved. So I think we're intending to keep the studies going, but right now, we're expecting to submit based on the 1-year data and that we hope that, that would be sufficient, based on our discussions, for an approval...","Biren Amin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I was going to say if I could have a follow-up, what do think are the implications of the DRCR protocol eye trial in DME?","Leonard S. Schleifer","I forgot which one eye is, but eye is the one which has early laser versus late laser. Is that the one you're referring to? I don't know them by number.","Biren Amin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","No, that's one that's comparing all 3 anti-VEGFs...","Leonard S. Schleifer","Right. Well, look, the DRCR has been an extremely good network that's done very high quality work. We work with them. That study has an interesting design to it. It is a head-to-head study that compares Avastin, Lucentis and EYLEA. But given by a regimen that probably will stress the molecules a little bit, all of them, because it's a PRN-based regimen rather than a fixed-dosing interval, so it should be interesting to see whether there are differences in the number of doses or the actual letters gained, and there's nothing like a head-to-head trial to sort that out. We hear that, that trials moving nicely, and we look forward to the results down the road.","Operator","Okay, and the last question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen and Company.","Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Bob, a question for you the DME market. In the past, we've asked physicians the number of injections for DME they give compared to the number of VEGF injectors they give for wet AMD. We get a really wide range of answers, but the median answer is like 1 DME injection for every 5 wet AMD injections. I'm curious whether in your market research, you've asked the question that way and what data you get for that question?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Phil, we read your notes. I think one of your notes was that -- says that surveys aren't worth looking at. So [indiscernible] even though, you do the men Bob does them, I'm not a big survey guy in terms of how accurate they reflect what doctors say they do versus what they're actually doing. So I think what we're going to -- I just have to wait and try and count up these injections and see what we get. I think the notion that you can treat and you're finished with diabetic macular edema is just not correct, and we just see that in all of our trials. And I think that, that may be wishful thinking out there, but we'll have to see when all the data comes up, but I wouldn't -- I would follow your own advice. I wouldn't pay that much attention to the surveys.","Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I pay attention to Bob's survey.","Robert J. Terifay","All right. So let's go to the science instead of surveys. I would say that DME is much more VEGF-driven than AMD, and so theoretically, you would need more drug to adequately manage DME. I think that's the educational thing that has to be done, is defining the adequate management of DME.","Michael Aberman","Thank you, everybody, for joining us on the call today. Again, Manisha and I are going to be available to make a call. It's probably easiest if you want a follow-up call to shoot myself an email at michael.aberman@regeneron.com or Manisha, which you can find on the press release, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for a question-and-answer period.","I'd also like to remind you that remarks made on this call that are not historical in nature may be forward-looking statements about Regeneron and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events and our actual results may differ materially. Such remarks may include but are not limited to those related to Regeneron and its products and business, sales and expense forecast, financial forecast, development programs, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, intellectual property and competition, all of which involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2013, which we expect to file with the SEC later today. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law.","GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed on today's call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP are available in our financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website.","Once our call concludes, the IR team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate the opportunity to review the results of the first quarter and also provide our outlook for the rest of the year.","Before we get started, however, it feels as though we need to pause and catch our breath. This has not only been quite a year for Regeneron, but quite a week as well. Just in the last few days, we became a newly minted member of the S&P 500 Index; a potential competitor to our EYLEA franchise had a significant setback; we acquired full rights to 2 important pipeline assets to support our goal of expanding and protecting our EYLEA franchise in retinal diseases; we reported strong quarterly results; and our stock price and market capitalization both hit all-time highs.","Having paused to recognize the recent milestones, it's also appropriate to remember that the fundamental mission of Regeneron is to use innovative science and technology to bring important new medicines to patients in need.","Now before we get into some additional details of this quarter, which will be provided by George, Bob and Murray, it is worth taking a broader perspective of Regeneron as that may help you to better understand why we are so excited about our future prospects.","We think of Regeneron in terms of 3 critical aspects of our enterprise: one, our growing global EYLEA franchise; two, our unique business model based upon highly leveraged partnerships; and three, our extraordinarily productive research and development capabilities and associated pipeline that serves as the foundation for everything we accomplish at Regeneron. I would like to briefly highlight some important aspects of each of these 3 critical pillars of Regeneron.","First, our global EYLEA franchise represents a strong growth opportunity for Regeneron. We are 18 months into our commercialization of EYLEA in the United States, and we can proudly say that U.S. EYLEA launch is among the most successful in the history of the biopharmaceutical industry. This quarter, we reported U.S. net sales of $314 million, which represented more than a 150% increase from the first quarter of last year and approximately a 14% increase from the prior quarter. As a result, we are increasing our guidance for 2013 U.S. EYLEA net sales to $1.25 billion to $1.325 billion. While there continue to be some headwinds in terms of near-term growth in U.S. EYLEA sales, such as the slight reduction in reimbursement that Medicare provides because of the sequester and a growing percentage of sales coming from existing patients who move to less-frequent dosing, we see several significant growth opportunities for EYLEA in the U.S. and the rest of the world.","First, it appears that the market for anti-VEGF therapy in diabetic macular edema, or DME, is large, based upon the initial success of ranibizumab or Lucentis in this indication. We are expecting our first Phase III data later this year in DME, and we are hoping to file for approval in the U.S. in 2014. If we obtain approval, we would expect that EYLEA penetration into the DME market could provide a substantial source of growth in the U.S.","Second, the launch of EYLEA outside of the U.S. by our 50-50 partner Bayer HealthCare is going extremely well. First quarter net sales of EYLEA, as announced by Bayer HealthCare, were approximately $65 million, bringing total global EYLEA sales to $379 million in this quarter. Putting this into the context of the overall current market opportunity, the combined global sales of EYLEA and ranibizumab or Lucentis in the first quarter of 2013 totaled approximately $1.4 billion. EYLEA represented only about 27% of the global dollar sales of branded intravitreal anti-VEGF treatments. So we believe EYLEA, over time, has significant room to grow, particularly outside of the U.S., where EYLEA has only about 10% of the total sales reported for ranibizumab and EYLEA combined.","X-U.S. sales are already contributing to our bottom line. Our share of the profits from x-U.S. sales was approximately $19 million. After our repayment of $13 million in development expenses initially funded by Bayer HealthCare, we recognized $6 million of profits from x-U.S. EYLEA sales that flowed directly to our earnings. And we expect significant growth of these sales as Bayer HealthCare launches in additional countries outside of the United States. We expect our quarterly repayment obligation to Bayer HealthCare to remain relatively flat for the rest of the year at approximately $13 million. Therefore, as sales and profits hopefully grow outside the U.S., a greater proportion of those profits will flow to our bottom line.","Outside the United States, EYLEA is only marketed for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration, or AMD. So additional potential indications such as macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion, or CRVO, and DME, diabetic macular edema, represent additional opportunities for growth of our x-U.S. EYLEA franchise.","Finally, as you are aware, there's substantial discussion in Congress about the regulation of compounding pharmacies. Given that compounded Avastin represents nearly 50% of the unit volume in the United States, the possibility exists for substantial expansion of the branded intravitreal market for anti-VEGF therapies should any structural change to the compounding industry result from any new potential legislation or regulations.","Regeneron's position on the compounding situation is that we are in favor of patient choice and the fact that retinal specialists have multiple choices to treat their patients. Yet while we support multiple choices, we believe that all those who manufacture or compound intravitreal therapies should be held to a single safety and quality standard and follow good manufacturing practices. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that any legislation will be passed that will change the market dynamics regarding intravitreal anti-VEGF therapies. And to be clear, our updated U.S. net sales forecast does not include any potential structural change in the marketplace that may or may not occur related to the ongoing debate about compounding pharmacies.","Now let's turn to the second pillar supporting Regeneron's business, our important collaborations with both Sanofi and Bayer HealthCare. Our collaboration with Sanofi is broad-based and provide us with the capital we needed to invest in our antibody pipeline at a time when we did not have ready access to those resources. As a result, we were able to invest in and develop the strong pipeline that we have today. I would like to add and emphasize that it's not just the capital that we enjoy from Sanofi, rather we value the expertise and commercial reach that Sanofi offers for our partnered programs.","Our Bayer HealthCare collaboration also provided capital and development expertise that enabled us to jointly conduct a large EYLEA development program. And now they are proving to be an excellent commercial partner outside the United States.","This unique business model allows a greater proportion of our revenue to fall to the bottom line while still advancing a robust pipeline of 13 different clinical programs, including 3 Phase III assets. This quarter, for example, we reported non-GAAP net income of $201 million or $1.78 per diluted share. This translates into 21% non-GAAP earnings per share growth from the fourth quarter of 2012 and almost a fivefold increase compared to the first quarter of last year. As a reminder, non-GAAP net income excludes noncash compensation expense, noncash interest expense and noncash income taxes, which Murray will discuss in further detail.","Finally, the fundamental foundation to our entire business is our industry-leading innovative technologies and discovery and development capabilities. Led by George Yancopoulos, my partner at Regeneron since we first opened our labs 25 years ago, Regeneron has built a suite of technologies that has given us a robust pipeline of antibody drug candidates. This includes 3 late-stage with large potential market opportunities, including alirocumab, our PCSK9 inhibitor in a large global Phase III program for treating elevated cholesterol and cardiovascular disease; sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody in a large Phase III program for rheumatoid arthritis; and dupilumab, our IL-4 receptor antibody that will be advancing into Phase IIb testing for allergic asthma and atopic dermatitis later in the year. And innovation keeps on coming. We are equally excited about our earlier-stage pipeline and our novel technologies that we believe have the potential to become the foundation of our future growth.","Now let me turn the call over to George Yancopoulos, Regeneron's Chief Scientific Officer, to discuss our pipeline progress in greater detail. George will be followed by Bob Terifay, Senior Vice President of Commercial, who will elaborate on our commercial activities. And finally, Murray Goldberg, our Chief Financial Officer, will discuss our financial performance during the first quarter of this year. George?","George D. Yancopoulos","Thanks, Len, and good morning to everyone. The first quarter of 2013 continued to be a busy time for the research and development teams at Regeneron.","Let me begin with EYLEA, which is now approved for 2 indications in the United States, wet AMD and macular edema following CRVO. As you just heard from Len, our partner, Bayer HealthCare, expects to continue filing and receiving x-U.S. approvals for EYLEA in both of these indications in a growing list of countries. A Phase III trial of EYLEA in patients with macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion, or BRVO, is fully enrolled, as are 2 Phase III trials in DME. We and Bayer HealthCare expect top line 1-year results from the x-U.S. DME trial before year-end. As a reminder, outside the United States, DME approvals have been based on 1-year data, in contrast to the United States, which has required 2-year efficacy data.","Our third Phase III trial in DME was initiated early this year in Russia and Asia and is enrolling patients. We and Bayer HealthCare expect to report top line data from our Phase III study in EYLEA in myopic choroidal neovascularization, or mCNV, in the next few months, which could form the basis of regulatory filings outside of the United States.","Turning to our Phase III antibody pipeline and starting with, alirocumab, our PCSK9 antibody, which is in clinical development for lowering LDL cholesterol. Our broad Phase III ODYSSEY program is ongoing. And as previously announced, we expect top line results from the first Phase III trial, ODYSSEY MONO, in the third quarter 2013. As a reminder, the ODYSSEY MONO trial is comparing alirocumab monotherapy to ezetimibe in patients with  hypercholesterolemia. Data for the majority of the Phase III trials for alirocumab, excluding the ODYSSEY outcomes trial, are expected in 2014.","Our Phase III program with sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor inhibitor, is moving along as expected. The mobility Phase III trial in patients who have failed disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, or DMARD, therapy, is fully enrolled and we expect top line data in early 2014.","We, along with Sanofi, have also initiated the Phase III target trial, which will evaluate the combination of sarilumab and DMARDs with rheumatoid arthritis patients who are not responsive to or are intolerant of TNF-alpha therapies. This study is intended to establish the utility of sarilumab in TNF-alpha inhibitor failures. Additional Phase III trials for sarilumab are planned to start this quarter.","Beyond these Phase III programs, our Phase II pipeline is also advancing. We now have positive data in 2 indications for our IL-4 receptor antibody, dupilumab, formerly known as REGN668. In March, we presented positive data from 2 proof of concept studies of dupilumab in atopic dermatitis at the Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology. Later this month, we will be presenting data at a late breaking session of the Annual Meeting of the American Thoracic Society from a Phase IIa study of dupilumab in patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma with elevated eosinophils. We expect to initiate Phase IIb studies in both these indications later this year.","In addition to these later-stage programs, we have 7 other antibodies in Phase I, along with several other exciting antibody programs that are in earlier stages of development. I would like to spend a few minutes on 2 of these earlier-stage antibody programs.","As Len mentioned briefly, we have now acquired from Sanofi full rights to our PDGF receptor antibody and our ANG2 antibody for ophthalmology. Both of these pathways play an important role in angiogenesis, and their blockade could potentially add to the clinical benefit seen with anti-VEGF therapy. We expect to submit an IND for a combination trial of our PDGF receptor antibody in EYLEA in the second half of the year. We also expect to submit an IND to develop our ANG2 antibody in the ophthalmic setting later this year. As a reminder, the ANG2 antibody is already in clinical development in oncology in combination with ZALTRAP as part of our Sanofi collaboration.","While we will not be providing additional details on these earlier-stage assets at the moment, it's a testament to the power of our research and development expertise to have these 2 programs advancing. It also highlights our commitment to maintain a leadership position in the field of retinal diseases, particularly VEGF-mediated diseases like wet AMD and DME.","Finally, I'd like to note that we are excited about some of our emerging new technologies that we hope will soon yield clinical candidates, including bispecific antibodies, longer-acting antibody technologies and antibody-drug conjugates.","With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Bob to provide an update on the EYLEA launch and market dynamics.","Robert J. Terifay","Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. The EYLEA franchise is not only doing very well but is also well positioned for continued growth, both in the United States and outside the United States.","In the first quarter, we continued to witness strength in the uptake of EYLEA in the U.S. wet AMD market, both in terms of patients new to anti-VEGF therapy, as well as those switching from bevacizumab or ranibizumab. As a reminder, we received a permanent J code effective January 1 of this year.","Our qualitative market research, which comes from position-based questionnaires and was conducted in the first quarter, indicates that in terms of eyes treated, EYLEA now represents 24% of the U.S. wet AMD market, ranibizumab represents 30%, and bevacizumab represents 46% of the market. This suggests that EYLEA hold a 44% share of the on-label wet AMD market. In the first quarter, 59% of EYLEA-treated eyes were eyes continuing on EYLEA from previous months, 25% were switches from bevacizumab and ranibizumab, and 16% were new to anti-VEGF treatment. Drilling down further, these market research data show that EYLEA, in the first quarter in 2013, garnered 24% of wet AMD eyes which were new to therapy, and 58% of eyes which were switched from previous therapies. Of these switches, 55% were from bevacizumab, and 45% were from ranibizumab.","In our survey, physicians report positive clinical responses to EYLEA that meet or exceed their expectations in 70% of treated eyes. In a majority of the remaining patients, it's too early to assess response to therapy. Physicians now estimate that wet AMD, on average, patients -- wet AMD patients, on average, receive 7.5 doses of EYLEA in their first year of therapy, including 3 initial monthly doses, and 5.4 doses in the second year of therapy.","In macular edema following CRVO, the second indication for which EYLEA has received approval in the United States, our qualitative market research indicates that during the first quarter, we now have a 21% share of treated eyes.","As you've heard, we've updated our EYLEA U.S. net sales forecast to $1.25 billion to $1.325 billion for the year. While we had 14% growth in these sales in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter last year, we expect to see a slower rate of growth for the remainder of the year, as a greater portion of our sales are now coming from existing patients and many of these patients are moving to less-frequent dosing.","Lastly, we've recently started to see an impact from the sequester funding cuts on some retinal practices. Specifically, under the sequester, payments for Medicare Part B drugs such as EYLEA were reduced from 106% of the average selling price to 104.3%. This reduction has led some practices to reduce their use of FDA-approved anti-VEGF therapies for retinal diseases.","Turning now to the x-U.S. portion of our EYLEA franchise, where we split profits 50-50 with Bayer HealthCare, first quarter net sales were $65 million. While by the end of March, EYLEA was available in over 15 countries, first quarter sales were primarily from Japan and Australia, where Bayer reported market shares of 48% and 42%, respectively. Over the course of 2013, we expect Bayer to embark on launches in additional countries as regulatory and pricing approvals for EYLEA in wet AMD are achieved. In addition, applications for marketing authorization for EYLEA for the treatment of macular edema following CRVO are pending in Europe, Japan and other regions. Bayer has estimated peak sales of EYLEA outside of the United States of EUR 1 billion if approved in the expected indications of wet AMD, CRVO, DME and Myopic CNV.","Turning to ZALTRAP or ziv-aflibercept. Sanofi reported sales of $14 million for the quarter, which is down from the fourth quarter of 2012. This decline is largely related to a 50% reduction in the effective net sales price in the United States effective November of 2012. Now that ZALTRAP has been approved in the EU, we look forward to continued x-U.S. launch rollouts over the course of 2013.","With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Murray Goldberg.","Murray A. Goldberg","Thank you, Bob, and good morning. I'm very pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of 2013.","As you heard from Len earlier on the call, the first quarter of 2013 was another strong quarter, with total revenue of $440 million and non-GAAP net income of $201 million or $1.78 per diluted share compared to $1.47 per share in the fourth quarter last year.","The increase in our earnings was primarily driven by strong EYLEA sales performance in the United States. We are also pleased that sales of EYLEA outside the U.S. contributed to our bottom line for the first time. Outside the U.S., we are entitled to 50% of profits on EYLEA sales, except for Japan, where we receive a royalty on sales. As you heard, we reported $314 million in net U.S. EYLEA sales, and Bayer HealthCare reported net x-U.S. EYLEA sales of $65 million for the quarter. For the full year, we now forecast net U.S. sales of $1.25 billion to $1.325 billion. EYLEA inventory levels in the U.S. continue to equal about 1 to 2 weeks of sales.","ARCALYST, or rilonacept, net sales in the first quarter were $5 million, similar to sales in prior quarters.","Turning to collaboration revenue. Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue was $15 million for the first quarter. Included in this line are a net profit of $6 million from x-U.S. EYLEA sales after repaying $13 million of development expenses that Bayer HealthCare has previously funded, amortization of upfront and milestone payments and cost sharing of current EYLEA development expenses. All of these will be detailed in our 10-Q that we expect to file later today.","Sanofi collaboration revenue was $99 million for the first quarter. This includes reimbursement of our R&D expenses for preclinical and clinical research within our antibody collaboration, amortization of upfront payments and our share of the loss associated with the ongoing launch of ZALTRAP. In the first quarter, Sanofi recorded $14 million of ZALTRAP net sales, and we recognized a net loss of $8 million from ZALTRAP, as we and Sanofi prepared for commercialization in the European Union and other countries. As we have said before, we do not expect a meaningful positive contribution from the commercialization of ZALTRAP in the near term because of our obligation to repay Sanofi from our share of ZALTRAP profits for 50% of the ZALTRAP development expenses that they have funded.","Non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $29 million for the first quarter, including royalty expense to Genentech relating to U.S. EYLEA sales. COGS continue to average less than 10% of product sales.","Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expense for the first quarter was $51 million. We reiterate our guidance for non-GAAP SG&A expense in 2013 of $215 million to $235 million.","Non-GAAP R&D expense for the first quarter was $154 million. This includes unfunded R&D expenses of $44 million compared to $48 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Unfunded R&D is calculated as the difference between our total R&D expense and the amount that is reimbursed by our collaborators.","As we said on our February conference call, we expect unfunded R&D expense to increase in 2013 compared to 2012 for several reasons: increased spending on EYLEA clinical programs, including the Phase III trials in DME and macular edema following BRVO; advancing unpartnered antibody programs through to the proof of concept stage; and increased spending on early-stage technologies, such as antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific antibodies and longer-acting antibody technologies. In addition, if the initial Phase III data for alirocumab are positive later this year, it would trigger the real-time sharing of 20% of subsequent Phase III development expenses for the ODYSSEY program. Given the timing of these R&D expenses, we expect the impact on unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense to be weighted more heavily towards the second half of the year.","In addition, we anticipate that, as in 2012, full year discovery preclinical spending under the Sanofi antibody agreement is likely to exceed the amount that Sanofi is obligated to reimburse. Like last year, due to the timing of the reimbursement for discovery research, the difference will fall primarily in the fourth quarter.","Our full year 2013 guidance for non-GAAP unfunded R&D remains at $275 million to $325 million. This guidance includes the $20 million in upfront payments that we will pay to Sanofi later this month in connection with our recently announced acquisition of the full rights to antibodies, the PDGFR and ANG2 in ophthalmology. This increase in unfunded R&D spending over the balance of the year will, therefore, impact our quarter results. As a reminder, non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses exclude noncash share-based compensation expense.","Turning to the bottom line. We reported non-GAAP net income of $201 million or $1.78 per fully diluted share for the first quarter. This non-GAAP EPS excludes noncash share-based compensation expense, noncash interest expense related to our senior convertible notes and noncash income tax expense and is based on about 114 million non-GAAP fully diluted shares. A full reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings are set out in our earnings release.","For GAAP purposes, in the first quarter of 2013, we recorded a $43 million income tax expense, representing about a 30% effective tax rate. Because of the timing of passage of the American Taxpayer Relief Act in January 2013, we recognized the full benefit of our 2012 federal research tax credits in the first quarter of 2013. This lowered our effective tax rate for the quarter to about 30%. For the remainder of 2013, we expect a GAAP effective tax rate of about 40-plus percent. However, we do not currently expect to pay any significant cash income taxes through at least 2014. Moreover, as sales of our products and our operations grow outside the United States, we anticipate that our GAAP tax rate will start to decline in a few years.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Len.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Thank you, Murray, Bob, George and the rest of the team. We are proud of what we have accomplished so far this year but also recognize that we must keep innovating. With that goal in mind, we will continue to invest in our R&D and our technologies and strive to deliver on our pipeline. We look forward to upcoming commercial, regulatory and clinical milestones in the remainder of this year.","Thank you all for joining us this morning. And with that, let me turn the call back to Michael.","Michael Aberman","Thank you, Len. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our team will be available in our office after the call for follow-up questions. Thank you. And operator, if you could please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jim Birchenough with BMO Capital.","Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Question on the opportunity around potential penetration of the Avastin base. Is there any way you can quantify the number of physicians you'd characterize as Avastin prescribers, what the pace of conversion has been? Maybe describe what you're seeing in terms of any disruption on the increased scrutiny? And if you have any insights into how this legislation or draft legislation might proceed, that would be helpful.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Let me address -- this is Len. Let me address the legislation part first, and then I'll turn the market dynamic question over to Bob. In terms of legislation, all we know, thus far, is that there's been a lot of interest in this area for the obvious reason that many Americans were killed and thousands were put at risk from the problems at compounding pharmacies. And this catastrophe has certainly caught the attention of the FDA and people in Congress. We know recently that the Senate Health Committee seemed to draft a bipartisan bill that will, I'm sure, be marked up and changed, et cetera. But as it stands now, it would seek to regulate compounding pharmacies, including those who would repackage sterile products such as Avastin for distribution around the country to be used in injections. And as I said during my prepared remarks, we feel strongly that choice is fine, multiple choices are good for patients and doctors, but there should only be one standard -- one quality standard for a drug that's going to be injected in a high-risk area like the back of the eye. And that standard should be regulated under GMP, we believe, by the FDA. Bob, any comment? Are you seeing anything on the market dynamics?","Robert J. Terifay","Yes. So in terms of the compounding legislation and its impact on physician prescribing, so far, it has had very little impact on physicians moving away from Avastin. That said, we have seen the market shifting away from Avastin towards the branded products since the launch of EYLEA. And on average, we see about 10 to 12 accounts -- new accounts that come to EYLEA each week that are generally smaller accounts that were using Avastin, were not using Lucentis and now have -- our sales representatives have been working with them, helping them figure out how to deal with the distribution and the carrying costs, et cetera. And so we are seeing an increase in our penetration of the Avastin market, but it is not related to the compounding.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess, first, could you comment a little bit about your announcement today about working on a deal with Sanofi on PDGF and ANG2? And I was just trying to think about, what are your thoughts on potential uses? Are you starting to combine it, create the combined formulation with EYLEA? And then for the EU market, would you have to work out an agreement with Bayer, and how would that occur? What would be the timeline for that occurring?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Thanks for the question, Robyn. Let me just deal with some of the deal-related questions. Both of these antibodies were discoveries that came out of our labs, but they were partnered with, part of our Sanofi relationship. I think Sanofi and Regeneron got together and thought that it made sense, given our EYLEA franchise and the potential of combining these drugs with EYLEA, that we would be able to regain sole rights to those programs for use in ophthalmology. Under our deal that we did with Sanofi, we have the right to partner with anybody, and that would include our partner Bayer, and we don't have anything further to say about that at this time. Now as far as the technical reasons why you want to study these molecules and how you study them, George, do you want to comment on that?","George D. Yancopoulos","Well, there's a lot of very interesting biology behind the notion of combining either of these pathways with anti-VEGF pathways, particularly in the eye and for uses in the eye. And we're very excited about having the ability now to have not only potential best-in-class anti-VEGF therapy but also potential best-in-class anti-PDGF and anti-ANG2 therapies, which we can explore both on their own and also in combination and, if need be, in a rather favorable situation, of being able to combine them in a single formulation. So we're excited about the opportunity. It still is, obviously, early days, but there's a lot of interesting biology here.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Raymond with Robert Baird.","Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just kind of curious if you could expand on your comments on the sequester-related sort of headwinds. It seems this dynamic might favor Avastin over the branded therapies. But given the less frequent dosing interval for EYLEA, that should be an advantage for you guys. So maybe some crosswinds, perhaps, there? I wonder if you could maybe describe a little bit more about -- is it really all just something that favors Avastin? Or is there maybe an advantage with respect to EYLEA and Lucentis that you're seeing?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes. I mean, it's a little bit early to really predict this. I think it's difficult. Bob might want to comment about what some individual practices have done, but big trends, we can't speak to yet. Bob?","Robert J. Terifay","Many of the practices feel that they're working on a fairly thin margin in terms of their office staff that has to handle the products, the receivables, et cetera. And so that's really where the concern is, that they're just not making sufficient enough money to cover the costs of using the branded agents. So I think, largely, right now, the physicians are seeing the sequestration as something that will lead to them thinking more about using Avastin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adnan Butt with RBC Capital Markets.","Adnan S. Butt - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Congrats on the forward-thinking Sanofi deal. On the combination of EYLEA and PDGF, what leads the company to believe that those 2 can be combined together? Is the ANG2 a combination as well? And then for long-acting antibodies, is there anything being thought about for EYLEA to extend its interval? Or is that for future products?","Leonard S. Schleifer","So I don't think we have a comment about EYLEA specifically, but George can comment, and I didn't know whether the question was whether -- what the rationale for combination overall or combination specifically into a single syringe. But maybe he could address the rationale for both. George?","George D. Yancopoulos","Well, as we all know, there's multiple ways that blood vessels can be triggered, can be activated, can be made to leak, can be made to grow. And certainly, there's a lot of preclinical science that implicates the PDGF pathway and the ANG2 pathways in these processes. So I think it's a very attractive position to have these combination capabilities. And certainly, because the proteins that we were talking about combining can be combined, and we have actually done it in preliminary formulation studies, the opportunity is there to combine them into a single formulation to be delivered simultaneously if the science supports that possibility.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.","Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Does Bayer need your DME data in the U.S. for them to file in Europe? It would seem that we're coming close to the 1 year anniversary for their trial being fully enrolled, whereas your second year anniversary might be early 2014. Do they need to wait for your data to file?","George D. Yancopoulos","Historically, the EMA has approved Lucentis based on the results of one 1-year study. So it is possible that, based upon the first year of the Bayer study, they may be able to file. But they have not announced anything about their filing plans.","Leonard S. Schleifer","And we'll have that data later this year. And you're correct in terms of the timing, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Kantor with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jason Kantor - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wanted to skip over to dupilumab and just ask how you plan to start Phase IIb trials this year. Can you give us some idea of what those trials might look like, and as well, how you'd think about the overall IL-4 [ph] program? What would the kind of market be in asthma or atopic dermatitis? And are there other indications that are related that you might also go after now that you have proof of concept with the patients?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Right. So Jason, I wouldn't have a comment on trials that haven't been announced yet. It's just -- you just have to wait. I'm sorry. As to other indications, I would say that it is exciting to us that when you take 2 diseases that superficially are not related, atopic dermatitis and, let's say, allergic asthma, and you get a proof of concept with a single drug candidate in both of those, you recognize, of course, that these are related diseases because they're both allergic-type diseases affecting different tissues, one affecting the skin and one affecting the lungs. And obviously, if one drug can have -- seem to have an important effect in both of those, then we will be looking at a lot of other tissues with the same sorts of processes maybe ongoing. So I think your insight there is good. I would just say that this is an area that we are particularly excited about. We think the prospect of fundamentally influencing these pathways is important. George, do you want to add anything about the trends of these diseases or...?","George D. Yancopoulos","Yes. I think -- just to amplify on what Len said, I think we have made a really fundamental potential finding here, which is, as you know -- and it's all over the news, there was just a release from the Center for Disease Control yesterday. Every day, you pick up a newspaper, you hear about the increasing rates of various forms of allergic disease in the world, ranging from asthma to eczema and other type of skin allergies, to food allergies, to an assortment of other diseases that, on some level, suggest that there's some sort of allergic reaction going on. And we've long thought that the interleukin-4, interleukin-13 pathways might be critical drivers of this essentially worldwide shift towards what is known as a TH2-type phenotype. And of course, until you actually produce human data, and as Len said importantly, in not just 1 but 2 of these diseases, do you actually think that maybe it is true that this is a fundamental set of pathways that are driving this epidemic towards too much TH2 disease. And since it works in these 2 settings, we're excited about the fact that this could much broadly address other types of allergic diseases as well. So we think there's a very important potential opportunity.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Okay. And we have to do our presentation at the American Thoracic Society. When is that, Michael?","Michael Aberman","That's May 21.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Okay, great. Thanks for the question, Jason.","Operator","The next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just wondering, now that you have the J code in hand, if you guys are going to plan to tighten your payment terms at all to the physicians given your account receivables balance. And then the second question I had was just any update on the EYLEA litigation with Genentech, both U.S. and x-U.S.?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes, good questions. We probably don't want to anticipate either of those questions with answers. So we'll give you a free pass to ask a different question, Terence, if you like.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, understand. I guess in terms of just the gating steps to getting the PDGF antibody into the clinic, can you guys just walk us through what else is left here and when, kind of a timeframe, to expect that might be?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes, we're at the end of the preclinical phase in preparing for filing of the IND sometime later this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ying Huang with Barclays.","Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have a couple here. First of all, can you tell us how many patients do you have to accumulate in the safety database before you can file for the PCSK9 antibody with the FDA? And then secondly, can you help us understand the market opportunity for both atopic dermatitis and also asthma indications here for the IL-4 program?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Right. So it's -- in terms of the number of patients, if you look at our filings, we believe that -- you can find them on ClinicalTrials.gov -- that the aggregate of our trials will provide an adequate database for us to file. I'm not going to give you a specific number that we've discussed just for competitive reasons, but our trial is designed to meet the number and meet the requirements for demonstrating safety and efficacy. In terms of the market size for asthma, resistant asthma, allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis, at this point, we would just say they are very large market opportunities. Sorry about not being able to quantify that at this point.","Operator","The next question comes from Joseph Schwartz with Leerink.","Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","I was wondering, how do you see EYLEA adoption patterns outside the United States comparing to what you've been able to achieve in the U.S.? Bayer obviously achieved pretty hefty market share in Japan and Australia very rapidly. Do you expect that pattern to play out in Europe and elsewhere?","Leonard S. Schleifer","We certainly hope. It's hard to predict how this is going to go. The launch is off to a great start. The IMS market share data in the countries, primarily Australia and Japan that have gotten going first, look great. There's lots of market awareness for the product. I think people are excited for the product, and we're looking forward to a successful launch. Avastin is less of a factor outside of the United States, so we're really in a head-to-head -- rather than a three-way fight, we're in a head-to-head battle with Lucentis, and so far, very good.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Newman with JMP Securities.","John L. Newman - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","All of my questions have been answered.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Okay, great.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Citi.","Kumaraguru Raja","This is Kumar Raja in for Yaron Werber. Can please give us a sense of how long it will take for pricing negotiations in Europe? And do you have a sense of what -- how long it took for Lucentis?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Yes. So these are the questions that are better posed to Bayer. They should be the spokesman for that level of detail, and I'm sure they'll be happy to address them for you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Biren Amin with Jefferies.","Biren Amin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess, I think you provided some pretty good color on dosing for year 1, year 2 for EYLEA. And I just want to -- thinking forward, how should we think about year 3 EYLEA dosing?","Leonard S. Schleifer","It's hard to predict. There's lots of data out there that people have tried -- try all sorts of different dosing paradigms. We kind of hope that people stick to the label. There are some people who are concerned about overtreatment. We're obviously concerned about systematic undertreatment. But I don't know we have any information yet. It's too early in our launch to know how people are going to use EYLEA. Even in the second year, we barely have people, small numbers, so it's a little bit early for that. Sorry.","Operator","The next question comes from Ted Tenthoff with Piper Jaffray.","Edward A. Tenthoff - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Actually, my questions are largely answered, but if I could ask Bob to just repeat what the 1-year injection rate was. And then a kind of housekeeping one for Murray. With respect to the weighted number of shares outstanding, it looked like it decreased a little bit from year-end. Is that just an accounting thing, or how should we be thinking about that?","Robert J. Terifay","Yes, so Ted, we said 7.5 doses in the first year, including the 3 loads, and then 5.4 doses in the second.","Leonard S. Schleifer","That's based on physician estimates, obviously, not actual chart reviews. The technical question about shares outstanding, I think it's you.","Murray A. Goldberg","Ted, really, it is just the accounting calculations on what gets included in dilutive, anti-dilutive in the calculation. Nothing fundamentally changed.","Edward A. Tenthoff - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","What is the fully diluted share count right now?","Murray A. Goldberg","The non-GAAP was 114 million shares. That's what our calculation's done on, 114 million shares.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company.","Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","It's one for George on dupilumab. George, we've seen other IL-4s that have produced kind of unimpressive data in asthma. What differentiates dupilumab? What are you seeing either preclinically in binding affinity or half-life? Or what have you seen from these initial clinical studies that will -- that gives you confidence that this will work on top of standard of care when some of the other drugs didn't?","Leonard S. Schleifer","Thanks for that question, and we'll let George handle that.","George D. Yancopoulos","All right, Phil. Well, we do think not all inhibitors are made the same, nor do they act the same. And as you know, all these features that you talked about, which are affinity, particularly hitting one receptor and a component of the receptor system that will block essentially with very high affinity, both cytokines, it hits both type 1 and type 2 receptors. There's a lot of differentiation on the biochemistry, which we can't get into the details here. But it's just -- I think it's a testament to the fact that if you create a good antibody with all the right properties, not all antibodies are the same, not all the technologies are the same, you may end up achieving better results in the clinic.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A couple on U.S. EYLEA. For the J code, any impact in the first quarter in terms of what you're seeing from the field, the speed to get reimbursement, how that compares with last year? And then on Avastin use, you guys have talked a lot about the general trend since the launch. But curious if your market research indicated an acceleration of lower Avastin share since the last call, since some of the adverse events were first disclosed.","Leonard S. Schleifer","We'll let Bob take that.","Robert J. Terifay","So Geoff, as you know, we received a temporary Q code in the middle of last year, which really brought us to very fast turnaround times from the Medicare providers. So we haven't seen a dramatic change in turnaround since the J code, since we were already being pretty -- processed as a specified agent in the Medicare system since July. With regards to the Avastin, we have seen a gradual decline since launch. In the launch timeframe, we had -- Avastin had about a 60% to 65% share of eyes. And that has now come down to 46%, so it continues to go down gradually.","Leonard S. Schleifer","Okay, great. Well, let us stop by saying we appreciate your time and interest. We do appreciate this week the work of the selection committee of the S&P 500 people. We're proud to be in that group. And we look forward to continuing to update you through the rest of the year. Thank you, operator.","Operator","You're welcome. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation.

My name is Kevin and I\u2019ll be your coordinator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Michael Aberman, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations for Regeneron. Please proceed, Dr. Aberman.","Michael Aberman","Thank you, Kevin. Good morning and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals\u2019 third quarter 2012 conference call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website in the newsroom page for at least the next 30 days. Joining me on the call today are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President of Regeneron Labs and Chief Scientific Officer; Murray Goldberg, Chief Financial Officer and Bob Terifay, Senior Vice President, Commercial. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the call for Q&A.","I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call that are not historical in nature may be forward-looking statements about Regeneron and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events and our actual results may differ materially. Such remarks may include but are not limited to those related to Regeneron and its products and businesses, development programs, collaborations, finances, taxes, regulatory matters, intellectual property and competition, all of which involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron\u2019s filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC, including its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2012 which was filed this morning. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law.","GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed on today\u2019s calls. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP is available in our third quarter 2012 financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website. Once our call concludes, the IR team will be available to answer further questions.","With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.","Leonard Schleifer","Thanks, Michael. Good morning to everybody. And thanks for joining us. I am happy to report another successful quarter for Regeneron both in terms of our financial performance as well as our progress in our pipeline. Starting with EYLEA, we reported a US EYLEA net sales of $244 million this quarter representing a 26% growth over the second quarter of this year.","Given the EYLEA results and current market trends, we are increasing our full year US EYLEA net sales guidance from our previous range of $700 to $750 million to our new guidance of 790 million to 850 million.","Our guidance takes into consideration that the combination of the Thanksgiving and end of year holidays could lead to as much as one less week of potential sales. The strong US EYLEA sales helped deliver our third consecutive profitable quarter with non-GAAP net income of $217 million, which translates into non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share of $1.89. Murray Goldberg will provide color on our financial performance later in the call. ","In the meantime, please note that this quarter's profits included two onetime milestone payments. A $15 million milestone from Sanofi for the US FDA approval ZALTRAP also known as ziv-aflibercept in combination with FOLFIRI for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that is resistant to or has progressed following an oxaliplatin-containing regimen and a $15 million milestone from Bayer Healthcare for the approval EYLEA in wet AMD in Japan. With the strong results reported today, we can expect our first profitable full year since our inception. ","It has also been a busy quarter on both the regulatory and clinical development fronts. In addition to the ZALTRAP approval in the US, we received US FDA approval for EYLEA for the treatment of macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion or CRVO. We are pleased to be able to provide another treatment option for the physicians and patients that are impacted by this condition.","This is also an important step towards our goal of driving long term growth for EYLEA through new indications. Outside the United States, our partner Bayer Healthcare has received several regulatory approvals for EYLEA including Japan, Australia, Columbia and most recently Brazil.","In addition in Europe the committee for medical products for human use also known as the CHMP recommended that EYLEA be approved for wet AMD and we expect marketing authorization by year end. Bayer Healthcare plans to launch EYLEA in Japan, the EU, Australia and other countries beginning later this year and continuing into 2013.","Turning to our antibody pipeline, we announced the initiation of a broad Phase III program for our PCSK9 antibody, REGN727 for lowering LDL cholesterol. We also announced the full enrollment of our first Phase III trial MOBILITY for sarilumab our antibody targeting the IL-6 receptor in rheumatoid arthritis and have also initiated a second trial in the broad SARIL-RA program with sarilumab that we call the target trial.","Our earlier stage programs continue to move forward with new antibodies entering the clinic such as our novel oncology antibody targeting OB-3 and we have started a combination trial with our two antibody and ZALTRAP.","Let me now hand the call over to our Chief Scientific Officer, George Yancopoulos to give more details on the developments in our pipeline. Following George, we will hear a commercial update from Bob Terifay, a financial update from our Murray Goldberg. And finally, I'll come back to make some concluding remarks before turning the call over to question-and-answers. George?","George Yancopoulos","Thank you, Len. The third quarter has been another busy one for us. This quarter was particularly gratifying with two FDA approvals Len mentioned in the United States. Although, we have enjoyed numerous regulatory approvals over the past year, we certainly appreciate that. In this industry drug approvals are not common place. We're extremely proud of the accomplishment of all the groups of Regeneron who contribute to the success.","ZALTRAP also known as ziv-aflibercept was approved in combination with FOLFIRI for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that is resistant to or has progressed following an oxaliplatin-containing regimen.","ZALTRAP is the only anti-VEGF agent approved in this setting. We received approval for ELYEA in the setting of macular edema following Central Retinal Vein Occlusion or CRVO. While the commercial opportunity for CRVO is not as large as wet AMD or diabetic macular edema where we have two fully enrolled phase 3 trails, the vision loss associated with CRVO can be catastrophic to patients.","ELYEA demonstrated significant efficacy in our COPERNICUS and GALILEO trials in CRVO patients with 56% and 60% three line gainers for the ELYEA arm versus 12% and 22% for the sham control arm of these trails at week 24, compared with baseline.  Mean change in visual acuity improved by 17.3 and 18.2 letters with ELYEA as compare to a four letter loss in COPERNICUS and a 3.3 letter gain in GAILILEO with the sham control arm on over the first 24 weeks of the study.","The most common adverse reactions 5% or more reported in patients receiving ELYEA were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters and increased intraocular pressure. We believe that ELYEA offers an important new treatment option for patients with this potentially blinding disease.","Turning to our late stage R&D pipeline, as we reported in our last conference call, early in the third quarter, Sanofi and Regeneron announced the launch of the 22,000 patients global Phase III program for Regeneron 727, our PCSK9 antibody for lowering LDL cholesterol. This program called Odyssey consists of more than 10 clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Regeneron 727 in a broad range of patients.","At the upcoming American Heart Association meeting in Los Angeles, we will present some novel analysis from our Phase II program for Regeneron 727. We along with our partner Sanofi will be hosting a webcast and teleconference for investors on Monday, November 5th from the American Heart Association annual meeting to provide some additional perspective on our Phase III program. Details on that event will follow shortly and will be posted on the Investor Relations section of our website.","I am also very pleased to announce today that the global Phase III mobility trial for Sarilumab are subcutaneous IL-6 receptor antibody for rheumatoid arthritis is now fully enrolled. The mobility trial which is part of the global SARIL-RA Phase III program is evaluating Sarilumab in combination with methotrexate in adult who have moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis with an inadequate response to methotrexate. With enrolment now complete, we expect results from the study in 2014.","In addition, we have now initiated another Phase III study in the SARIL-RA program called the TARGET trial. TARGET is now recruiting and will evaluate Sarilumab in combination with non-biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, also known as DMARD, in adult patients with moderate-to-severe RA who have an inadequate response to for our intolerant drug or more TNF alpha inhibitors.","Patients, who complete the mobility or TARGET studies, will be eligible to enrol in the (inaudible) which is the Phase III long term safety and efficacy study. We will be announcing additional Phase III studies of Sarilumab in 2013.","Another pipeline up in advance development is our NGF antibody Regeneron 475. Earlier this year, an FDA advisory committee voted unanimously in favor of providing clinical path forward for developing anti-NGFs for pain associated with osteoarthritis, which we believe represents a significant market opportunity. We are working with the FDA to define the next steps.","Turning to our earlier stage programs, we are particularly excited about developments in our oncology pipeline. During the third quarter, we initiated with Sanofi the first clinical trial combining one of our novel anti- angiogenic antibodies with ZALTRAP. In this case, it is our antibody to angiopoietin 2 called Regeneron910. While this is clearly an early first step, we are strong believers in the need to combine different anti-angiogenic modality to improve the impact of angiogenic agents for the treatment of cancer and we are looking forward to testing this and other novel combinations.","We also advanced into clinical development another novel oncology antibody that forced outside the Sanofi collaboration. Regeneron 1400 targets ErbB3 an emerging and important target in the epidermal growth factor family. ","In addition to on-going trials with EYLEA and ZALTRAP, we now have 10 antibodies in the clinic of which six are partnered with Sanofi. We also have additional earlier stage projects that are advancing towards the clinic and we look forward to updating you as they move forward in development.","I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Bob Terifay, who will provide an update on EYLEA.","Bob Terifay","","Thank you, George. We continue to be proud of the successful launch today of EYLEA or aflibercept injection. And the third quarter was no exception, as evidenced by $244 million in sales. ","The overall penetration of EYELA into the wet AMD market continued to grow during the third quarter, both in terms of newly treated patients as well as patients switching for bevacizumab and ranibizumab.","Importantly much of this growth came from new retinal practices that appeared to have been bevacizumab only practices in the past. ","There are two reasons why physicians reported they are adopting EYELA. First, the convenience of the dosing regimen and secondly, efficacy. Retinal specialist satisfaction with the efficacy of EYLEA was underscored at the recent annual scientific meeting of the American Society of Retinal Surgeons or ASRS, which took place in August. At this meeting there were nine independently prepared presentations from retinal practices around the country that reported their positive initial experiences with EYLEA, specifically in patients switched from ranibizumab for bevacizumab. These data provided additional insight into the differentiated product reception of EYLEA in this specific switch population. ","Turning now to reimbursement, remember that EYLEA is a buy and build product and it\u2019s not successful reimbursement is key. We continue to witness successful reimbursement in wet AMD from all the regional Medicare carriers, secondary and supplemental insurers and commercial and private payers. All targeted commercial payers are now covering EYLEA with many of them now having published coverage policies. ","As I mentioned last quarter, as of July 1st we were given the temporary Q-code which will be followed by permanent J-code which we expect in January of 2013. As you know, the Q-code facilitates an automated reimbursement. In our experience so far, there has been a streamlining of the reimbursement process following the Q-code. Since the Q-code is issued, physicians indicate that the average time for reimbursement of Medicare claims has improved. We remain very pleased with the growth of EYLEA and wet AMD to-date.","As you know another avenue of growth for EYLEA is expansion into other indications. And we\u2019re happy to report that in the third quarter EYLEA received approval for the treatment of macular edema following CRVO in the US Given that EYLEA was only approved for five working days in the third quarter it\u2019s too early launch of the macular edema following CRVO indication to gauge impact on sales. What I share with you is as of today all Medicare carriers have reported that they are reimbursing for EYLEA in this new indication.","Turning to our guidance for EYLEA net sales for the remainder of the year, we\u2019re cognizant in with a couple of important factors. As you know we\u2019ve now penetrated the vast majority of accounts that have been identified as ranibizumab accounts. We also have several hundred accounts now purchasing EYLEA that were not identified as ranibizumab account. The numbers of accounts that treat wet AMD and have not yet purchased EYLEA are limited.","Second, we see the patients continuing EYLEA therapy are moving towards less frequent dosing. Importantly for the coming quarter, we also expect some seasonality with the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays in the quarter, as we expect many practices to be closed for the last week of the year and some patients will likely delay injections until after the holidays.","Beyond the US we see tremendous opportunity for EYLEA. The ex-US wet AMD market is just as big if not bigger than the US market. In the third quarter, we along with our ex-US partner Bayer HealthCare announced that EYLEA had received a positive opinion for the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use to the EU.","Bayer launched EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD in various Europe territories following approval, which is expected later this year. EYLEA has also been approved for the treatment of wet AMD in Australia, Japan, Columbia and Brazil with launches anticipated beginning late this year.","I would now like to turn for ophthalmology to oncology, what we made our first foray in the third quarter with the approval of ZALTRAP also known as ziv-aflibercept. We co-commercialized ZALTRAP with our partners Sanofi.","Interest in the use of ZALTRAP in its approved medical setting for historically there was no therapy demonstrated to improve overall survival in combination with the standard of care chemotherapy regimen Folfiri, it\u2019s highlighted by the $8.3 million in net sales recorded by Sanofi in the United States from August 20th to September 30th.","With that, let me turn the call over to Murray Goldberg.","Murray Goldberg","Thank you, Bob and good morning to everyone. I\u2019m very pleased to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of 2012, which was the third consecutive quarter of profitability for Regeneron. Total revenue this quarter was $428 million, which included EYLEA net sales of $244 million and ARCALYST net sale of $5 million.","As Len already mentioned, the revenue for the quarter included a $50 million milestone from Sanofi and a $15 million milestone from Bayer which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment. ","In terms of EYLEA, net sales have now grown from a $124 million in the first quarter to a $194 million in the second quarter to $244 million this past quarter. We now forecast full year US EYLEA net sales of $790 to $815 million. EYLEA inventory held by distributors in the third quarter was consistent with prior quarters at about one to two weeks of sales.","Sanofi collaboration revenue for the third quarter was $145 million and has a number of components, including reimbursement of our R&D expenses for preclinical and clinical research within our antibody collaboration, as well as our share of the loss associated with preparing for commercialization of ZALTRAP and then launch in August, plus the ZALTRAP milestone payment. As you heard from Bob, we\u2019re very pleased with the $8 million that ZALTRAP net sales in the third quarter, representing about six weeks of initial sales.","During the initial launch period, we expect ZALTRAP to operate at a loss. In this quarter our share of that loss was about $7.5 million. Looking forward, we expect this loss to increase, as Sanofi launches ZALTRAP around the world, following approval in each country. The case impact of these early losses on us is litigated by the $50 million approval milestone that we received in the third quarter.","Note also, that even after ZALTRAP turns profitable, we\u2019re obligated to begin to repay Sanofi for our share of development costs. So, we do not expect to show profits from ZALTRAP on our income statements for at least the next couple of years.","For the third quarter, Bayer Healthcare collaboration revenue was $27 million and represent Bayer\u2019s reimbursement for their share of EYLEA development expenses that we incurred. It also includes the $15 million milestone that we received for the approval of EYLEA in Japan. As Bayer launches EYLEA in each country outside the US, we will start to share commercialization expenses and profits and losses from commercialization in these countries, except for Japan where we receive a royalty on sales. We also expected $10 million milestone in the fourth quarter from Bayer Healthcare upon pricing approval of commercialization of EYLEA outside the US.","Cost of goods sold in the third quarter was $20 million or 8.1% of total net product sales consistent with our prior guidance of cost of goods sold, averaging less than 10%. As a reminder, this includes royalty expense in connection with our agreement with Genentech relating to \u00a0ophthalmic sales of EYLEA in the US.","Turning to R&D, non-GAAP R&D expense was $145 million compared to $120 million in the third quarter last year.","If we net out R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, from our R&D expense line, our net non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense for the third quarter 2012 was $38 million similar to the $37 million in the second quarter this year.","We expect total unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense for the full year to range between $160 million to $200 million which implies a fourth quarter unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense of $50 to $90 million.","This potential substantial increase in the fourth quarter is primarily due to the fact that we expect full year discovery pre-clinical spending under the Sanofi antibody agreement to exceed the amount that Sanofi is obligated to reimburse. The difference will all fall into the fourth quarter. Therefore fourth quarter unreimbursed R&D expenses should not be extrapolated as a run rate for 2013.","With respect to SG&A, our non-GAAP SG&A expense for the third quarter was approximately $40 million compared to $28 million in the same quarter of 2011. We now expect our full year 2012 non-GAAP SG&A expense to be in the $160 to $180 million range below our prior guidance of $180 to $210 million.","As a reminder, non-GAAP R&D and non-GAAP SG&A expenses exclude non-cash share based compensation expense.","Turning now to the bottom line, we reported non-GAAP net income of $217 million for the third quarter which translates into non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of $0.89. Non-GAAP EPS excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense and non-cash interest expense related to our senior convertible notes. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $191 million and fully diluted EPS of $0.72.","Included in both the GAAP and non-GAAP EPS are the two onetime milestones totaling $65 million that went directly to the bottom line.","Now that we have reported three consecutive quarters of profitability, it seems appropriate to begin discussing and looking ahead to book and cash income taxes.","We currently have significant net operating loss carry-forwards and tax credit carry-forwards available to offset future taxable income. In fact, given the magnitude of our existing NOL and tax credit carry-forwards, plus significant additional tax deductions we expect in connection with future employee exercises of stock options, we do not expect to pay any significant cash income taxes through at least 2014.","On a book basis, things are more complicated. Even though we have a large amount of NOLs in tax credits that are available to offset future taxable income, under GAAP, we are not allowed to show a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet due to our outstanding history of operating losses, prior to 2012. Rather, we fully offset our deferred tax assets with what is called evaluation allowance.","In each of the past three quarters, when we reported net income, consistent with GAAP, we released enough of this evaluation allowance to offset that net income so that there was no need to provide for any book taxes on that income. ","Once we have a sustained history of quarterly profitability, we would be required to release a significant portion or all of the valuation allowance. In that quarter, we will recognize a large onetime, non-cash income tax benefit on our income statement. Since this is a onetime, non-cash benefit, we expect to exclude it from our non-GAAP earnings in that quarter.","From then on, consistent with GAAP, we will provide for book taxes on our net income each quarter using our estimated corporate tax rates which we expect to initially be around 40%. As our business continues to grow and we optimize business and financial management strategies, we anticipate that this tax rate will decline overtime.","It bears repeating that even though we may begin to report book income taxes on our financial statements, we do not expect to pay any significant cash income taxes in the near future. We have not yet determined whether to include cash taxes or book taxes in our non-GAAP earnings calculation at the time we begin to report book taxes.","Our non-GAAP fully diluted shares in the third quarter were approximately a $116 million and include 16 million shares attributable to stock options, restrictive stock and warrants and 4.7 million shares attributable to our convertible notes, accounted for using the 'if converted' method.","At September 30th, we have $583 million of cash, restricted cash in marketable securities. In addition, our trade receivables continue to increase and we're $507 million at the end of the quarter which is a reflection of our growing EYLEA sales and long commercial terms.","Thank you and with that I'll turn the call over to Len.","","Leonard Schleifer","Thanks Murray, Bob, George, the rest of the Regeneron team for delivering a great quarter. This marks our third quarter of profitability in a row as well as a strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth. We hope this is indicative of what we strive to deliver over the long term, strong top and bottom line growth.","In order for us to fulfill this promise we have to continue to continue to invest in R&D and deliver with our pipeline. As always, we thank the patients and their families who use our medicines and enroll in our clinical trials. Let me close by saying that we have always believed that Regeneron\u2019s success is due to its outstanding group of talented and dedicated employees.","Thus we are particularly proud that during this quarter, these employees and others recognize Regeneron as the best place to work in the industry as reflected by Science Magazine\u2019s recent ranking of Regeneron as the world's number one Bio Pharmaceutical employer.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Michael and open up the call for questions-and-answers.","","Michael Aberman","Thank you, Len. Kevin if you could now open the call for Q&A period.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank","I guess first question, you have given in the past the percentage of sales of new patients versus previously treated, could you update that? And second on PCSK9, what would be the first trial you think to roll and read out? And how do we think about timelines for data read outs for PCSK9? Thanks.","Michael Aberman","Okay. So let me take the second question first, as far as PCSK9 goes, we're going to have an event at the American Heart Association with Sanofi and so that\u2019s probably a better form to give you guidance on the various aspects of the program, it's coming up not too long Robyn, so if you can hold on till early part next month, you get your answers I hope.","As far as the specific movement whether the patients are coming from switches, how many switches, whether they're bad and whether they're Lucentis, we really\u00a0aren\u2019t going to get into that much detail. Bob can you give some general color on where we stand on market share and reiterate that?","Bob Terifay","Sure. In the past we've given you information from physician surveys. We\u2019d like to try to get more focus on the actual numbers. So I think what we can tell you is that it best and has about 15% of the overall market at the present time. Among the two products that are specifically approved for use in retinal diseases, total sales were $636 million.","Our share of those sales is about 40%. So overall what you can look at is, in the marketplace for anti-VEG-F therapies used in the eye, we have about a 20% market share. Now I remind you that Lucentis is approved but BRVO, CRVO and DME. So part of those sales are for other uses. So, our share is at least 40% or 20% of the AMD market. The other thing I can tell you from our surveys with retinal specialist which is a good indicator of where things are going is that our share of new patients is currently similar to that for Lucentis. So, we are gaining ground and things look very good for the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Raymond with Robert Baird & Company.","","Chris Raymond - Robert Baird & Company","Just, one of the dynamics that has kind of hit the news, since the quarter closed is this issue around the meningitis outbreak with compounding pharmacies. Understanding that you don\u2019t want to perhaps give too much color on the quarter, I know you talked about the holidays being hit, but can you maybe talk about the initial reaction you\u2019re hearing from docs in terms of this news item as it relates to Avastin use? And is there anything we should know about that?","","Leonard Schleifer","Thanks for that question Chris. You know, of course at Regeneron like most ethical pharmaceutical companies, our concerned for patients is always paramount and obviously our thoughts go out to all who affected by this tragedy and it really is a tragedy, it\u2019s a bit of a black mark on the US drugs supply system which here therefore we\u2019ve had a really, I\u2019d say excellent track record.","It\u2019s worth noting that when all of us think about FDA approvals, that it tempting to think only in terms of the safety and efficacy of the product as measured in clinical trials but there is much more to it. And an important part of the approval process includes inspection of the facilities where the drug will be manufactured and therefore it covers not just the drug but the entire supply chain including manufacture and distribution.","In addition, the FDA also has well specified guidelines and recommendations on the ongoing pharmacovigilance with management. So, you know that has not being the case based on the newspaper reports in the compounding pharmacy industry. So I think that there is value to using an FDA approved product. We recognize that there are cost differentials between the off label use of Avastin and the branded products. But nevertheless, we do think that the branded products have important attributes to offer.","As to whether or not there will be a structural change in the use of Avastin based on any regulatory or new regulations or laws that may emerge, I think it\u2019s just too early to tell whether there will be a psychological change over from Avastin to wanting people want to use an FDA product, we think that\u2019s possible. People give you all sorts of opinions on that, but we just don\u2019t have any data yet. But I think, over the next quarter or two we should be able to give you a little bit more information. Obviously, we\u2019re going to monitor very carefully what\u2019s going on in Washington and what\u2019s going on in the marketplace. Next question, please?","","Operator","Our next question comes from Joseph Schwartz with Leerink Swann.","Joseph Schwartz - Leerink Swann","","I was wondering regarding the compounded Avastin theme, how much Avastin uses for patients that might have good insurance coverage for EYLEA, but lining up that reimbursement takes time, so physicians might start the patient on Avastin while they wait for payers to approve the patients Is there anything that you can do to encourage more uptake of EYLEA, now you\u2019re your reps have a good story to tell versus just few of the unknown?","","Bob Terifay","So we do have a program in place that will cover practices if they do use EYLEA in a patient and then the patient turns out not to have insurance coverage. So that has not deterred physicians from using EYLEA at the initial dosing. Most of the Avastin use quite frankly is in patients who do have insurance, who could benefit from both EYLEA and Lucentis, but the physicians have chosen to use Avastin because of its price. So, that\u2019s a surprising point. We might have thought if you\u2019re already going into this the Avastin was being reserved only for patients who can afford a branded product, but that is clearly not the case. So there is an opportunity to be able to convert patients and we are seeing, we have been, even before this episode switching from Avastin to our products.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Birchenough with BMO Capital.","","Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital","Congratulations on the strong performance. Couple of questions, just following up on the line of inquiry on Avastin. When you look at Avastin practices that have this concern about financial risk, do you have a sense of what proportion are just not set up in terms of having sophisticated reimbursement, people onsite and what proportion do you have the sophistication to be able to build for EYLEA. So that\u2019s the first question. ","Second question, just on dose frequency, any sense of what the trends are there in terms of whether we\u2019re starting to see dose and extend having some impact, some of the headwinds you talk about before? And then a quick question for Murray, at the point where we exhaust the NOLs Murray, and you actually start paying cash income taxes, where do you think that 40% rate will have following to? Thanks.","Leonard Schleifer","So Bob do you want to deal with the issue of whether these practices can and cannot set up for reimbursement in the issuing dosing?","Bob Terifay","So Jim that was a good observation. We\u2019re actually picking up these practices that were all advanced and who are smaller practices, who just didn\u2019t have the infrastructure to ensure that they had the reimbursement to stay profitable and early on with the launch of the Lucentis, they had actually lost money. So we do have our reimbursement people spending time with the smaller practices to make them comfortable with how to manage their inventory so that they don\u2019t lose money on the anti-VEG-F agents. However, there are some larger practices that historically for one reason or another chose to be Avastin only practices, that do have the capabilities, but again, we are starting to see making inroads in those practices and we picked up quite bit of our business from Avastin.","Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital","And dosing?","Bob Terifay","In terms of the dosing again, I don\u2019t give the specifics of a physician surveys, but I can tell you that dosing interval is increasing overtime as physicians move from the three loading doses and we are seeing more and more that physicians are moving towards the every eight week dosing interval.","Murray Goldberg","On the tax side Jim, it\u2019s too early to be able to forecast that. Firstly, we don\u2019t really know when we\u2019ll start paying cash taxes, part of that depends on how quickly we generate profits, cumulative profits and what additional NOLs we generate going forward. So we don\u2019t the timing of when that is. And therefore, we don\u2019t really know at that point how far we\u2019ll have advanced and what we have been able to do in order to bring our tax rate down, but certainly it\u2019s an important goal for us to bring our book tax rate down from that and our cash tax rate down from that 40% level.","Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital","Murray, you meant generate not NOLs in the future but income tax credits so right from\u2026","Murray Goldberg","The options are both okay.  ","Operator","Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs","I guess one additional follow-up on the injection frequency, I was wondering if you have any survey data regarding injection frequency in the refractory patients, I know at ASRS it seems like the physician reports were kind of variable in terms of the dosing frequency and schedule they\u2019re using those patients. So I was just wondering what your surveys have picked up out there in the market and then second question on the SG&A front, was impressed the leverage again this quarter and I was wondering, if this is the level we should think about as we go into our years here. ","Leonard Schleifer","","Murray do you want to deal with the SG&A leverage at this point? I mean I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much new here. We know that this is an efficient product to sell and\u2026","Murray Goldberg","","The leverage we get is because we\u2019re based in to the same sales force, six sales force, and as Bob indicated, we\u2019re covering just about all the retinal specialist and their practices so that we can expand sales even both for went AMD and additional indications without having to significantly expand our commercial expenses.","Bob Terifay","In terms of refractory patients, if you go back to some of those presentations at ASRS, the physicians have reported that they were frequently dosing Lucentis or Avastin even on less than a monthly dosing intervals. Some of them were dosing every two weeks for example. What we see with EYLEA, is their first goal is to try to alleviate the ongoing retinal edema that existed in those patients and then they do try to increase the interval overtime and we are seeing that they are able to move the interval off and out from two weeks to four weeks or from four weeks to six weeks and over time, they are trying to stretch that. So, we do see that there is a longer interval in the refractory patients with EYLEA, but again, the more important factor that doctors have focused on is to alleviate that retinal edema and hopefully improve vision.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America","I wanted to ask you little bit more about this switchers, in general for those physicians that switch a patient from either Avastin or Lucentis over to EYLEA, do they in general, move right into the every other months, dose frequency or do they go to the loading dose?","Bob Terifay","So again, this ties back to part of what we\u2019re talking about refractor patients, many of the switches of people that were inadequately controlled with Avastin or Lucentis, so most of those patients are giving loading doses to start. There are some patients who\u2019ve asked to be switched to EYLEA because of living far away from the retinal practice or because of their travel schedules. In some of those patients, they get the three loads, in some cases they switch over to every eight weeks, but the majority of our switches currently do get three loading doses.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America","And are you finding physicians moving to as needed or PRN dosing with EYLEA to the same level they were with Lucentis or Avastin?","Bob Terifay","It\u2019s a mixed bag, there are some physicians who have chosen to go to a more predictable dosing schedule. So we actually have practices that have moved all their patients to every eight week dosing on a schedule and feel that they are getting very good results and that really is the strength of the product. If you can get to a predictable schedule we don\u2019t have to bring them in for monitoring in between, that saves the practice money, saves the healthcare system money and it is much more convenient for the patient.","There are other physicians who I wouldn\u2019t call it a PRN dosing schedule but they are using a treat extend dosing schedule which is, they try to extend out the dosing interval by checking on the patient\u2019s vision on a regular schedule and then move it out in two week increments overtime and we do see the interval increasing as we go out in time.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America","And one more for you Bob, if a physician were to treat a patient with EYLEA for DME, is it your observation that they can\u2019t get reimbursement coverage for it?","Bob Terifay","So first of all, we do not promote EYLEA for any use other than the labeled indications of whether AMD and macular edema following CRVO. For the most part, payers are reimbursing specifically for those two indications on select basis, if a physician selects to go to payer and try to get reimbursement for DME, it may be possible. But again, we\u2019re focused on our labeled indications.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Citigroup.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup","Nice quarter. So, question for Bob and a question for Murray. Just Bob, in terms of CRVO, may be help us understand a little bit the market, how it\u2019s different from AMD. It\u2019s more of a fixed number of injections market. I am just trying to get a sense. How do you kind of think about the rapidity of the uptake or is this kind of a more of a new patient market i.e. maybe even a faster penetration? And then I have a follow-up to Murray.","Bob Terifay","Sure. So, the CRVO market first of all is relatively small compared to the AMD market, about 10% in terms of the patients. In terms of its management, historically people looked at CRVO as a disease that they manage for a six months to a year and then, well first of all, there were no therapies historically, so they did watchful waiting and unfortunately some people lost their vision permanently. But they did think of it as an acute condition that once the clot resolves, that they wouldn't need therapy anymore. ","What we've seen in some of the longer term follow up studies from the Lucentis trials, specifically the horizon RVO trial is that, CRVO is a chronic disease. Patients may need anti-VEG-F therapy for several years and we do see the duration of therapy increasing for CRVO.","I also think CRVO has been undermanaged in the past, because watchful waiting was the norm, we saw people delaying therapy. What we can tell you from our own trial is that patients who delay treatment for more than two months after they experience the initial incident of CRVO, did not do as well as those who received immediate anti-VEG-F therapy. So we think there's an educational opportunity on RVO. We are focusing our medical specialists on working with physicians to identify more CRVO patients and treat them early, aggressively and chronically. So it may end up being a larger market than 10% over time and it may follow more the AMD dynamics.","","Yaron Werber - Citigroup","And just Murray, for you, when they look at your SG&A currently, I mean you're running around, Q1 was high and even pretty stable Q2 and Q3. I'm just trying to get a sense, is that kind of a good run rate as we think about your base spending from now on. And then R&D aside from this one time pop, I guess my question, is this going to be a onetime pop or is this going to be something that recurs at the end of every year, as you might just decide to spend more than Sanofi is reimbursing.","","Murray Goldberg","Two good questions. In terms of the SG&A, I think as I mentioned earlier, we don't see a need around the EYLEA program for there to be a big increment in commercial expenses in and of itself. I think in terms of G&A you will see some secular trends obviously as the company is growing a lot of those expenses grow with it and the infrastructure necessary to support it, not only the commercial operations but the expansion of our R&D efforts also grows. I think you will see some small increases consistent what you've seen the past aside from the big jump in commercial expenses related to EYLEA.","In terms of your other question, on R&D, we focused on the fourth quarter and the fact of the mechanics of how this is going to work in terms of the Sanofi reimbursement. So whether that will happen in each fourth quarter will depend as you point out how much we spend in terms of our discovery research and how that compares to what's reimbursed. So it's hard to predict that but we\u2019ll try to give you a heads up as we did in this third quarter.","But beyond that, in terms of the total amount aside of this quirkiness of the Sanofi expanding and reimbursement, the overall amount of what's going to happen unreimbursed R&D will also depend on other things like the progress of our NGF program which is not parted if and when that gets up and running those expenses will be unreimbursed R&D. and some of our investment in other antibodies that are not part of Sanofi collaborations such as George talked about ErbB3 which is first coming on board and other antibodies that are already advancing in Phase I.","So we may see some additional spending for those and for as we pursued new technology opportunities also coming out of our own expense. So the overall level of what the unreimbursed R&D would depend on some of these other factors NGF perhaps being a large one of that. So it's an early until we get some feedback from the FDA to talk about when and how much that might be.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup","So we should think about Q4 as 120 base that which was last which was one Q3 plus the additional 50 to 90?","Murray Goldberg","120 plus the 50, that we gave you our full year guidance of 160 to 200, we know that\u2019s a relatively large range, but we wouldn\u2019t take that fourth quarter rate to 50 to 90 and just automatically assume that's going to be the same thing in the first quarter next year.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup","No, no, no of course, but you kind of back into a fourth quarter 170 to 210 would be the range for the fourth quarter in R&D, just trying to bracket that a little bit all in?","Leonard Schleifer","Yes, we can certainly help you if it's still confusing, following our conference call.","Murray Goldberg","And we\u2019ll update this guidance as we get greater clarity in terms of what we\u2019ll be doing with some of the non-Sanofi programs moving into 2013.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Kantor with Credit Suisse.","Jason Kantor - Credit Suisse","Most of my questions have been asked and answered but I was wondering if you could talk about the potential for the ex-U.S. launch of EYLEA, what you've learned from the U.S. launch? And how you think about, how that drug could be taken up in other countries? What are the factors that could make it move more or less quickly than the U.S.?","Murray Goldberg","Right. So, I think those kind of detailed questions are better left for Bayer, who\u2019s got the rolling more on this one but you can look at the uptake of our product relative to Lucentis\u2019 first four years in the U.S. and you can take a look at the first four years of Lucentis outside the U.S. and then make your own relative guesses on how we\u2019ll do. But if you want more details, I would suggest you talk with our colleagues at Bayer at this point.","Just caution to remember of course, it\u2019s not a monolith outside the United States, you don\u2019t get reimbursement in every jurisdiction. These are multiple roll outs, so it\u2019s not like the United States where we rolled out, even though the market size is probably as large outside the United States as it is in the United States, it\u2019s not as easy to address that market as quickly.","Jason Kantor - Credit Suisse","","And then if I could ask another question on the US market, the people that are still using Lucentis predominantly, why are they still doing that? And what are you learning and how can you continue to penetrate those people who maybe who are not early adopters, what is the reason for their sticking with Lucentis versus switching?","Bob Terifay","","So, first of all if somebody is doing well on Lucentis, unless they want to be switched for convenience, the physician is not going to switch them off of a therapy that is working. Remember AMD is a chronic disease. So there are a number of patients on continuing Lucentis therapy that aren\u2019t going to be moved. In terms, of new patients, Lucentis does offer a rebate to high volume accounts and that does influence the decision making in certain accounts.","Operator","","Our next question from (inaudible) with RBC Capital Markets.","Unidentified Analyst","A high level question for you, Lucentis sales were pretty stable this quarter and EYLEA strongly, so can say a bit more about market dynamics that we\u2019re seeing out there. And if you can then specifically, is there some of bolus of patients that are hard to treat, that you think working through and then in terms of future development time for EYLEA, would you do a formal study yourself for the investigator sponsor study in that particular setting, are you good enough and then trials in combination with other agent cancer dose. Thanks.","Leonard Schleifer","I just didn\u2019t hear the last question.","Unidentified Analyst","The second part was that if you can form a big picture then specifically, is there some of bolus of patients that is being worked through, that are hard to treat, would you do a hard to treat study yourself or are the IST good enough? And then lastly combination to studies, if any with EYLEA?","Leonard Schleifer","Well, I think, we\u2019re going to look at the, whether or not it make sense to do a registration study based upon what it would cost, how much it would influence the market, what the endpoints would be. George, want to add anything to that?","George Yancopoulos","Well, certainly this as we\u2019ve already heard a lot of emerging data on these hard to treat patients and we\u2019re certainly seeing how that data matures over time and taken that into consideration as one set in terms of going forward.","Leonard Schleifer","In terms of the first part of your question, I would remind you that Lucentis is relatively stable in sales, but they do have three indications beyond wet AMD. Beyond CRVO, which we share in common with them, they are approved for macular edema following branch, retinal vein occlusion which is a market that is about a third of the AMD market size. And they also are the only product to approve the treatment of diabetic macular edema where there is significant unmet medical need and so there are part of those Lucentis sales, are those uses which has offset the decline in the AMD.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Then if I can just ask on the bolus to you, the condition of bolus?","","Leonard Schleifer","","There are constantly patients who the physician determines are refractory or inadequately controlled with other therapies. Not everyone gets to a dry retina especially on a predictable dosing schedule. So we continue to see switches, but the number of switches or the numbers of switch available patients is lower than when we first launched.","","Bob Terifay","","So remember this will constantly be a sort of a very dynamic and cycling market. You have patients who will stop therapy, these are the elderly patients. Right now we\u2019re only getting approximately half of the branded market going in and therefore a quarter of the overall market and therefore the 75% of the market that are potential bolus patients if you will, that will accumulate as they continue to go. If we gather more and more of the frontend new patients, then obviously that would go down. So it\u2019s very hard to model per-se, to take. If you\u2019ve got a great model, send it along to us.","","Unidentified Analyst","Can I speak on sarilumab since nobody seems to ask on that?","Bob Terifay","","We\u2019re getting very late in time and we have a few more question, and sorry, so we\u2019re going to take two more questions, operator.","","Operator","Your next question comes from Philip Nadeau with Cowen and Company.","Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company","Just to first, just looking for an update on your PDGFF efforts, when can that enter the clinic and when can we see data? And then second on ZALTRAP pricing, there was a prominent cancer institution here in New York City that recently made some noise about ZALTRAP\u2019s pricing. So, it\u2019s really been clear to me how many refractory patients used low-dose Avastin versus high-dose. Could you give us some sense of how you think ZALTRAP is actually priced relative to the actual Avastin dose that\u2019s being used in refractory patients? Thanks.","Bob Terifay","As part of the pricing and all that issue, we should really have only one spokesperson for that and that\u2019s been Sanofi\u2019s. People are more than happy to discuss those issues with you. If you need a contact, we\u2019ll give you a contact there. In terms of PDGF, George, you want to make any comments about that?","George Yancopoulos","Yes, we certainly find the very preliminarily data very interesting, we recognized that it\u2019s very hard to understand that the magnitude of the benefit in these small studies where we\u2019ve certainly seen our experiences that you can get differences that are due to chance and it\u2019s hard to know what the exact benefit is. We certainly think that it\u2019s going to be a very interesting but very complicated development path going forward. How to incorporate another agent another series of injections? How many are going to be needed? What\u2019s the benefit is going to be required and so forth. So it\u2019s going to be a very competitive clinical development path and very interesting. And we\u2019re certainly not going to give guidance on what our approach is going to be right now other than that it\u2019s going to be very interesting. As I said, it\u2019s going to be very complicated. How do we incorporate another injection to the process? And we\u2019ll be hopefully entering very soon to the clinic and giving you more information about our pogrom.","Bob Terifay","So we hope next year to be in the clinic. Good, Michael, turn it back over to you we have one more.","Michael Aberman","Actually given the time, it\u2019s already 9:30, I think we\u2019re going to wrap it up here. I apologize to anybody who didn\u2019t make it on the call obviously. We will be available immediately following this call to answer any further questions. So again, operator this concludes our third quarter call. Thank you everybody for participating.","Operator","So ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation.

Such statements may include, but are not limited to, those related to Regeneron and its products and business, financial forecasts and guidance, development programs and related anticipated milestones, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, payer coverage and reimbursement issues, intellectual property, and pending litigation and competition.","Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected in that statement. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron\u2019s filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30th, 2019, which has been filed with the SEC today.","Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. In addition, please note that GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed on today\u2019s call.","Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliation of those measures to GAAP is available in our financial results press release which can be accessed on our website. Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions.","With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.","Leonard Schleifer","Thank you, Justin. Before we begin, I'd like to extend a warm welcome to Justin who joined us earlier this summer after completing a 19-year training program at Merck and has immediately hit the ground running here at Regeneron. We're thrilled to have him as part of the team and we worked hard to make his first quarter a straightforward one.","Thanks to everyone for joining the call and turning to our business. We had a great quarter actually marked by top and bottom-line growth as well as important advances across our innovative R&D engine. Sales at Regeneron products including those recorded by our partners grew 32% compared to the second quarter of 2018.","EYLEA global net sales grew 13% to $1.9 billion including U.S. EYLEA net sales growth of 17% to $1.16 billion. The diabetic retinopathy approval in May continues to build upon EYLEA's leadership position in treating retinal diseases including Wet, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, and retinal vein occlusion. We are also pleased to announce that our antibody collaboration with Sanofi achieved profitability this quarter. We expect profits to continue to increase driven by growth in Dupixent as well as discipline cost management across the collaboration to stem losses from Praluent by better aligning investments with revenues.","Dupixent is fulfilling its potential to improve the lives of patients by transforming the treatment of a variety of Type 3 allergic diseases. Global net sales are now annualizing at more than $2 billion. Patient initiation in the U.S. are growing and many ex-U.S. launches are just beginning.","Building on this commercial momentum in June, we received the FDA approval for Dupixent in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. In the EU Dupixent was approved in May for severe asthma in adults and adolescents and as we announced this morning was just approved for atopic dermatitis in the adolescent patients.","We also announced today the strong positive results of our Phase 3 study in children aged 6 to 11 with severe atopic dermatitis. We are enthusiastic about the current and future prospects of Dupixent as a treatment directed at the underlying cost of allergic diseases. Additionally, we are making significant progress towards our goal of building a leading presence in immuno-oncology.","The U.S. and EU approvals for Libtayo in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma are just the beginning. Our clinical efforts, which now includes multiple different immuno-oncology programs are studying a wide variety of potential drug candidates in several difficult-to-treat cancers including non-small cell lung, cancer basal cell carcinoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma and prostate cancer.","Beyond Oncology, we continue to novel programs forward throughout early and late-stage development. George will speak to a few of these programs and additional data readouts are expected later this year. We have made critical advances that have led both to top line and bottom line growth, but we recognize that these advances maybe overshadowed by the current policy debates on the affordability and accessibility of innovative medicines. We continue to work with policymakers to develop responsible solutions that address affordability and accessibility, while preserving incentives to develop transformative treatments of the future.","Now, I'll turn the call over to George.","George Yancopoulos","Thanks, Len. Let me begin with EYLEA, the market leader based on its ability to improve vision across multiple retinal diseases along with its safety profile established by over 25 million injections. In addition to EYLEA's indication for the treatment of wet AMD or macular edema following retinal vein occlusion and for diabetic macular edema or DME, the FDA label for EYLEA was expanded in May to include diabetic retinopathy without centrally involved AME based on the panorama study.","In this diabetic retinopathy setting our updated label shows that EYLEA demonstrated an 85% to 100% reduction in the incidence of vision-threatening complications. In addition, we are awaiting FDA action on our resubmitted filing for the EYLEA prefilled syringe.","In terms of our future innovation in retinal disease, we are planning to initiate clinical programs with a higher dose formulation of aflibercept in wet AMD and in DME by the end of 2019. These studies will test higher doses of aflibercept in 12 and 16-week regimens compared to the recommended EYLEA regimen of two milligrams every eight weeks. Beyond aflibercept, we are continuing preclinical development of a new VEGF blocker, gene therapy, and other novel approaches including with our new collaborators at Alnylam.","I'd like to now turn to DUPIXENT, our Breakthrough Therapy that has already benefitting many patients in a wide variety of atopic and\/or allergic diseases. As Len mentioned, we achieved several important regulatory milestones. Beyond the highlighted approvals, an opinion by the European Committee from Medicinal Products for Human Use or CHMP for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis is anticipated by the end of 2019.","And just this morning we announced positive results of the Phase III trial in severe pediatric atopic dermatitis patients aged six to 11 years which we intend to submit to regulators in the coming months. I would like to remind you of the tremendous unmet need in this population.","On average, the children on our study had nearly 60% of their body covered with lesions and had suffered from this disease for most of their lives leaving the children and their families devastated and without much hope.","Not only did DUPIXENT dramatically reduce skin involvement as measured by EASI score by an average of about 80%, it also improved measures of anxiety, depression, and health-related quality of life for both the children and their families.","The study also confirmed DUPIXENT's established safety profile and once again, numerically reduced skin infections. We are deeply committed to bringing DUPIXENT to patients suffering from a range of Type 2 inflammatory diseases driven by the interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 team pathways.","With that goal in mind, we are actively enrolling patients in Phase III studies in the eosinophilic esophagitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD. As a reminder, we are also exploring the effectiveness of DUPIXENT in allergy desensitization settings such as for grass and peanut allergy.","While allergy immunotherapy can be effective in the long-term, many patients can't complete the prolonged time course required for success because of allergic reactions which can be severe. We recently completed a small Phase IIa trial with about 25 patients per treatment arm, testing whether DUPIXENT could improve the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of subcutaneous immunotherapy or SCIT therapy for grass allergy. The preliminary results of this study showed that about 30 patients discontinued therapy in the SCIT group, mostly due to clinically meaningful allergic reactions compared to only a single patient who discontinued SCIT when combined with DUPIXENT and not due to an allergic reaction.","And in the primary efficacy analysis, there was no difference in terms of reduction of the allergic symptoms with SCIT or in the combination. Thus we are encouraged by the potential of DUPIXENT to increase the tolerability of SCIT therapy and we're looking forward to presenting the results at a future medical meeting.","Earlier this quarter, we reported that Regeneron 3500, our interleukin-33 antibody made primary and secondary endpoints in a proof-of-concept study in moderate-to-severe asthma patients, showing that Regeneron 3500 may provide an alternative therapeutic option for asthma. Although the Regeneron 3500 results were numerically lower than those for the DUPIXENT calibrator arm.","In addition, the combination of Regeneron 3500 and DUPIXENT did not demonstrate increased benefit compared to DUPIXENT monotherapy in this trial, although the study was not power to this comparison. In addition, the next 12 months, we're expecting interim results from the Phase 2 Regeneron 3,500 studies in COPD and in atopic dermatitis.","I will now shift gears to our immunotherapy efforts to treat cancer. Starting with Libtayo. Last month, our PD-1 antibody was approved in the EU for adults with metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, who were not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation making Libtayo the first and only approved medicine of any kind for patients with advanced CSCC in the U.S. and Europe.","With the goal of making Libtayo available from a broader population of CSCC patients, we started Phase 3 study in adjuvant CSCC. In addition to an ongoing investigator-initiated study, our study in the neurological setting is scheduled to start in the fourth quarter. Additionally, our pivotal study of Libtayo in basal cell carcinoma, the most common skin cancer is expected to read out in the first half of next year.","Moving on to non-small cell lung cancer, we are pleased by the enrollment for our Libtayo monotherapy Phase 3 trial in high PD-L1 expressors. We have commenced enrollment in part two of our other Phase 3 lung cancer study, which will compare Libtayo plus chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone regardless of PD-L1 status or histology.","Beyond checkpoint inhibition, our investigational bispecific antibody franchise consists of two broad categories based on the T-cell receptor to which the bispecific bind. The CD3 molecule or the CD28 customers are bispecifics. In total, we now have four bispecifics under clinical investigation. Our CD20xCD3, BCMAxCD3, MUC16xCD3 and notably the newest was addition of our first co-stimulatory bispecific PSMAxCD28. Additional candidates are expected to enter to clinic in the upcoming months and years.","In June, we presented updated efficacy and safety data for Regeneron 1979, our CD20xCD3 bispecific. Regeneron 1979 continues to show high response rate in heavily pretreated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients. In particular, we observed complete responses in four out of seven diffused large B-cell lymphoma or DLBCL patients treated with Regeneron 1979 doses 80 milligrams or higher.","Notably, four of these had failed prior CAR-T therapy, and two of which achieved complete responses. Regeneron 1979 has demonstrated manageable tolerability with no discontinuations to the syndrome or neurotoxicity to date. Recruitment for a potentially pivotal Phase 2 trial for Regeneron 1979 is now ongoing. The multi-arm study will enroll several disease-specific cohorts of relapsed refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients including follicular lymphoma, DLBCL, and other non-Hodgkin's lymphoma subtypes.","Our two other CD3 bispecific antibodies MUC16xCD3 for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and BCMAxCD3 for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma are in clinical studies that are actively enrolling patients. We plan to present preliminary BCMAxCD3 data by the end of 2019.","Finally, recruitment is ongoing for the first co-stimulatory candidate Regeneron 5678, which binds prostate-specific membrane antigen or PSMA on tumor cells, as well as the CD28 co-stimulatory molecule on T cells.","Based on preclinical evidence, we are hoping to see synergy of our co-stims with Libtayo in disease settings, such as prostate cancer, that have proven resistant to immunotherapy alone. If successful, this innovative approach could open up the possibility of immunotherapy to a large number of patients who do not currently have this option.","In addition, we expect a number of updates related to other programs emerging for our pipeline. By the end of 2019, we are planning to present our C5 antibody data in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH. By the end of this year, we also expect readout of our ANGPTL-3 antibody Phase 3 study in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, as well as a readout of our Activin-A antibody pivotal study in the rare disease Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva, or FLP. Phase 3 studies of fasinumab, our advanced candidate for osteoarthritis pain are now fully enrolled and data are expected during 2020.","Finally, we just celebrated the fifth anniversary of The Regeneron Genetics Center. To date, we have sequenced 700,000 individuals linking their exome data with detailed medical records. We continue to be excited about our ongoing effort here, including our work to sequence the U.K. Biobank database in collaboration with a consortium of leading biopharma progress.","Mining of The Regeneron Genetics Center database had already discovered and\/or validated a number of genetic drug targets across several human diseases, which are positively impacting our clinical development efforts.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Marion. ","Marion McCourt","Thank you, George. In the second quarter, we executed well across our portfolio of existing lines of business and recent launches. Starting with EYLEA. Global net product sales grew 13% year-over-year to $1.9 billion. In the U.S. net product sales grew 17% year-over-year and 8% quarter-over-quarter to $1.16 billion.","EYLEA growth is driven by share gain and market expansion, underpinned by the aging population and increase in diabetes prevalence. In the branded U.S. anti-VEGF market, our share increased to 71% of net product sales. In the quarter, a temporary shortage of Avastin in select geographies modestly impacted EYLEA net sales.","EYLEA continues to help patients with a diabetic eye disease and this represents an important growth opportunity for the brand. In mid-May, the FDA approved EYLEA to treat all stages of diabetic retinopathy and our launched commence immediately. For this indication, EYLEA is the only anti-VEGF for approved with two dosing options, allowing doctors to customize treatment to their patients' needs.","Our comprehensive plans to develop EYLEA's position in the diabetic retinopathy market are underway. We begin educating both physicians and patients upon approval encouraging early intervention for appropriate patients and ensuring EYLEA is the first-line anti-VEGF treatment. It's early days in the launch, but we're pleased with feedback from retina specialists and we're seeing positive early interest and uptake among major practices.","We are investing in EYLEA's commercial platforms to advance our market-leading position across all indications, including wet AMD, DME and in diabetic retinopathy. Our expanded and realign sales force has a dual focus of growing both the diabetic eye disease market and our core wet AMD business.","Robust engagement efforts with the retinal community, messaging both EYLEA's clinical and real world experience are well under way. Additional outcomes in safety remain the standards by which therapies are compared and EYLEA's rapid and sustained outcomes in improving and protecting vision are unsurpassed.","We're committed to further strengthening our leadership position for EYLEA through continued innovation including in dose and delivery. Pending FDA approval the EYLEA prefilled syringe will be launched in 2019.","I'd now like to turn to Libtayo. The launch in continuous squamous cell carcinoma or CSCC continues to gain momentum. And in the U.S. net product sales were $41 million for the quarter. Brand awareness within the medical community is growing demonstrated by the breadth of prescribers at major cancer centers and community practices around the country. Since launch, we made further progress in establishing Libtayo as the standard-of-care in advanced CSCC across all lines of therapy.","Market research indicates more than three times as many CSCC patients are now receiving an anti-PD1 or PD-L1 treatment compared to before Libtayo's approval. We believe Libtayo is poised for continued growth. We have broad payer access and a QA recommendation from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Libtayo is the only checkpoint inhibitor to have this designation in CSCC.","Additionally, ex-U.S. launches in CSCC are underway and we look forward to data that could expand the potential of our dermatologic oncology portfolio into earlier stages of CSCC and beyond.","Moving to Praluent, in the second quarter, global net sales were $74 million. In the highly competitive U.S. market, we remain focused on patient affordability and physician ease of prescribing. We are working closely with our collaborator Sanofi to greatly improve brand profitability.","Turning to KEVZARA, in the second quarter, global net sales were $59 million. In the U. S. KEVZARA continues to make headway in the IL-6 subcutaneous class with an estimated 47% share of new patients-dispensed KEVZARA or NBRx and 29% share of total scripts or TRx.","Now for DUPIXENT, which is transforming the lives of patients suffering from Type 2 inflammatory diseases, atopic dermatitis, asthma, and now chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. Global net product sales in the second quarter were $557 million. In the U.S., net product sales reached $455 million, representing 151% year-over-year growth.","Total prescriptions or TRx in the U.S. grew approximately 30% compared to the first quarter. This was driven by continued growth in approved indication, adult atopic dermatitis and asthma, as well as the launch in atopic dermatitis for adolescents.","Weekly new-to-brand prescriptions or NBRx for the second quarter averaged approximately 1,200 patients per week, up from 950 in the prior quarter. This momentum is further evidence of the positive impact of our commercialization strategy and execution across all approved indications.","As we mentioned last quarter, prescribing continues to grow in adult atopic dermatitis as more moderate patients are just prescribed DUPIXENT and more healthcare professionals gain brand experience. Our recent launch in adolescence is going well. As a reminder, DUPIXENT is the first biologic approved for adolescents many of whom remain uncontrolled using topical therapies.","Market reaction has been extremely positive. Target physicians are prescribing and excited about the results they're seeing. There's significant uptake of both dermatologists and allergists and we're making meaningful inroads in reaching target pediatric dermatologists and pediatric allergists. In addition, market access coverage is already at or near levels of the adult population.","Asthma is a significant opportunity and DUPIXENT is well-positioned for continued growth. DUPIXENT's differentiated clinical and safety profile continues to support uptake. The asthma biologic market has expanded 13% since Dupixent's launch demonstrating our ability to compete and grow this market. Allergists, who have experienced using Dupixent in atopic dermatitis now also see its benefit for their asthma patients. Prescribing more \u2013 prescribing among pulmonologists is also increasing and they are highly receptive to Dupixent efficacy, use in steroid-dependent patients, and self administration.","And finally, in late June Dupixent became the first biologic medicine approved as an add-on maintenance therapy treatment for adults with an adequately controlled chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps. This indication is yet another first-in-class opportunity for Dupixent given the high unmet need.","In the U.S. up to 90,000 adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps are considered uncontrolled despite the prior surgery or systemic corticosteroid use and about 55,000 patients are those that had prior surgery.","Importantly, many patients with this disease have other Type 2 inflammatory diseases like asthma. In our two Phase 3 clinical trials almost 60% of patients also had asthma, which was improved with the Dupixent treatment. Our commercial efforts are focused on EMTs, and allergists and we're having constructive payer discussions. While early in the launch, we believe this will be a meaningful growth opportunity for Dupixent and we look forward to providing future updates.","In closing, we're excited about our near-term performance and confidence that our ongoing commercialization efforts will drive long-term growth across core brands and ongoing launches.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Landry","Thanks Marion. For the second quarter 2019, Regeneron executed well and delivered solid financial results on both the top and bottom lines. And as Len stated, we are pleased that the Sanofi antibody collaboration has reached commercial profitability. Total revenues for Regeneron grew 20% year-over-year to $1.93 billion driven by continued growth of our core brands EYLEA and Dupixent.","Non-GAAP diluted net income per share grew 10% year-over-year to $6.02 on non-GAAP net income of $690 million. Our second quarter GAAP results were impacted by both the Alnylam upfront payment and the equity investment.","In addition to Marion's earlier comments about EYLEA, I want to highlight two additional items related to U.S. EYLEA net sales for the quarter. First, inventory movements were immaterial in the quarter. Second, U.S. EYLEA net sales were impacted by an increase in sales related deductions.","Moving to our collaboration revenue line items. Starting with payer, ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales, which are reported to us by Bayer were $715 million representing a 7% reported and a 13% constant-currency basis increase year-over-year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the second quarter of 2019, grew 10% year-over-year to $289 million of which $269 million was derived from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S.","For the Sanofi collaboration, we generated significantly improved results. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $349 million, up 47% year-over-year. This increase was primarily driven by improved profitability in the Sanofi antibody collaboration. In the second quarter of 2019 Regeneron recognized a profit of $39 million in connection with the commercialization of non-I\/O antibodies compared to a loss of $69 million in the second quarter of 2018.","Profitability came from higher global net product sales of Dupixent, partly offset by an increase in commercialization-related expenses to support ongoing Dupixent launches. Based on our current projections, we anticipate increasing profitability from the commercialization of non-I\/O antibodies going forward.","Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $589 million for the second quarter of 2019, compared to $470 million for the second quarter 2018 and essentially flat compared to the $583 million recognized in the first quarter of 2019, driven by continued investment in our research platform and pipeline.","Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total non-GAAP R&D expense, less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, was $423 million for second quarter 2019 compared to $286 million for the second quarter 2018 and $419 million for first quarter 2019.","The year-over-year increase is primarily driven by higher spend associated with our earlier-stage pipeline, clinical trial and manufacturing costs to support ongoing development programs and lower Sanofi reimbursement as a result of the amended Immuno-oncology Discovery and Development Agreement. Based on the current progress in our R&D pipeline and outlook for the remainder of the year, we are tightening our previous full year 2019 guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to $1.625 billion to $1.71 billion.","Next, non-GAAP SG&A expense was $375 million for the second quarter of 2019 a 16% year-over-year increase driven by commercialization-related expenses to support ongoing Dupixent launches and EYLEA's recent launch in diabetic retinopathy. We are tightening our previous full year 2019 guidance for non-GAAP SG&A to $1.53 billion to $1.58 billion.","Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue was $123 million for the second quarter of 2019. We are lowering and tightening our previous full year 2019 guidance for Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses to $500 million to $530 million.","Turning now to taxes. For the second quarter, our GAAP effective tax rate was 14.1%. We are reaffirming our full year 2019 GAAP effective tax rate guidance of 11% to 13%. To assist with modeling, principally, due to the Alnylam $400 million upfront exclusion from non-GAAP earnings, the full year 2019 non-GAAP tax rate will be higher than our full year 2019 GAAP effective tax rate.","Turning next to our balance sheet and cash flow. Regeneron ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities of $5.55 billion. Through the first six months of the year, we generated free cash flow of $916 million. We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.","Capital expenditures were $95 million for the quarter and $169 million year-to-date. Based on our updated capital spend plan and year-to-date spending levels, we are lowering and tightening our full year 2019 capital expenditure guidance to $380 million to $420 million. In conclusion, we're very pleased with our operational and financial performance this quarter. These financial results, along with the execution on our R&D and commercial strategies position us for continued long-term growth.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Justin.","Justin Holko","Thank you, Bob. That concludes our prepared remarks and we'd now like to open the call for Q& A. To ensure that we are able to address as many callers as possible, please limit your questions to one or two question. Please go ahead, John.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Carter Gould from UBS.","Carter Gould","Good morning. Congrats on the Sanofi collaboration tipping over into profitability and thanks for taking the question. One for George. I want to ask around the CD20 antigen loss you observed at disease progression and some of the patients responding to 1979. I was just interested in your current understanding of the mechanism; earlier given I believe this was rare with RITUXAN and how you see this potentially influencing how 1979 maybe positioned in the treatment paradigm? Thank you.","George Yancopoulos","I have to admit I didn't quite get your question there.","Carter Gould","Okay. It was around the CD20 antigen loss you saw in some of the patients treated and how you see that ultimately potentially influencing how the drug gets positioned in the treatment paradigm if it potentially takes away salvage options?","George Yancopoulos","Right. Well, I think that we have seen antigen loss to both CD20 and also CD19 which has occurred. So far it doesn't seem to have in these very late-stage patients dramatically affected the response rates or the durability. So, we're seeing the rates that we responded -- we reported. So, doesn't seem it's at this point a major issue.","Carter Gould","Thank you.","Justin Holko","Next question John.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Harrison","Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to ask on the initial BCMA data that you expect to present towards the end of this year. I mean how should we think about relevant comparisons here? Is this something you would compare against CAR-T against BiTEs, I'm just wondering how we should think about that and what the goal here is? Thanks.","Leonard Schleifer","Maybe George has more comments, but what I would say best thing is probably to wait for that data, but the way Sanofi and Regeneron and thinking about that in this part of the collaboration is that obviously if we can deliver anything close to what a bispecific can deliver then -- that a CAR-T can deliver, excuse me, then a bispecific being off-the-shelf and pharmaceutical like drug, pricing, consideration and things like that should obviously have a huge advantage in the marketplace.","So, we would consider our competition more of things like the BiTEs and what have you. Obviously, we have already started out with long-lasting molecules with a well-designed; we make them straightforwardly through a proprietary approach. So, we think that we can compete and what you should be looking for is what kind of activity we can deliver. So, maybe we should just wait for that.","George Yancopoulos","Yes. And I think just to add that I think that obviously, we're hoping that it's going to confirm that our class of CD3 bispecifics are reproducibility sort of top-of-the-class in terms of producing the sort of efficacy that we've already seen with our CD20xCD3 bispecific. And so that's what we're hoping for.","In addition to that we just want to point out that both with our own pipeline and obviously, with our partners' pipeline, there are myriad of combination opportunities. So, it's just sort of the beginning to show the activity with the BCMA bispecific. We can then add to it with the right set of combinations with components that both sides in the collaboration have to offer that we're very excited about, including for example our co-stims, which we have quite a few that could potentially collaborate clinically with the BCMAxCD3 bispecific.","Justin Holko","Thank you, Matthew. Next question?","Operator","Our next question is from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn","Hi. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on the antibody JV profitability as well. Maybe just two on Dupixent, first on, I was wondering if you could share your thoughts about relevant size of the 6 to 11 year-old population here at atopic derm? And then would the pace of uptake be similar or faster than what we saw with adults in your view? And then on Dupi for grass allergy thanks for the additional data, just wondering next steps there for that program, if you could give us any more color on the forward? Thank you.","Leonard Schleifer","So why don't we take the Dupi \u2013 Marion will take the commercial question first.","Marion McCourt","Sure. And Terence just to clarify your question on Dupixent you were talking about the European population or you were you talking about the U.S. population?","Terence Flynn","Sure. I mean, both would be great, but I know you got the data this morning from 6 to 11. And again, I don't think you guys have characterized how big those groups are.","Marion McCourt","Right, right. So what I wanted to share with you, obviously with the atopic dermatitis population in the U.S. for adults, we've said about 300,000 to 400,000 patients are at greatest need of therapy. And I just want to lend the context that at this point, what we're very pleased with uptake and the difference that DUPIXENT is making in the lives of patients we've probably only so far reached about high-teens about 18% of the adult patient population. We're excited about the adolescence launch and we're seeing nice uptake there early days, again, a lot more work to do.","We haven't yet given a characterization in the size of the pediatric population, but certainly will on the future as we get further into the data readouts and preparedness for launch of that indication, which certainly I can confirm we'll be prepared to launch as soon as we have the FDA approval.","Leonard Schleifer","Yeah. Just a slight follow-up, the uptake of the cream \u2013Eucrisa was fairly brisk, I think in some of the younger patients. So we think that market is really one of great unmet medical need. And as George said, these are children we studied that had 60%, 60% of their body covered with lesions, having all sorts of effect on their mental health, their sleeping, their family, they are just building quality of life. So I think that in the severe patients, we would expect pretty brisk uptake, but it's going to obviously take some work, because you're treating children with a biologic, we still have to constantly educate and remind people what George said in contradistinction to other Biologics, where you see an increase infection or \u2013 listen carefully George mentioned that it was actually numerically decreased consistent that we've seen this cause a severe moderately severe atopic dermatitis patients and numerical decrease. So we think that as people get more and more and more comfortable with the safety and efficacy, this will move lower and lower down into the age groups as we get approval. George, maybe you want to turn to the grass allergy and what's next?","George Yancopoulos","Yeah. So as I mentioned, we were very excited by the potential of Dupixent to apparently increase the tolerability of skit therapy. I may have misspoke, obviously it was 25 patients per arm, and I said 30 patients discontinuous \u2013 30% of the patients discontinued on SCID which is I think is about normal. Obviously, if you do the math, that's about eight patients. That's the exact number. But in any case \u2013 so as we noted, the ability of desensitization therapy to work is real, but it takes time and it comes at the cost of tolerability and many patients not being able to get through the therapy because of the severe allergic reactions. So it is obviously very exciting to see Dupixent have such an apparent benefit, albeit in an early study in small numbers, on the tolerability of the SCID therapy.","We have a number of other ongoing programs in studying allergy and I think we're going to be looking at all these together before we come up with our formal strategy of how to go forward in this, but we do think that this is a very exciting area that can make a lot of difference to a lot of people who are suffering from allergies. So we're pretty excited.","Justin Holko"," Great. Thank you, Terence. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Yaron Weber from Cowen.","Yaron Werber","Great. Thanks for taking my question and again nice results. I have \u2013 if you don\u2019t mind, just two questions, the first one on Dupi. If you can just give us a sense across -- between asthma, AD and obviously, chronic rhinosinusitis is obviously just getting going. But what really kind of led to the growth this quarter on a quarter-over-quarter basis?","And in asthma, where are you getting the majority of sales? Is that new to Biologics, or is it switching from Biologics? And then just a question on EYLEA whether we're hearing some reports on the field that there is now a slightly higher discounting program from Regeneron about a 4% and does that jive with what you're saying? Thank you.","Leonard Schleifer"," So before Marion tackles those question, I'll say, it is Justin's first call and maybe he's being nice to you. We said one question per. That was three. We'll let Marion give you pass on then trying to deal with each of the questions.","Marion McCourt"," Sure. I'm happy to. So I'm going to start with EYLEA. And let me first comment that we believe that physicians should make this choice on which anti-VEGF therapy they want to select for their patients and certainly EYLEA is the standard of care for many prescribers. Further, I'll just say that, we really are not commenting on pricing strategy. I'm happy to go into some of the other items as well. I'll see if I can remember the questions.","We haven't given for Dupixent, we haven't. It is early days for many of our indications, so haven't given breakout of business by indication, because it would be premature. But I think in your question, there were a couple of specifics in there that I can give you. You were asking for a characterization in asthma of the types of patients that are being prescribed Dupixent and we are getting the majority of our starts from bio na\u00efve patients. About 80% of our business is patients who are coming onto a biologic therapy and then, of course, the remaining are switches.","The characterization I'll give you is that, certainly for the physicians who are prescribing both allergists and pulmonologists now, allergists obviously had a lot of experience with Dupixent from atopic dermatitis, but we are hearing very positive comments. And it's the differentiation of the clinical profile, the safety, the results they're getting in terms of the patient's ability to breathe more easily, and to go about their lives in a normal way, that obviously coupled with the ability for patients to self or have at-home administration.","So certainly, asthma was a major contributor to our performance in the quarter, but as was atopic dermatitis. We continue to see substantial growth and as I mentioned earlier, there's still so much unmet need, certainly with adults. And now we're very excited to also be helping those adolescent patients who are very much in need. So, I think I would round it all up by saying that it's the combination of medications; the expansion of our platform is DUPIXENT that is contributing to this strong second quarter performance.","Leonard Schleifer","Thanks Marion. And just maybe add one thing to emphasize you said the combination indications, that's really resonating well for people for example who have both asthma and nasal polyps which is very commonly coexisting or asthma and atopic dermatitis, particularly in adolescence is a common coexistent. So, the ability to treat these comorbidities is a real advantage for our product and I think the allergists in particular who are the ones in sort of the center point seeing patients who have multiple comorbidities are really getting that.","Justin Holko","Thanks Yaron. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Geoff Porges from SVB Leerink.","Geoff Porges","Thank you very and congratulations on the quarter. A lot of things that I could ask questions on, but I'll just ask one with 10 subparts. On the 1979 study George, you mentioned that is going to enroll both DLBCL and follicular lymphoma and presumably also mantle cell. Do you envisage that it could be potentially pivotal in all those NHL subtypes? And will you be enrolling patients who are prior CAR-T failures in that trial? Thanks.","Leonard Schleifer","Yes. So, basically, the way our pivotal Phase II study is designed is with a number of arms actually each one dedicated precisely to exactly some of those subtypes that you're interested in.","So, that yes, each one we would consider to have pending, of course, how active the data and the durability and so forth. Each one would have registrational possibilities and we also have a -- in the pivotal Phase II, we certainly will have the late-stage follicular lymphoma patients, the late-stage DLBCL patients, but also we have a program where we're focusing an arm specifically on CAR-T failures where we think obviously in such a high unmet need population where people have failed everything, if one sees the sort of activities that we're seeing in this very small numbers of patients so far being maintained and being durable that yes, that could also be a separate approval opportunity. ","Justin Holko","That's two out of four prior CAR-T that George mentioned with complete responses was very encouraging.","Geoff Porges","Indeed.","Justin Holko","Okay. Thank you, Geoff. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.","Cory Kasimov","Hey good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. I recognize this is probably a difficult one to answer, but we're frequently asked, so I'll ask you. How are you broadly thinking about the longer term outlook for EYLEA when you balance the possibilities of healthcare reform in Part B exposure pending competition Wet AMD and then your own new EYLEA launches and less exposed indications? Thanks.","Leonard Schleifer","Yes. Obviously, it is a difficult question to answer and we hope to give a good answer to it. Our view is more qualitative. If you look at the brand, we're seeing good growth and the good growth is not just occurring in the United States. Its occurring I think it was about 13% outside of the United States. For a brand that's this large and this late in the class that says that the demographics that we predicted would be having a positive impact. So, I do think there is plenty of room for growth. In terms of competition, obviously, as I think it was mentioned on the call at the end of the day vision and maintaining and improving vision is the goal of standard. It's what the FDA measures you by. I think it's what most patients care most about, and we are unsurpassed in that. Our long-term safety, I think we've given over 25 million injections. We are expecting action on our pre-filled syringe, which we worked hard at to come up PDUFA date's coming up pretty soon.","So our enormous safety database is I think work in our favor. It is hard to do this, and if you're injecting 20 \u2013 as we said now up to 25 million injections into the eye, you have to be able to do that in a very reliable and safe way. If you look at some of the studies out there that have been focusing on let's say dryness is also if you look at them there is some data that's worth inspecting on the reactions in terms of inflammation. So, we also have to see how that sorts out plus we have the advantage of being able to give the dose monthly as well as every other month as well as all the indications. So I think we're well positioned from a near-term.","In terms of your question about healthcare policy and overhang, obviously we watch that carefully. We're very involved in Washington. We know what's really important to us. We are sympathetic to the notion that some have that prices in United States are much higher and prices for the same drugs outside the United States, but we don't thing that the solution of tying prices in the United States for drug like EYLEA, where we don't control the price outside of the United States makes a lot of sense. That would be a huge negative to the biotechnology industry as a whole because so many biotechnology companies license away their rights for survival outside the United States, and they don't control the prices.","So we were happy to see in the Grassley widen compromise that that was not in there. It almost got in there in an affirmative way that it couldn't happen that vote was 14-14. We watched that carefully. We're working at it and so we're hopeful that the policy debates that are taking place will not block innovation or rewards the good actors. We haven't had a price increase in EYLEA. So the notion of having an inflation rebate would not affect us. So maybe that's a qualitative summary of all the things that we worry about. We worry about competition obviously, we worry about the environment, we worry about the regulatory and patent exclusivity and so forth.","Justin Holko","Next question.","Cory Kasimov","Thanks, Len. Appreciate it.","Marion McCourt","There's one item. I might pick up a one thread in the question and this was just related to EYLEA and our indications, and obviously the growing indication which recently launching in diabetic retinopathy. To date, 60% of our sales are now coming from wet AMD. And with the expansion of our diabetes indications now over 30% of EYLEA sales are coming from the Diabetes indications, and of course recently including diabetic retinopathy and the balance for others.","Operator","And our next question is from Evan Seigerman from Credit Suisse.","Evan Seigerman","Hello. Thank you so much for taking the question. And congrats on the progress. One combo for Bob and Marion. So Bob you had mentioned that there was some sort of an Avastin shortage that may have benefited EYLEA sales in the quarter. And then more broadly speaking, how are you positioning EYLEA in light of upcoming competitive launches?","Marion McCourt","Sure. So let me take a start and then if Bob has elements to add. So I think, first, let me talk a little bit about the second quarter. We certainly have a strong quarter. It was influenced by a few factors and let me cover those. Certainly, there's market expansion in consideration. We do see growth from our wet AMD and DME indications. We began launching in diabetic retinopathy. As mentioned, we added customer-facing personnel to focus on our Diabetes indications.","There was a modest, what we had characterized as a modest impact from Avastin shortages in some geographies in the U.S. and then as well we were up against a somewhat weaker 2018 second quarter comparison. So I did want to give you some relative context there. I think in terms of, as we look forward, we do think that for EYLEA as a standard of care with a huge end market, it's important to look at growth rates as the average of several quarters to get a true sense of what the growth profile has looked like historically and may go into future. And then in terms of preparation for competitive launches, we feel very well positioned to continue to perform well in the market with EYLEA and certainly we're very excited about the breadth of indications and the profile that Len just covered related to EYLEA.","Justin Holko","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from Yatin Suneja from Guggenheim Partners. ","Yatin Suneja","Hey, guys. Congrats on all the progress and thanks for taking my question. The question is on REGN3500, the IL-33 antibody that you have, could you maybe talk about the development strategy there, given that Dupi monotherapy was numerically better than IL-33 across all the end points that you have elevated in the asthma trial, could you maybe comment on the areas where you think IL-30 might play a differentiated role relative to Dupi?","Leonard Schleifer","Well, as you said, the hope would be that there might be, to particular patients who might better respond to, for example, or would like the alternative in IL-33 as opposed to a Dupi in asthma. And, of course, we're also waiting for upcoming data from our atopic dermatitis program and also from our COPD program, to really understand how we're going to position this. But we do think that this could be an important alternative option for some patients with Asthma, just based on the current data and we're waiting for more data to see how it evolves.","Justin Holko","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from Mohit Bansal from Citigroup.","Mohit Bansal","Great. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Quick question on Praluent. Given that the challenges you are facing in the market, do you think there comes a point where you and your partner take a tough business decision? Or you think you can turn it around and achieve profitability for this drug in longer term? Thank you.","Leonard Schleifer","Yeah. Obviously, this is a highly competitive space. And we don't want to get too detailed about what our strategies are. Obviously, we said we're trying to match our investments appropriately. We do have some strategies. At the end of the day, heart disease is still a major killer. The PCSK9 is still a terrific drug. So, maybe that's all we should say at this point.","Mohit Bansal","Okay.","Justin Holko","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Kennen MacKay from RBC Capital Markets.","Kennen MacKay","Hi thanks for taking the question. Maybe one for George. I was wondering if you can just comment a little bit more on the high dose of aflibercept trials you're initiating and sort of how high you can go on those and really what the goals of the high dose are? Thank you.","George Yancopoulos","Well, obviously, from our earlier studies, we've seen that about 50% of patients can do well with a more prolonged dosing schedule that is on a 12-week interval. And so we're imagining that if we go to higher dose of aflibercept we may be able to push a higher percentage of patients to either a 12-week or maybe even a 16-week regiment. So, we're running the studies to actually test these longer intervals and see whether the higher doses will actually do that. So, we'll see.","Justin Holko","Great. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald.","Alethia Young","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a very good quarter. I guess I found the 18% or so number very striking about how much adults and maybe can you talk about some of the things that you're doing to drive penetration or is it the slow but sure process to get more people on the drug? Thanks.","Marion McCourt","Sure. So, I believe your question, Alethia, is in reference to the comment on DUPIXENT in adult atopic dermatitis. And I do -- yes, just to give a context, but my comment is to make a point that while certainly many adults that had very, very difficult moderate-to-severe disease are now being treated, there is tremendous potential for us to do more with DUPIXENT to help appropriate adults in need of therapy.","And to your characterization, I do think that DUPIXENT is gaining momentum in atopic dermatitis, certainly in other indications as well. And it's not unusual for physicians first to prescribe to those patients who are their toughest patients, the most severe patients. We're seeing pickup in breadth and depth of physician prescribing of DUPIXENT and we also are seeing more moderate, moderate-to-severe patients being treated. So, it's encouraging because DUPIXENT is helping these patients in a way that we hear time and time again is transformational to their lives and as well transformational to the lives of the physicians who are treating them.","Justin Holko","I think we have time for two more questions John.","Operator","Our next one is from Hartaj Singh from Oppenheimer & Co.","Hartaj Singh","Great. Thank you for my question. I have one question on Libtayo. You had a stronger number than we expected for the second question. I think this PD-1 had gotten some really good data and just from what we've heard is being really accepted broadly. Can you just give us some color on the commercial rollout and how that has progressed? And any thoughts also on the lung cancer products you've got ongoing? Thank you.","Marion McCourt","So, I will give some comments related to commercial performance and with Libtayo, we certainly are making inroads to become the standard-of-care for CSCC patients as described in our label.","Approximately 90% of new patient starts in CSCC within the anti-PD-1, PD-L1 class are now going to Libtayo. Further, we had excellent payer coverage that is already been achieved and further; we'll have a permanent J code in October 1st. So, certainly, we've made a strong start in the launch of CSCC for Libtayo.","Leonard Schleifer","About the lung cancer, I guess, early on there were a lot of the thoughts that the PD-1 space would be commoditized and that there would be so many PD-1s and it'd be sort of boilerplates just making other one. I think that, if one fairly looks at the data, these are not behaving the same and that's obvious for sure in the lung cancer space, where Keytruda is the unquestioned leader. And so we're very excited about the fact that, we think that our PD-1 might have very good activities already demonstrated as we've heard in certain settings. So we're excited to see, how it's going to perform in the lung cancer setting, and whether it will be one of the rare PD-1s that can really provide a lot of benefit to patients there.","Operator","And our last question from Brian Skorney from Baird.","Brian Skorney","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Two quick ones. Obviously, bevacizumab almost prescribed VEGF therapy despite being off label. It looks like there's one company plan on actually filing at BLA next year to market a brand at bevacizumab. How do you guys think about the market impact of an active sales force marketing bevacizumab versus more passive usage right now? And then just real quickly on Regeneron 4461. I know leptin was a pretty well researched target about a decade ago, never quite realized the terms. Can you your thoughts on what makes targeting the receptor with your antibody attractive and how you could overcome some of the prior history? Thanks.","Leonard Schleifer","Sure. Just very briefly, because we're running out of time and I'll take the bevacizumab question. George, will deal with the question on the insulin \u2013 I mean, on the leptin receptor. So in terms of bevacizumab, obviously you can't have biosimilar to bevacizumab in terms of approvals, because it doesn't have any approvals. So somebody if they want to get approvals obviously going to have do all of the different studies et cetera. And we already know that in large studies conducted independently by the government for example Protocol T bevacizumab was inferior clearly inferior to EYLEA. So I think that the use of bevacizumab is mainly one driven by its off-label exceedingly low price. So having another competition there with or without the sales force is doctors are well aware about this, we wouldn't expect to have a major impact in the market. George, on the leptin?","George Yancopoulos","Well, just to remind you, one of the major problems with leptin and metro leptin is it was developed was \u2013 it elicited unfortunately in quite significant percentage of patient's antibodies against the leptin. And a lot of these patients are patients who actually still have endogenous leptin activity. So when the antibodies come on board, the patients end up not only neutralizing the injected leptin, but they endogenous leptin they end up being worse off than they were beforehand and they're also left with nothing to actually being available to treat them, because you now can't give them leptin.","So of course we are pursuing our leptin receptor activating antibody in that setting, but it would also provide a better alternative and would allow broader usage. There are other settings where one could have conceived using metro leptin except one who wouldn't have not wanted, to elicit this antibody response and have the potential to wipe out the endogenous leptin remaining activity. And so people were reticent to explore it more broadly in other setting. So on top of that, it is one of the first examples of our new activating antibody technology that allows us to, we hope, create efficient in vivo acting \u2013 activating antibodies for growth factor and cytokine and so forth. So for all those reasons, we're pretty excited about our leptin receptor program. But, of course, we'll be starting in the \u2013 in same sort of rare patients where leptin is mostly used right now.","Operator","I'll now turn the call back over to Justin Holko for closing remarks.","Justin Holko","Great. Thank you, everyone, and thank you again for dialing in to the call today. The IR team will be around to answer questions later today. ","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Please note, the conference is being recorded.","And now, I will turn the call over to Manisha Narasimhan, Head of Investor Relations.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, John. Good morning, and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' third quarter 2018 conference call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under Events for 30 days. Joining me on the call today are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President and Chief Scientific Officer; Marion McCourt, Senior Vice President and Head of Commercial; and Bob Landry, Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial (sic) [Financial] (00:56) Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A.","I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call today include forward-looking statements about Regeneron.

Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you. Manisha does such a fabulous job at Investor Relations, we should at least get her name right. It's Manisha Narasimhan. Good morning to everyone who has joined the call. In the third quarter, Regeneron delivered record financial results, an important pipeline progress.","EYLEA sales continue to grow. For the first time, U.S. EYLEA net quarterly sales surpassed $1 billion. Also, for the first time, third quarter worldwide Dupixent sales exceeded $0.25 billion. And Dupixent was recently approved for asthma, its second major indication. Additionally, we launched Libtayo, our first approved immuno-oncology therapy.","For EYLEA, we significantly strengthened the franchise through a recently expanded label for less frequent dosing and the potential for a new indication in diabetic retinopathy. And we expect to advance a high-dose formulation of aflibercept into the clinic in the first half of next year.","Libtayo, our first commercial entry into the exciting and fast-evolving area of immuno-oncology, is the foundation upon which we intend to build with multiple additional agents and approaches in many different cancer settings. We have described Dupixent as a pipeline and a product, and it is living up to that potential. Compared to other approved biologics for asthma, Dupixent has a differentiated profile and label.","The recent asthma approval, together with the ongoing robust launch in atopic dermatitis, positive Phase 3 results in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and positive Phase 2 results in eosinophilic esophagitis, validate the scientific hypothesis that the IL-4\/IL-13 pathway is responsible for a spectrum of allergic or Type 2 diseases. You'll hear more from Marion about the launch of Dupixent in asthma and atopic dermatitis, and George will update you on our clinical programs.","We have continued to make steady progress with our other commercialized products. From Praluent, our LDL cholesterol-lowering PCSK9 antibody, we anticipate that the U.S. treatment guidelines for lipid lowering will be updated shortly. We hope the updated guidelines will facilitate greater access and support increased use of the PCSK9 class. Although it gets drowned out in the debate about drug prices, the fact remains that cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the United States, and high LDL cholesterol is a major cause of cardiovascular disease.","Our early pipeline continues to progress. At the beginning of the year, we set a goal of advancing four to six new molecules into clinical development. I'm happy to report that to-date, we have already advanced four new molecules into clinical development. These include a bispecific antibody for ovarian cancer, a new antibody for pain, a leptin receptor agonist, and an antibody to CTLA4.","We also expect to advance into the clinic by year-end, a BCMA CD3 bispecific antibody for multiple myeloma. We now have seven approved drugs and our clinical pipeline has 20 product candidates spanning a range of therapeutic areas. All of these molecules were discovered by our scientists. With that, I will now turn the call over to George.","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Len, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin with EYLEA. In August, our supplemental Biological (sic) [Biologics License] (06:00) Application or sBLA was approved for EYLEA dosed every 12 weeks after one year of effective therapy in wet age-related macular degeneration or wet AMD. EYLEA is now the only anti-VEGF drug for the treatment of wet AMD that offers the flexibility to optimally treat patients, regardless of whether they require fixed-interval dosing of 4, 8 or 12 weeks.","In September, the FDA accepted our sBLA for EYLEA in diabetic retinopathy with an action date in May 2019. This sBLA was based on the data from the Phase 3 PANORAMA study, which investigated the use of EYLEA in patients with mildly severe to severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema. Positive six-month top line results from PANORAMA were announced in March 2018.","Just a couple of weeks ago, we announced positive data from the one-year time point from this same study. On the primary endpoint at one year after initial monthly dosing period, followed by every 8- or every 16-week treatment, 80% and 65% of patients, respectively, experienced a two-step or greater improvement from baseline on the diabetic retinopathy severity scale compared to only 15% of patients receiving sham injections.","The results were highly statistically significant, with the p-value less than 0.0001. Regarding the two key secondary endpoints which achieved statistical significance based on the pre-specified hierarchical analysis, compared to sham injection, treatment with EYLEA reduced vision-threatening complications by 82% to 85%, and the development of center-involved diabetic macular edema by 68% to 74%.","Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in working age adults in the United States. What is perhaps underappreciated is the rate at which non-symptomatic patients can develop serious complications that threaten their vision. Strikingly, within the first year of PANORAMA, more than one-third of previously asymptomatic diabetic retinopathy patients who were treated with EYLEA went on to develop vision threatening complications or diabetic macular edema. EYLEA markedly reduced these complications and reversed the anatomic severity of the disease. These results underscore the potential value of earlier intervention in diabetic retinopathy.","In addition to data from our PANORAMA study, the government-funded Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network is conducting its own Phase 3 study of EYLEA in diabetic retinopathy. This study known as Protocol W is ongoing.","Turning to the competitive landscape. In our view, there isn't any product in the near-term that can have a substantially different safety and efficacy profile compared to EYLEA. EYLEA is approved in a number of retinal diseases, and has demonstrated safety and efficacy with over 20 million doses administered worldwide. It doesn't appear that any potential near-term entrants can provide substantially different dosing flexibility, duration or visual gains than are already achievable with EYLEA.","Nevertheless, we believe that higher dose formulations of aflibercept might provide additional or longer-lasting benefit, and thus, we are advancing this program into clinical development in 2019.","I'd now like to turn to Dupixent, our antibody that blocks the interleukin-4, interleukin-13 pathway that we are investigating in multiple allergic diseases. Just a couple of weeks ago, Dupixent was approved by the FDA for its second major indication: asthma in adults and in adolescents. Dupixent is approved for two important types of patients with uncontrolled asthma: Those with moderate-to-severe disease with an eosinophilic phenotype and those who require oral corticosteroids to manage their disease. With Dupixent, the newest biologic approved for the treatment of asthma, we have demonstrated an unprecedented profile.","As noted in our label, in our pivotal studies of patients with moderate-to-severe eosinophilic asthma, we reduced severe exacerbations by up to 67% compared to placebo, and increased FEV1, a measure of lung function critical in asthma, by 29% to 33% compared to 14% to 16% from placebo.","In addition, Dupixent is the only biological approved for oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma regardless of the eosinophilic phenotype, and the only asthma biological that offers patients self-administration. The U.S. launch in asthma is under way, as you will hear from Marion.","Our regulatory application for asthma is currently under review by European regulators. We expect a decision in the second quarter of 2019. In terms of ongoing clinical development of Dupixent in asthma, we are currently enrolling patients between ages of 6 and 11 years, and are planning a separate Phase 3 study in patients aged six months to five years.","In October, we announced that in two Phase 3 studies of Dupixent in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, Dupixent significantly reduced nasal polyp size, nasal congestion severity, and need for systemic corticosteroid and\/or surgery. Patients with inadequate control of disease struggle with pain, nasal discharge, the inability to smell and difficulty breathing. The current standard of care, which includes the use of oral and internasal corticosteroids often, along with surgery, is often inadequate. These are the first pivotal trial results in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps showing that interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 are key drivers of this disease. Of note, more than three-quarters of patients in these trials also suffer from other Type 2 inflammatory conditions, including asthma, allergic rhinitis, and NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease.","In a pre-specified group of patients with co-morbid asthma, Dupixent significantly improved lung function asthma control, providing the first evidence that Dupixent can treat inflammation from the upper to the lower airway in the same patient. Detailed results for the nasal polyp size will be presented in a future of medical conference. We intend to make a regulatory submission to the FDA in this indication in the first quarter of 2019.","Dupixent has now demonstrated late-stage safety and efficacy in three allergic or atopic or Type 2 inflammatory diseases: atopic dermatitis, asthma, and now, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. As we have observed in our studies, patient with one such condition often suffer from allergic diseases as well \u2013 other allergic diseases.","We are committed to extending Dupixent's approval into younger age groups and geographies, and broadening it to additional Type 2 allergic indications. In atopic dermatitis, we recently reported positive data for our Phase 3 study of Dupixent in adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. These results were the basis of a regulatory submission in the U.S. for patients between the ages of 12 and 17 years.","This morning, we announced that the FDA has accepted for prior review, the sBLA for Dupixent in adolescent patients 12 to 17 years of age with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, whose disease was inadequately controlled with topical therapies or for whom topical treatment was medically inadvisable. Currently, there are no FDA-approved systemic biologic medicines to treat adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.","The target date for the FDA decision is March 11, 2019. We're also currently conducting studies in younger patients between the ages of six months and five years, as well as in patients between the ages of 6 and 11 years. In terms of other diseases, we initiated our Phase 2\/3 study for dupilumab in adults and adolescents with eosinophilic esophagitis.","We also recently started our Phase 2 study of dupilumab in peanut allergy. This program is being conducted in collaboration with Aimmune Therapeutics. A Phase 2 study of dupilumab for grass allergy is currently underway and a Phase 2\/3 study in COPD is being planned.","We view our interleukin-33 program as a complement to Dupixent. The Regeneron Genetics Center, in collaboration with Geisinger Health System and the U. K. Biobank, has confirmed and extended observations linking the interleukin-33 pathway to both COPD and asthma. We are studying our interleukin-33 antibody both as monotherapy, as well as in combination with Dupixent and asthma, where we have three trials in progress, and in COPD where we have one. We plan by year-end to initiate two Phase 2 studies in atopic dermatitis. One will be anti-IL-33 monotherapy, and the other will combine anti-IL-33 with Dupixent.","I would now like to switch to the very exciting field of immuno-oncology, which continues to be an area of focus for us and where we have recently made important strides. At the end of September, Libtayo, the brand name of cemiplimab-rwlc, became not only the first PD-1 antibody approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC, but the first treatment of any kind ever approved for this cancer. The response rate for this very high unmet need cancer setting were among the highest ever reported for a PD-1 treatment in a solid tumor.","Outside the United States, a regulatory application for Libtayo is being reviewed by the European Medicines Agency with the decision expected in the first half of 2019. There are currently no EMA-approved treatments for advanced cutaneous cell carcinoma. As we have stated before, we consider non-small cell lung cancer being an important potential indication for Libtayo. Our Phase 3 program in non-small cell lung cancer is enrolling as planned.","Based on our review of emerging data in this evolving field, and as we had indicated on our last quarterly call, we have doubled the size of our trial comparing Libtayo monotherapy to chemotherapy in PD-L1 high patients from 300 patients to approximately 700 patients. We are also conducting Phase 3 studies of Libtayo in second-line non-small cell lung cancer and in combination with chemotherapy with an anti-CTLA-4 antibody in first line. While these things are being conducted with the commercially available CTLA-4 antibody, I am pleased to report that our own CTLA-4 antibody is now in clinical development.","Turning now to our bispecific antibody platform, the leading program here is our fully owned CD20xCD3 antibody. Next month at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology or ASH, we will be presenting additional data in B-cell malignancies. Our second bispecific antibody to enter the clinic targets MUC16 and CD3 for ovarian cancer. By year-end, we expect our BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody to enter clinical development for the treatment of multiple myeloma.","We have also announced that we will be progressing an entirely new class of bispecifics into the clinic starting in the first half of 2019. Continuing on the theme of immuno-oncology, in the third quarter, we entered into a collaboration with bluebird bio to discover, develop, and commercialize new CAR-T and other cell therapies for cancer. This collaboration represents a great example of two companies with synergistic technologies working together to try to make a significant advancement in the field.","Moving on, our late-stage pipeline has made progress and I would like to focus on a few programs. In the third quarter, we announced positive topline efficacy data for fasinumab, our Nerve Growth Factor or NGF antibody in patients with chronic pain from osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. The study met both co-primary endpoints and all key secondary endpoints at week 16, showing that we can achieve efficacy with low doses that mitigate treatment associated arthropathies at least during the study period.","We have three Phase 3 studies with fasinumab ongoing in osteoarthritis, including our long-term safety study. As most of you know, pain represents an area of high unmet need. To that end, we have recently advanced another molecule for pain into clinical development, a full human antibody to the GFR alpha3 neurotrophic factor receptor.","Our clinical programs in cardiovascular metabolism are moving ahead. We are enrolling Phase 3 studies of Praluent in adults with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, in addition to pediatric studies in heterozygous and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. We recently received regulatory approval for Praluent for the treatment of patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia undergoing apheresis.","And finally, the FDA has accepted for review, an sBLA for Praluent as a potential treatment to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events with the target action date of April 28, 2019. Evinacumab, our ANGPTL3 antibody, is in a Phase 3 clinical development study in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, where it's received Orphan and Breakthrough designations.","We are also enrolling patients in a Phase 2 study of evinacumab in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and refractory hypercholesterolemia, and another Phase 2 study in severe hypertriglyceridemia. In terms of our other clinical programs in December, at the Annual ASH Meeting, we will also be presenting additional data from our wholly-owned C5 antibody program. We expect to initiate a Phase 2 study of the subcutaneous-administered molecule in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria or PNH in the first half of 2019.","Another exciting molecule in our pipeline is our Activin-A antibody, where we currently have a potentially pivotal Phase 2 study ongoing in a rare disease called fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.","Finally, I would just like to highlight, within the next three months, our Regeneron Genetics Center expects to hit the 500,000 mark of human sequence, a milestone few, if any, centers have ever achieved.","With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Marion.","Marion McCourt - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start with EYLEA, where global net sales in the third quarter were $1.68 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year. U.S. net sales of EYLEA were $1.02 billion, a 7% year-over-year increase. This increase was driven by overall market growth in both wet AMD and DME, physician preference and the aging population, as well as the increase in the prevalence of diabetes. Based on net sales, EYLEA currently holds about 70% of the overall branded U.S. and anti-VEGF markets.","In an effort to educate consumers and raise brand awareness and interest, we recently launched the pilot EYLEA DDC campaign for approved indications in select markets. Beyond the approved indications of wet AMD, DME, retinal vein occlusion, and diabetic retinopathy with DME, we see potential opportunity for EYLEA in diabetic retinopathy.","As you just heard from George, we recently reported positive data in this indication and expect a regulatory decision in the U.S. in May of next year. Following this potential approval, we plan to initiate a focused campaign to drive adoption in this large untapped indication.","Additionally, in August, we announced that the FDA-approved an sBLA for EYLEA for a modified every 12-week dosing schedule for wet AMD after one year of effective treatment. This makes EYLEA the only approved anti-VEGF drug for wet AMD with 4-, 8- and 12-week dosing specifically referenced in its label.","I'd like to spend a moment discussing our prefilled syringe for EYLEA. As previously announced, we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA. We remain confident that we will be able to satisfy the agency's request, which included the completion of a usability study evaluating a single injection in approximately 30 patients. We plan to make a regulatory submission in the first half of 2019. Our launch timelines for the prefilled syringe have not changed, and we continue to be on track for an expected 2019 launch.","Turning now to Dupixent, global net sales in the third quarter of 2018, as reported by our collaborator Sanofi, were $263 million, including $220 million in U.S. Let me start with Dupixent in atopic dermatitis. Underlying U.S. demand for Dupixent remains strong with total prescriptions or TRx up approximately 17% quarter-over-quarter sequentially.","Prescriber depth and breadth continues to improve with now over 12,300 healthcare providers having prescribed Dupixent to over 60,000 patients. Despite the strength of this launch, the vast majority of patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis have not been treated with Dupixent. Educating patients about Dupixent as a potential new treatment is an important area of focus. To this end, we recently launched a national branded television campaign and are encouraged by the early results.","Outside the U.S., the ongoing launch in Dupixent in atopic dermatitis is progressing well. As George announced, the sBLA for Dupixent in adolescents with atopic dermatitis has been filed and granted Priority Review by the FDA with an action date in March 2019. If approved, this will allow the benefits of Dupixent to be extended to patients as young as 12 years of age. We estimate that the number of adolescent patients is about half that of the adult atopic dermatitis population. In addition, we have also submitted an application for a 200-milligram autoinjector for Dupixent.","Turning now to asthma, which is the most recently approved indication for Dupixent. As you heard from George, we believe Dupixent is a highly differentiated biologic for the treatment of asthma. The launch is underway and feedback from physicians has been positive. We've only been in the market for a couple of weeks now, so it is too early to provide any detailed launch metrics.","We estimate there are approximately 775,000 to 900,000 adult and adolescent patients in the U.S. with moderate-to-severe asthma that have uncontrolled persistent symptoms that despite standard-of-care therapy may be suitable for treatment with a biologic therapy.","Currently, only about 11% of these patients are treated with a biologic. One of the key considerations for physicians treating asthma patients is to limit or avoid the use of oral steroids to control the disease. We estimate that the oral corticosteroid-dependent population represents approximately 25% to 30% of the approximate 775,000 to 900,000 patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma eligible for a biologic. Dupixent is a non-steroid treatment option for these patients.","With that in mind, we are optimistic about the asthma launch with the goal of making Dupixent the preferred first-line biologic for indicated patients with moderate-to-severe asthma. Early efforts to engage both allergists and pulmonologists are well underway, and the reception has been positive. Many allergists are already familiar with Dupixent in atopic dermatitis, and these doctors are also treating patients with asthma.","We're actively working at educating and creating awareness of Dupixent's differentiated profile with pulmonologists. We look forward to providing further updates on the launch in the months ahead.","I'd now like to turn to Libtayo, our PD-1 antibody. On September 28, the FDA approved Libtayo for the treatment of patients with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or locally advanced CSCC, who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation. We continue to expect a decision by the European Medicines Agency in the first half of 2019. The launch of Libtayo is a major milestone and the first step in our goal of establishing Regeneron as a major player in the immuno-oncology space.","Upon FDA-approval, the oncology sales force quickly mobilized to make Libtayo the standard of care for CSCC by engaging medical oncologists and MO surgeons (26:50), targeting centers specializing in skin cancers.","So far, feedback from medical community has been positive. On October 24, Libtayo was included in the updated National Comprehensive Cancer Network, NCCN, Guidelines for CSCC. Libtayo received a 2A evidence rating, the only systemic therapy with an NCCN rating in CSCC.","From a payor standpoint, we've been successful in establishing broad access and reimbursement coverage so patients in need can get access to the treatment quickly. Recall that CSCC is the most common form of skin cancer and is responsible for an estimated 4,000 to 8,000 deaths each year in the U.S. It currently accounts for approximately 20% of all skin cancers in the U.S., with the number of newly diagnosed cases expected to rise annually. We look forward to providing further update on the launch at a later time.","Switching to Praluent, global net sales in the third quarter recorded by Sanofi were $80 million, representing a 62% increase compared with the third quarter of 2017. We have submitted data from the cardiovascular OUTCOMES study to regulatory agencies in the U.S. and the EU, and anticipate decisions in the second half of 2019. We are also expecting that the lipid-lowering treatment guidelines in the U.S. will be updated shortly. These updated guidelines may facilitate greater access and support increased use of the PCSK9 inhibitor class.","We're continuing payor engagement and remain the exclusive PCSK9 inhibitor on the Express Scripts National Commercial (sic) [Preferred] (28:32) Formulary. Based on net sales, our market share in the U.S. has grown significantly since the addition to the [ph] ESI formulary (28:39), up to 40% in the third quarter with the number of prescriptions continuing to increase steadily.","Moving to Kevzara, global net sales as recorded by Sanofi were $25 million in the third quarter as demand improved. Within the IL-6 subcutaneous class, Kevzara now has 42% of dispensed NBRx share and 20% share of TRx.","I'll now turn the call over to Bob.","Robert E. Landry - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Marion, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report both solid top line results and strong operational performance for the third quarter of 2018. We are encouraged by EYLEA and Dupixent sales growth, progress across our portfolio, and improvements on our operating leverage as reflected in the reduction of our full year 2018 expense and tax guidance line items.","For the third quarter of 2018, we earned $5.87 per diluted share on non-GAAP net income of $675 million. These results represent a 47% and 44% year-over-year increase in our non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income, respectively.","Total revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $1.66 billion driven by performance of U.S. EYLEA, revenue increases for both the Sanofi and Bayer collaborations, and growth within other revenue.","EYLEA net product sales in the United States grew 7% to $1.02 billion compared to $953 million in the third quarter of 2017. U.S. EYLEA distributor inventory decreased in the quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2018, yet remained within our normal one- to two-week targeted range.","As disclosed in our last earnings call, commencing in the second week of June, we increased the existing EYLEA discount that we offered to physician practices regardless of volume. As a result, there was a slight degradation in EYLEA's gross-to-net percentage in the third quarter of 2018 compared to both the third quarter of 2017 and first half of 2018.","Effective October 1, 2018, we started shipping and recording U.S. net sales of Libtayo. As a reminder, for Libtayo in the U.S., we are the commercial lead and will record product sales. Sanofi has exercised its option to co-promote Libtayo in the U.S. Ex U.S., EYLEA net product sales recorded by our collaborator Bayer were $655 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, representing a 20% operational and 16% reported increase on a year-over-year basis.","Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2018, grew 12% year-over-year to $264 million, of which $243 million was derived from the share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. The $243 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 18%, compares favorably to the $205 million realized for the three months ended September 30, 2017. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $256 million for the third quarter of 2018 compared to $245 million for the third quarter of 2017.","The year-over-year revenue increase was driven by three factors. First, we realized a $59 million decrease in our share of losses in connection with the commercialization of Dupixent, Praluent and Kevzara; second, higher Sanofi R&D reimbursement revenue associated with our increased investment in immuno-oncology; and third, higher Sanofi commercialization reimbursement revenue associated with increased investment in commercialized products.","Offsetting these three factors is the 2017 expiration of the Sanofi Antibody Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement, under which we recorded $38 million of revenue in the third quarter of 2017 compared to no revenue this quarter. In the third quarter of 2018, we recognized a loss of $39 million in connection with the commercialization of products from the Antibody License and Collaboration Agreement with Sanofi, which compares favorably to a loss of $98 million in the third quarter of 2017, and a loss of $69 million in the second quarter of 2018.","The lower share of loss versus the third quarter of 2017 was primarily attributed to higher global net sales of Dupixent and Praluent, and continued cost containment for Praluent, partly offset by an increase in Dupixent commercialization expenses. Despite incurring necessary launch expenses for new indications in new markets, from a financial standpoint, the Alliance had its best performing quarter.","While we experienced improved operating leverage in the third quarter of 2018, we expect the Alliance's financial results to remain variable for the next few quarters as we continue to incur launch expenses for new indications in new markets. Compared to the third quarter of 2018, we are expecting a higher Alliance loss in the fourth quarter of 2018, in connection with the commercialization of these antibodies.","Before turning to expenses, I want to briefly comment on our third quarter 2018 other revenue. In the third quarter of 2018, other revenue was $117 million versus $62 million in the third quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily driven by the recognition of a higher amount of deferred revenue from Teva and Mitsubishi Tanabe, including amounts related to the recognition of a portion of the $60 million and $20 million development milestones achieved from Teva and Mitsubishi Tanabe, respectively, in the third quarter of 2018.","Other revenues also increased from the recognition of revenue related to our agreement with Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, to develop, test, and manufacture an antibody therapy for the treatment of Ebola virus infection. As a reminder, you can find a summary of the components of other revenue in the MD&A section of the 10-Q.","Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $497 million for the third quarter of 2018 as compared to $460 million for the third quarter of 2017. The increase in non-GAAP R&D expense was the result of an increase in Libtayo clinical cost and higher R&D, head count and facility-related costs, partly offset by a decrease in Dupixent development cost.","Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total non-GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, was $311 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $227 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017.","As highlighted earlier, $38 million of this increase is attributable to the expiration of the Sanofi Antibody Discovery and Preclinical Agreement at the end of 2017. The remaining increases were driven by our share of higher immuno-oncology clinical costs and R&D activities associated with the growing number of wholly owned programs. Our press release includes the information required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense.","We are lowering and tightening our full year 2018 guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense to be in the range of $1.19 billion to $1.225 billion from our previous guidance of $1.21 billion to $1.26 billion.","Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $326 million for the third quarter of 2018 as compared to $259 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017. The higher SG&A expenses in the third quarter of 2018 were primarily due to an increase in contributions to independent not-for-profit patient assistance organizations and higher launch expenses for Libtayo and Dupixent in adult and adolescent asthma.","We are lowering and tightening our full year 2018 non-GAAP SG&A expense to be $1.33 billion to $1.37 billion from $1.34 billion to $1.39 billion. Based on this revised guidance, we expect a higher SG&A spend level in the fourth quarter of 2018. This higher spend is driven by EYLEA expenses, including DTC; and Dupixent expenses, including DTC and patient support programs.","Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue, was $107 million for the third quarter of 2018. We are lowering and tightening our full year 2018 guidance for reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses to $430 million to $455 million from $455 million to $485 million.","For the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, non-GAAP cost of goods sold declined principally due to better cost absorption at our Limerick, Ireland commercial manufacturing facility. Cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing increased due to higher sales volumes of both EYLEA outside the U.S. and Sanofi collaboration antibodies, as well as the recognition of manufacturing costs associated with our agreement with BARDA. These increases were partially offset by lower validation costs at our Limerick facility.","Turning now to taxes. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2018 was 6.5% compared to 31.3% for the third quarter of 2017, driven primarily by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as one-time tax benefits associated with tax planning in connection with this Act. Our tax rate continues to benefit from the Federal tax credit for research activities, stock-based compensation, and income earned in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the U.S. The third quarter of 2018 also included a GAAP income tax benefit of $11.9 million that was an adjustment to the provisional amount recorded as of December 31, 2017, for the U. S. Tax Reform Act, which was related to the remeasurement of the company's U.S. net deferred tax assets.","As we await additional regulatory guidance and continue to assess the full impact of the new tax law, including some one-time items, we now expect our full year 2018 effective tax rate to be in the range of 11% to 13% from our previous guidance of 13% to 16%. While our effective tax rate guidance has been lower for 2018, we expect that over the next few years, our effective tax rate will be in the mid- to high-teens.","Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet. Regeneron ended the third quarter of 2018 with cash and marketable securities of $4.1 billion, and generated an excess of $1.1 billion of free cash flow from the nine months ended September 30, 2018. We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.","Our capital expenditures for the three months ended September 30, 2018, were $106 million, in total, $298 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. We are lowering and tightening our full year 2018 capital expenditure guidance to $360 million to $390 million from our prior range of $410 million to $450 million.","On the BD front, as George mentioned, we entered into a collaboration with bluebird bio. In connection with the execution of the collaboration agreement, we also agreed to purchase 420,000 shares of bluebird common stock for $100 million. As part of the agreement, $37 million, the amount paid in excess of the fair market value of the shares purchased, will be credited against our funding obligation for collaboration research.","Before I hand the call back to Manisha to commence Q&A, I also wanted to highlight an exciting announcement Regeneron made in September regarding a new agreement with the State of New York to support economic development in the capital region. Over the next seven years, Regeneron has committed to invest $800 million to expand facilities and create 1,500 new full-time jobs in New York State. This expansion will be supported by $140 million in economic development incentives from New York State.","With that, I would like to turn the call back to Manisha.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Bob. John, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question is from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Greg Harrison (41:15) on for Geoff. Thanks for taking the question. Can you talk us through the trends you're seeing recently with payor access for Dupixent? Have asthma patients been able to get access? And how is this compared with the launch in atopic dermatitis?","Marion McCourt - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So, certainly, it's early days, Greg (41:36), in the launch for asthma. But I can certainly report that with Dupixent for the new asthma indication, we are making steady progress and very pleased with initial dialogue with payors. But I'll just remind everyone that this is only our third week in market with the asthma launch. Then, as a comment, you alluded to atopic dermatitis and payor coverage. Certainly, we see the majority of the market with adequate coverage. And, of course, that reflects in the uptake we're seeing with Dupixent performance.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question please?","Operator","Our next question is from Carter Gould from UBS.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, Len, given all the commentary coming out of the White House around Part B proposals and HHS, just wanted to get to your latest thoughts on sort of that messaging, anything that you guys can do to either mitigate that front on either on the \u2013 yeah, I'll it there.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Hi. Thanks for your question, Carter. Obviously, it's tough to know what's going to actually become policy given a lot of these announcements were pre-election. I do think the administration is serious about trying to do something with drug pricing. But whether or not they will be able to get in a demonstration pricing which covers a large fraction of the country starting in the year 2020 with international reference pricing, I think that's a wide, big, open \u2013 big question mark at this time.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I'm curious how you're looking at the market opportunity for Dupixent in the moderate eosinophilic asthma population when considering the low biologic penetration you referred to for severe asthmatics to-date. So, I guess, given those historic dynamics, do you think you'll be able to penetrate much of the moderate patients in the first year or so of the product's launch or should we really be focused on severe? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","I'm going to let Marion answer that question after I just make one brief comment. The market has yet to see a self-administered product. And it is \u2013 penetration is expected to be exceedingly low for the moderate population when you have to get to the doctor's office in an infusion or hang around there for half a day, et cetera, et cetera. Marion?","Marion McCourt - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yes. So, I'd add to that, that it's not unusual that physicians, and in this case, it's pulmonologists and allergists, will often use a product, Dupixent, in this case, for asthma on some of their tougher patients first. I'll share that anecdotally, the reports we're getting have been very, very positive. So, over time, most definitely, I think we'll have success not only with severe, but also the moderate patients. And I think that continuum will evolve over market experience.","But they're really compelling reasons why, and that relates to the clinical profile of Dupixent in asthma, its overall efficacy, not only in exacerbations, lung function, OCS reduction and quality of life, but then also the broad category of patients that we achieved in our label; moderate-to-severe patients, of course, EOs greater than 150, OCS-dependent regardless of phenotype or EOs.","As Len mentioned, another element that we're hearing that is just so important is that we are the only asthma biologic to offer both at-home self-administration and when physicians want to, they can always start a patient in the office to help educate and train them. But this is a really important factor in the ability to have broader use.","And then the other item I'd add is that, of course, with Dupixent, we're not launching a new product, we're launching a new indication. So, allergists who already had experience with Dupixent, and we already have shown an established safety profile. So, we're really excited about the launch. It is very, very early days. I look forward to giving you reports in the future.","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And this is George. I just want to emphasize about the clinical profile that Marion brought up, which is that, particularly for moderate patients, they still can have pretty substantial reductions in their lung functions. When you're talking about a biological that may be the first biological really can have clinically meaningful impact on lung function, that can really make a difference in patients' lives. And that is something that has a really potential to essentially have a real impact on patients' lives. And together with its safety profile, I think there's a lot of rationale for penetrating into the moderate population.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","John, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray.","Christopher J. Raymond - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey, thanks. Just a question on the Dupixent peanut allergy study or work that you're doing with Aimmune. Can you maybe talk a little bit in detail about the objectives of this work, maybe the strategy even? I think you've talked about being able to potentially improve on Aimmune's experience in desensitizing kids during the up-dosing period. But maybe just frame for us, what is \u2013 there's obviously a lot of opportunity in food allergy, not just peanut allergy. What does success look like from this initial trial? And where do you think that could take you in terms of sort of penetrating that other market, that bigger market? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Just to get into the science for a second, I think that everybody has to understand that the reason you have allergies is you have a certain kind of immunoglobulin known as immunoglobulin E that is bound to the surface of mast cells and basophils. And once it interacts with allergen, it clusters on the surface of these cells, resulting in degranulation, release of histamine, and other allergic mediators. That's the fundamental basis of allergy.","For those of you who don't know, interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 are the IgE switch factors. When you try desensitization therapy, the whole goal of that therapy fundamentally is to reprogram the immune system and make the immune system make good antibody or immunoglobulin G, as in George, instead of immunoglobulin E as in Ellen.","So \u2013 and when you are trying desensitization, you don't really have a natural way of actually impacting whether the cells that are involved in the response go to IgG or IgE. IL-4 blockade and IL-13 blockade are the fundamental drivers. So, in any setting of desensitization, giving Dupixent should do or drive exactly the kind of reprogram that you want that historically has been very difficult to achieve.","And in animal studies, the results are pretty much black and white. So, we believe that in almost any setting of desensitization, whether it be peanut, grass, whether it be with any approach, the whole goal is to stop making IgE and to start making IgG. That is exactly what Dupixent can do.","So, what we hope success in that study is faster ability to tolerate higher doses of the peanut during the whole desensitization, decrease the number of patients who have allergy-mediated side effects, mostly GI side effects that limit their ability to take or stay on the treatment. All of these will be indicators that Dupixent is doing exactly what we think it should be doing, which is driving more IgG and preventing the body from making the IgE, and thus, reprogram the body away from allergy. And this is just the beginning. If it works in peanut, it has a signal here, it should be applicable to essentially every form of desensitization available by whatever modality.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Our next question is from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you very much for taking the question. Just to follow-up on Dupixent a little bit. Could you just address the question of the adolescent indication and what your expectations are there? And you mentioned the population, but would you expect adoption to be faster or slower there?","And then just back to the asthma launch. Could you comment on whether you think this is going to be actively managed by payors, whether there'll be step edits and rebates involved, or do you think that you're largely going to sort of be able to price more or less at the same price as you have in AD and have unrestricted access? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Geoff, before Marion answers, we invite you to come by. We might have a antiviral antibody we can give you there.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","I'd appreciate that.","(51:04)","Marion McCourt - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So, Geoff, addressing your comments first on Dupixent uptake in adolescence, well, as mentioned, we very much look forward to the indication and helping this group of patients with moderate-to-severe disease, and the agony that goes with that for both them and their families. We would anticipate that the uptake should be similar to potentially a bit faster than what we saw in adult atopic dermatitis, and I think it's for two reasons. I want to be a little conservative in saying similar, but the reason why I think realistically, it might be a little bit faster for these patients is that physicians now have experience with Dupixent. And the product is becoming well known, depth of prescribing is increasing.","And for that reason, coupled with the fact that this is an alarming disease for adolescents, we believe it's very important that we get the word out quickly, and there's great excitement and enthusiasm in the market for this indication, for this group of patients who are truly suffering.","Your second question related to asthma and payor uptake, it's very early days. This is our third week of launch, so things are going well. There's been great receptivity to the clinical profile of the product. But I think I'd rather come back and give more detail on payor specificity as we have more time in market.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","I just wanted to add to the pediatric side of this, is that next setting (52:37) steroids, whether they're absorbed from lathering lots of it on or with systemic bursts (52:45) of treatment in adolescents during their growth spurts is a big deal. So, I think that's another reason why doctors might want to move to early adoption.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Next question please?","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Luchini from BMO Capital.","Matthew Luchini - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi, great. Thanks for taking the question. Just on Dupixent, we've had the DTC campaign ongoing now for a little while. I was wondering if you could give us an update or your latest view on the patient mix that's currently receiving the drug for atopic dermatitis, as well as perhaps your view on current persistence or refill rates. That's something that I don't think was mentioned in the earlier remarks. Thank you.","Marion McCourt - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure. So, let me take persistence and refill rates first. So the persistency that we've commented on in the past at the 12-month point being approximately 80% continues. So, we see strong persistency with Dupixent. Similarly, on the \u2013 first script refill is an important factor and we still see that at over 90%. So, these are indicators that when patients go on Dupixent therapy for atopic dermatitis, they want to stay on therapy because their lives are better.","The second piece you mentioned is a little bit on the DTC, I believe, was part of the question, and also, the types of patients. So, similar to the comment I made before, it's not unusual for physicians to start with their most severe patients. But clearly now, we're getting penetration not only with severe, but also moderate patients. And we really thought it was part of our responsibility to \u2013 for this disease and for patients who potentially previously had given up because therapies were not really helping them at all, we thought that this product was absolutely ideal for an on-air branded campaign.","We're still only in months of that branded Dupixent TV campaign. It was perceived, as some would recall, by a disease awareness campaign, and we thought that was the right order to do things. We've been in national broadcast mode with the Dupixent TV campaign now since about the August timeframe. So, we're several months in. The signs we see so far are encouraging.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question is from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Know you are unlikely to give EYLEA guidance for 2019, but maybe you could just talk about the puts and takes heading into next year. It looks like we're on track for another double-digit year of branded growth here. So, just wondering if we think that, that should continue heading into 2019. And then you mentioned this higher dose formulation of EYLEA. Maybe what have you learned here that drove this decision? And what would actually be required to bring that to market? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So maybe George can take the higher dose, and then we can comment about the market.","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Well, in terms of a higher dose, I guess the point is that we remain impressed with the fact that EYLEA has stood up with so much competition, and that no one has really been able to come up, seemingly, with a fundamentally different profile in terms of the benefit, effects on vision or duration of treatment.","And so, we thought that it was time, especially because we've been working on this in the labs for a while, to see whether just giving a higher dose of EYLEA can actually take EYLEA past what is now, we think, the gold standard in the field, and see if we could either improve the benefit and\/or extend the duration of the interval. And so we're poised, we've been working on this for a while, and we're going to be putting it in the clinic this year.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Next year, 2019.","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sorry. 2019. Yeah.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Right. So \u2013 and then...","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","I'm already operating in 2019.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","In terms of the market growth, we see nothing that will change the underlying demographics for the increase in diabetes and the increase in AMD continuing to grow the market somewhere in the mid to high or low-double-digit growth over time. Those demographics do not seem to be letting up at all. Obviously, where we fit in there, based on competition, what have you, we'll have to see how all that plays out.","But I echo what George says, we haven't seen anything that's disruptive. We certainly haven't seen a drug \u2013 even the most touted drug by the sponsor, RTH (57:47), it seems to me they have forgotten that the retina specialists are actually some of the smartest guys out there as physicians. And they can do math and they can multiply 75% times about 50% and come up with a lot lower number than 75%. So, it seems to me that EYLEA has a really good profile.","In addition, what we saw in the diabetic retinopathy studies was, we think, quite remarkable. I think it was startling to many, how frequent it was that people untreated with asymptomatic diabetic retinopathy given placebo, just watch for year, and when a large fraction of them, about a-third, actually develop vision-threatening complications.","And this can be dramatically prevented and reduced, not only improve the diabetic retinopathy, but prevent the progression of the diabetic retinopathy. And we think that, that's a big deal. It's going to take some reeducation out there of both patients and physicians, but we think that's a fundamental advance. Remember that diabetes and diabetic eye disease is one of the leading still leading causes of blindness in adults.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, we have time for one last question, please.","Operator","And our last question is from Ying Huang from Bank of America.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I have one for NGF. In the recently released Phase 3 top line, you saw the placebo adjusted rate of \u2013 adjudicated arthropathy at about 2%. And then we saw the Pfizer fasinumab at ACR showed less than 1.5% incidence of RPOA. Just wondering whether you think that this kind of safety is acceptable for the FDA and for the treating physicians, and what's the gating factor for the long-term safety in your Phase 3 trial? And then next, if you could give us a little bit more color on the collaboration with bluebird, exactly what kind of target and what kind of style of (59:51) therapy you're focusing on. Thank you.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Ying. Let me just comment on the fasinumab and then maybe George can comment on the bluebird or add to fasinumab. But I have to say that I think we know that in any drug dosing \u2013 any drug development program, getting the dose right is really, really important. And that becomes super important when you have a very steep dose response curve for side effects. And we think that our approach has been to really try and get that dose right. And we're hopeful that the very long dose that we got that is still able to produce what's basically so far at least best-in-class efficacy results \u2013 and notwithstanding, of course, study comparisons and all that \u2013 but really good efficacy results thus far, but perhaps, as George said in his prepared remarks, mitigating the safety.","In terms of safety, I don't think it's just going to be the adjudicated arthropathies, which \u2013 that probably would be an acceptable level. But I also think there's a question of whether or not this treatment will be to more or less joint replacements. There's some evidence, I believe you've seen in the other development program, certainly in ours, of high doses that you would see more joint replacements. And that probably would not be acceptable.","Our program is very carefully monitored by an independent VSMB (01:01:28), which has met recently, and advised us to continue development at these low doses, where we've demonstrated the efficacy. So, we hope that we've got the dose right. Being first here may not be nearly as important as being right because there's not as much room for error in this program as there might be in others. George can talk about bluebird.","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, just to add to that. As you know, we're continuing our long-term safety study with NGF. And as Len said, I mean, the most important data is to see what the benefit will be compared to adverse events with, we believe at this point, since we seem to have mitigated against at least the arthropathies, the total joint replacements numbers are going to be very important certainly with the competitors' program that is a concern, and we'll have to see whether our dose gets around that.","In terms of bluebird, I think for us, this is a very exacting collaboration. Clearly, they've demonstrated and they've developed their technologies and abilities to develop these CAR-T therapies. What we bring to the table is we bring new targets and new reagents, whether they be antibodies or T-cell receptor-related reagents that can target new targets that can be put into and made into chimeric antigen receptors by bluebird to be put into their cells and used via their therapeutic approach. So, we're very excited about putting together our ability to bring new targets and new ways to make these chimeric antigen receptors together with their ability to take those forward and deliver them to patients. And we think this is a real synergistic collaboration between two companies with very complementary capabilities, and we're hoping to be able to change the future there.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Manisha A.

Please note, the conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Dr. Michael Aberman. Dr. Aberman you may begin.","Michael Aberman","Thank you very much and good morning and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Third Quarter 2016 Conference Call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under Events and Presentations for 30 days.","Joining me on the call today are: Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President of Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer; Bob Terifay, Executive Vice President, Commercial; and Bob Landry, Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Questions & answers.","I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, those related to Regeneron and its products and businesses, sales and expense forecasts, financial forecasts, development programs, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, coverage and reimbursement matters, intellectual property, litigation matters and competition.

Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the rest of IR team will be available to answer further questions.","With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.","Leonard Schleifer","Thanks, Michael, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us on the call and webcast today. I would like to begin by giving you a high-level stance of our near-term and longer term priorities at Regeneron. EYLEA our flagship anti-VEGF continues to remain a key financial driver for Regeneron.","We are pleased with the continued growth of EYLEA and are committed to maintaining our leadership position in the branded anti-VEGF market by pursuing both additional indications for EYLEA such as diabetic retinopathy, where we currently have a Phase III study ongoing. And we are also looking at ways in which we can improve upon the high efficacy bar set by EYLEA through combinations within antibody to Ang2 where we currently have two Phase II studies ongoing.","While EYLEA remains very important to our business, we are equally focused on the ongoing launch of Praluent or PCSK9 antibody for long LDL cholesterol as well as advancing our pipeline. For Praluent, we believe that if outcomes data are positive it will drive greater use of this class. As mentioned in our release, we expect this second interim analysis by the end of this month.","Moving on to Sarilumab our IL-6 receptor antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, as you heard last week, we received a complete response letter from the FDA, this was due to certain manufacturing deficiencies, not specific to Sarilumab. They we observed during a routine inspection of a Sanofi fill and finish plant in France.","Sanofi has provided comprehensive responses and is working closely with the FDA to address the deficiencies as expeditiously as possible. It is only been a week since we received the complete response letter and we are preparing to engage in meaningful discussions with the FDA, so it is too early for us to comment on the expected timeline for a potential Sarilumab approval.","We do not expect these manufacturing deficiencies will impact Dupilumab or as it is now known by its branding Dupixent, where our Biological License Application or BLA is currently under FDA prior review for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in the dose. The FDA action date for the BLA is at the end of March. Dupixent is a very important pipeline product candidate for us and we believe that atopic dermatitis represents an area of high unmet need. As a reminder, we received breakthrough designation this indication.","In addition to atopic dermatitis, we are also investigating Dupixent in other indications including asthma, where we recently completed enrollment in our second pivotal study. In midterm, we are looking forward to important clinical progress several of our Phase II and III programs, which spend a variety of therapeutic areas such as allergic diseases, pain, viral diseases, ophthalmology, oncology, cardio metabolic diseases, inflammatory and rare diseases.","These programs have the potential to drive the next wave of growth for Regeneron. You will hear more about the key clinical developments from some of these programs from George.","At Regeneron, we have always been committed to long-term science and innovation. In fact, today\u2019s marketed products as well as the 16 product candidates in clinical development were all home grown in our internal R&D engine. We will continue to invest in science and technology that can provide sustainable innovation and growth well into the future.","This unique long-term focus on science is at the heart of why we have been able to attract top talent, which is key to our continuing success. Through that end, last week we were thrilled to be named by science magazine as the number one company in the biotech or pharmaceutical industry to work for. A recognition we received for four of the last six years.","We know that our industry has faced many important questions regarding pricing of drugs. This is not the forum to discuss the complex issue of drug pricing, but I think it is important to note that Regeneron is in a unique position. As the company founded on Science and committed to the research and development of important new products, we are well positioned to succeed even in a difficult and constrained pricing environment.","In fact, we have never raised prices on any of our drugs choosing instead to grow through the optimization of currently marketed products by pursuing new indications, as well as the introduction of new medicines. Our future potential growth will be driven by this strategy.","With that, let me turn the George.","George Yancopoulos","Thank you Len and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. I would like to begin with Dupixent, our IL-4\/13 blocker, which we believe is one of the most exciting late stage drug candidate in the industry. We are investigating Dupixent in a wide variety of allergic diseases. The most advance of which is uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.","Just last month, we had the opportunity to present detailed results from SOLO-1 and SOLO-2 which were two identical Phase III studies that investigated Dupixent in the monotherapy setting at the annual EADV Conference.","These data were also concurrently published in the New England Journal of Medicine. These were the first large pivotal studies where systemic investigational therapy demonstrated significant reduction in the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis with an average reduction in skin scores of about 70% accompanied by a marked reduction in the usually unrelenting itch associated with this disease and almost 40% of these patients achieving clearing or near-clearing of their skin lesions.","Unlike other immune modulating therapies, there was no evidence of increase immunosuppressant and the most common adverse events in the two trials were injection side reaction in conjunctivitis. We were encouraged by the excitement with which these data were received by the physician community, as well as by patients and we believe that this speaks to the current unmet need and frustration with currently available therapies for this severely debilitating disease.","As Len mentioned, our BLA for Dupixent for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis is currently under FDA review and has been given priority review status and an action date of March 29, 2017. While the SOLO studies were in the monotherapy setting, we have also reported positive one-year top line data from the CHRONOS Phase III study, which explore Dupixent in combination with topical corticosteroids.","The safety and efficacy findings from the long-term CHRONOS study were consist with those observed in SOLO-1 and 2. I\u2019m pleased to share that LIBERTY AD CAF\u00c9 a Phase III study of Dupixent with common topical corticosteroids in adult patients with severe atopic dermatitis were controlled with or intolerant to or ineligible for oral cycle is now fully enrolled.","We along with our collaborator Sanofi, expect to complete the regulatory submission in Europe and Japan in the fourth quarter of 2016. We also plan to initiate a Phase III study in the pediatric severe atopic dermatitis population in the first quarter of 2017, in patients between the ages of 12 and 17. We are pleased that similar to the adult indication Dupixent has received breakthrough designation for the treatment of pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.","While atopic dermatitis is the most advanced indication in development for Dupixent, we are making headway with our asthma program as well. We have previously announced positive results from our first pivotal study of uncontrolled persistent asthma, despite treatment with inhaled steroids and long-acting agonists.","As a reminder, these data demonstrated improvements in both lung function as measured by FEV and exacerbations in all patients, regardless of baseline Eosinophil status. There was a 15% improvement above placebo in FEV1 and a 75% reduction in exacerbations in the overall population treated with the 300 milligram every two-week dose. The most common adverse event associated with treatment in this study was injection side reaction.","In September, we announced completion of enrollment in LIBERTY asthma quest, which is our confirmatory Phase III pivotal study of Dupixent in this indication. The primary end-point of this study is at 52 weeks and we therefore expect to make a regulatory submission in the U.S. towards the end of 2017.","We also expect to initiate a Phase III study in pediatric asthma patients in early 2017. We were also exploring the use of Dupixent in several other allergic indications such as nasal polyps, where we expect to initiate a Phase III study earlier next year and in Eosinophilic Esophagitis we are currently in a Phase II.","Turning to Fasinumab, our nerve growth factor antibody for pain. In October, we provided an update on this program. Following the observation of the case of progressing osteoarthritis in the patient receiving high dose Fasinumab, who had a history of advanced osteoarthritis of the knee, the FDA placed our Phase II study in chronic back pain patients on clinical hold.","This event prompts an unplanned interim analysis study, which had already completed 70% of its targeted enrollment. The unplanned analysis showed clear evidence of efficacy with improvement in pain scores in all Fasinumab groups compared to placebo at eight and 12-week timeframes with p value less than 0.01.","Preliminary safety results were also generally consistent with those observed previously with this class. The FDA has since communicated that we can continue development of Fasinumab in chronicle back pain by excluding patients who have advanced osteoarthritis. We are also continuing our pivotal program in osteoarthritis with final design elements still receiving regulatory feedback. The Fasinumab program will contain safety data from 10,000 patients overall.","Moving to Praluent. The recent news on the discontinuation of development of Bococizumab obviously has a major impact on the PCSK9 landscape. This further underscores a very high bar in terms of safety and efficacy for this class. This example also highlights to us the value of our fully human VelocImmune based antibody technology.","In terms of our Praluent program, our 18,000 patient ODYSSEY outcome study remained ongoing. We expect the second interim analysis for futility and overwhelming efficacy by the end of this month. We and our collaborator Sanofi have also completed regulatory submissions for the once-monthly dosing formulation of Praluent in the Europe and Japan territories as well as in the United States, where we have been granted an FDA action data January 24, 2017.","Our immune-oncology continues to advance and expand. We believe that these are still early days in the area of immune-oncology with a net collective knowledge of this field evolving rapidly and the competitive landscape changing continuously.","Evidence of this includes the recent surprising sale year of the market leading PD-1 antibody in first line lung cancer. Regarding our PD-1 program, our potentially pivotal study in Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma is ongoing and we plan to announce additional studies in the near future. In addition, we are also studying PD-1 in combination with our by specific CD-20 by CD-03 molecule.","As this year at the American Society of Hematology or ASH conference we will be presenting monotherapy data from the CD-20 by CD-03 program. Lastly, we plan to advance Regeneron 3767 and the antibody LAG-03 into clinical development by the end of 2016. In October, we announced top line results from the Phase II combination study of EYLEA with Rincumab, our PDGFR receptive antibody in wet Age-related Macular Degeneration or wet AMD where the data demonstrated no improvement in Best Corrected Visual Acuity, the primary end-point of this study versus EYLEA alone.","We think these study results demonstrate the high hurdle that has been set by the well established efficacy and safety of EYLEA. That said, we are looking for ways in which we constraint in our EYLEA franchise. To that end, we are conducting a Phase II study of EYLEA in a co-formulated combination with Nesvacumab, our antibody to Ang2 in AMD and DME. The DME study is fully enrolled while the study in wet AMD continues to enroll patients. We were also exploring longer acting approaches in this class.","And with that summary, let me turn the call over to Bob Terifay.","Robert Terifay","Thank you George and good morning everyone. Third quarter U.S. EYLEA or Aflibercept net sales grew 16% year-over-year. Net U.S. EYLEA sales in the third quarter were $854 million and year-to-date sales were $2.5 billion. Net Ex-U.S. EYLEA sales in the third quarter were $471 million, which represents 27% year-over-year growth unadjusted for currency fluctuations. Net Ex-U.S. year-to-date sales were $1.4 billion. EYLEA is the market-leading product among FDA approved anti-digest agents for all of its approved indications in the United States.","In the U.S., we are seeing increased competitor discounts and rebates. We are carefully accessing these actions. As I\u2019m sure you are well aware there is a pending proposal from the centers for Medicare and Medicaid services regarding position reimbursement for physician administrated Medicare Part B or buy and bill drugs.","We have worked hard on the policy and legislative front on this issue and will be prepared to respond on the commercial front as needed to make sure that patients continue to have full and complete access to EYLEA.","Bringing now the Praluent or Alirocumab. As reported by Sanofi, net sales in the third quarter were $38 million with the U.S. accounting for $32 million of the total. Sales data and IMS total prescription data indicate that Praluent and Evolocumab market share are roughly 50-50 in the United States. As reported by IMS, U.S. total prescriptions for Praluent increased sequentially to 60% versus second quarter of 2016.","The challenge for the PCSK9 inhibitor class continues to be the significant reimbursement hurdles for the physicians\u2019 offices and patients, resulting in a low volume of prescriptions being dispensed. This is resulted in physicians\u2019 offices reserving their initial prescription to eliminate pool of patients.","We continue to focus our efforts in improving access and improving the prescription process through the payers in specialty pharmacies. We are gradually seeing more payers loosen their utilization management criteria, including removing the requirement prior Ezetimibe therapy.","In addition, we are now seeing some patients shortening the number of months that a patient needs to be on maximally tolerated statin therapy and eliminating a specialist only prescribing or consultation requirement. Others have streamlined the prior authorization process. ODYSSEY outcomes data positive, are anticipated to be a key driver in shaping the future success of Praluent.","Outside of the United States, Praluent was approved in the EU in September of 2015 with the product now approved in 41 countries. Reimbursement discussions are currently underway with several governments across Europe. Positive reimbursement decisions have been issued in the UK, Spain, Norway and the Netherlands. It still remains a challenging reimbursement situation with some countries awaiting cardiovascular outcomes data.","We continue to plan for the potential launch of Sarilumab in the United States. As an example, we have a major presence at the upcoming American College of Rheumatology meeting this month in Washington DC. We will be presenting data from our MONARCH study of Sarilumab as monotherapy in patients for who are poor [Indiscernible] responders as well as subset analysis from our pivotal U.S. registrational studies. We will have a display to your presence highlighting the essential role of IL-6 in rheumatoid arthritis.","The European Marketing Authorization Application for Sarilumab is currently under review by the European Medicines Agency, with a potential decision on the application expected in mid 2017. Co-promotion decisions for Europe and other ex-U.S. countries will be made over time. We are currently preparing for Dupixent or Dupilumab commercialization within FDA PDUFA date of March 29, 2017.","We will be co-promoting Dupixent with Sanofi Genzyme in the United States. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made at the later date. We are aware that payers and pharmacy benefits managers are proactively evaluating the cost effectiveness of emerging therapies for atopic dermatitis in the United States. We want to take a moment to discuss how we are thinking about the Dupixent commercial opportunity, which differs in many important respects in the situation we phase with Praluent.","Dupixent has already demonstrated efficacy on the most important outcomes. Consistent efficacy on rash severity, itching and quality of life measures. In the United States, there are 1.6 million patients with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The majority of which will not likely receive Dupixent therapy. We estimate that approximately 300,000 of these patients have exhausted all approved therapies and have failed or unable to tolerate unapproved use of immunosuppressant therapies.","Many of these advanced patients are suffering from a host of related issues, including sleep disturbances, anxiety and depression. These atopic dermatitis patients should not be denied therapy. We hope payers and insurers will provide appropriate and timely access to Dupixent, should it be approved. And the patients will not have to step through unapproved immunosuppressant therapies, many of which had bought Black Box warnings. We plan to work closely with all stakeholders including patients, physicians and payers to achieve this goal.","With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer Bob Landry.","Robert Landry","Thanks Bob and good morning. Regeneron posted strong financial results in the third quarter of 2016 as well as entered into two new exciting collaborations. We are also lowering and tightening full-year 2016 guidance on non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D, non-GAAP SG&A, our effective tax rate and capital expenditures.","Let me start with our top-line third quarter earnings. The third quarter 2016 non-GAAP net income was 365 million in non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $3.13. This represents an increase of 32% in both non-GAAP net income per diluted share as well as non-GAAP net income in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015.","Regeneron\u2019s third quarter 2016 non-GAAP net income primarily excludes non-cash share based compensation expense and the $25 million upfront payment made connection with our third quarter 2016 license in collaboration agreement with Adicet and includes the income tax effect of these non-GAAP reconciling items. Of all reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings that is set forth in our earnings release.","Total revenues in the third quarter of 2016 were $1.2 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 7% over the third quarter of 2015. Net product sales were $857 million in the third quarter 2016 compared to $738 million in the third quarter of 2015. EYLEA U.S. net product sales were $854 million compared to $734 million in the third quarter of 2015 representing 16% year-over-year growth, sequential quarter-over-growth was approximately 3%.","During the third quarter of 2016, EYLEA experienced a slight increase in U.S. distributor inventory levels as compared to the second quarter 2016, but continues to be within our normal one to two week targeted range. As mentioned in our press release issued this morning, we are tightening our full-year 2016 U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance to be year-over-year growth of 23% to 25%.","Ex-U.S. EYLEA sales were product revenue is recorded by our collaborator Bayer were $471 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared to $371 million in the third quarter of 2015 representing a 27% increase on a reported basis. On an operational basis or constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 25%.","In the third quarter of 2016, Regeneron recognized a $171 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. total Bayer collaboration revenue for the third quarter 2016 was $191 million.","Turning now to our Sanofi collaboration. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was a $144 million for the third quarter of 2016. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line item primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred commercialization related expenses, and our share of profits or losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies.","In the third quarter of 2016, our share of the collaboration\u2019s losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies, which includes Praluent and pre-commercialization activities and costs in connection with Sarilumab and Dupixent was $112 million, which can be found in table four of our earnings release. Netted within the collaboration losses were the global sales of Praluent, as recognized by our collaborator Sanofi, of $38 million for the third quarter of 2016.","Before moving to expenses, I would like to highlight two third quarter business development transactions. The first is the collaboration we entered into Teva to developing commercialize or NGF antibody Fasinumab under the terms of the agreement Teva paid Regeneron $250 million upfront payment and we will equally share on an ongoing basis R&D expenses of approximately $1 billion under a global development plan.","We plan ratably recognize the upfront payment as revenue over the related performance period. The signing of this agreement did not have a material P&L impact on the third quarter of 2016. As a reminder, the intellectual property associated with our late-stage pipeline included Fasinumab has been migrated offshore thus expenses in revenues associated with the program will be recognized in foreign jurisdictions with cash rate lower than in U.S. Federal statutory rate.","The other 2016, third quarter business development transaction was a collaboration with Adicet, which will allow us to discover and develop engineered next generation immune cell therapeutics. In accordance with this agreement, we paid Adicet $25 million upfront payment in the third quarter of 2016, which we have recorded as GAAP R&D expense in our consolidated statement of operations, but have excluded from our non-GAAP net income.","Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense less R&D non-cash share-based compensation expense as well as the upfront payment we made to collaborate our Adicet was $437 million for the third quarter of 2016.","Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculate as the total non-GAAP R&D expense plus R&D reimbursements from our collaborators was $256 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Our press release includes all the information and is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense.","As a result of the recently executed collaboration with Teva regarding Fasinumab, we are lowering and tightening our full-year 2016 guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $945 million to $975 million from our previous guidance range of $970 million for just over $1 billion.","Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $221 million for the third quarter of 2016. We are tightening and lowering our full-year 2016 guidance for non-GAAP SG&A to $965 million to $995 billion from our previous guidance range of $980 million to $1.02 billion.","Note that, even after lowering and tightening our full-year guidance, we do not expect to see any material pre-launch cost savings from the PDUFA delays of Sarilumab. We will be co-promoting Sarilumab with Sanofi Genzyme and our sales force is already onboard. And as you heard earlier from Bob Terifay, we continue to prepare for the launch in anticipation and the resolution of matters with the FDA.","Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue was $66 million for the third quarter of 2016 we are tightening our full-year 2016 guidance of Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses to be in the range of $310 million to $335 million from $310 million to $340 million.","Turning now to taxes. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 was 27.6% as compared to 46.5% in the third quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings, inclusion of the tax benefit of share based compensation and the impact of the domestic manufacturing deductions, as compared to the same quarter of last year. As well as the discrete impact to this quarter of a change in our assessment of reserves were uncertain tax positions.","For 2016, we are lowering and tightening guidance for our full-year GAAP effective tax rate to be 29% to 33% from the previously provided range of 33% to 41%. Our capital expenditures for nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $361 million. For the full-year of 2016, we are lowering and tightening our guidance for capital expenditures to be in the range of $480 million to $510 million from the previously provided range of $480 million to $530 million.","2016 capital expenditures primarily include cost in connection with renovations of our Limerick, Ireland manufacturing facility, tenant improvement in associated costs at our Tarrytown, New York facilities. Renovations in addition stores at Rensselaer, New York manufacturing facilities in the purchase of an office building New York, Rensselaer manufacturing facility.","We ended the third quarter 2016 with cash and marketable securities of $2.2 billion, which includes the Teva upfront payment of $250 million. As we have reported in previous quarters, we have opportunistically reduced the number of warrants that we issued in 2011 in connection with our convertible debt issuance through repurchases from the warrant counterparties. Depending on market and other conditions, we may spend up to $415 million to repurchase or settle these outstanding warrants.","With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Michael.","Michael Aberman","Thank you Bob. Before turning over to Q&A let me remind everyone to please keep your questions to a single question to allow for most number of people to have a turn. With that operator, can we please open up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Citigroup.","Robyn Karnauskas","Hi guys, thank you. I\u2019ll stick to the one question. So if I heard you correctly, it sounded like the [Indiscernible] revenue was concluded - and it\u2019s a 12-week study, so is it possible that we could - well in the first quarter and if so or when we get results remind us how you typically release them [Indiscernible] maybe some color and executions around that. Thank you.","Leonard Schleifer","First. Since you are talking about timing, we really don\u2019t give guidance on timing and as we have with our - we typically look at this and give the top-line press releases is our typical practice.","Robert Landry","But more in general comment Robyn, we would say that and George might want to amplify and I think it\u2019s a tough bar, and we are constantly looking to try and improve on that and so when we get the data we certainly will give you a top-line assessment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn","Hi, thanks for taking the question. It\u2019s just one of the two parts, first just maybe walk us through some of the key drivers of EYLEA growth that we should consider as we head into next year here. And then Bob maybe just last year at this time you highlighted 2016 was shaping up to be an important investment year. Any thoughts here as we head into 2017 produce the [Indiscernible] market. Thank you.","Leonard Schleifer","So Flynn I\u2019ll let Bob amplify if he likes, but the obvious potential growth drivers for EYLEA comes from demographics, aging population, more patients with diabetic eye disease, potentially would come from market share depending upon what continues to happen in the marketplace. This is potential for ups and downs there. And obviously an additional indications diabetic retinopathy those in the three places where we would be focusing and looking to drive growth off of a very large base obviously.","Robert Landry","Terence hi, it\u2019s Bob. Yes, I mean we go out with our SG&A guidance upcoming we are not in a position right now to talk to that, but again we have spent time on this call and you have heard us previously with regards to the spending we have around Dupixent. So with the March 29th PDUFA date coming, we need to ensure that we are ready with regards to our marketing and our sales team is everything to be able to hit the road very quickly on that.","And again, we are still investing behind Praluent as we wait for the outcomes data in Sarilumab. As I mentioned on the call, I mean we are putting promotional dollars behind that in our marketing and spending and when the FDA list the regulatory approval on that then we will be in a position to ensure that the product is fully supported from a marketing and sales perspective.","Michael Aberman","Next question.","Operator","Next we have Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang","Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. I have a question on the ODYSSEY outcome study here. So we know the hurdle for overwhelming efficacy ratio of less than 0.02 with the p values less than 0.0001. Can you elaborate, do you need to see consistency in every composite of the prime end-point, the all four composite of prime end-point. And also can you tell us how much confidence you have in terms of being able to need that end-points by the end of this month? Thank you.","George Yancopoulos","Yes, this is George. In some ways this decision is out of our hands and it\u2019s very subjective in terms of there is independent monitoring board that without us is going to look at the data regardless of even if we hit the numbers that you stated in terms of our overwhelming efficacy. They have to make a decision about not only consistency and so forth that they are going to take into account whether there is rationale and it\u2019s worthwhile, because maybe they want to look with in subgroup or another to get the complete data set.","And so it\u2019s very hard to predict something like that and as I said, is up to an independent data monitoring, its completely out of our hand and they could simply decide for example that they want to follow and get more [deaths] (Ph) in one particular subgroup even though the overall population was very clear. So the end result is I can\u2019t really answer your question, because we just don\u2019t know.","Michael Aberman","Okay. Next question.","Operator","Next we have Chris Raymond from Raymond James. Mr. Raymond your line maybe muted.","Christopher Raymond","Oh, sorry. Can you hear me now? Yes, thanks. So on Sarilumab, so just putting me the manufacturing delay for the drug aside, there has been some news in the biologic space information recently Amgen sort of talking about running out of it\u2019s sort of pricing runway. And we have actually seen from some of our own work, pretty strong evidence that other sort of newer biologics have been gaining traction for some time.","I wonder if you could maybe described at a high level your views maybe of the changing landscape with respect to access in PBM market power. And how you think Sarilumab once it is ultimately approved is positioned, not just necessarily from a clinical standpoint, but how you think for commercial landscape is changing in ways that may or may not favor the drug. Thanks.","Leonard Schleifer","Sure, this is Len. At the risk of unveiling a little bit of our strategy here, but not too much of it because obviously we have to get to market. It is a tough environment and the people who are paying the bills have seen what I would consider in some cases almost outrageous increases at least on the WAC price of the wholesale acquisition drugs, rheumatoid arthritis where people taking double-digit increases, sometimes twice a year. To me that suggests some sort of tone deafness in this environment.","We think that we have to compete on two in two way, we have to compete with a very good drug, which we think Sarilumab will be. Of course, we have to get over this filling glitch and get to market as quickly as we can. But we think that the class is doing very well, there is some date out there from the first engine of the class where monotherapy against the leading NITNF, the and IL-6 receptor class performed better.","And there are some people who simply don\u2019t like to take Methotrexate, we have data of our own, which probably won\u2019t be enough for us filing similar types of results with outperforming in monotherapy. But giving a solid entry with good properties is not going to be enough here and we have to compete with an offering that payers will find attractive. I think Regeneron is willing to break some of the mold here and now I\u2019m getting some hints from my colleagues that I have probably said enough. So I will leave it at that.","Robert Landry","Its Bob. I think it\u2019s important though also to keep in mind that the market has been characterized by a significant amount of TNF cycling and the reality is after a patient receives one TNF inhibitor, if they move a second, we see a diminishing efficacy overtime. We have an obligation from a sales and marketing perspective when we get approved to stop the TNF cycling and IL-6 inhibition plays a central role in RA. It plays a role in not only the symptoms but in terms of the progression of joint damage. And we have to educate physicians on that. So we are anxious to have the product get approved and get that message out there.","Michael Aberman","Okay, thanks for the question. Next question.","Operator","Next we have Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners.","Geoffrey Porges","Thanks very much for the question. Perhaps a question on the manufacturing issue. It\u2019s been weeks since the Sanofi conference call so I presume you both had a lot more information. Could you confirm whether the auto field finish facility was included in the original BOI and whether its straightforward to switch the fill finish [Indiscernible] to that alternative facility. And then secondly, could you just tell us whether the inventory of Praluent, Sarulimab and Dupilimab, which presumably have already pre-launched is embargoed or is it likely to be usable and can you be selling Praluent from that inventory already? Thanks.","Leonard Schleifer","Yes, Jeff. As usual, you ask some of the best and most penetrating questions. And as usual we will give you or we would love to give you an answer, but we really not in a position to discuss the details of discussions that aren\u2019t going with the FDA, how they are going to be resolved, the strategy redundancy, what is in filing, what isn\u2019t and so on and so forth.","We can summarize by saying that Sanofi is working very hard and they believe they can quickly remedy the deficiencies that were not related to Sarilumab per say, but rather some general GMP deficiencies, which there frankly and well on their way to remedy of course we have to work with the agency and they have to be satisfied.","In terms of products that are already manufactured there. I think you should think the FDA sort of takes a risk based approach here, they have sort of maybe frozen in place those things that are actually being - assuming that they don\u2019t think a plant is way out of whack. And nothing can be shipped and still they continued to fill an used product from that facility for approved products.","It\u2019s a new product such as Sarilumab, which gets sort of shout off obviously and unfortunately. We are working with them on Sarilumab and we are also working with a different group on Dupixent, which is a breakthrough product, which has a whole different set of approaches to it.","So it\u2019s complicated, you can imagine there is tremendous amount of work, a week seems like a long time maybe in your world, but in the world of regulatory interactions and manufacturing remedies and so on, it\u2019s still relatively short time.","Michael Aberman","Next question.","Operator","Next we have Ronny Gal from Bernstein.","Ronny Gal","Thank you for taking my question. So just very quickly following on Jeff. Just looking at generic industry here when it comes to facilities the cycles improving facilities and getting product approved is actually quite long and what gives you conviction that in this case, it will be a relatively short one. And then if I could sneak a second one, 340B there has been some discussion form for that program. If you kind of give us an update about this program and how it impacts EYLEA sales?","Leonard Schleifer","We are going to give you only one question. And so the first question has to do with how do we know how quickly this is going to be remedied. Well we don\u2019t know how quickly it\u2019s going to be remedied for sure, obviously. We know how quickly, which is in a relatively short period of time that Sanofi feels as if they can get the plant in full GMP compliance. In fact, they have already broadened all sorts of efforts and resources, they have already submitted a detail plan, they have already submitted the first or second progress reports against that plan. And so, we feel that the strategy is the right one, and the approach is the right one. Obviously, we will just have to work with the agency and see how quickly they can feel comfortable that the plan is ready to go. Next question.","Operator","Next we have a Alethia Young from Credit Suisse.","Alethia Young","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on the pediatric population, I know you quantified a little bit more about the adults with the 300,000 a-day. Can you kind of frame that in similar likely nature or similar nature as to the pediatric population please.","Leonard Schleifer","Bob do you want to comment at all on this.","Robert Terifay","Yes, I don\u2019t think we are prepared to sort of go into the numbers in the pediatric population especially things were just embarked on our Phase III program now.","Michael Aberman","Okay. Next question.","Operator","Next we have an [Indiscernible] RBC Capital Markets.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, thanks for the question. Maybe for Bob, On EYLEA pricing issue are aside - is EYLEA growth tampering a bit. We had thought that DME would be as big as A&D. What are the individual market dynamics, perhaps if you can give any color on that?","Robert Landry","So, we have done very, very well with EYLEA in DME that has been the driver of growth over the last couple of years. Primarily driven by the impressive protocol p results, which indicated that EYLEA was superior Lucentis and that Fasinumab on its primary end-point. The challenge with continuing growth in DME is that there are number of patients that never make it to the retinal specialist office. They go to an ophthalmologist who do laser therapy, laser is a revenue driver in the ophthalmologist office and they don\u2019t make it to the retinal physician\u2019s office where they could get access to anti-VEGF therapy.","This has been a focus for us, we are educating, we are trying to educate patients that if they do have DME, they ought to get themselves to an retinal specialist, but this is chipping away at a habit among the ophthalmologist and its going to take some time. But we continue to see that the DME market does offer substantial growth opportunities for us in the future and as Len mentioned earlier if and when we get to diabetic retinopathy indication that would be a further driver.","Michael Aberman","Thanks. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Scotti from Evercore ISI.","John Scotti","Hi, good morning thanks for taking my question. On EYLEA, I think you previously mentioned that you are seeing a bit of an increase in gross to net and I was just wondering if you are still seeing that steady increase in gross to net and potential smaller erosion in that price. And if so, what is the magnitude of that and whether or not you see this trend is stabilizing or continuing into 2017.","Leonard Schleifer","Yes. I don\u2019t think there has been much sequential change at all in the gross to net, it\u2019s been flat sequentially in the last two quarters.","Michael Aberman","Next question.","Operator","Next we have Cory Kasimov from JP Morgan.","Cory Kasimov","Hey, good morning guys, thanks for taking my question. So, what is the PEDUFA date for a monthly Praluent and early next year. Can you just talk a little bit about the importance of extended dosing in this study? I mean clearly this is a payer constraint market today, but what might monthly dosing mean a little bit down the road? And how do think about even maybe longer term dosing options potentially entering this market from competition at some point in the future. Thanks.","Leonard Schleifer","Yes, I\u2019m not convinced that the driver of this market is whether or not you have something every other weak or every month or what have you. I do believe that people will be driven by the LDL lowering by the outcomes data that would we hope we will support the LDL hypothesis, will continue to support it. And largely driven by payers, they have already demonstrated that they will not pay for convenience, if you look at the hepatitis C class, they put a much less convenient regimen up against a much more expensive regimen.","So I don\u2019t think convenience per say is going to drive the market. On the other hand, we like to come up with offerings that are as convenient as possible for patients.","Robert Landry","So just add to that. So far the patients that have received Praluent on a every two week basis have been happy with the dosing frequent, whereas convenience is not a big issue, but as Len pointed out, we would like to offer another dosing form for those patients who do want monthly convenience. But this is not an issue in the marketplace at the current time.","Michael Aberman","Next question.","Operator","Next we have Jim Birchenough from Wells Fargo.","James Birchenough","Yes, hi guys, just a question on the co-formulated Ang2 EYLEA product. And referencing data for the PDGF program. Is there anything in the co-formulation of the two drugs that limits the efficacy of each individual component whether it\u2019s viscosity and ability to inject the full dose of the amount of protein you are giving to the back of the eye. I\u2019m just trying to see if there is learning\u2019s from the PDGF program that might inform how we just think about the co-formulation part of this for the Ang2 product? Thanks.","George Yancopoulos","Yes, we have no reason to think that there is any issues what so ever with that or that would have contributed all to the results and that the results we believe simply reflects the biology or the lack of biology for the PDGF pathway.","Michael Aberman","Next question.","Operator","Next we have [Indiscernible] from SunTrust.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Question on Praluent. Could you comment on the value-base contract, I mean we know Amgen mentioned that they are entering into value-based contract for their PCSK9. Is that happening with you, how do you see that impacting the dynamics going forward?","Leonard Schleifer","Well one thing I should mention is many plans do not have the ability at the present times to enter into these types of arrangements. So it\u2019s going to be a rarity that a plan is able to implement value-based price contracting. However, for those that can do it, we are working with those plans to establish a value-based contract more appropriate.","Michael Aberman","Great. Next question.","Operator","Next we have [Indiscernible] from Jefferies.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, thanks, guys for taking my questions. How do you think payers will define moderate-to-severe for atopic dermatitis patients, because we hear like many darns don\u2019t typically follow easier score out at scales, but I just had a look at by surface area to determine severity of disease?","Leonard Schleifer","I think it varies by geography in Europe, [EZ 75] (Ph) or PASI 75 is the driver of definition of disease in psoriasis. And we anticipate that EZ 75 will be something we have to educate physicians on and they are already preparing themselves for that. In the United States, you are correct, EZ scores are not relevant to the physicians and IG8 scores are not specific enough. So we are working right now on plans with payers on how to better define the disease. George?","George Yancopoulos","Yes, we suggest like you know that obviously in our studies on average the patients that we study had more than 50% of their body surface. At baseline covered by this disease and a quarter of the patients had 85% or more of their body covered with this disease. This just shows how severely these patients are and it\u2019s not just that their skin is covered with this rash, but this is a weepy, itchy, horrific rash that they just can\u2019t escape. And remarkably enough as we said despite the heavy burden of disease at baseline almost 40% of these patients achieved a clear or almost clear status.","Really in this business do you have a privilege to be involved in a story like this that can make such a difference in patients\u2019 life. We have been lucky here at Regeneron that we have done this a couple of times already but we think that Dupixent is really a once-in-a-lifetime story where you can really impact such an important disease, so dramatically having an average 70% improvement among all patients.","And the thing that\u2019s also so stunning to us about Dupilumab is that it looks like it might have the promise to do likewise in a host of related allergic diseases. Including the overall asthma population where they are again and in most uncontrolled severe population once again the results are very impressive from our first pivotal study and we think the same maybe the case in a host of other allergic setting.","So the short answer to your question is, unfortunately there is a lot of patients who have more than 50% of their body surface covered. Those patients are certainly by any category considered severe patients. As Bob already told you, many of them have exhausted all other options and we just hope that all the other ancillary things don\u2019t keep these important patients from getting access to this important life-changing drug.","Leonard Schleifer","Yes, I understand before I turn to what George has said, which is that in contrast to Praluent. We knew with Praluent of course that we could lower cholesterol rather dramatically, but to most patients unless they are highly involved in the detail of their care, which some are, but many to them that isn\u2019t the end all, be all something that they wakeup everyday wondering how to get their cholesterol down.","Of course they have had a heart attack and everybody in the family does, then they do pay attention to that. But then there was the push back, well you don\u2019t really know do you that it improves outcomes and we\u2019re just going on a hypothesis. Even though there is a great deal of data to certainly support that hypothesis.","So it\u2019s not a disease that people are clamoring to get treated and it\u2019s not outcomes that are readily in hand. Contrast that with Praluent where these patients are desperate for treatment, truly desperate for treatment and we are not talking about the topical treatments that are available such as steroids that might become available when you are dealing with small areas relatively to modest disease.","We are talking about the kind of patients George referred to, which are really quite significant. And these patients can see the outcome themselves, they can tell that they are doing better and we see it in our studies, we see it in our questionnaires, we see it in whether or not there is sweeping because they can scratch themselves so badly.","I heard a story the other day which practically was a group of us who practically brought us all to tears, where a little boy who was visiting his grandparents and so cuddling and sleeping on the same bed. With very bad atopic dermatitis said to his grandparents, can you each hold one of my hands when I sleep so I don\u2019t scratch myself so badly. I mean think about that, this is a disease that people really are looking for treatment.","And if we can get this drug approved, first for adults and hopefully down the road for children, we can really provide something that they can tangibly feel. We are passive about making sure that we remove all the barriers out there and we expect to work with patients, with doctors, with payers, with organizations to make sure that people are aware of this treatment and can get access to it. Next question.","Michael Aberman","Yes I think, we have time for one last question.","Operator","Our final question comes from Phil Nadeau from Cowen & Company.","Phil Nadeau","Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. Just one question on some of your prepared remarks. You mentioned that your competition for EYLEA is beginning to increase the discounts that they are offering. I want to understand the dynamics there a bit more, is there a cycle for when discounts are negotiated and there are any signs that you are seeing this is something that\u2019s demanded by payers or is it just something that the competition is taking upon themselves to do?","George Yancopoulos","Yes, remember this is a Part B drug and there really not the same kind of environment we have a timing and a cycle with patients. For the most part there is some small amount of that that goes on. But for the most part the discounts and rebates that have been offered have been sort of directly backed to the physician\u2019s office et cetera, et cetera.","We continually revaluate that situation, we looking what are impacts, we are very sensitive to doctors being have to make a choice of what to give the patients, what they might think the best drug would be because of a rebate situation or something like that. We think most retinal physicians don\u2019t do that, but we certainly understand that we will then as the markets shifts we are prepared to react if necessary.","Leonard Schleifer","Great. Thank you all for joining the call today. As we mentioned before, the IR team and Bob, the Chief Financial Officer will be available to answer any questions that didn\u2019t make it on the call. That ends the call for today.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Dr. Michael Aberman. Dr. Aberman, you may begin.","Michael S. Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations","Thank you and good morning and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Second Quarter 2016 Conference Call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under Events and Presentations for 30 days. Joining me on the call today are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President of Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer; Bob Terifay, Executive Vice President, Commercial; and Bob Landry, Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A.","I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, those related to Regeneron and its products and businesses, sales and expense forecasts, financial forecasts, development programs, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, coverage and reimbursement matters, intellectual property, litigation matters and competition.

Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions.","With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Michael, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us on the call and webcast today. Before I turn the call over to my colleagues who will discuss our scientific, commercial and financial performance, I'd like to take a few minutes to give you some broader perspective on Regeneron and our business.","Regeneron continues to advance its mission to bring important new medicines to patients in need. EYLEA is our drug used to treat a number of potentially blinding diseases and with millions of injections administered each year, it is one of our most important approved products and continues to grow well globally. EYLEA is now at an annual global net sales run rate that exceeds $5 billion. This has been driven both by the approval of EYLEA in new indications as well as new data that have further increased the confidence of physicians in this product.","Thanks to our long-standing belief and investment in science and technology, we are now in the midst of a new product cycle which has the potential to impact multiple disease settings. This investment in science has resulted in PRALUENT, our PCSK9 antibody for lowering LDL cholesterol, and additional potential near-term approvals that could address rheumatoid arthritis and atopic dermatitis. Our late stage pipeline also includes programs in asthma, pain, respiratory syncytial virus and the immunotherapy of cancer.","Our earlier pipeline opportunities continue to grow with a total of 15 product candidates currently in clinical development, including seven that we are developing independently, with several more expected to enter the clinic in the near term, making for a pipeline that can address potential opportunities ranging from rare orphan diseases such as fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva or FOP, to emerging infectious diseases, epidemics such as Zika. George will provide specific details on some of these programs later in this call. All of these opportunities are the results of investments we made in science and technology over the last 20 years, yielding a pipeline that is entirely home grown.","Our commitment to the long-term is unwavering as we invest in the next generation of technologies to support our future pipeline. For example, our Regeneron Genetics Center and our investment in technologies with companies in the areas of gene editing and cell therapy such as Intellia and Adicet, which are synergistic with our existing capabilities. I should also mention that we recognize that we operate in a rapidly changing environment that poses new challenges to the commercialization of our products, and we continue to try and develop innovative solutions to address these issues.","Lastly, we believe it's absolutely essential to attract the best and brightest minds to scientific careers, and to elevate the place of science in our society; therefore we were thrilled to announce in May that Regeneron was selected as the new sponsor of the Science Talent Search. Regeneron is only the third sponsor in this renowned 75-year history of this high school science talent competition, which was previously sponsored by Intel and before that by Westinghouse. George and I are both alumni of the Science Talent Search and we believe the program plays a vital role in encouraging talented young people to pursue a path in science and engineering.","With that introduction, let me turn the call over to George.","George D. Yancopoulos - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories & Chief Scientific Officer","Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. I'd like to begin with progress in our late-stage pipeline.","In the second quarter we reported positive data from three Phase 3 studies of dupilumab, our interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 blocker in patients with uncontrolled moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, which is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. Dupilumab is the first systemic therapy to show positive Phase 3 results in this indication.","On our last earnings call, we talked about the positive data from the first two Phase 3 studies, SOLO 1 and SOLO 2, which studied dupilumab as a monotherapy. In June, we just recently reported the results from the third study, LIBERTY AD CHRONOS, which was a long-term study that investigated dupilumab in combination with topical corticosteroids, which are currently the standard of care in the United States for the treatment of this difficult disease. Overall, the efficacy observed in the CHRONOS study was very consistent with the previously-reported positive Phase 3 SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 studies of dupilumab in the monotherapy study.","While the primary endpoint of the CHRONOS study was assessed at 16 weeks, the study continued until 52 weeks and efficacy was sustained in both the dupilumab 300 milligram weekly as well as the 300 milligram every other week dose groups through this one-year mark. At 16 weeks, about 40% of the patients in both dupilumab dose groups achieved clear or almost clear skin status as measured by the Investigator Global Assessment score compared to about 12% of the patients in the topical steroid only arm. Nearly two-thirds of the patients receiving dupilumab achieved a 75% improvement in the average \u2013 improvement in the overall skin score as assessed by the Eczema Area and Severity Index, or the EASI score, compared to about 23% of patients in the topical steroid only arm.","This was the first long-term Phase 3 study to show that dupilumab in combination with topical steroids was superior to topical steroids alone and provided sustained efficacy and significantly improved measures of overall disease severity, skin clearing, itching and quality of life through one year of treatment.","The overall rate of adverse events and serious adverse events was comparable between the groups treated with dupilumab in combination with topical steroid and the topical steroids alone. Serious and\/or severe infections were numerically higher in the topical steroid alone group. Adverse events that were noted to have a higher rate with dupilumab treatment included injection site reactions, which were seen in 20% of the patients on the dupilumab weekly arm, 16% of the patients in the dupilumab every two week arm, and 9% of the patients in the placebo plus topical steroid alone arm; and conjunctivitis, which was observed in 19% of patients in the dupilumab weekly arm, 13% of patients in the dupilumab every other week arm, and 8% of patients in the topical steroid alone arm. About 22% of the patients in the placebo group, 23% of the patients in the dupilumab weekly group, and 28% of the patients in the dupilumab every other weekly group had a reported history of allergic conjunctivitis coming into the study.","These one-year results from the CHRONOS study further suggest that dupilumab impacts the apparent activation of the interleukin-4\/interleukin-13 pathway and results in significant efficacy without the side effects associated with immune suppressing therapies. In this regard, and very importantly, we have not observed an increase in overall infections or serious infections in our atopic dermatitis program to date. The U.S. BLA submission has been completed, and we look forward to working with the FDA to bring this important breakthrough therapy to patients as soon as possible.","We're also developing dupilumab in other allergic diseases such as asthma, nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis. As a reminder, our first pivotal study in asthma showed that two doses of dupilumab, 200 milligram and 300 milligram every other week, in combination with inhaled steroids and long-acting beta agonist demonstrated a statistically significant 12% to 15% improvement in lung function as measured by FEV1 over placebo at week 12, and a 64% to 75% reduction in the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations over placebo.","The most common adverse event was injection site reaction, which was more frequent in the dupilumab dose groups at 13% to 25% compared to 12% in the placebo group. The incident of infections was balanced across treatment groups at 42% to 45% in dupilumab arms and 46% in the placebo arm, as was the incidence of serious adverse events which were seen in 3% to 7% of the dupilumab groups and 5% in the placebo group. We expect our confirmatory one-year Phase 3 study of dupilumab in this indication to complete enrollment in the third quarter of 2016.","As a reminder, we are the only late-stage biologic that targets both IL-4 and IL-13, and recent competitor developments in the late-stage asthma space are consistent with our pre-clinical data and our hypothesis that it is important to block both of these interleukins.","Turning to PRALUENT, our 18,000 patient ODYSSEY outcome study is ongoing. As we had previously disclosed, the Data Monitoring Committee for this study completed the first interim analysis when 50% of the total events had accrued based on unblinded study data. In addition to reviewing the safety study, the DMC performed a futility assessment and recommended that the study continue with no changes. A second interim analysis for futility as well as for overall efficacy, when 75% of the targeted primary events has occurred, is expected later this year.","As Len mentioned, we also have three other late-stage programs: sarilumab, our interleukin-6 receptor antibody for rheumatoid arthritis, where we expect FDA action by October 30; fasinumab, our NGF antibody for pain associated with osteoarthritis; and REGN2222 for respiratory syncytial virus or RSV.","Turning now to our earlier-stage pipeline, in May we reported positive interim proof of concept data from a Phase 2 study of evinacumab, an antibody to angiopoietin PTL3 in patients with a homozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia. These patients continue to have a major unmet need as they are typically not as responsive to standard lipid lowering therapies such as statins or even to PCSK9 inhibition and some of the treatment options available to them are limited by the accompanying safety and tolerability concerns. Although these data were from a small number of patients, we are encouraged by the additional 55% reduction in LDL cholesterol levels at week four on top of standard of care compared to baseline.","In this study, evinacumab was generally well tolerated and there were no adverse events leading to discontinuation. The most common drug-related adverse events were injection site reactions, which were mild in severity.","Our Phase 2 study of EYLEA in a coformulated combination with rinucumab, our PDGF receptor antibody, in wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD, which has been granted fast track designation, is fully enrolled and we expect top line data from this study in the fourth quarter of 2016. This is a three-arm, two-stage study with patients randomized to receive one of three dosing regimens: EYLEA alone, EYLEA in combination with low dose PDGF blocking antibody, or EYLEA in combination with high dose PDGF blocking antibody. The primary efficacy endpoint of the first stage of this study is the mean change in visual acuity at week 12 from baseline. The second stage of the study is designed to confirm and extend the findings from the first stage of the study.","Our Phase 2 combination studies of EYLEA in a coformulated combination with nesvacumab, our antibody to angiopoietin-2, in AMD and DME continue to enroll patients. We are very excited by our earlier stage pipeline in immuno-oncology where both our PD-1 antibody and our CD20\/CD3 bi-specific antibodies have demonstrated promising activity in early clinical trials. Our potentially pivotal study with our PD-1 antibody in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma continues to enroll patients and we hope to be investigating additional agents in combinations over the next six to 12 months.","We have also expanded our capability in the area of precision immunotherapy with our recently announced collaboration with Adicet, which will allow us to discover and develop engineered next generation immune cell therapies. This collaboration takes advantage of our unique VelocImmune and Veloci-Next technologies that will allow us to use cell-based therapies to target tumor cells.","We also recently initiated a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers of REGN2477, an activin antibody being developed for the treatment of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP, and other musculoskeletal disorders. We remain committed to using our technologies and approaches to help address emerging infectious diseases such as Ebola, MERS and Zika. For Zika, we have identified several fully human monoclonal antibody candidates that are able to potentially block the virus \u2013 to potently block the virus from infecting cells in vitro. And early data indicate that these antibodies are protective in an animal model. We're now in the process of scaling up for human trials.","We also recently initiated our first-in-human study in healthy volunteers in our Ebola program which has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob Terifay.","Robert J. Terifay - Executive Vice President, Commercial","Thank you, George, and hello, everyone. We're pleased with the sales growth of EYLEA or aflibercept injection, both thin the United States and ex U.S. in the first half of 2016. We've made progress in improving access in reimbursement for PRALUENT, or alirocumab, among U.S. payers. In addition, the European and Japanese launches for PRALUENT continue to progress. And we are now preparing for the potential U.S. launces of sarilumab and dupilumab over the next year.","Starting with EYLEA, second quarter U.S. net sales grew 27% year over year. Net U.S. EYLEA sales in the second quarter were $831 million. Net ex U.S. EYLEA sales in the second quarter were $486 million which represents 44% growth year over year on a reported basis. We continue to have a strong position in our U.S. market share leadership for EYLEA in the FDA approved anti-VEGF market in terms of injections as reported by 203 retinal specialists in our quarterly market research survey. According to our survey results, in the overall anti-VEGF market, EYLEA has a 37% share of injections as compared to 19% for ranibizumab and 44% for off label, repackaged bevacizumab.","On the other hand, with our growing market share, our expenses to support reimbursement activities, including patient support services and reimbursement assistance, have also increased impacting both our gross to net ratio as well as our profit margin.","I should note that there are currently a series of proposals from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services regarding physician reimbursement for physician-administered Medicare Part B, buy and bill drugs which could lead towards physicians favoring the use of bevacizumab or in large-volume retinal practices, ranibizumab due to the provision of increased direct-to-physician financial incentives from the manufacturer and group purchasing organizations. The impact of any changes is difficult to predict, though we are monitoring the situation very closely.","Regeneron believes that EYLEA is clearly differentiated from both bevacizumab and ranibizumab. Physicians and patients should not be denied access to any drug therapy that is deemed appropriate. We believe that physician choice should be preserved and alternative schemas to reduce healthcare cost should be explored.","Turning now to PRALUENT, as reported by Sanofi, net sales in the second quarter were $24 million worldwide, with the U.S. accounting for $21 million of the total. I'm pleased to share that as of July 1, approximately 74% of commercially insured lives and approximately 91% of Medicare insured lives have access to PRALUENT. We continue to see improvement in the number of prescriptions that are successfully being filled, with both PRALUENT and evolocumab generally splitting market share evenly. However, only approximately 25% of our prescriptions written actually get dispensed. Unfortunately, due to unprecedented strict utilization management criteria and very tedious prior authorization paperwork that the pharmacy benefits managers and health plans have put in place, many patients who are eligible for treatment with a PCSK9 inhibitor have not had the prescriptions filled.","We continue to focus our efforts on improving access, or improving the prescription process through the payers and the specialty pharmacies. Over the last several months, we've seen some payers loosen their utilization management criteria removing a requirement for prior ezetimibe therapy. Others have streamlined the prior authorization processes. ODYSSEY outcomes data, if positive, are anticipated to be a key driver in shaping the future success of PRALUENT.","Outside of the United States, PRALUENT was approved in the EU in September 2015 with the product now available in several countries. Reimbursement discussions are currently underway with several governments across Europe. Positive reimbursement decisions have been issued in the UK and Spain among others. It still remains a difficult reimbursement market with some countries awaiting outcomes data.","In the United States, we've submitted the supplemental BLA for the 300 milligram monthly dose of PRALUENT, and have been granted a PDUFA date of January 24, 2017. We have also submitted a regulatory application for PRALUENT monthly dosing in the EU. Also in July, PRALUENT was approved in Japan.","We've submitted a BLA to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for sarilumab our IL-6 receptor inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis and have been granted a PDUFA date of October 30, 2016. Earlier this week, the European Marketing Authorisation Application or MAA for sarilumab was accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency. We will be co-promoting sarilumab with Sanofi Genzyme in the United States and we've completed hiring of her field-based team. Training again this week. Copromotion decisions for other countries will be made over time. Were currently preparing for dupilumab commercialization with the potential U.S. approval in the first half of 2017. Will be copromoting dupilumab with Sanofi Genzyme and have begun interviewing our sales management team. Copromotion decisions for other countries will be made at a later date.","With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry.","Robert E. Landry - Senior Vice President-Finance & Chief Financial Officer","Thanks Bob, and good morning to everyone. I have several financial updates to provide this morning. Let me start with our top line second quarter earnings. In the second quarter of 2016, non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.82. This represented an increase of 24% in both non-GAAP net income per diluted share as well as non-GAAP net income in the second quarter 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015. Regeneron's second quarter 2016 non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense and the $75 million upfront payment made in connection with our April 2016 license collaboration agreement with Intellia. It also includes the income tax effect of these non-GAAP adjustments. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings as set forth our earnings release. I will describe further detail shortly, effective this quarter, our non-GAAP net income is no longer includes an adjustment from GAAP tax expense to the amount of taxes that were estimated to be paid or payable in cash.","Total revenues in the second quarter of 2016 were $1.2 billion which represented a year-over-year growth of 21% over the second quarter of 2015. Net product sales were $834 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $658 million in the second quarter of 2015. EYLEA U.S. net product sales were $831 million compared to $655 million in the sink quarter 2015 representing a 27% year-over-year growth. Sequential quarter-over-quarter growth was 6%. EYLEA distributor inventory levels continue to be within our normal one to two week targeted range, and the June 30 levels were very similar to our March 31, 2016 levels. Please note that we are reaffirming our 2016 U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance to be year-over-year growth of between 20% and 25%.","Ex U.S. EYLEA sales, where product revenue is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer, were $486 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $338 million in the second quarter of 2015, representing a 44% increase on a reported basis. On an operational basis, or constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 42%. In the second quarter of 2016 Regeneron recognized $167 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the second quarter of 2016 was $192 million.","As a reminder for the EYLEA franchise, during May 2016 we stopped incurring the royalty expense in connection with our agreement with Genentech related to global EYLEA sales. This benefited our cost of goods sold in cost of collaboration manufacturing line items.","Turning now to our Sanofi collaboration, total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $163 million for the second quarter of 2016. Sanofi collaboration revenue line primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses, and our share of profits or losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies.","In the second quarter of 2016, our share of the collaboration's losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies, primarily PRALUENT, was $122 million, which can be found in table four of our earnings release. Netted within the collaboration losses were the global sales of PRALUENT, as recognized by our collaborator Sanofi, of $24 million for the second quarter of 2016.","Turning now to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expense was $406 million for the second quarter of 2016. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, R&D non-cash share-based compensation expense and the Intellia upfront payment, was $222 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016. Our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense.","Given our forecasted spend and associated reimbursement levels for the second half of 2016, we are increasing and tightening our full-year guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of between $970 million to just over $1 billion from the previously provided range of $875 million to $950 million. This increase is a result of two factors. A forecasted increase in spending shift from partnered to unpartnered antibody development programs; we now have seven antibodies that we are developing independently, including two that are in late stage, RSV and fasinumab. And a greater allocation of unreimbursed manufacturing costs within our Rensselaer, New York facility to R&D as opposed to inventory due to less demand for PRALUENT than was anticipated.","Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $244 million for the second quarter of 2016. We are increasing and tightening non-GAAP SG&A expense in 2016 to $980 million to $1.02 billion from the range of $925 million to $1 billion. This increase is primarily driven by our expenses to support EYLEA reimbursement activities, including patient support services and reimbursement assistance along with additional investments in EYLEA's commercialization.","This increase is partially offset by lower commercialization and prelaunch spend associated with our collaboration antibodies with Sanofi. As you may recall, last quarter we introduced a new guidance component: Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, which represents reimbursement of internal and external costs that Regeneron incurs in connection with preparing to commercialize or commercializing, as applicable, PRALUENT, sarilumab and dupilumab. Again, this is a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue and is referenced in Table 4 of our press release.","For the second quarter of 2016, the reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses was $86 million. We are lowering and tightening this guidance in 2016 to be in the range of $310 million and $340 million from $320 million to $370 million.","Turning now to taxes. Prior to the quarter ended June 30, 2016, our non-GAAP measures included an income tax expense adjustment from GAAP tax expense to the amount of taxes that were paid or payable in cash for the respective period. Historically, there was a significant difference between the company's GAAP effective tax rate and the actual cash income taxes paid or payable primarily due to tax benefits related to employee exercises of stock options. The tax benefits related to employee exercises of stock options were historically recorded in additional paid in capital for GAAP reporting purposes.","During the second quarter of 2016, the company early adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-09. The new standard requires companies to recognize tax benefits in connection with employee exercises of stock options in the income statement. In other words, we will account for tax deductions related to stock option exercises in the period of exercise as a discrete item to the quarter. With the early adoption of the new standard, the company chose to discontinue its former non-GAAP income tax expense adjustment since, by adopting the new standard, it eliminated one of our primary differences between the company's effective tax rate and cash income taxes paid or payable.","As a result, our second quarter 2016 and 2015 non-GAAP financial results included in our earnings release for comparison now reflect this continuance of our non-GAAP income tax expense adjustment. This new standard will result in variability in our effective tax rate from quarter to quarter, as based on GAAP rules, these items are not forecasted in our estimated annual effective tax rate. These deductions are based on the company's stock price and individual employees' decisions on when to exercise their stock options.","The current tax-related adjustment in our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income in Table 3 of our earnings release solely represents the income tax effects related to our non-GAAP pre-tax adjustment. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2016 was approximately 33%, which is 8% lower compared to the second quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings and share-based compensation as compared to the same quarter of last year. For 2016, our guidance for our GAAP effective tax rate for the full year will be 33% to 41%.","Our capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2016 and for the six months ended June 30, 2016, were $139 million and $243 million respectively. We are lowering our full-year 2016 capital expenditure guidance to a range of $480 million to $530 million from the previously provided range of $550 million to $625 million. These 2016 expenditures include the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities in both Rensselaer, New York and Limerick, Ireland, as well as growth in our Tarrytown, New York headquarters as we continue to grow our employee base.","Regeneron's balance sheet had $1.64 billion of cash and marketable securities as of June 30, 2016. Less than $500,000 of our originally issued $400 million of convertible senior notes due October 1, 2016 remain outstanding.","With that, I would now like to turn the call back to Michael.","Michael S. Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations","Thank you, Bob. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. As we like to give as many people a chance to ask questions as possible, as always, please limit yourself to one question. Our team will be available in our office after the call for any follow-up questions.","Operator, if you can now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Cameron Bradshaw - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. This is Cameron Bradshaw filling in for Terence. Thank you for taking our question. I was wondering, for the Phase 2 trial of EYLEA combined with your PDGF, looks like we're going to see data in the second half of this year. Can you just remind us of the trial design and then what you're hoping to see with respect to efficacy in order to make a go\/no-go decision on the Phase 3? Thanks.","George D. Yancopoulos - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories & Chief Scientific Officer","This is George. The study design really has two stages. The first is a head-to-head-to-head between the three groups that we described in our call, the combination of the PDGF blocker on top of EYLEA versus EYLEA alone with two doses of the blocker. That's the first stage. As you know, even in studies with hundreds of patients in them, as we've of course seen, we have as much experience as anybody alone and with our collaborators in doing these large studies, there can be a lot of variability in letters gained. So we design the study to include a second stage as well that actually shows the effect of adding on therapy on top within the same groups. That we predict to be a more powerful way of confirming if there are added benefits of the PDGF therapy.","So we will have the firs type of comparison, which we consider perhaps to be slightly less powerful in the timeframe that I just described, and then we will also be getting the second stage of data. So depending on how strong the first set of data is, we will either be able to make a decision at that point or we'll be awaiting the results from the second stage to help us and make that decision.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would just add in terms of helping you think about it, for us, since this is a single injection of the two antibodies by the physician, that we don't have to have a gigantic benefit. We just have to have something that's clearly beneficial because the hurdle for us to move forward isn't that great because there's no additional burden on patients having to take an additional injection.","Michael S. Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations","Great. Next question.","Cameron Bradshaw - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Citigroup.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, guys. Thank you. So you mentioned that access is opening up a little bit for the PCSK9s. Can you talk a little bit about what percentage of the payers had higher restrictions initially this year? And then how did that change? What percentage of people are not requiring prior auth or reduced the requirements for filling out forms, et cetera? And then going to that, what do you think the trigger point was for doing that? And what are the timing for these events? Is it third quarter? What triggers these things and how do we think about that going forward? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Bob?","Robert E. Landry - Senior Vice President-Finance & Chief Financial Officer","So there have been some payers that, based upon the FDA decision not approve ezetimibe based upon their OUTCOMES data that have said since ezetimibe does not have an FDA indication for the prevention of cardiovascular outcomes, that on their own or at the advice of some of their physician medical directors, they've removed the ezetimibe step edit. And that has happened in a few plans already.","George D. Yancopoulos - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories & Chief Scientific Officer","With regards to the prior authorization paperwork, some of the payers had prior authorizations that required tens or almost up to 40 questions. It became very tedious for the physicians. So some of the plans have begun to change their prior authorization to be simpler and, again, that is in place in a few payers now. I think the real driver that's going to change things is going to be when we get the OUTCOMES data for the product.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks Bob. It's Len. Just to amplify on that, it seems to me there are three ways, three important factors you can consider. Assuming that we have a relatively high satisfaction rate, that patients get on the drug, get their cholesterol lowered and tolerate the drug, this is not like the hepatitis C market. Those should be long-term patients so we begin to accumulate them as opposed to constantly having to find to replace as you would, let's say, in a hep C environment.","Secondly, as Bob said, the cardiologists are not like the rheumatologists where they have people in their office who are very experienced in dealing with these prior authorizations and paperwork, and I think that they are getting more efficient at it. They are somewhat frustrated by it for sure, and some of them are giving up. Some say, well, I'll wait for outcomes before I got to the mat with fights and things like that. But I do believe that the experience of the doctors in picking the patients that they know, each PBM for each patient or each payer, if you will, they are getting better at knowing how to get this done as they get more experience.","And then of course finally, as George mentioned, we hope that the OUTCOMES data later this year will change the dynamic out there in terms of the feeling, the compelling need to go on these products if we show an OUTCOMES benefit. Next question?","Operator","Our following question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein.","Ronny Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","One second.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Do we have a question today?","Ronny Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yep, right here. Okay, sorry. Actually, never mind.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay.","Michael S. Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations","Okay. Next question.","Operator","Our following question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just one more on PDGF. So if you look at Fovista plus the Lucentis, it seems that there's a four letter difference. Can you help us frame the expectations for your coformulated EYLEA plus PDGF antibody? I know you're comparing to EYLEA of course, so does that four letter apply in this case? And what are you expecting from the outcome? Thanks.","George D. Yancopoulos - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories & Chief Scientific Officer","Well, we consider it very hard to interpret these sort of existing studies because, as I said, we've actually seen with larger studies when you actually repeat the study, four letter differences easily go away. So, we really consider this a very early field and based on a lot of the science, it's really very, very hard to predict what, if any, benefit will be seen here. We do think that our unique two-stage design will end up giving us probably the best data and most convincing perspective on whether there is an added benefit or not. And as Len pointed out, the fact that if there is an added benefit, we'll be able to do it with a single injection and assuming appropriate safety, we'll make it easier to deliver that benefit to patients with this approach. And remember, our approach here, we're combining two very similar antibody-like drugs into a single coformulated injection as opposed to giving two very different types of drugs with separate injections.","Michael S. Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations","Great. Next question.","Operator","Our following question comes from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much for taking the question. Just on dupilumab. George, could you just comment first on the conjunctivitis. Is that signal real? Are you seeing it in the other studies, for example, in asthma or esophagitis? And then related to that, could you just talk a little about the launch outlook? What are the parallels or differences to the PRALUENT experience and how might you get payers to let some patients through in this case?","George D. Yancopoulos - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories & Chief Scientific Officer","Okay. Well. The first part is very interesting in terms of the conjunctivitis. We have consistently seen it in our atopic dermatitis studies. We have not seen it in our asthma studies. As you know, there's differences for examples in the way topical steroids are used in the populations and so forth. And we have various ideas about why this may be the case. That said, even though it seems specific to the way the drug is being used in this particular patient population and perhaps with either the use or actually the less use of topical steroids in the treated patients.","The comforting thing is that these patients do have, as we pointed out in the call, they do have already a lot of history of conjunctivitis. So this is not really something brand new to the patients. And the conjunctivitis that is seen here on dupilumab seems to be of mild to moderate severity and is limited. Most cases actually resolve during treatment and very few, if any cases, actually lead to discontinuation. So it seems as if the benefit risk is really maintained in the face of this.","That said, also in terms of the second part of your question about dupilumab, we think it's a very different situation compared to PRALUENT. I mean, there is a huge unmet need here. Patients are really suffering from ongoing symptomatology and the data actually shows that this symptomatology is actually markedly improved with the dupilumab treatment.","So that it seems to us that there's going to be a lot of patients who really are \u2013 and we already know \u2013 who are going to so positively impacted in their life that they're going to be demanding this drug. And it seems to us that these patients will deserve to have this first systemic therapy that can really make a difference in their lives. Let me remind you that this is \u2013 we're talking about the most moderate to severe class of the patients here which are more than 1 million patients in the United States alone, and these patients really have very few other alternatives.","And as you see with our data in CHRONOS where we treat on top of topical steroids, the standard of care, very few, only about 10% of the patients or so, become clear or almost clear with topical steroids as opposed to about 40% on the drug. And there's not only, of course, the cosmetic effects of having these skin lesions and so forth and the associated infections and so forth that you get, but there's an enormous amount of itch which drives a lot of behavioral problem and so forth. There's associated depressive and psychological symptomatology here and so forth. And we've actually shown that much of this is actually impacted in our studies. So we think this can be a very important drug for this population of patients and we think that there's going to be a very important opportunity to make a lot of difference in a lot of people's lives, which is what should count in this business.","But beyond that, I think that we also have to remember that dupilumab is really a franchise onto itself. The data really suggests that we have hit upon here with blocking both interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, the critical drivers of allergic disease in general. We're hoping ODDYSEY to extend the findings from our first pivotal study in asthma by confirming them with the second pivotal study, and we will also be continuing to study in other allergic diseases, whereas you've already seen we already have some positive data in other allergic diseases in early stage studies as well. So this can benefit not only the allergic and atopic diseases of atopic dermatitis, but we hope to be able to have studies that confirm it to additional allergic diseases as well.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I just wanted to add one thing, Jeff. In terms of about the difference between PRALUENT, just to re-emphasize what George already said, which is that most people don't like to think of themselves as sick and they don't like to have to take a cholesterol lowering drug. Oh, I'll fix it with diet or I'll take my statin or what have you. But patients with atopic dermatitis really suffer. It's really made its way into pop culture. There's a new series on HBO \u2013 I don't know if any of you have seen it \u2013 called The Night Of and the actor, John Turturro, portrays this lawyer who suffers terribly from atopic dermatitis. He has to wear sandals. He goes to a group to discuss all this and it really has a terrible impact on this life. And this, I don't think this is just a TV portrayal. I think this is what we see, that people really suffer from this disease.","I think one last point to just add as well is that unlike most other biologics that are immunomodulators where you see in general whether it's the TNFs or a variety of other classes you generally see a doubling of the serious infection risk rate. This appears to be more of an immunomodulator that is correcting an immune deviation. And actually as we reported and as we summarized during this call, there is no increase in infections and in serious infections here. So once again this is an important option that's being offered to the patients in contrast to other alternatives which are essentially immunosuppressing. And to have this sort of efficacy with a non-immunosuppressing agent I think is also offering a lot of hope to patients.","Michael S. Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations","Okay. Next question.","Operator","Following question comes from Chris Raymond from Raymond James.","Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Ah, hey, thanks. Yeah, so just as another question here, I guess, on dupilumab in atopic dermatitis. So maybe for Bob if possible. So I'd imagine your marketing prep's pretty underway now with the BLA submitted. And I know we know the vast majority of intervention here is topical corticosteroids. But I'm just curious, what has your work uncovered in terms of the use of other biologics off-label and physician satisfaction with these agents? And maybe can you talk about how you're thinking about this as you formulate your launch plans? Thanks.","Robert J. Terifay - Executive Vice President, Commercial","Sure. So as George pointed out, there are approximately 1.6 million patients in the United States who are uncontrolled on topical therapies who have moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. A very small proportion of those patients have received other therapies, immunosuppressant agents, generally not biologics but things like cyclosporine and methotrexate. The challenge with those therapies is you can't use them long term. They've got some toxicities that really interfere with the patient's long-term use of the therapy and thus, their symptoms will come back, their itch will come back and their quality of life will decrease. So there is a huge opportunity for dupilumab in these uncontrolled moderate to severe patients. There's the pent up demand among patients and physicians to get the patients on therapy and to improve their lives.","George D. Yancopoulos - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories & Chief Scientific Officer","And to add to that, in terms of biologics, we do not believe that there's any convincing evidence with any available approved biologics that show efficacy in this disease setting. And as you know, there's also no other late-stage biologics that are promising in this area. So this really has a chance to really be providing something to patients that don't really have any other alternatives at this point.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would add also, to make sure you think about these other diseases as other significant opportunities. There's been a desire to have a drug, like a biologic, that could effect, in asthma, for example, that could treat all patients. That could have an effect both on FEV1 and on exacerbations. And no such drug has been forthcoming as yet, and we're excited that our first pivotal trial demonstrated in the broad population affect both on FEV1 and on exacerbation.","So hopefully if we can confirm that in our trial that's just about to be completed in enrollment, think ahead about a year for the trial, and then the data, we could be onto something, a whole new opportunity, which people really are looking for. Something that can treat all the patients, and that can treat both the FEV1 and the exacerbations.","George D. Yancopoulos - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories & Chief Scientific Officer","Right. As Len briefly touched upon, a very important feature that of course we're hoping to confirm in our second pivotal study is this point about the broad population. I mean, so far biologics have been limited to the so called, the more allergic or eosinophilic type patients, and is the only places where substantial efficacy has been noted. And it's, as Len said, mostly only with exacerbations and not on lung function.","So if we can confirm the results of the first pivotal, it could confirm another major hope for patients who really need these types of therapies.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And the last point on that, which I know George likes to make when he speaks about this at meetings, is that we can't forget the fact that people who have asthma frequently have atopic dermatitis and people who have atopic dermatitis frequently have asthma. These are overlapping syndromes because they are scientifically related, I should say pathophysiologically related, we think, through the IL-4\/IL13 pathway. So, next question?","Michael S. Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations","Next question.","Operator","Next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.","John Scotti - Evercore Group LLC","Hey, good morning. It's John Scotti in for Mark. Maybe I'll just ask a quick one on the Adicet collaboration. Could you just elaborate a little bit more on the technology behind off the shelf therapies there? And I guess, how does that approach differ from those that are already in development, such as Cellectis? And then I guess maybe, when could we see some of those assets entering the clinic?","George D. Yancopoulos - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories & Chief Scientific Officer","Well, I think...","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Wait, before you answer that George, I just wanted to make one comment that is, if I went to Broadway and had so many stand-in actors, I would be mortified.","George D. Yancopoulos - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories & Chief Scientific Officer","Okay. I think and important point to make is, we really believe in people and we believe in synergies. And we've had long-standing interests to be working with Aya Jakobovits who's really leading Adicet. And obviously, she's been in areas that we've been in. We have enormous respect for her, her capabilities. And so we really feel that we can work well together with her and her team. And number two is the synergies with our existing programs. This is why we make these sorts of deals. We believe that we have a lot of potential tools and starting points for making the sorts of targeting reagents that would be introduced into these cell therapies using our existing technologies such as our VelocImmune and our Veloci-Next technologies which really, nobody else in this field has access to right now. So we're hoping that we put together our unique capabilities that nobody else in the cell therapy space has together with a pioneer and a leader in this area such as Aya Jakobovits and her team that we could really do special things. And I think at this point, that's what we want to say about this collaboration.","Michael S. Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations","Great. Next question?","Operator","Following question comes from Adnan Butt from RBC Capital.","Adnan Shaukat Butt - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, thanks folks. Let me ask a 10-Q question. It lists PD1 as embarking on potentially pivotal studies over the next year. Are there unique indications or combinations that you have selected already? Any details there please?","George D. Yancopoulos - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories & Chief Scientific Officer","Yeah. So it's already been publicly disclosed that we're already in a potentially registration study in a unique indication that we think has a lot of promise for various reasons and where we've already seen early clinical activity in our earlier studies which is cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. And so that is, for example, one setting. We've also identified additional settings. That has been publicly disclosed. We've also identified additional settings that we'll be going into, we hope both potentially with it as a monotherapy but also with new combinations.","Michael S. Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations","Great.

Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just going back to your prepared remarks, I was just wondering with EYLEA, like is it something that you're kind of starting to experience just as \u2013 like what are the dynamics for why like the financial incentives that manufacturers were providing are increasing or groups purchasing? Why did you specifically kind of bring that to our attention this quarter? Thanks.","Leonard S.

Sir, you may begin.","Michael S. Aberman - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations","Thank you very much, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' first quarter 2015 Conference Call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under Events and Presentations for 30 days.","Joining me on the call today are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President of Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer; Bob Terifay, Senior Vice President, Commercial; and Bob Landry, Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A.","I'd also like to remind you that remarks made on this call include forward-looking statements about Regeneron.

Once our call concludes, the IR team will be available to answer further questions.","With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Michael, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us on the call and webcast today. The first quarter of 2015 was once again a very busy and productive time for Regeneron. Our underlying business continues to be strong, and we believe that we are well positioned to further execute on our goal of building an innovative company that consistently brings new medicines to patients with serious diseases.","We are pleased with the continued growth that we have seen with our flagship drug, Eylea, also known as aflibercept, where U.S. sales grew over 50% year-over-year. Based on these strong results, we are raising our guidance for the U.S. Eylea net sales growth for the full year 2015 to 30% to 35%, from the previously provided range of 25% to 30%.","Turning to Praluent, we and our collaborators, Sanofi, are actively engaged in preparing for our upcoming FDA advisor committee meeting on June 9. In the U.S., we have been granted an FDA action date of July 24. Our commercial teams have been very busy preparing for the anticipated approval and launch of Praluent, and you will hear more about this from Bob Terifay.","As we have said before, we believe that our long-term growth will be fueled by our ability to consistently bring innovative medicines to the market. To do this, we must continually advance and refuel a pipeline of medicines to help patients. We now have 16 product candidates in the clinic, and you'll hear more about some key advances from George. In particular, our late stage pipeline is advancing rapidly, with a submission plan for sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody later this year, and continued progress with dupilumab, our IL-4, IL-13 blocking antibody.","With that, let me turn the call over to George, and he will be followed by Bob Terifay and then Bob Landry. George?","George Damis Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. Let me begin with Eylea. In February, the full results of the independent NIH-sponsored Protocol T study in diabetic macular edema, or DME, were published online and subsequently in the print edition in March in the New England Journal of Medicine.","The results from this study demonstrated that, compared to Lucentis and Avastin, Eylea provided significantly greater efficacy, despite one fewer injection and fewer laser treatments. The improvement with Eylea relative to alternative anti-VEGF therapies were particularly apparent in the group with moderate or worse vision loss at the start of the trial. We are pleased with the positive reception that these data have garnered from the retinal specialist community.","Eylea received an additional FDA approval in the first quarter when it was approved for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy in patients with DME. Outside the United States, Eylea was approved by the European Commission for the treatment of visual impairment due to macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion, or RVO.","Our combination trials with Eylea are underway, and a Phase II trial of Eylea co-formulated with our PDGF receptor antibody is now ongoing. This trial will explore two doses of the PDGF receptor antibody, each combined with 2 milligrams of Eylea in a single intravitreal injection. The FDA has granted this program fast-track designation for the treatment of patients with wet AMD.","Our phase I combination study of Eylea co-formulated with our ANGPTL2 antibody, nesvacumab, also in a single intravitreal injection, is also ongoing, and we expect to report data from this study later in the year.","Turning to Praluent, our PCSK9 antibody for lowering LDL-cholesterol. 18-month results from the ODYSSEY long-term trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine, in a paper titled Efficacy and Safety of Alirocumab in Reducing Lipids and Cardiovascular Events. These data showed robust and consistent LDL-cholesterol lowering with Praluent from the largest double-blind placebo controlled trial of a PCSK9 inhibitor to date, and demonstrated that Praluent, when added to statin therapy at the maximally tolerated dose, significantly reduced LDL-cholesterol levels. Additionally, in a post hoc analysis from this study, there was evidence of a reduction in the rate of major adjudicated cardiovascular events, or MACE, with Praluent.","At the American College of Cardiology Meeting, we presented data from the CHOICE I and CHOICE II studies, which explored every four-week dosing of Praluent. Though the every four-week dosing data will not be included in the initial Biologics License Application, these are important data that further support an individualized dosing approach to patients' lipid-lowering needs. Importantly, these data were consistent with the LDL-cholesterol lowering observed among alirocumab-treated patient across our Phase III program to date.","Turning now to our immunology and inflammation portfolio. Dupilumab, our IL-4, -13 blocking antibody, has made clinical progress across multiple indications. As a reminder, the positive Phase IIa data of dupilumab in asthma and atopic dermatitis were both published in the New England Journal of Medicine.","Later this month, we will be presenting data from the positive Phase IIb study in asthma at the Annual Meeting of the American Thoracic Society. As a reminder, following discussions with the FDA, this study will be considered a pivotal trial, which means that we will only need to conduct a single Phase III efficacy study in asthma, which we recently initiated. An additional major indication for dupilumab, atopic dermatitis, for which we have been granted breakthrough designation, is currently enrolling patients in the Phase III LIBERTY program.","We also recently initiated a study in atopic dermatitis in children. We expect to initiate another Phase III program in patients with nasal polyps with associated chronic sinusitis later this year. Our proof of concept study in the eosinophilic esophagitis indication is ongoing.","Turning to sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody for rheumatoid arthritis, which has demonstrated positive data in both signs and symptoms, as well as in radiographic progression, in the Phase III MOBILITY study. We expect to report data from additional Phase III studies in the second quarter of this year. We are planning on a regulatory submission in the United States in the second half of the year. We now have a pipeline of 15 fully human monoclonal antibody products that are in clinical development. I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight some of our earlier stage pipeline antibodies.","Fasinumab, our nerve growth factor antibody for chronic pain, is expected to move into pivotal studies later this year in osteoarthritis. RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a common seasonal infectious disease that is the leading cause of bronchiolitis, pneumonia and hospitalization in children under the age of 1. Based upon our discussions with the FDA, we now plan to move into pivotal studies with this program, which we expect to initiate mid-year in the Southern hemisphere.","Our antibody is designed to have a higher affinity for RSV and a longer half-life than the currently approved therapy, which could result in less frequent dosing. Regeneron 1033 is our fully human antibody to GDF8 or myostatin. We recently presented proof of mechanism data in healthy volunteers at the International Conference on Frailty and Sarcopenia Research. In a separate Phase II proof-of-concept study in elderly patients with sarcopenia, all three doses of Regeneron 1033 met their primary endpoint of an increase in lean body mass by DEXA scan at 12 weeks compared to placebo, with changes compared to placebo of approximately 2%.","This is in line with other agents that target GDF8. We also observed improvements in some, but not all, exploratory functional endpoints in this trial. Overall, the drug was well tolerated, with no safety signals. Based on these initial results, we are considering various options for next steps for this molecule, which may include combination with other agents. Data from this Phase II study will be presented at a future medical meeting.","Turning to immuno-oncology. Our earlier stage assets are advancing. Our PD-1 antibody and our CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody are both in the clinic. While it is still very early, and we have only enrolled small numbers of patients, we have already started to see preliminary signs of clinical activity, such as B cell depletion with the bispecific antibody, and early clinical responses with our PD-1 antibody. We hope to be able to share more data from these programs with you later this year or early next year. We also have multiple additional immuno-oncology targets in pre-clinical development which we anticipate could be moved into the clinic in the next 12 months to 14 months.","I also want to take a moment to give you an update on the progress that we have made at the Regeneron Genetics Center, or the RGC. We have entered into several key collaborations, including with a hospital for sick children in Toronto for the world's largest genetic study in pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease, with the Broad Institute and Lund University for large scale cardiovascular target sequencing project, and the University of Maryland for an Amish genetics collaboration. We expect to have sequenced about 100,000 individuals by the end of this year.","With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Bob Terifay.","Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President-Commercial","Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. This has been a very exciting quarter for the Commercial group at Regeneron, as we continue to grow our market shares across the indications for Eylea, rapidly build our internal and field-based capabilities to potentially launch Praluent or alirocumab later this summer, and roll out our pre-launch programs for sarilumab and dupilumab.","I'd like to begin my comments today with Eylea. First quarter U.S. Eylea net sales to distributors were $551 million, which represents a 51% increase over first quarter 2014 and a 5% increase over fourth quarter 2014. Importantly, underlying physician demand remained strong, and grew from fourth quarter 2014 to first quarter 2015 by over 10%.","Much of this growth appears to be related to the reaction among physicians to Protocol T study, which George just discussed and which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at several retinal meetings in the first quarter of 2015. According to a qualitative survey of 201 retinal specialists conducted in March 2015, over 50% of the eyes treated with VEGF inhibitors for DME are now treated with one of the two FDA-approved DME therapies, with Eylea capturing a greater share versus ranibizumab. Importantly, the market share gains for Eylea are not just resulting from ranibizumab share declines, but also from bevacizumab shares declines.","We're also seeing market share growth in wet age-related macular degeneration, or macular edema following retinal vein occlusion. According to our qualitative survey, the market share for Eylea now surpasses that for ranibizumab in the United States.","Eylea was approved by the FDA in July 2014 for the treatment of DME. DME is characterized by a low diagnosis rate. Moreover, of those eyes diagnosed, only a minority are treated with anti-VEGF therapy. In order to ensure that more diabetic patients get annual dilated eye exams to detect DME, in the first quarter, we instituted an extensive public awareness campaign entitled, Don't Let Diabetes Steal Your Sight, which includes displays at diabetes patient conferences, a patient website, and unbranded advertising in diabetes patient publications and web programs.","To address the limited DME patients' access to VEGF inhibitors and its potential impact on patients' vision, we're conducting educational programs with optometrists, encouraging early referral of DME patients to retinal specialists where they're more likely to receive access to anti-VEGF treatment.","In the first quarter, we added another indication for Eylea, diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetic macular edema. This new claim extends insights for physicians into the role of Eylea in DME management. Not only does Eylea reduce macular edema, it also improves retinal damage, highlighting the special role of VEGF inhibitors in the treatment of DME, and further supporting why VEGF inhibitors should be more broadly used in patients with DME.","Turning to the ex-U.S. Eylea business, where we split profits with our collaborator, Bayer HealthCare. First quarter 2014 (sic) [2015] (15:45) ex-U.S. Eylea sales were $292 million, representing a 34% increase year-over-year on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, this represented year-over-year growth in excess of 50%.","Ex-U.S. Eylea sales continue to be important driver of growth, with continued regulatory approvals and registrations. For example, in the first quarter of 2015, Bayer achieved CHMP approval of Eylea for macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion in Europe.","With respect to Praluent, or alirocumab, our PCSK9 inhibitor for hypercholesterolemia, we and Sanofi are busy preparing for a potential third quarter 2015 U.S. launch. Let's first discuss the potential patient population for Praluent.","Statins remain the standard of care for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, and should always be used as first-line therapy. Praluent has been studied in, and will be positioned for, high-risk patients who cannot get to their low density lipoprotein cholesterol, or LDL-C target, on a maximally tolerated statin, or cannot tolerate statin therapy.","We believe there's a significant underserved market of approximately 11 million patients in the United States at high risk who are not at their LDL-C cholesterol targets, despite standard of care therapy. These high risk patients include those with familial hypercholesterolemia, those with statin intolerance, and those at high risk because of a previous cardiovascular event or other comorbidities.","Praluent has been developed to address the individualized LDL-C lowering needs of patients. Praluent was studied using two different dosage strengths, a 75-milligram every two weeks dose, which provides on average about a 50% LDL-C reduction from baseline, and a 150-milligram every two weeks dose which provides on average a 60% or more LDL-C reduction from baseline. Consistent with the dosing approach to most cardiovascular medicines, including statins, antihypertensives and anticoagulants, we expect the usual starting dose for Praluent to be the low dose, the 75-milligram dose. Dosing can be adjusted depending upon patient response to therapy. The availability of two different dosing strengths, offering different levels of LDL-C reductions, is an important point of differentiation for Praluent.","Obviously, this is all dependent upon FDA review and approval as the year goes by. In terms of commercializing Praluent, Regeneron and Sanofi share in all global and U.S. internal strategic and technical planning and execution. We also share sales force promotion for Praluent in the United States. The majority of Regeneron's three field-based teams: our special representatives, our hospital specialists, and our reimbursement specialists, have been hired, and the first two waves of home office training have been completed.","I'm very impressed with the caliber and experience of the Praluent team that we hired in less than three months. This required screening 20,000 resumes and conducting almost 2,000 interviews. This will be a market that requires development, given that Praluent represents one of the first injectable biologics for chronic cardiovascular disease with a novel mechanism of action. We've already launched our unbranded physician and patient campaigns, including educational websites. Meanwhile, we're busy finalizing testing of the potential branded campaigns, preparing our sales and education pieces and programs, and evaluating pricing options.","As has been broadly reported in the press, the PCSK9 inhibitor class is garnering significant scrutiny from payers, pharmacy benefits managers, and specialty pharmacies. We expect the reimbursement environment to be complex and carefully managed. Our goal is to ensure that payers and healthcare providers understand the value the PCSK9 inhibitors can offer to patients, and the need for physician choice when initiating PCSK9 inhibitor treatment.","We're working with the players involved in the market access decision-making process to focus on patient good. That said, it will likely take several months for commercial and government payers to conduct formulary reviews, make reimbursement coverage decisions, and begin to process patient claims. Given these reasons, we expect an initial gradual uptake at launch.","We're also busy preparing the market for the potential launch of sarilumab in the United States next year. We have a significant presence at the European League Against Rheumatism meeting in Rome in June, and the American College of Rheumatology meeting in San Francisco in November.","Overall, we are undertaking substantial commercial investments to fully maximize these exciting opportunities and reach appropriate patients who can benefit most from treatment. Bob Landry will provide more detail on the financial impact.","With that, let me turn over the call to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry.","Robert E. Landry - Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone who has joined us today. Overall, we are very pleased with our first quarter 2015 performance. In the first quarter 2015, we earned $2.88 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $336 million, which represents year-over-year growth in non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income of 27% and 28%, respectively.","Regeneron's first quarter 2015 non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense related to our senior convertible notes, loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with conversions of a portion of our convertible notes during the quarter, and non-cash income taxes. First quarter non-GAAP net income was reduced for cash income taxes expected to be paid or payable in 2015. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release.","Total revenues in the first quarter were $870 million, which represented year-over-year growth of 39% for the three months ended March 31, 2015. Net product sales were $545 million in the first quarter, compared to $362 million in the first quarter of 2014. Eylea net product sales in the United States were $541 million in the first quarter, compared to $359 million on the first quarter of 2014, which represented an increase of 51%.","During the first quarter, there was a modest decrease in U.S. Eylea distributor inventory levels as compared to the fourth quarter 2014, and inventory levels remained within our normal one- to two-week targeted range. Underlying physician demand grew by over 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014.","As Len mentioned earlier, we are raising our U.S. Eylea net sales growth guidance for full-year 2015 over 2014 to 30% to 35%, as compared to 25% to 30%, on the strength seen from first quarter U.S. Eylea performance. Ex-U.S. Eylea sales were $292 million in the first quarter of 2015, as compared to $218 million in the first quarter of 2014. Product revenue from ex-U.S. Eylea sales is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer HealthCare. Please keep in mind that our reported ex-U.S. Eylea sales will not be exactly the same as the ex-U.S. numbers that Bayer Healthcare reports, this is because for Japan, Bayer reports their sales to their distributor, Santen, while we report Santen's in-market sales.","Ex-U.S. Eylea sales in U.S. dollars trended down in the first quarter of 2015 when compared to fourth quarter 2014, due to foreign exchange headwinds. On a constant currency basis, sales increased sequentially by a mid-single-digit percentage. I do want to reinforce that currently, our overall P&L exposure to currency movements remains limited, due to the fact that the bulk of our revenue is U.S.-based. Additionally, we have partially offsetting European operating expenses from our Irish plant start-up, Sanofi-incurred Praluent launch expenses outside the U.S., and European clinical trial expenditures.","In the first quarter of 2015, Regeneron recognized $89 million from our share of net profits from Eylea sales outside the United States, after repayment of $14 million in development expenses. Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue for the first quarter was $124 million. This included one $15 million sales milestone, which represents our final milestone to be earned from Bayer relating to ex-U.S. Eylea sales.","Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $173 million for the first quarter of 2015. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, and our share of profits or losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies. In addition, in the first quarter of 2015, Sanofi collaboration revenue included previously deferred revenue relating to our ZALTRAP collaboration agreement with Sanofi, which was amended during the quarter.","As a reminder, while we get reimbursed for antibody-related commercial expenses that we incur, these, along with the commercial expenses that Sanofi spends on the antibodies, are included as expenses in the calculation of antibody profits and losses.","In the first quarter of 2015, our share of losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies was $22 million, which can be found in Table 4 of our earnings release. Please keep in mind that as we approach the potential approval and launch of Praluent under our antibody collaboration with Sanofi, we expect our share of losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies to substantially increase. However, once Praluent, and eventually other antibody products, are launched and become profitable, our share of profits and losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies will become positive revenue.","Additionally, I like to highlight a change in the line item included within Sanofi collaboration revenues. Regeneron share of losses in connection with the commercialization of ZALTRAP, which will no longer be applicable following the amended ZALTRAP agreement we entered into this past quarter with Sanofi. Under the terms of the amended agreement, Sanofi will be solely responsible for the development and commercialization of ZALTRAP indications worldwide, including all cost associated with these activities.","Sanofi will pay Regeneron a percentage of net sales of ZALTRAP between 15% and 30%, and also pay Regeneron for all quantities of ZALTRAP that we manufacture. As a result of entering into this amended agreement, we recorded $20 million of technology licensing and other revenue this quarter, primarily related to our earned percentage of net sales of ZALTRAP for the period from July 1, 2014 through March 31, 2015, and for our manufacturing of ZALTRAP commercial supplies for Sanofi. In addition, in the first quarter of 2015, we recognized $15 million of previously deferred revenue under the ZALTRAP collaboration agreement, which was included in Sanofi collaboration revenue.","Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $284 million for the first quarter, and our unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense minus R&D reimbursements from our collaborators in R&D non-cash share-based compensation expense was $110 million for the quarter.","Our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. For 2015, we'd like to reiterate our previously provided guidance of non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $525 million to $575 million. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D spend is primarily driven by three factors: our obligation to pay for 20% of the phase III clinical development expense following the first positive Phase III results of our partnered antibodies, advancing our unpartnered pipeline in proprietary R&D initiatives, such as those in the area of human genomics.","Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $117 million for the first quarter, and we do expect SG&A expenses to accelerate over the balance of the year as we ready the market for the launch of Praluent. We continue to expect non-GAAP SG&A expenses in 2015 to be in the range of $650 million to $725 million. As previously mentioned, a portion of the SG&A expense will be offset by the reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses recorded within Sanofi collaboration revenue. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $40 million for the quarter.","As a reminder, in 2015, we expect to begin paying significant cash income taxes. Our non-GAAP tax rate for this quarter, and for all of 2015, will be based on an estimate of the cash taxes paid or payable for the full year, which will be substantially lower than our GAAP effective tax rate. On a non-GAAP basis, our estimated tax rate for the first quarter of 2015 was approximately 12.5% of non-GAAP pre-tax income. We continue to guide for cash tax as a percentage of non-GAAP pre-tax net income to be between 10% and 20% for 2015.","Our capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2015 were $114 million. Given this first quarter spend, in our remaining outlook, we are tightening our 2015 capital expense guidance to be between $650 million and $750 million, as compared to $650 million and $800 million.","Our Limerick commercial manufacturing site, which is under construction, continues to represent our largest capital investment in 2015, and we are on track to begin manufacturing validation batches in the second half of this year. We also recently completed a land purchase of approximately 100 undeveloped acres adjacent to our Westchester County campus in Tarrytown to provide flexibility for future expansion.","We ended the first quarter of 2015 with cash and marketable securities of $1.23 billion compared to $1.36 billion at December 31, 2014. The decrease in cash and marketable securities versus year-end 2014 was partly due to higher trade accounts receivables resulting from lengthened payment terms to U.S. Eylea customers effective mid-2014 in connection with the launch of Eylea for the treatment of DME. These extended U.S. Eylea dating (30:12) terms were subsequently reduced in the first quarter 2015. In addition, during the first quarter of 2015, we paid a total of $125 million to reduce the number of outstanding warrants held by one of our warrant holders. These warrants had originally been issued in connection with the issuance of our senior convertible notes in 2011.","Also, in a noteworthy change to our liquidity profile, in March 2015, we entered into a $750 million revolving credit facility which provides access to capital for general corporate purposes. We have no current plans to draw upon this facility. Lastly, in April, note holders surrendered $127 million principal amount of our senior convertible notes which will be settled in the second quarter of 2015. After settling these conversion obligations, only $35 million principal amount of our senior convertible notes will remain outstanding.","All of these transactions are more fully explained in our first quarter 2015 10-Q which was filed earlier this morning. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Michael.","Michael S. Aberman - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations","Thanks, Bob. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. As we'd like to give as many people a chance to ask questions, I remind everyone to please limit yourselves to one question. Again, as a reminder, our team will be available in our office after the call for any follow-up.","Thank you, operator, if you can now please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi. Your line is now open.","Yaron B. Werber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Really, congrats, this is a terrific amount of progress, especially on the pipeline. I'm going to be boring and just take the first Eylea question. It looks like the growth looks pretty good, obviously, and the launch in DME, which frankly sort of tracks with what our servers (32:05) have been saying historically, which is faster than your initial comments going back six months ago. What's the difference? What's driving the growth? Is it just purely Protocol T, or are you actually seeing market growth? Thank you.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Bob, do you want to take that?","Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President-Commercial","The Protocol T study has definitely had an impact on the perception of Eylea in the treatment of DME. And it appears that a lot of the growth, much of the growth, is coming at the \u2013 share offset from bevacizumab and ranibizumab. We are now focused on trying to grow the market more, as I indicated, by getting more patients into retinal specialists. But the initial growth appears to be primarily at the \u2013 coming from the competitors.","Michael S. Aberman - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations","Next question?","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey Craig Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much, and add my congratulations on the progress and the good results for the quarter. Perhaps I'll just take a question on the pipeline, George, since you're on the call. On 2222, you moved the timeline up, which is encouraging. Do you think it's feasible that you could get through Phase III in a single season in the Southern and Northern hemisphere? And, related to that, is it looking as though this is a product that's suitable for full-term infants, or are you going to focus on the preemies, as your predecessor did?","George Damis Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","I think those are great questions. Of course, generally, one would need to have two pivotal trials. So we're hoping that we would be able to complete in one season, one of the studies, though we are prepared to extend it if need be. And I think \u2013 you point to the potential opportunity here. There's a large unmet need. RSV is, in terms of total numbers, occurs much more frequently in full-term infants, as you point out, and it causes a lot of disease and morbidity in that population, where, right now, treatment is not standard of care, and it would be wonderful to that population to offer them an alternative that \u2013 or to offer them a therapy that could actually prevent this serious disease in infants. So, it's possible that that could comprise a large part of the opportunity.","Geoffrey Craig Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Michael S. Aberman - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations","Great. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Chris J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Thanks. Just another sort of DME question. I think you guys have long talked about the share of intravitreal therapies in DME patients being obviously less than AMD. I think the number, I've heard you guys say it for a while, is 40% share. So, some of our feedback has been that that might be coming higher as time progresses. I wonder if you could maybe update your thoughts for us on what that share might be now or have you seen it, given all the data that's come, have you seen specifically, a movement in that share? Thanks.","Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President-Commercial","Chris, obviously, all of our information, and the information that is in the public domain, is from anecdotal qualitative surveys with physicians. I think that there's some growth in the anti-VEGF penetration. But the reality in DME is, unlike wet AMD, where patients' vision is at risk if you don't treat aggressively, this is a disease where physicians go slower. And I think, aside from the 40% that you're quoting, the bigger challenge in this marketplace is that many patients get diagnosed with DME and don't make it to a retinal specialist. They're with an optometrist or with an ophthalmologist, where they don't get access to anti-VEGF therapy.","So, we're working very hard right now to try to get more people into a retinal specialist and treat it with an anti-VEGF therapy, but that is the big obstacle in the marketplace, to make sure the doctors get to the right doctor \u2013 or the patients get to the right doctor. George?","George Damis Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","Yeah. And I just want to make a few comments. Obviously, this is a relatively new field. But now I think, over the last few years, the field has really recognized some things that make a huge difference. Of course, as Bob said, one of the problems is that there's a low diagnosis rate, and there's a low treatment rate right now.","However, there's also now the recognition from the entire field that anti-VEGFs really are a dramatic improvement over the previous standard of care and approaches, including laser therapy and so forth. So I think that's a really big recognition. And, of course, another huge piece of data now comes from the Protocol T study that says that some anti-VEGF agents are much more powerful at controlling the disease, and improving vision, than other anti-VEGF agents. So, we believe that there is a very large unmet need here, in terms of patients not being diagnosed and not being treated with anti-VEGF therapy, and not receiving, obviously, the best anti-VEGF therapy. And that's a very, very large opportunity.","Chris J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thank you for taking my questions, and good morning to everyone. So, Len, I know that you recently met with the CEO of Sanofi. Can you give us, on a high level, what you think the collaboration's going through, and where the strategic direction there is for Sanofi with your collaboration? And then, I have a detailed question about the DRCR trial. So, obviously, we have all anecdotally heard from doctors that the result has been making impact on their practice in DME. Do you guys think that there will be some read-through or spillover effect into AMD as well? Thank you.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ying. I have one question for you. Are you following me around, or...?","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Actually, Len, I want to know what happened in Cuba, too.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","So, the answer to your first question is yes, of course, we've met and spoken with, several times, the CEO, as we would \u2013 expected to do with such an important collaborator of ours, with Sanofi. I think Olivier was a great choice by Sanofi's board to lead that company. He's got a lot on his plate, but we were pleased to see that, high up on that list, was the relationship with Regeneron. That relationship has got a lot to do, and we've \u2013 certainly our focus, both on, how do we make sure that the launches are going to go seamlessly and spectacularly \u2013 that's sort of job number one. You do all this hard research and development work, and now we got to finish it off by strong launches.","And obviously, we've got three potential launches coming over the next several years. Not just with Praluent for low cholesterol, but also sarilumab for rheumatoid arthritis and, of course, dupilumab for a variety of allergic diseases, including atopic dermatitis, asthma, and perhaps several others. So, we have lots to talk about, the relationship is strong, and we have plenty to do.","In terms of the \u2013 your question is whether there's a halo effect of the Protocol T, I've heard several people suggest that that's the case. One person told me that previously, a practice might be able to just carry Avastin, if they didn't want to get into the buy and build business, but when they see the Protocol T data, they feel they have to carry Eylea, because there's such a differential there. And once they start doing it, and then they might be more inclined to use it for AMD. I don't know how often that sort of scenario plays out, but I can imagine some sort of a halo effect.","Of course, we're out of the promotional aspect about this. We can \u2013 we don't talk to doctors about Protocol T, we don't promote it. Our field force doesn't promote it, because it's not in our label. But the good thing about the retinal community is that they have lots and lots of meetings. And it's already been presented at a retinal specialty meeting. It's been \u2013 was presented \u2013 I was at the ARVO meetings over the past several days, it will be presented again at several \u2013 at the ASRS and several other retinal meetings.","So they have lots of opportunity to hear \u2013 and frankly better than to hear from us, which we can't do. They hear from the people who conducted the studies, who make a very strong presentation about the results. So, I think it will move market share. In DME, I think it will increase market share, moving more people to get treated, and I think it potentially could have a halo effect.","Michael S. Aberman - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations","Thanks, Len. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Just wondering if you can maybe provide us some insight into the potential questions or topics at the upcoming ad com for Praluent? And if not on that question, then maybe you could give us some more details with respect to any shift in your account base for Eylea post the DME launch. Just wondering if you can comment at all about growth trends from existing accounts versus new accounts? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Terence. As far as the advisory panel, we're waiting, as you are, for the FDA briefing book and the questions to come out. So, when we know them, obviously you'll know them. We, of course, have our war games and our scenarios, but we'll probably not comment on that and let Regeneron-Sanofi do its work, and Amgen will have to do its work and, of course, the FDA will be doing the most important work.","Bob, did you want to comment on the Eylea question?","Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President-Commercial","Yeah. I think that, in terms of accounts, we've pretty well penetrated the retinal accounts. And so, our DME business is coming from existing accounts. It is interesting that diabetes is distributed differently in the United States than wet AMD. So, we do see a different geographic disbursement of the sales. But in terms of the accounts, it's pretty much the same accounts.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","The one qualitative thing, of course, that we feel very good about is that, when you're going into a new product cycle, which we hope we're going into, it's nice that your flagship product is still really growing very strongly. At 50% year-over-year in the U.S. growth, that was terrific, and that was with a little modest inventory drawdown. I think that that bodes well, that the company is strong and continues to be strong, as we try and broaden our base of important products.","Michael S. Aberman - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Schwartz with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.","Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks very much. I'm wondering, I'm still intrigued by the approach that you're taking for Regeneron 1033 in sarcopenia. So, I was wondering if you could expand a little bit about the signals that you saw, in terms of the functional endpoints. Are any of them potential registrational endpoints? And then, what kinds of combinations are you contemplating for this drug?","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","George?","George Damis Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","Well, we certainly are very gratified that this genetically defined pathway can indeed be followed up with the biologic, and you can see the right type of biological responses without untoward effect, sort of as the genetics would have predicted. So, that is very gratifying for the whole field of genetics and genomics and so forth. This is a very complicated area. You talked about registrational endpoints and so forth. This is a very young field. There really hasn't been too much done in this area. So that's still a developing area, in terms of how one would approve it.","And in terms of combinations, that's still very early in our program, and certainly, there's a lot of competitive issues there, so I'm not going to necessarily get into what we might imagine. But certainly, this is an area where we think that there's the possibility of taking this one pathway, where you see this moderate benefit, perhaps, and combining it with others, and perhaps increase the benefit, both in terms of the anatomy and in terms of the function, and be able to provide a more meaningful result to patients.","Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah. Do you think that the accelerometry tools could help you get around any requirements for PROs that the FDA might otherwise require? Seems like Novartis is working a lot on that area.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","We can have this as a side \u2013 about, perhaps, these fine details.","Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, sounds good. Thanks.","Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President-Commercial","We'll talk.","Michael S. Aberman - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations","Okay, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS. Your line is now open.","Matt M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Nice quarter, guys, and thanks for having me on the call. I wanted to come back to the RSV program, gratified to see that moving forward sooner rather than later, and I'm just trying to think around the corner a little bit, to see how \u2013 thinking about how this program could play out here. George, would I be wrong to interpret your prior comment as meaning that there seems to be interest or buy-in among the regulators to move into a broader target population, the full-term babies? And then related, maybe more of a commercial question is, in that core population of those born 32 weeks to 34 weeks gestation, I'm just trying to understand what kind of data you think you need to show to get around or mitigate any kind of pricing strategy that might arise from your competitor? Thanks very much.","George Damis Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","Right. Well, my prior comments, I think, were just that. In that I think that these questions point out that the current standard of care is that the actual infants that are treated with the RSV therapeutics is very, very limited and there is a much broader population that, in fact, the CDC has actually said could dramatically benefit if this type of approach could be made more broadly. And certainly, that is shaping our thinking, and I think that's about \u2013 that about represents our perspective.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","I would only add perhaps, George, to emphasis your comments, that we hope to have a differentiated product on \u2013 in terms of maybe how long it might be able to be \u2013 last before you have to give a repeat, or something of that nature. So, it isn't simply, if we do something, the competition can respond in kind commercially, there may be differentiations in the product as well. We'll have to see that as the data goes on.","Michael S. Aberman - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations","Okay. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adnan Butt with RBC Capital Market. Your line is now open.","Adnan S. Butt - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thanks, and let me throw a curveball and ask on fasinumab. So would that be a Phase III study or a Phase II in it, and would you be starting at the same dose levels where the program finished off? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. The thing about that program that you have to understand is that, you could call these really whatever you want, Phase II\/IIIs, Phase IIbs, Phase IIIs. What's going to drive it is not the number of efficacy trials you have or need. What's going to drive this program is the number of patients you need exposed, very \u2013 thousands of patients exposed, and that's really going to be the main driver. The efficacy part of this is pretty much in hand for the \u2013 across the class. It shows impressive efficacy. Refining the doses, of course, can be done in a IIb\/III setting. But really, the way you have to think about this, the way we're thinking about it, is that it's a question of making sure you're getting the adequate exposure done that would support a filing.","Michael S. Aberman - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations","Great. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert (sic) [Robyn] (49:31) Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, guys. This is Adnan (49:36) for Robyn. Congrats on the progress. So, just going back to the PCSK9 launch. Being about one month ahead of the competitor, how do you view \u2013 what's the benefit there? And also, could you comment any on the litigation, I guess, with Amgen regarding the patent? Thank you.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, we have no comment on really either of those, and that's it.","Unknown Speaker","Fantastic.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","We think \u2013 to reiterate what we said in the past, we don't believe we infringed any valid claims. If you've been following this close enough, what we've already said is that, in lieu of a preliminary injunction proceeding, the court's going to give a early trial date, expecting that to be around March of next year. Beyond that, we really don't have much to say. And how we're going to use our month to our advantage is \u2013 probably better off we keep that to ourselves, or we'll lose that advantage.","Unknown Speaker","I tried. I tried. I tried. Well...","Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President-Commercial","It's worth trying. I know Amgen wanted you to try but, but we can't oblige, sorry.","Michael S. Aberman - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations","Next question.","Unknown Speaker","One follow-up, one quick follow-up just, that you may be able to answer. How do you view potentially broadening the label for PCSK9?","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","I didn't hear that. Say it again?","Unknown Speaker","Sorry. In terms of \u2013 how do you potentially view \u2013 I know your launcher is a small \u2013 a more narrow label for PCSK9. How do you potentially view a broader label, and when we might see that?","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'm not sure what the question is. You know we've done a very broad development program that focuses on the people who really could benefit. We think that it would be irresponsible for anybody to suggest that statins aren't the first line of approach here. Statins have been a very good drug. They've been shown to have very strong effects on cardiovascular outcomes. They've been used by millions and millions of people of every race and nationality around the world. There's a strong safety record, and we're \u2013 so, we're \u2013 we really believe that that's not the marketplace we're going after, obviously.","What we're looking for, nevertheless, is that there are millions, if not \u2013 maybe even 10 million people who \u2013 where statins is not adequate for them, for a variety of reasons. Maybe they've got familial hypercholesterolemia and they just simply can't get their cholesterol where their doctors would like it to go. Maybe they have been on statins and they've had a heart attack, or very high risk and they \u2013 still at risk, they need to go even lower. And maybe there are some people who are statin intolerant.","I think you've heard all sorts of estimates out there of how many peoples and what the market size is and et cetera, et cetera. I'm sure that those are grossly exaggerated, at least the ones that I've read. I think that this could be an important class of drugs when used properly, and when respecting the fact that statins should be the front line of therapy.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you very much.","Michael S. Aberman - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations","Great. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, with regard to your PD-1 candidate, can you elaborate a little on your latest thoughts around development plans there, and whether you expect to only combine the agent with other in-house assets, or if you'll be looking for outside collaborations as well? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yes and yes. And, George, you want to elaborate on that any further?","George Damis Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","Well, I think you just gave away the answer, yes and yes is the answer. I think that we all know that this is a very exciting new class and target, and we have, as we've already indicated, we have multiple additional targets, that are within a year or two of development, that are potential partners for this therapy in various settings.","And we also are very actively looking to molecules outside of our own pipeline with which to combine it. And we think it's very early in the whole entire immuno-oncology field to understand how to really best harness the potential and the power of this field. And so we're very excited to be a part of it, and we're very excited to have what, even from our very early clinical studies, looks to be an active molecule that's out there.","Michael S. Aberman - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations","Great. Next question.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Newman with Canaccord. Your line is now open.","John Newman - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wondered if you could comment a bit, just obviously based on what's in the public domain regarding what is known about the difference in formulations between your PCSK9 product and Amgen's? I'm specifically curious as to what we know about the fact that your concentration is half of theirs. I'm just curious as to what types of implications that might have in the real world since, just theoretically, having a concentration that's half of another product within the same volume might suggest some differences in how the drugs are administered. Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","So John, I think you may have some confusion there. But without getting into the details of the formulation, let me just focus on the important differentiating points that potentially could arise as we look through all the data and get through the advisory panel and approval. Regeneron has a formulation that allows for the treatment at 75-milligram dosage form, as well as a 150-milligram dosage form. And there are many patients for whom 75 milligrams is more than adequate, and they will get the benefit that you're looking for.","There are some where the people would like to get a higher benefit. Well then, of course, you have the opportunity to use our higher dose, a 150 milligram formulation. So we do have the ability to individualize, and we don't have to, with our product, give people what I would call forced higher dosing, or forced overdosing, more than you really need to give to get the job done.","These products look \u2013 and I hope that'll come across our advisory panel, these products look very good at this stage. But of course, you're only dealing with thousands of patient-years of exposure, and for \u2013 typically our trials have lasted about 18 months. And so, when you're talking about a lifetime of therapy, of course, some people would like to \u2013 some doctors would prefer to use the lowest dose that will get the job done. That, to us, is a big point of differentiation. Maybe we should leave it at that, and more will come as we get, I think, through the advisory panel, the labeling, and the launch. And George, you want to add?","George Damis Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist, President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","Yeah. I just wanted to make a couple of comments. I think, as Len correctly pointed out, I think the most important potential difference for the patients is the option \u2013 and for their physicians \u2013 is the option to choose between a lower dose or a higher dose, certainly for initiation of therapy. But just to \u2013 as Len said, to get the facts right, our 150-milligram dose is actually a more concentrated formulation, not a less concentrated formulation. And also, in terms of that, when, for example, their monthly dose's form is actually a \u2013 3 mLs worth of an injection.","So, these are actually things that \u2013 depending on how you look at it, would actually be considered in our favor. But those are minor details. I think the important point is Len's point about the fact that we have the flexibility of dosing, and the patients, and the physicians can, based on their baseline LDL and their goals, can decide which dosage form to initiate therapy with.","Michael S. Aberman - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations","Operator, we have time for one last question, and for those who didn't make it on the call, we apologize. We'll make sure to try to get to you next time, and you know we'll be in the office after the call. So, final question.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me slip in a question here. So, question for you on PCSK9. When you look at the market awareness today of the class, and maybe the urgency to treat, what are the subtleties between the U.S. and EU opportunities? I guess I'm just trying to get a sense for \u2013 if there's a reason to think that o-U.S. may be different dynamics, based on Bob's launch comment. Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Bob?","Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President-Commercial","Yeah. So, obviously, awareness is very high amongst specialists: cardiologists, lipidologists and endocrinologists, given that the data have come out at the cardiology and lipidology and diabetes meetings. In terms of the differences between the U.S. and Europe, Europe is very much governed by governmental payers. And so, although awareness is very high, it's going to come down to a decision as to which patient types are deemed to be suitable for PCSK9 inhibitor therapy, dependent upon price point.","In the United States, as we talked about a little bit on the call earlier, the payers are exerting more involvement than they have in the past, but the physicians can still have choice as to which patients get access to therapy. So, I think uptake in the United States \u2013 the patient pool in the United States is likely to be larger than that outside of the United States.","Michael S. Aberman - Senior Vice President, Strategy & Investor Relations","I think, with that, I'm going to conclude today's call and thank everybody for participating. And again, we'll be in our office.

Once our call concludes, Bob Landry, Jay Markowitz and the IR team will be available to answer further questions.","With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.","Leonard Schleifer","Thanks Mark. Good morning to everyone. EYLEA and Dupixent kicked off a successful start to 2019. For the first quarter, total aggregate sales of all Regeneron-invented products were $2.27 billion, a 23% year-over-year increase. We are pleased with the early launch of Libtayo, a foundation immune-oncology and we made significant progress across our deep and diverse pipeline.","EYLEA, which was approved in the U.S. late in 2011, continues to deliver in its eighth year in the market, with U.S. sales of $1.07 billion, a 9% year-over-year increase. I'm proud to say that EYLEA\u2019s growth has come without price increases.","EYLEA has an established efficacy and safety profile with over 25 million injections sold worldwide. In addition to a demographic tailwind in approved indications, we view our pending new approval in diabetic retinopathy as a new opportunity potential to potentially drive growth.","While the potential to prevent patients with diabetic retinopathy from suffering blinding complications is very exciting, we recognize that it will require market development because it involves treating patients that are currently asymptomatic.","To test the hypothesis that higher doses may improve upon EYLEA\u2019s already market leading profile, later this year we plan to advance the clinical development of a higher-dose formulation of aflibercept and we continue to make progress on new molecular entities that have the potential to be even better.","Let me turn now to Dupixent, a product with the potential to change the course of allergic type two diseases. First quarter net sales globally were $374 million, and patient feedback testified to Dupixent\u2019s value proposition. We are seeing growth in both atopic dermatitis and asthma, and we expect further growth to be amplified by expanded age groups, new geographies and additional indications.","Moving now to Libtayo. In its first two quarters on the market, Libtayo has established a foothold in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC. We intend to build on that dermato-oncology foundation and expand into other indications.","In addition to testing Libtayo and cancers in which PD-1 blockade is known to be effective, we considered an important component of potential future combinations that have the potential to broaden activity and deepen responses.","Last month, we announced the collaboration with Alnylam that combines each company's unique assets and abilities and enables us to pursue intracellular targets in the eye and central nervous system, as well as a select number of targets in the liver. This deal exemplifies our business development strategy and we continue to explore many new and exciting opportunities. Advancing our internal pipeline remains a key priority. Leveraging our scientific capabilities and our world class genetics efforts, and partnering with other scientific driven companies is yet another way we plan to capitalize on our own research productivity and innovation.","In summary, our core franchises of EYLEA and Dupixent are growing, Libtayo is establishing itself as the foundation of our diversified and comprehensive immune-oncology platform, and has had early commercial success in his first indication.","We are advancing a broad and deep pipeline, rich in opportunity for sustainable, long term growth. For more on that, I will now turn the call over to George.","George Yancopoulos","Thank you, Len, and good morning everyone. Let me begin with EYLEA, which remains the gold standard for retinal disease. Despite efforts by many others to develop drugs with superior visual outcomes, EYLEA remains the market leader, based upon visual outcome and safety and is the measure upon which other therapies are compared.","In terms of additional indications, in which EYLEA can benefit patients, we are looking forward to next week's FDA action date for our supplemental BLA in diabetic retinopathy. Furthermore, we are awaiting FDA action and our resubmitted filing for the EYLEA prefilled syringe hoping to launch in the second half of 2019.","As Len mentioned, we also plan to initiate clinical development of a higher dose formulation of aflibercept and we continue preclinical development of a new VEGF blocker. Earlier research efforts are focusing on gene therapy and other novel approaches. I'd like to now turn to Dupixent, which is emerging as a new standard for type 2 diseases.","In the first quarter of 2019, we achieved three important regulatory milestones; the FDA approval for adolescents age twelve through 17, with atopic dermatitis, a positive EU opinion for severe asthma and adolescence in adults and the U.S. and EU filing of our applications for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis for which we receive priority review in the United States with an action date of June 26. We hope to bring the benefit of Dupixent even younger, atopic dermatitis patients or Phase 3 trial in pediatric patients, aged six to eleven is now fully enrolled, and we expect to report results on this trial later this year.","We also have an ongoing pivotal confirmatory study in the eosinophilic esophagitis as well as studies with peanut and grass allergy. Dupixent is delivering on its pipeline interproduct promise, demonstrating positive data in multiple allergic type-2 diseases confirming our hypothesis that Interleukin or an Interleukin-13 are the key drivers of allergic type-2 disease in general.","Many of these different manifestations of an overactive type-2 inflammation occur simultaneously in the same patient. For example, in our adolescent atopic dermatitis trials, more than 90% had at least one other allergic condition with more than 50% suffering from co-morbid asthma. Obviously, there would be a huge patient benefit if they can take a single medicine from multiple diseases.","Interestingly, there are numerous case studies published by outside investigators indicating benefits for dupilumab in an assortment of additional Type-2 related conditions, such as alopecia areata and Bullous pemphigoid that we have yet to study formally, and we are considering confirmatory studies in these settings.","Of course, it is possible treat numerous immune diseases with drugs that are broadly immunosuppressive or to treat a single disease with drugs that are more disease specific. Dupixent is the rare example of a drug that has efficacy across a range of types of diseases that tend to afflict the same patient, with the favorable safety profile that has permitted development in teenagers and young children.","In addition to Dupixent, we in Sanofi are also testing REGN3500, a fully human anti IL 33 Antibody in asthma, atopic dermatitis and COPD. The first of these proof-of-concept trials to read out is an asthma, where we expect to report top line results by mid-year.","I will shift gears now from our efforts with immuno therapies in non-oncologist settings to our immunotherapy efforts to treat cancer, starting with our PD-1 antibody, Libtayo. Last month the European regulatory body issued a positive opinion for advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. This follows a September 2018 U.S. approval, which made Libtayo the third FDA approved PD-1 antibody and the first approved medicine of any kind for patients with advanced, cutaneous, squamous cell carcinoma.","To extend Libtayo\u2019s benefit in this disease, the second most common skin cancer, we will be starting a Phase-3 adjuvant trial this quarter, and a new adjuvant trial in the third quarter. We are also evaluating Libtayo in the most common skin cancer, that is basal cell carcinoma where we have fully enrolled the locally advanced cohort of our potentially pivotal trial.","Moving to lung cancer, despite the headstart of other multiple other programs, Libtayo has the opportunity to become one of only two PD-1 antibodies approved for the first line treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, the most common cause of cancer death. A Libtayo monotherapy trial, which we doubled in size is about two thirds enrolled. We will soon begin enrolling patients in our Phase-3 non-small cell lung cancer trial comparing Libtayo plus chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone. This study will enroll both squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients regardless of PDL-1 expression.","Beyond Libtayo, bio-specific antibodies, another key component of our immune-oncology strategy. We will present updated efficacy and safety data for our CD20xCD3 bispecific at two European Hematology Conferences in June. The data will include promising early results with higher doses, longer term follow up and efficacy in specific patient\u2019s subpopulations such as CAR-T failures.","Encouraged by high rates of deep and durable responses, we are on track to initiate two potentially registration phase two studies; the first an advanced relapsed\/refractory follicular lymphoma by mid-year and another an advanced relapse\/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or DLBCL by the end of the year.","We're enrolling patients in early studies testing our other two clinical stage CD3 bispecific antibody. MUC16 by CD3 for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, and BCMAxCD3 for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Based on currently available results, from BCMA targeted CAR-T and other approaches, there is still room for improvement, of fully human BCMAxCD3 with favorable pharmacokinetics and lacking potentially immunogenic features may provide the foundation for additional combination approaches.","As far as we know, our bispecific platform is the only one that does not use artificial linkers, mutations or other unnatural sequences. We are also advancing our entirely new classes by specific antibodies as we will soon begin clinical testing of our first costimulatory or costimulatory bispecifics, REGN5678, which is designed to bind Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen or PSMA and CD28. We hope that our clinical studies will replicate our preclinical observations that this new class of co-slim bispecific has limited to toxicity while synergizing with Libtayo as well as with the CD3 class of bispecifics.","Since prostate cancer has shown real, but limited responsiveness PD-1 therapy, we believe it may therefore be an ideal opportunity to detect a clear signal of additional activity if the combination of Libtayo and PSMA by C28 results in a substantially higher response rate than previously observed with PD-1 blockade.","The ability to test multiple combinations of our own checkpoint inhibitors, CD3 bispecifics and co-slim bispecifics is a differentiated feature of our immune-oncology pipeline. However, heightening the immune response via combination approaches carries inherent risks, as occurs with CAR-T therapies.","For example, in our initial study combining our CD20xCD3 bispecific with our PD-1 antibody, in which approximately 30 patients with advanced lymphoma have been treated with a combination, we observed enhanced cytokine release syndrome or CRS that might have been associated with increased tumor response, but also with increased toxicity including unfortunately two fatalities potentially related to the CRS.","We plan to modify the dosing regimen with the goal of minimizing toxicity while potentially capturing the potentially increased activity. Over the coming months and years, we expect to advance a steady stream of bispecifics into clinical development. Just to remind you, Regeneron1979 C3 bispecifics other than those targeting MUC16 and BCMA in our new class of cost in bispecifics are all wholly-owned by Regeneron.","Leaving our immune-oncology and moving to pain. As we have emphasized previously fasinumab, our anti NGF antibody involves a high risk program due to long term safety issues involving increased treatment associated arthropathies in and total joint replacements with this class.","On April 30th, the Data Monitoring Committee recommended continuing the program at the ongoing lower doses, where we previously reported positive efficacy results. These are just a few highlights of Regeneron\u2019s homegrown pipeline.","Let me conclude with comments about the Regeneron Genetics Center, or the RGC in Alnylam collaboration. In March, the RGC provided to the global research community excellent sequences from the first 50,000 U.K. Biobank participants. Sequences are linked to detail de-identified electronic health records, imaging, and other health related information provided through collaboration among the U.K. Biobank, Regeneron, and GlaxoSmithKline.","Regeneron is also leading a separate effort to sequence the remaining 450,000 U.K. Biobank participates, which we intend to complete by 2020 and is being funded by a consortium of biopharma companies, including Alnylam, AbbVie, AstraZeneca, BMS, Biogen, Pfizer and Takeda.","Finally, I would like to acknowledge our new collaboration with Alnylam. Regeneron and Alnylam\u2019s technologies are complementary and our companies share a commitment to patients into science. The emphasis of our joint work will be on diseases of the Eye and CNS and we will also work jointly on certain targets expressed in the liver, including C5, where we each have clinical stage assets.","Regeneron\u2019s antibodies are optimal for secreted in cell surface targets, Alnylam\u2019s RNAi enables us to extend our therapeutic reach to inside the cell.","With that, I'll turn over the call to Marion.","Marion McCourt","Thank you George and good morning everyone. I'd like to start with the EYLEA. For the first quarter, U.S. EYLEA net product sales grew 9% year-over-year to $1.0 7 billion. Overall market growth continues to be driven by the aging population, increase in diabetes prevalence, and physician preference for EYLEA.","EYLEA is the world's leading anti-VEGF therapy for retinal disease. Based on its broad range of indications, demonstrated safety profile, dosing flexibility, and established physician confidence EYLEA market share continues to grow in the overall U.S. anti-VEGF market. This includes branded products, and off-label repackaged Avastin.","In the branded U.S. market, EYLEA has about 70% share of net product sales. Among peers, EYLEA continues to secure approximately 90% first line access. We're committed to further strengthening our leadership position for EYLEA through continued innovation, in dose and delivery as well as label expansion opportunities.","Diabetes is our largest growth opportunity. Very shortly, we expect to hear from the FDA on our filing submission for EYLEA and diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is not a benign condition. Patients with moderately severe and severe nonproliferation disease are at risk for potential blindness.","Given the compelling data from our panorama trial, we think this is an important opportunity to help patients avoid these serious complications. If approved, we have comprehensive plans to develop this market. Our focus will be on raising awareness of the benefits of treating diabetic retinopathy, encouraging early intervention for appropriate patients, and ensuring EYLEA is the first line anti-VEGF treatment for diabetic retinopathy patients.","Turning now to the Dupixent where global net product sales in the first quarter were $374 million. In the U.S. net product sales reached $303 million, representing a 159% year-over-year growth.","Total prescriptions or TRX in the U.S. grew 18% quarter-over-quarter. This was driven by growth in adult atopic dermatitis, and in our new asthma indication, which launched in the fourth quarter.","In March, the FDA also approved Dupixent in adolescent atopic dermatitis, which we anticipate will contribute to incremental growth. Across all indications, prescriber experience and depth continue to improve.","Approximately 16,000 health care providers have prescribed Dupixent and we continue to see strong prescribing trends. Weekly new-to-brand prescriptions or NBRx for the quarter averaged 950 patients per week, up from approximately 700 in the prior quarter.","In atopic dermatitis, more patients are now benefiting from Dupixent, including those with both moderate and severe disease. Prescriber debt has grown, as evidenced by a nearly 200% year-over-year increase in the number of providers, who have prescribed Dupixent to five or more patients.","Additionally, patient awareness has improved benefiting from our promotional and educational campaigns. As a reminder, we estimate the target patient population most in need be 300 to 400,000 adults and just a small minority of patients have received Dupixent since launch.","We also see an important opportunity in adolescent patients with atopic dermatitis. Dupixent is the first biologic approved in this patient group, who remain uncontrolled using topical therapies. While it's very early, market launch reaction has been extremely positive. Our promotional efforts are focused on the same allergist and dermatologists, who currently treat adults with atopic dermatitis, plus pediatric dermatologists and pediatric allergist. We have also been encouraged by payer receptivity to extending Dupixent\u2019s access to this younger patient population. Additionally, we anticipate data from our pediatric study in atopic dermatitis ages 6 to 11 later this year.","Turning now to Asthma, where Dupixent is quickly establishing a competitive market presence in the U.S. Dupixent has a differentiated, clinical and safety profile compared to other asthma biologics. It has a first-in-class mode of action that substantially reduces exacerbations and provides clinically meaningful improvement in lung function, for all the patient population and is the only asthma biologics that can be self-administered. Since Dupixent\u2019s asthma launch last October, we estimate the asthma biologic market has grown by more than 10%.","Nearly 75% of Dupixent asthma patients are new to biologics and significant opportunity remains for subsequent growth. Uptake has been driven by allergists who have experience using Dupixent in atopic dermatitis, and also pulmonologist who are highly receptive to Dupixent efficacy used in steroid dependent patients and self-administration.","Additionally, we are excited about launching in markets outside the U.S. Dupixent was recently approved in Japan, and we expect an EU regulatory decision mid-year.","Finally in June, we expect to hear from the FDA on our proposed indication in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. This should help further differentiate Dupixent from the competition by demonstrating that the same treatment can address multiple related type-2 conditions that often present in the same patient.","I'd now like to turn to Libtayo. In the U.S. first quarter, net product sales were $27 million, driven by prescription demand. Building on our success since launch, Libtayo\u2019s brand awareness among the medical community has increased substantially. We made further progress in establishing Libtayo as a standard-of-care in advance CSCC across all lines of therapy.","Our launch update has benefited from broad payer access with nearly all Medicare commercial and Medicaid lives covered. We expect the number of patients on Libtayo to grow, based on demographics, enhancement and patient identification and physician referrals.","Libtayo is the only FDA approved treatment for advanced CSCC and the only anti PD-1 or PD-L1 with a Category 2A recommendation from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network or NCCN.","Now onto Praluent. Just over a week ago, the FDA approved Praluent to prevent cardiovascular events. Praluent is the first and only PCSK9 inhibitor with data showing a meaningful reduction in all-cause mortality and we're pleased the data describing this mortality effect was included in the updated label. In this highly competitive market, we continue to be focused on patient affordability and payer access.","Moving to Kevzara. Within the IL-6 subcutaneous class, Kevzara now has an estimated 45% share of new patients dispense drug or NBRx and 26% share of total scripts or TRx. We are working to accelerate Kevzara growth by securing a greater share of the IL-6 market and growing the market which is currently estimated at $450 million in the U.S.","Now I'll turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Landry","Thank you, Marion, and good morning to everyone. Today I will discuss our first quarter 2019 financial progress, highlight various items and events that impacted our results, and provide updates to our full year guidance line items, which can be found in our press release that was issued earlier this morning.","For the first quarter 2019, we reported non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $4.45 on non-GAAP net income of $518 million. Total revenues were $1.71 billion, a 13% year-over-year increase. Revenue growth continued to be driven by global sales of EYLEA, and increase in both Sanofi and Bayer collaboration in Libtayo net sales.","For the first quarter 2019, global net products sales of EYLEA were $1.74 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year. U.S. EYLEA net product sales increased due to higher sales volume partly offset by an increase in sales related deductions primarily due to higher discounts.","U.S. distributor inventory experienced a slight quarter-over-quarter decrease yet remained within our normal one to two week targeted range. Ex-USA EYLEA net product sales recorded by our collaborator, Bayer were $669 million representing a 7% reported and a 15% operational or constant currency basis increase year-over-year.","Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the first quarter of 2019 was $276 million of which $249 million was derived from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. the $249 million represents year-over-year reported growth of 7% compared to the first quarter of 2018.","Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $246 million for the first quarter of 2019, a 30% year-over-year increase. We are projecting the Sanofi collaboration revenue line to increase over the remaining quarters of 2019. The year-over-year increase in Sanofi collaboration revenue was primarily driven by lower losses associated with the commercialization of non-IO antibodies driven in part by higher net sales of Dupixent and an increase in the antibody reimbursement of our Regeneron commercialization expenses.","These increases were partly offset by a decrease in reimbursement of research and development costs under the IO discovering development agreement with Sanofi, as the amended December 31, 2018 agreement narrowed the scope of reimbursable activities to the BCMA by CD3 and MUC16 by CD3 programs.","Second, Sanofi collaboration revenues associated with cost reimbursements from Sanofi for bulk drug manufactured by Regeneron were also adversely impacted by timing. In the first quarter of 2019, we recognized the loss of $28 million in connection with the commercialization of non IO antibodies, which compares favorably to a loss of $75 million in the first quarter of 2018.","As noted, the lower share of loss versus the first quarter of 2018 was primarily attributable to higher global net products sales of Dupixent partly offset by an increase in Dupixent commercialization expenses to support the U.S. launch in asthma and ongoing global launches in atopic dermatitis.","Turning now to expenses; non-GAAP R&D expenses were $583 million for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $458 million for the first quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP R&D expense was the result of the expansion in progression of our earlier stage pipeline, an increase in Libtayo development expenses, higher clinical manufacturing costs, and higher headcount in headcount related costs.","This increase in R&D spend is consistent with our 2019 guidance and previously communicated commitment to reinvest the tax savings we are realizing from the enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into research and development.","Our non-GAAP on reimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total non-GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators was $419 million for first quarter 2019 compared to $278 million for the first quarter of 2018.","Included in our updated non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D guidance, our projected program initiation expenses related to our recently announced Alnylam collaboration. Despite the inclusion of these initiation expenses, we are maintaining the top end of our guidance in tightening the range. The $400 million upfront collaboration agreement payment to Alnylam will be recorded as an R&D expense in the second quarter, but will be excluded from reported non-GAAP R&D expenses.","As a reminder, Regeneron\u2019s year-over-year increase and full year non-GAAP unreimbursed guidance is primarily attributable to higher clinical trial and manufacturing costs to support Regeneron\u2019s wholly owned programs, including four to six new molecules expected to advance into the clinic in 2019 on top of the five molecules that were advancing into the clinic in 2018, and lower Sanofi reimbursement as a result of the amended IO discovery and development agreement.","Next, non-GAAP SG&A expense was $362 million for the first quarter of 2019, a 22% year-over-year increase. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher headcount and headcount related costs, primarily to support the Dupixent, asthma and Libtayo launches.","Higher contributions to independent not-for-profit patient assistance organizations and an increase in U.S. commercialization related promotional expenses for Dupixent. We are lowering and tightening our previous 2019 guidance for non-GAAP SG&A expense.","Also as a reminder, the year-over-year increase in our guidance is primarily driven by increased spend, support launches for Dupixent and Libtayo as well as incremental spend to support the potential new growth opportunity of EYLEA in diabetic retinopathy and increased patient assistance programs.","Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses, a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue was $119 million for the first quarter of 2019. We are lowering and tightening our full year 2019 gains for Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses.","For the three months ended March 31, 2019 combined non-GAAP cost of goods sold and cost to collaboration and contract manufacturing were $174 million compared to $108 million in the first quarter of 2018.","With regards to COGS, remember that it includes Sanofi\u2019s share of gross profits in connection with our commercialization of Libtayo in the United States. The year-over-year increase in cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing was primarily due to higher expenses in connection with planned, process validation of our Limerick manufacturing facility, higher inventory write offs and reserves, and the recognition of drug substance manufacturing costs associated with higher sales of Dupixent.","Regeneron's process validation expenses and inventory write-off and reserves for first quarter 2019 were $44 million higher than the first quarter 2018. While these sorts of charges and activities can be difficult to predict, we currently don't expect to see increases of this magnitude impact any of our next three quarters.","Turning now to taxes; our effective tax rate was 15.6% for the first quarter of 2019, compared to 18.3% for the first quarter 2018. As a result of incurring the $400 million Alnylam upfront collaboration expense in the U.S. we are lowering our full year 2019 effective tax rate to be 11% to 13%. The impact of the lower effective tax rate will likely be seen later in the year as the tax benefit of stock based compensation has historically been weighed towards the fourth quarter of the year.","Turning next to Regeneron's first quarter 2019 cash flow, and March 31, 2019 balance sheet. Regeneron ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of $5.57 billion and generated free cash flow of $823 million for the quarter. We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.","Included in both balances was the first quarter 2019 receipt of $462 million of consideration from Sanofi related to the amended IO discovery and development agreement. Our capital expenditures for the first quarter, which has historically been our lowest spend quarter was $74 million. Based on our latest projections, we are lowering and tightening our full year 2019 capital expenditure guidance.","Under the terms of the recently signed collaboration agreement with Alnylam we are obligated to make an upfront payment of $400 million and have also agreed to purchase $400 million of Alnylam equity, which equates to approximately 4.44 million common shares at the agreed upon price of $90 dollars per share.","Subject the Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance, we anticipate closing this transaction and paying the $800 million during the second quarter. Additionally, we will provide Alnylam with a specified amount of funding at program initiation and at lead candidate designation and Alnylam will be eligible to receive up to $200 million in clinical proof of principal milestones for Eye or CNS programs. The clinical proof-of-principal milestones are not expected in 2019.","With that, I would like to turn the call back to Mark.","Mark Hudson","Thanks. Bob. That concludes our prepared remarks. Before we get into Q&A, Len will have one thing to say.","Leonard Schleifer","Yes, one late breaking news. We just received the note, I'm pleased to inform you that the European Commission has informed us that on the 6th of May it adopted the EC implementing decision for Dupixent extension of the indication with the treatment of adults and adolescents with severe asthma with type-2 inflammation, characterized by raised blood eosinophils and\/or raised FeNO and the addition of the 200 milligram dose strength in both the prefilled syringes and prefilled pen format.","So the final full indication for Dupixent is now Dupixent, this is in Europe as indicated in adults and adolescents 12 years and older. As ad-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma with type-2 inflammation characterized by raised blood eosinophils and\/or raised FeNO who are inadequately controlled with high dose inhaled corticosteroids, plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment.","Now, we can go to questions again.","Mark Hudson","Operator, we'd like to open up the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Operator, you may open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And from [Indiscernible]. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, hi good morning. So congrats on the launch of dupi. I have a question about dupi trends so far in asthma. It sounds like you're really capturing a nice share in terms of 75% or first the biologics. So I have a two part question. Number one, in terms of prior authorizations, what are you seeing for this new class versus the IL-5 class?","And then secondly, when you're mentioning a 10% market growth, we're calculating the IL-5 is roughly doing about a billion and a half right now depending on how you project growth. Are you kind of talking about 10% of that is sort of a comp, and how do you see that market growing? Thank you","Marion McCourt","Sure. So let me take a start. I'll go to the last comment on the growth of the Asthma biologics market, and in our calculation was somewhat as you described. We look at all the biologics products that are currently indicated in the U.S. for asthma. And then since the launch of Dupixent for asthma, we're seeing the size of that market in total grow by about 10%. So certainly inclusive of Dupixent\u2019s which we believe is significantly driving the growth, but also in combination with the IL-5 category you mentioned and also we would include Xolair of course as a biologic product within the asthma market.","The next piece going back, we do see some very favorable indicators still somewhat early in launch, and most compelling of course is the profile and the unique aspects of Dupixent\u2019s that is being showcased by allergists or the experience of Dupixent from atopic dermatitis but also pulmonologist, both the clinical profile, the safety profile and the fact that patients can self-administer.","Again, early in the reimbursement cycle, I will comment only on Dupixent. It\u2019s probably best that I not comment on an access for competitive therapies, but I can share that in early days, while we continue to work closely with payers, we have been pleased with the ability for patients to receive reimbursement and for physicians to participate and have ease of prescribing.","So while we'll continue to work closely in that area, early days all aspects of the launch uptake, both patient experience, prescriber experience, and our patient access have been quite favorable.","Mark Hudson","Operator, next question?","Operator","From Goldman Sachs, we have Terence Flynn. Please go ahead.","Terence Flynn","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just a two part on Regeneron 1979. I'm just wondering when you guys will have visibility on if the Phase 2 trials will be or will not be registration enabling in lymphoma? And then the two debts that you mentioned, can you give us any more context there with respect to either you know the dose or if they were in FL or DLBCL and anything on prior treatment history? Thanks a lot.","George Yancopoulos","Well we will be certainly informing you when we know that these are registrational studies. In terms of the toxicities, I just wanted to remind you as I noted in my comments that these were seen in combination with PD-1. And as I noted that in some ways, it indicates that the theoretical concept of combining these two classes actually increases the immune activation is actually you know pertaining in the situation here. And what we believe is that we have ways of adjusting the dosing regimen, so that we can avoid the increase cytokine-release syndrome while capturing the potential increased activity of combining these two classes.","Leonard Schleifer","So Terence, just to amplify on the registrational aspect. It's nothing that we're being coy. I think, it -- there will be registration if the data are adequate. So obviously, we'll let what -- I think what George was trying to say is, we'll let you know when we have the data. We intend these to be registrational if the data continues to be as good as it was in the early studies.","Mark Hudson","Operator, next question?","Operator","From JPMorgan, we have Cory Kasimov. Please go ahead.","Cory Kasimov","Hey, good morning guys. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on the bispecific programs, and recognizing that it's still obviously relatively early days. How do you see the durability of response from 1979 stacking up against CAR-T therapies and the importance of this parameter for future broad commercial uptake? And as you're gathering experience in CAR-T experienced patients as well. How do you see 1979 initially slotting into the market place? Thanks.","George Yancopoulos","Well we have reported on durability and we'll continue to report on it in the upcoming conference. Most patients who remain on treatment maintain their responses. In terms of versus CAR-T as I noted, we will be reporting on promising early results in post CAR-T failures at the upcoming meeting.","So we think that there is a lot of opportunity here for the CD20 bispecific, both in the relapsed refractory setting where we're setting it in. It's obviously going to be much more convenient and amendable therapy to more patients, who don't have to go through the whole process that's required for CAR-T therapies. The possibility that can actually also work in individuals who has failed CAR-T therapies is very exciting.","Let alone the possibility that with its profile, and the way we give it that we can also be moving relatively rapidly into the frontline settings as well. So we think this is a very exciting opportunity that can really address a lot of the need in lymphoma from the latest stage patients who have failed every other kind of therapy eventually to a frontline therapy that could really impact the disease in the earliest of patients.","Leonard Schleifer","And just to amplify slightly, for those who are not dupi aficionados. We reported previously rather striking a response data including a high percentage of complete responses. What we think would be the effective doses. And so, when you start to see that in these very treatment experienced patients, it gets pretty exciting, pretty quickly.","Mark Hudson","Operator, next question?","Operator","From UBS, we have Carter Gould. Please go ahead.","Carter Gould","Morning. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to I guess stroll down a little bit more into the decision to move Dupi into a Phase 3 and COPD. I think before you talked about that being more of a Phase 2, Phase 3 study. It seems like a fully flushed out kind of Phase 3 and maybe just speaks to your level of confidence there given sort of the mixed history with -- negative history with the IL-5 and kind of what gives you confidence there? Thank you.","Leonard Schleifer","Maybe, I'll let George answer as well. But I would say, that one is comes more under the category of \u2013 we\u2019ll need to see the data rather than a higher degree of confidence based upon some earlier studies. When we had done atopic dermatitis, what we had done our first asthma studies where we saw these clear-cut effects on FEV1 and even on loss of asthma control and dramatic responses in AD of course, you had a much higher degree of confidence. COPD is I think much tougher. It's worth looking at, but we wouldn't rank this as something with a high degree of confidence.","George Yancopoulos","Yes, I think what Len is alluding to is that COPD is a very complex disease. And the problem is that in the real world, the data suggests that it is indeed quite complicated in terms of it's impacted by asthma and type-2 diseases. And so, there are a lot of patients who have COPD whose diseases worsen with these related type-2 toxicity.","The problem is finding the right patients to treat, and also negotiating with the FDA, who likes to study cleaner diseases. So I think as Len said, it's going to be, it can be a complicated story and we'll see what the data says.","Mark Hudson","Operator, next question?","Operator","From Barclays, we have Geoff Meacham. Please go ahead.","Greg Harrison","Hi this is Greg Harrison on for Geoff. Thanks for taking our question. Could you tell us maybe a little more about your overall strategy in the complement space, and what type of differentiation do you think you'd need to see with fasinumab [ph] to make it competitive in PNF for that efficacy or dosing convenience? And what other types of additional indications? Could you potentially pursue there? Thanks.","Leonard Schleifer","So I think it's a little bit early to get into that sort of competitive assessment. Obviously, as George mentioned, where we've got the ability to combine that with some iRNA from Alnylam. We're going to be working with them. The potential there might have some unique features. It's just a little early to say where we'll slot it and we'll have to see how the day develops. But obviously, we\u2019re going to look at efficacy. We're going to look at interval etcetera.","Mark Hudson","Operator, next call?","Operator","From SVB Leerink, we have Geoffrey Porges. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey Porges","Thank you very much for taking the question. A couple of quick ones on R&D [ph]. First, George, could you give us a sense of when you might be in a position to make a decision on your NGF program, specifically whether it's go or no go, and whether that might be some savings to the otherwise upward trend in R&D?","And then, secondly just to go back on the combination it definitely sounds like you've had a setback on the PD-1 bispecific combination. But what are your thoughts on the PD-1 combination with the [Indiscernible] molecule. How quickly might that advance? Are you concerned about some of the same other immuno toxicity liabilities or else TLF liabilities? Thanks.","Leonard Schleifer","Okay, well first on the NGF. As I mentioned the Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board gave the go ahead just last week for us to continue with the program. So we they will continue to monitor the study and when we underline the study and so forth, we'll be able to better assess what the efficacy safety ratio is and where the program is going. So that's the story on NGF.","I wouldn't necessarily classify the CD20 by CD3 combination with PD-1. As a setback, as I said, I mean, what it really indicates is a pretty dramatic increase in immune activation. As you know of course, these sorts of things were the things that demonstrated excitement in approaches like CAR-T therapies in fact it was noted in many cases that the people who had, the patients had the highest immune activation, had the highest anti-tumor responses. And we think this is likely to be the case in this setting as well.","The benefit that we have with the ability to individually titrate and give them in a different sequence, allows us to much better find to the timing of the immune activations and allow us to better take advantage of the immune activation while controlling the potential cytokine-release syndrome. So we actually think it's actually an exciting indicator of combined immuno activation.","And so we're very excited both of the combinations of our C3 bispecifics with PD-1, but also CD28 bispecifics of PD-1 and C3 bispecifics with the CD28 bispecifics. All three of those sets of combos are for an incredible exciting set of opportunities that in animal studies have really been game changing.","And so we can only hope, that we can achieve the same sort of benefit risk in patients that we're seeing in those settings.","Mark Hudson","Operator, next question please?","Operator","From Morgan Stanley we have Matthew Harrison. Please go ahead.","Matthew Harrison","Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the adjuvant studies that you're running in Libtayo, and maybe just comment how we should think about the data that you have in sarcoma informing those other skin cancer studies, and just your confidence around what we know so far on the molecule about that adjuvant study? Thanks.","Leonard Schleifer","Well, I think in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, obviously the very impactful efficacy that we saw in the latest stage patients gives us a lot of confidence that in the earlier stage patients, as is usually the case with cancer treatment that we'll be seeing even better benefits. And obviously, this increases very substantially the number of patients in those indications who might be able to benefit if our adjuvant and neo adjuvant trials in the cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma produce that sort of data that would be possible based on the data that we've seen the late stage patients.","So that will be, I think a very exciting way to increase the benefit to a large number, more of patients. We don't have satisfactory treatments right now, and avoid them progressing to these later and much more debilitating stages. Similarly, in lung cancer, we're excited with our opportunity there in terms of our first line -- first line setting. And of course we're also hoping to move into earlier settings there as well.","Mark Hudson","Operator, next question please?","Operator","From Bank of America, we have Ying Huang. Please go ahead.","Ying Huang","Hi, good morning thanks for taking my question. So you mentioned that the total prescriptions for Dupixent increased 18% quarter-over-quarter. And then, new patients are coming out about right now at 950 per week. Can you provide a living more clarity about the breakdown between the patients coming from adolescence atopic dermatitis versus asthma? Where exactly are you seeing the most growth? Thank you.","Marion McCourt","So, it\u2019s early days. So we're not at this time giving specific breakouts by indication, but I certainly can give you a feel for performance. First as you summarized some of the points that I'd made during the call on NBRx as one measures or new branded scripts on a weekly basis. We are seeing a significant increase when we look at this quarter's rate on a weekly basis of 950 versus prior quarter at about 700 scripts per week, so we're very pleased.","What is occurring is we're actually seeing growth in all of our indications, which is a very exciting profile for Dupixent. We continue to help more adult atopic dermatitis patients. So we're seeing growth in that realm. Additionally, as I mentioned during the discussion of the call, we are seeing a very nice start to the launch of asthma, both from a standpoint of Dupixent\u2019s profile, but also from the standpoint of being very competitive to other agents that are currently being used as biologics for the treatment of asthma.","And then finally, on the most recent indication for adolescence is one that has been transformational certainly for patients and their families, but also as we hear stories all the time from physicians who are treating these patients. These poor young adolescents you know are very often challenged to participate at school, in their activities, on a daily basis. And we're hearing just wonderful stories on the difference that Dupixent is making for them, so we\u2019re very early in this launch. We\u2019re excited to be helping so many and we see continued growth across atopic dermatitis, asthma and all the various age groups we're now covering.","Mark Hudson","Operator, next question please?","Operator","From Piper Jaffray, we have Chris Raymond. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is Alee [Indiscernible] for Chris this morning. Another question on Dupixent. We\u2019ve gotten pretty consistent physician feedback from multiple points that the Dupixent sampling plan was suboptimal at least for dermatologists. So I guess the more recent feedback says that's improved lately. Could you just give us some background or color on your Dupixent sampling plant, especially as additional indications are launching? Thanks.","Marion McCourt","So, you know first I will say that is very important to us that our patients receive Dupixent and physicians have the experience that they need. There are availability of samples in the marketplace today. So as you indicate we do have a sampling program, but we also think it's very important that as patients are initiated on therapy, they're able to stay on therapy and we also have a number of support services that help patients and their prescribing physicians, make sure that patients can navigate payer reimbursement. And once on Dupixent can actually stay on therapy.","We believe at this point we have the number of samples correct in the market to support our various indications.","Leonard Schleifer","So let me just amplify on that what Marion just said, because I think it is a tension between wanting to make it as easy as possible for the doctors and patients. On the one hand, on the other hand, the greater good we think of getting foreseeing if you will payers to make decisions, so that everybody can get access. And payers are very sophisticated as one payer said to me, keep it up Len we love those samples, it's like free drug. We'd like you to keep going forever.","So there is this tension of forcing payers to make a decision on the one hand and striking the right balance for making it easy for patients to initiate the launch. The number of patients getting on the drug is really quite remarkable. So we think, we've got that balance working.","Mark Hudson","Operator, next question please?","Operator","From BMO, we have Matthew Luchini. Please go ahead.","Matthew Luchini","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to come back to the CRS with 1979, and recognizing what you've said so far. Just wondering if you might be able to put any more color around similarities or differences between the two patients that experience CRS those didn't perhaps in terms of prior -- number of prior lines of therapy, types of therapy, if they were both seen in FL or DLBCL, for example? Any other color you can provide would be helpful? Thank you.","George Yancopoulos","Well, maybe I will just start by reminding you that in some ways, this is very analogous to our early experience with CD20xCD3 monotherapy. Those early studies actually with our lowest doses, we actually saw a pretty profound CRS.","And what the team didn't realize that we had the ability -- like I said, this is one huge advantage with these biologics, for example, compared to things such as CAR-T therapies that we can literally dial up and dial down the doses and adjust sequences and divide the doses, and we were able to control it.","So now as we got to the much higher doses with much higher activities, as Len pointed out, where we're seeing in late-stage patients, high proportions of not only overall response but complete responses, this now comments with much less CRS than we saw in the early days because we learned how to adjust, divide and sequence the dose of the individual therapy.","We think that were exactly an analogous situation with the CD20 combination with a PD-1. We're now at much lower doses of the CD20 in combination with the PD-1, but giving it in the way that we had avoided the CRS, we are now seeing it again, which tells us that we have higher immune activation and we're going to just do the same sorts of things that we did by taking advantage of our ability to divide the doses in sequence the regiments and so forth. And we're hoping in the same way that we shared with the bispecific on its own, we will be able to take advantage of this increase immuno activation but avoid the CRS.","So we think these are really exciting times. We've seen it before, we got to what we believe now are, as Len said, the actual effective doses in these late-stage patients with monotherapy and we hope will now be able to do the same thing with a combination delivery even more efficacy without having to pay too much of a price in terms of increased toxicity.","Leonard Schleifer","Plus I think, one has to think ahead. We have a lot on the bispecifics. I think as George mentioned earlier, where you're going into some cancers where you don't see very many responses at all. And the notion that you can actually get these enhanced combined immune activations, I think is as important for these other programs as it is to 1979. We're actually you do quite fine as you get up to much higher doses, so I think this is \u2013 has really potentially profound implications for our other programs.","Matthew Luchini","Very good point.","Mark Hudson","Operator, next question please?","Operator","From Baird, we have Brian Skorney. Please go ahead.","Brian Skorney","Hey good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Bob, maybe just kind of characterize when we look at earnings going ahead is a little bit of a retrenchment on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter compared to last year. And I know you guys don't provide bottom line guidance, but just maybe kind of from a target perspective, do you see 2019 as a year of EPS growth. And do you think it's just kind of a onetime items given a little drag or should we kind of expect 2019 to be more flattish, and look towards 2020 and beyond to see a return to growth?","Bob Landry","Yes Brian. So thanks. So we're not going to give guidance on this call with regard EPS. It's just not what we've done previously, and we tried to highlight with regards to gives and takes during the first quarter. I mean, certainly with regards to our cost of collaboration manufacturing calling out the Delta, which was a big increase year-over-year. We don't talk much about our supply chain other than saying we think it's best-in-class. These are very difficult antibodies that we continue to make. You know sometimes things like that happen.","With regards to R&D, our guidance holds. We raised the lower end of our guidance, but that's because of the Alnylam transaction that we're going to execute in the middle of second quarter. We're taking on initiations and upon doing that there'll be payments to Alnylam.","So we still are comfortable with regards to where we are from our guidance point of view. I will say expenses in Q1 from R&D came in a little harder than usual, but for the rest of the year we still feel comfortable with the guidance levels we've provided previously.","Leonard Schleifer","I mean, I do think to remind us a bit. The way we see the business, the top line are the products that have come out of Regeneron are continuing to grow, and the expenses are growing primarily because the research organization is just so dug on productive. I think it was mentioned that we put maybe four or five molecules in the clinic last year. We expect to put a similar number this year, and we have a steady flow projected for the year for 2020 and beyond.","So with that, obviously we feel we should be investing in our research, because we think it has the potential to deliver a great return.","Mark Hudson","Operator, we\u2019ll take one last question?","Operator","And from Cantor Fitzgerald, we have Alethia Young. Please go ahead.","Alethia Young","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Just one on Alnylam, I wanted you guys talk a little bit more about how you're thinking about using this platform technology versus the antibodies? And also I think you might go after larger or more rare opportunities and just your general perspective on the platform? Well thanks.","Leonard Schleifer","Yes. Well, we have enormous hope that Alnylam is going to be transformational opportunity. Why? Because both sides bring, I think a lot of unique and very exciting capabilities to the table. We've been obviously doing a lot of biology and genetics particularly in the eye and also in the CNS that we haven't really talked about, and most, if not the vast majority of the targets there are intracellular targets, and obviously Alnylam has the capability with their technology to start addressing some of these intracellular targets in these two spaces that are challenging with other approaches.","And so this allows us to take advantage of our genetics, all the information coming out of our regeneration genetics and or all the biology we've been doing, all the animal modeling that we've been doing, and now take advantage of them with a whole new platform, not antibodies that as you know are limited to extracellular targets, secretive proteins and cell surface receptors, but an assortment of intracellular targets that we now think we can address both in the eye and CNS and address a whole new series of diseases where we have enormous knowledge and capability based on our genetics and a biology effort.","So it's really coming together I think, two great likeminded companies, with very complementary approaches that we think together we can really make a difference particularly in these spaces.","Mark Hudson","Operator, this concludes today's call. Thank you everyone for joining. Again, Bob Landry, Jim Markowitz, and the IR team will be around to answer any further questions. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect."],"18114":["Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Manisha Narasimhan. Manisha, you may begin.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Sylvia. Good morning, and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' first quarter 2017 conference call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under Events and Presentations for 30 days.","Joining me on the call today are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President and Chief Scientific Officer; Bob Terifay, Executive Vice President-Commercial; and Bob Landry, Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A.","I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call today include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to those related to Regeneron and its products and business, sales and expense forecasts, financial forecasts, development programs, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, intellectual property and competition.

Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions.","With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer. Len?","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Manisha. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call and webcast today.","The first quarter of 2017 was an eventful and significant quarter. Dupixent, our breakthrough drug for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults, received regulatory approval in the United States and the launch is underway. This marked the first of two anticipated FDA approvals in 2017, the second being for sarilumab, also now known as Kevzara, where we have been granted an FDA action or PDUFA date of May 22.","Before we get into the details of our quarterly performance, I want to take a moment to remind everyone of two important priorities at Regeneron. At the core, we have always been a company that is driven by science, and committed to bringing important new drugs to patients in need. These priorities are directly responsible for the robust pipeline that we have today, with five FDA approved drugs and 16 product candidates in various stages of clinical development, all of which have come out of Regeneron labs. George will provide more details on pipeline progress.","As we advance as a company, the commercial aspects of our business is growing in importance as well. This year, we and our collaborator, Sanofi, are laser-focused on ensuring that the ongoing Dupixent launch is successful. While it is too early for us to provide you with sales updates, I am pleased to share with you that about five weeks into the launch of Dupixent, things are continuing to go well. We are pleased with the interest and reception from both patients and physicians.","Just last week you heard from our partner, Sanofi, that about four weeks into the launch, more than 2,500 prescriptions for new patients for Dupixent had been written. I'm happy to inform you to-date that over 3,500 new prescriptions have been written for Dupixent, which translates into over 900 prescriptions written in the past week.","We are also pleased with the reaction from the payers on our responsible approach to pricing to date. We continue to work hard to ensure that eligible patients have access to the drug, and we are pleased with the coverage and utilization management criteria that have been put in place thus far. Bob Terifay will provide additional details.","While atopic dermatitis in adults is our first indication, we are also investigating the use of Dupixent in several other indications and age groups, ranging from what we think could be a near term opportunity in asthma to other indications such as nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis.","Just today, we reported our Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in eosinophilic esophagitis was positive. If we can get approvals for these additional indications, we expect to be in launch mode with Dupixent for many years to come.","Maintaining our leadership position with EYLEA as the market-leading branded anti-VEGF drug continues to be a key focus. With our first regulatory approval in wet age-related macular degeneration or wet AMD, the EYLEA business was initially more concentrated towards the elderly, the majority of whom are Medicare patients. But with subsequent approvals in indications such as diabetic macular edema or DME and diabetic retinopathy in DME and retinal vein occlusion, we have diversified to patient groups where there is less reliance on Medicare.","We continue to support the ongoing launch of Praluent, our PCSK9 inhibitor antibody, for lowering LDL cholesterol. We expect our 18,000-patient cardiovascular outcome study to be completed towards the end of the year with data in early 2018.","On the U.S. patent litigation, we and our collaborator, Sanofi, have been granted an oral argument date of June 6, 2017 at the Court Of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Based on this timing, we could get a decision on the appeal before the end of the year. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to George.","George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. On the call today, I would like to focus on our ongoing clinical development program for dupilumab, review some important data on the long-term use of EYLEA, share some updates on our immuno-oncology program, as well as the progress of the rest of our pipeline.","I'd like to begin with the approval of Dupixent, our IL-4\/IL-13 blocker for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable. This approval is the culmination of a scientific quest that has been decades in the making. While Bob Terifay will address the ongoing launch of Dupixent in greater detail, I would like to focus on the progress that we are making in the clinic with dupilumab in various other indications.","Asthma is an important late-stage opportunity where we are investigating in the use of dupilumab. Despite the recent approval of drugs from the IL-5 inhibitor class in what has been characterized as the allergic patient population, we believe there is an unmet medical need for these patients for a drug that can markedly improve lung function, as well as provide further protection against exacerbations.","In addition, there is a need for drugs that will show efficacy in a wider patient population across all allergic classifications. Based on results from our Phase 2B pivotal study in asthma, where we showed robust improvements in both lung function as measured by FEV1 and reductions in exacerbations, in all patients regardless of their allergic classification, we believe that dupilumab has the potential, if approved, to fill these needs.","Our second pivotal study in the adult asthma indication, the LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study in patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma is fully enrolled and we continue to expect top line data later this year. We believe these data have the potential to confirm the broad efficacy we observed in the first pivotal study. If these data are positive, we expect to complete a regulatory submission in the United States in the fourth quarter of this year.","We also recently started enrolling patients in the Phase 3 study of dupilumab in pediatric asthma patients between the ages of 6 and 11 years in the second quarter of 2017. We're also evaluating dupilumab in pediatric atopic dermatitis, where there is a high unmet need, and we were again granted breakthrough status by the FDA.","Positive data from the open label Phase 2A trial in patients 6 to 17 years old with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis were recently presented at the American Academy of Dermatology Conference in March. The safety and efficacy data from this trial were very encouraging. We have initiated a Phase 3 study of dupilumab in adolescents between the ages of 12 to 17. We expect to initiate in the second quarter of 2017 a second Phase 3 trial in pediatric patients between the ages of 6 and 11 years.","We're also investigating dupilumab in a third clinical setting, which is the treatment of patients with nasal polyps. Following up on earlier positive data from our Phase 2 study in this population, we now have two separate Phase 3 studies that are currently enrolling patients.","As Len mentioned, we recently obtained positive results in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study of dupilumab in a fourth important clinical setting, which is in patients with active moderate to severe eosinophilic esophagitis, a chronic inflammation of the esophagus and one of the major causes of dysphasia or difficulty in swallowing. In this Phase 2 study, we observed clinically meaningful efficacy for dupilumab, as well as profound histologic and endoscopic improvement, together with a safety profile consistent with our previous clinical experience. Detailed data from this study will be presented in an upcoming medical conference.","While eosinophilic esophagitis can be debilitating in adults, it is especially concerning in the pediatric population, where it can be a cause of failure to thrive, and this could potentially be an area of future clinical investigation for dupilumab. It is believed that eosinophilic esophagitis can be a manifestation of food allergies, further supporting the rationale of exploring the efficacy of dupilumab in patients suffering from severe specific food allergies. In the second half of 2017, we intend to initiate a Phase 2 study of dupilumab in patients with specific food allergy.","The positive data for dupilumab across the four allergic or atopic conditions we have investigated to date \u2013 that is atopic dermatitis, asthma, nasal polyps, and now eosinophilic esophagitis \u2013 is consistent with our long-standing hypothesis that these allergic conditions reflect the same fundamental disease process triggered by overactivity of the IL-4\/IL-13 axis. This unifying hypothesis suggests that the differences between these conditions largely reflects how overactivity of IL-4\/IL-13 pathway manifests differently in different tissues.","For example, overactivity of IL-4 and IL-13 in the skin triggers atopic dermatitis. In the lower airway, it results in asthma. In the upper GI tract, it results in eosinophilic esophagitis. Unfortunately for many patients, IL-4\/IL-13-driven allergies can manifest in multiple sites at the same time. Since dupilumab inhibits the key driver of this pathway in all these settings, we believe that it can represent a mechanism-based approach to treat the root cause of these allergic conditions rather than each individual indication on a separate basis.","This represents a fundamentally new way to think of, group and treat diseases previously and otherwise thought of as disparate and requiring distinct therapies \u2013 that is mechanism-based treatment directed not by a disease organ-specific manifestations, but by the disease's fundamental cause and mechanism. We're also encouraged by the safety profile that we have observed thus far for dupilumab in these settings.","I'd like to remind you that the current regulatory framework does not allow for a mechanism-based approach to treatment, but rather an indication-based approach. We are very interested in discussing this type of mechanism-based approach for treating allergic or atopic disease with the regulatory authorities while we continue to pursue more conventional approval strategies.","Turning now to Kevzara, our IL-6 receptor antibody for rheumatoid arthritis. As Len mentioned, we anticipate a regulatory decision in the United States, where we've been granted an FDA action date of May 22. In April of 2017, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use or CHMP adopted a positive opinion for Kevzara for the treatment of moderate to severe RA in adults. We expect a potential approval in Europe for Kevzara in the second quarter of 2017. We have also made regulatory submissions for Kevzara in Japan.","Beyond RA, we are currently enrolling patients in the Phase 2 clinical study of sarilumab for the treatment of polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis. We're also considering investigating the use of sarilumab in other indications.","Turning to our other late-stage programs, I'd like to begin with EYLEA. As Len mentioned, we are committed to maintaining our leadership position in bringing important advances to patients with retinal diseases. To that end, we are conducting two Phase 2 studies of EYLEA in combination with nesvacumab, our antibody to Ang2, one in diabetic macular edema or DME and another in neovascular age-related macular degeneration or wet AMD. Both studies are fully enrolled, and we will evaluate efficacy and safety at 36 weeks, which we expect in the second half of this year. In addition, we are also investing in EYLEA as a monotherapy in a Phase 3 study in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema. This study, called PANORAMA, continues to enroll patients.","I'd like to spend a few moments focusing on findings from the long-term follow-up of our Phase 3 VIEW 1 study of EYLEA in patients with wet AMD, which were recently published in Ophthalmology Retina. As background, existing long-term data with other anti-VEGF agents, most notably from the government-sponsored CATT study, have shown that early visual gains obtained with anti-VEGF agents were not maintained over time. In fact, by the fifth year, patient had lost, on average, over three letters compared to their original baseline. Over 20% of patients have progressed to become legally blind by year five.","It had been postulated that this loss of vision is due to inexorable progression of the disease process itself over time, even in the face of anti-VEGF treatment. Others had raised the theory that the anti-VEGF agents themselves contribute to geographic atrophy over time and thus to the subsequent vision loss. In marked contrast to the CATT study, long-term follow-up data from the VIEW 1 study, where patients who were treated with fixed interval EYLEA dosing and received EYLEA on average every 12 weeks in year 2 and every 8 weeks in year 3 and 4 showed that the vision gains observed at the end of the first year were on average largely maintained at 4 years.","These long-term results provide the first evidence that long-term treatment with anti-VEGF agents can maintain vision gains in patients with wet AMD. We think these are very important findings for the field. This data support our longstanding view that regular fixed interval dosing regimens result in substantially better visual outcomes compared to PRN or treat-and-extend dosing regimens, which over time result in suboptimal visual acuity benefits and even in substantial visual loss.","We think this is probably true regardless of the anti-VEGF agent being utilized. Although we saw that more than 50% \u2013 about 50% of the patients in the second year exploratory treatment phase of our long-term trial received fixed corollary treatment and maintained their vision we are more comfortable that the every two-months regimen is likely to maintain vision over the long term based on larger and long-term experience.","With regards to convenience-based regimens such as PRN and treat-and-extend approaches, we think they are lacking in convincing and long-term evidence for their ability to maintain vision over the long-term. With regards to this point, we think that doctors should be strongly cautioning their patients that choosing convenience-based dosing has a high risk of causing permanent vision loss for their patients We think it is important that retinal specialists and public health officials begin to recognize the potential public health crisis that may be resulting from irregular dosing regimens that do not follow the FDA-recommended usage guidelines and that the loss of vision that these protocols may be causing may be needlessly occurring in thousands of patients, leaving many irrevocably legally blind.","Moving on to Praluent, our PCSK9 inhibitor antibody for lowering LDL cholesterol. We are pleased to announce that Praluent was recently approved in a 300-milligram once monthly dosing regimen. We expect to report top line data from the 18,000 patient ODYSSEY Outcomes study in the first quarter of 2018. Positive outcome data reported with PCSK9 inhibitors further supports the hypothesis that lowering LDL cholesterol with the PCSK9 inhibitor can reduce cardiovascular risk. We look forward to sharing data from our study in early 2018.","In addition to our efforts with Praluent and cardiovascular disease, we are also developing evinacumab, our antibody to Angptl-3 for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or homozygous FH. In March of 2017, we announced that the FDA granted evinacumab Breakthrough Designation Status. Just a few weeks ago, we presented a positive data from a Phase 2 proof of concept study of evinacumab in patients with homozygous FH. This data showed that patients who normally don't respond well to statins or to PCSK9 experienced an average reduction of 50% in their LDL cholesterol following two subcutaneous injections of evinacumab with an acceptable safety profile.","Our immuno-oncology portfolio continues to progress. Our potentially pivotal study of Regeneron 2810, our PD-1 antibody, continues to enroll patients in the cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma study. We look forward to presenting data from our expansion on in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma patients from our Phase 1 trial at an all-abstract session at the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, in June.","We also expect to initiate clinical studies in non-small cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma in 2017. Our second checkpoint inhibitor, REGN3767, an antibody to LAG-3 is also currently in clinical development where we are studying it both in the mono-therapy setting and in combination with our PD1 antibody. As a reminder, we expect additional IO targets to enter development over the next several years.","Additionally, our bispecific CD20xCD3 antibody is also currently being studied in the clinic, as well as in mono-therapy and in combination with our PD-1 antibody. Determining the optimal dosage level with these therapies that are activating the immune system is very important as witnessed by some of the toxicities demonstrated in other drug classes such as the CAR-Ts. While the process has been slow, we believe we are nearing dose selection.","Also in late-stage development is suptavumab, also known as REGN2222, which is an antibody in development for respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. Our Phase 3 study has finished enrolling patients, and we expect to report top line data from this study in the second half of the year.","We're also advancing our Phase 2 program for fasinumab, our nerve growth factor antibody for pain.","Development in other parts of our early-stage pipeline continues to advance. REGN2477, our Activin A antibody is in clinical development for the treatment of the rare disease Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva, or FOP. We expect to begin a Phase 2 trial in this indication in the second half of 2017. We are also studying REGN2477 in combination with trevogrumab, our antibody to GFD8, in a Phase 1 trial which is fully enrolled.","Finally, we also initiated Phase 1 multiple ascending dose trial in asthma with REGN3500, our antibody interleukin-33 for inflammatory diseases, in the first quarter of 2017. I think it's important to remind you that all of these programs and all the antibodies in our pipeline are entirely developed and discovered in-house.","Before I turn the call over to Bob, I want to take a moment to share my excitement about the first group of Regeneron Science Talent Search winners who were announced in March. Our sponsorship of this storied high school science competition underscores our commitment to fostering the next generation of scientific leaders. After meeting these promising high school students, we feel encouraged that our future is in good hands.","With that, let me turn the call over to Bob Terifay.","Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. First quarter 2017 U.S. net sales of EYLEA or aflibercept were $854 million versus $781 million in the first quarter of 2016. This represents growth of 9% year-over-year. Ex-U.S. net sales of EYLEA were $484 million compared to $419 million in the first quarter of 2016. This represents growth of 16% year-over-year.","EYLEA is approved in approximately 100 countries for the treatment of wet AMD and DME. EYLEA continues to be the market-leading product among FDA-approved anti-VEGF agents for all of its approved indications in the United States.","U.S. EYLEA net sales in the first quarter were impacted by a slight decrease in distributor or inventory as well as an increase in the gross-to-net margin, which Bob Landry will discuss in more detail. Based on a qualitative market research survey we conducted in the first quarter, EYLEA market share remained consistent at approximately 66% of the FDA-approved anti-VEGF market. Also based on this survey, FDA approved anti-VEGF therapies account for approximately 56% of the overall anti-VEGF market.","In term of treatment regimens, as George noted, the variable interval dosing regimens that are often used in the treatment of retinal diseases with the anti-VEGF agents can contribute to inadequate vision improvements and we believe are not optimal for long-term maintenance of visual acuity. We are focused on educating retinal physicians and their patients on the benefits of using dosing regimens supported by evidence-based medicine and approved by the FDA.","The recent approval and launch of Dupixent or dupilumab in the United States is the beginning of a new chapter for Regeneron. Dupixent was approved for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis at the end of March. As Len mentioned, the drug is commercially available to patients. Our field force is engaged with and educating the 7,000 or so targeted dermatologists, allergists and immunologists in the United States.","The targeted patient population consists of roughly 300,000 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who have the greatest need. These are the patients who've exhausted all approved therapies and that failed or are unable to tolerate unapproved use of immunosuppressants. Though it's quite early in the launch, we are pleased with what we have seen so far and I'd like to share with you some of the details of the ongoing launch.","Firstly, we believe that the importance of good market access cannot be underestimated. To that end, we were very thoughtful about pricing Dupixent following multiple discussions with key stakeholders. Our goal for access is that utilization management criteria reflect good medical practice, which means that Dupixent should be prescribed by specialists such as dermatologists, allergists and immunologists to patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, who have not responded to maximum topical cortical steroids. We do not believe that requiring patients to take potentially toxic off-label systemic immunosuppressants is appropriate now that Dupixent is approved and available.","Two of the largest pharmacy benefits managers or PBMs have provided coverage right from the beginning. Coverage at these two PBMs account for approximately 25% of lives in commercial plans in the United States. We've been actively engaged with additional payers, and based on these conversations, we believe, are well-positioned to receive broad coverage by the end of the year. We hope that these decisions will come early since eligible patients have been waiting for a long time for a new treatment for this debilitating disease.","To-date, we estimate that over 1,800 physicians across all 50 states have already written a Dupixent prescription. There have been over 3,500 prescriptions for new patients written for Dupixent as of today. I would like to remind you that this number only represents the prescriptions written by physicians. It is not a reflection of the number of prescriptions that have been dispensed. Writing the prescriptions starts the coverage approval process. We estimate that the coverage decision should take several weeks, so it's too early for us to predict how many of these prescriptions will ultimately be approved for insurance coverage and dispensed. However, the early signs are encouraging, and we look forward to updating you during the second quarter.","Outside of the United States, to remind everyone, in the fourth quarter 2016, we filed a Marketing Authorization Application or MAA for Dupixent and hope to have European approval by year end.","Turning now to Kevzara or sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. We've been granted an FDA action date of May 22nd. We'll be co-promoting Kevzara in the United States. Our sales force is on board and is preparing for the anticipated launch. In Europe, Kevzara has received a positive opinion from the CHMP and our collaborator, Sanofi Genzyme, is gearing up for a potential launch in Europe later this year as well.","Turning now to Praluent or alirocumab. As reported by Sanofi, net sales in the first quarter were $36 million worldwide with the U.S. accounting for $25 million of the total. I would like to note that there was an impact in the marketplace from the injunction ruling against us in the first quarter of 2017, which was eventually stayed pending appeal. We are pleased to announce the Praluent was recently approved in a 300-milligram once monthly dosing regimen.","We continue to be disappointed by the uptake of the PCSK9 inhibitor class, but remain optimistic given the recent positive Outcomes data for this class and our own Outcomes data are expected in early 2018, which if positive could have an impact on demand. We remain committed to our efforts to improve Praluent access and bring this important product to more patients who can benefit.","With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry.","Robert E. Landry - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. During today's call, I'll discuss our first quarter 2017 financial performance and highlight changes to a few of our full-year 2017 guidance line items.","In the first quarter of 2017, we earned $2.92 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $337 million. This represents a year-over-year increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income of 22% and 23%, respectively. I'd like to remind everyone that these growth numbers are based upon revised first quarter 2016 non-GAAP net income and EPS results relating to the company's adaption of Accounting Standard Update 2016-09 in the second quarter of 2016. This accounting standard requires companies to recognize excess tax benefits in connection with employee exercises of stock options in the income statement. You can access these revised numbers and further information in our Form 10-Q filed earlier this morning.","Regeneron's first quarter 2016 and 2017 non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense and includes the income tax effect of non-GAAP reconciling items. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release. Total revenues in the first quarter of 2017 were $1.3 billion, which represented year-over-year growth of 10% over the first quarter of 2016. Net product sale were $858 million in the first quarter of 2017, compared to $784 million in the first quarter of 2016.","EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $854 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $781 million in the first quarter of 2016, which represents an increase of 9%. For the full year 2017, we reaffirm our U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance of year-over-year single-digit percentage growth.","During the first quarter of 2017, EYLEA experienced a slight drawdown in U.S. distributor inventory levels yet remained within our normal one- to two-week targeted range. Additionally, we experienced an increase in our EYLEA gross to net percentage as a result of two factors. First, earlier this year, we started offering a discount to all offices regardless of volume for competitive reasons. And, second, there's been a small increase in the number of Medicaid patients being treated with EYLEA.","Ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales, which are recorded by our collaborator Bayer, were $484 million in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to $419 million in the first quarter of 2016, representing a 16% increase on a reported basis. On an operational basis or constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 19%. In the first quarter of 2017, Regeneron recognized $175 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the United States. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $194 million.","Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $210 million for the first quarter of 2017. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line item primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred commercialization-related expenses, and our share of profits or losses in connection with the commercialization of antibodies.","In the first quarter 2017, our share of losses in connection with the commercialization of Praluent, Dupixent, and Kevzara was $108 million. This can be found in Table 4 of our earnings release. This loss represents increased spending related to the Dupixent and Kevzara launches, while we continue to proactively monitor and manage our investment in the global commercialization of Praluent.","Netted within these losses were the global sales of Praluent as recognized by our partner Sanofi, which for the first quarter of 2017 were $36 million. The U.S. net sales of Praluent in the first quarter 2017 were clearly impacted from the news regarding the January 5, 2017, issuance of the permanent injunction prohibiting the commercialization of Praluent in the United States, which was subsequently stayed pending appeal.","In the first quarter of 2017, other revenue increased significantly as compared to the first quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily due to reimbursements of research and development costs in connection with our collaboration agreement with Teva, which was entered into in September 2016. You can find a summary of the components of other revenue in the MD&A section of our 10-Q.","Turning now to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $434 million for the first quarter of 2017. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total non-GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, was $189 million in the first quarter of 2017. Our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. For 2017, we'd like to reiterate our previously provided guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $950 million to $1.025 billion. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $243 million for the first quarter of 2017. We are tightening and lowering our full-year 2017 guidance for non-GAAP SG&A to $1.14 billion to $1.2 billion from our previous guidance range of $1.175 billion to $1.25 billion.","Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue, was $74 million for the first quarter of 2017. We are lowering and tightening our full year 2017 guidance of Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses to be in the range of $385 million to $425 million, from $400 million to $450 million.","Before shifting to taxes, I would also like to note that operating cost related to our Limerick manufacturing facility that have not been capitalized were recognized in cost of goods sold and, therefore, had a negative impact on our first quarter 2017 gross margin as compared to the third and fourth quarters of 2016.","Turning now to taxes. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter 2017 was approximately 42% as compared to approximately 45% for the first quarter of 2016, which as stated earlier has been revised for the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09.","For the full year 2017, we continue to guide our effective tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 38%. This guidance includes an estimate of the full year tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation. As stated on previous calls, there will be volatility in our effective tax rate quarter to quarter since the tax benefits of stock-based compensation can only be included based on actual exercises in the quarter. We expect the majority of our stock-based compensation tax benefits to be recognized in the latter part of the year as we have a large number of stock options that vest or expire in the fourth quarter.","From a cash flow and balance sheet perspective, we ended the first quarter of 2017 with cash and marketable securities of $2.3 billion. Our capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2017 were $50 million. We are tightening and lowering our full year 2017 capital expenditure guidance to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million from our previous guidance range of $375 million to $425 million.","We note that this represents a significantly lower capital spend than the previous two years as we are nearing completion of a few major capital projects including our drug substance manufacturing facility in Limerick, Ireland.","Also, we finalized the refinancing related to our Tarrytown headquarters in March 2017. Further details can be found on our website in the 8-K filed in association with this transaction or in our most recent 10-Q that was filed earlier this morning.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Manisha.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Bob. Sylvia, we'd now like to open the line for Q&A. In the interest of time, we'd like to request that you limit yourself to one question. We will be available in the office after the call for a follow-up Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Geoff Porges from Leerink Partners.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much for taking the question and congratulations on all the progress. And Len, don't take this the wrong way, but congratulations on the cash flow and filing the Q account.","I wanted to ask, George, just a few questions \u2013 related questions on the pipeline. Looking through the Q this morning, there's no mention of your C5 antibody nor of your CD3 biospecific. Could you jus comment on the status of those programs?","And then, on the ODYSSEY Outcomes study, given the timing that you've provided to us, can you give us a sense of what you estimate the median duration of exposure will be in the study and what effect that might have on the likely effect size given the offset of the lower dosing that you may have with some patients?","George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. A lot of questions in there. First, we did actually comment on the CD20 by CD3 biospecific that it's moving along, that basically we've spent a lot of time because as obviously, you've all noticed that there have been concerns with similar types of agents, as well as the CAR-T approaches in terms of really getting the right dose and avoiding very dangerous toxicity. So, we've been very careful about dose selection in that program, and we're hoping very close to be \u2013 to the point where we can initiate larger trials.","In terms of our C5 antibody, I don't know how much we've said publicly about it, but I guess we've said that we will be in the clinic with it this year and I'm sorry I didn't make any references. That was just an oversight on my part.","In terms of our Outcomes study, I have to say there are so many differences between our design and the four-year design that I think it's almost impossible to try to model it and figure out are the results going to be substantially different.","I think that the four-year data pretty strongly show that its results are very consistent with the sort of benefits that, when obtained in terms of cardiovascular outcomes with the proportional LDL lowering, and that's pretty much exactly what we hope to show, that we're pretty much on the same sort of curve as the statins and now the first results that are coming out of the PCSK9 class.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Our following question comes from Chris Raymond from Raymond James.","Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Question on Dupixent. So, according to some of our market checks, it looks like the breakdown among patients by age is that roughly half are adults, you've got maybe 20% adolescents, but then there's another maybe sort of 33% or 34% that are treated by docs today that are under 12.","I know you guys have talked about the clinical path for kids 6 to 12 but, at least according to our data anyway, derms today have a sizable patient load under 6, and there's probably many more who haven't made their way to a derm. So, can you maybe talk about the potential to get at that market of kids under 6? Like, for example, some of our data says that maybe as much as 12% or so of patient load are actually even under 2. So, what's the setup, I guess, there for treating kids younger? Thanks.","George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. You are absolutely right that a lot of these allergic diseases, it's not only atopic dermatitis, but eosinophilic esophagitis and so forth and so on, unfortunately, afflict the very young. There's a very deliberate process that we work with with regulatory authorities to progress to the youngest in our population because we all feel that we have to be very careful, and we're working very closely with the FDA to follow along those guidelines to be able to bring this treatment down the line to the youngest of patients who really need it. But as you said, there is a very important unmet need in these populations for all sorts of allergic diseases.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","One thing, just to amplify what George said, is that the FDA clearly recognizes it. They had an advisory group, and they in fact pushed us to start on younger populations even sooner than one might normally in the development program.","So, I think we get it. The agency gets it. They've granted us I think breakthrough status for \u2013 I can't remember which age group, maybe \u2013 Manisha, do you remember?","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","12 to 17.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","12 to 17. So, I mean, I think everybody gets it, and we've got good early data, and as George said, we're sort of doing this logically, and trying to move to where that need is. Of course, the chronocity of treatment from a commercial point of view, once you make it to adulthood and you have the disease, we should be clear that this is \u2013 we don't view this as treating an episodic disease. These people have disease chronically and will need chronic treatment, which may be different than children who can possibly outgrow this.","Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So, should we see a trial then start maybe for kids under six at some point? I guess that's the key question.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yes. You will see us moving towards younger age groups steadily.","Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","Our following question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the launch of Dupixent. I have one question on EYLEA. It seems that you reported pretty strong numbers for EYLEA sales in the U.S. and Roche reported strong numbers for Lucentis. So does that mean the market is growing at a higher rate this year or are the branded medicines taking share from off-label Avastin?","And then, maybe for George, a quick question on you PD-1 trial for non-small cell lung cancer. Given there's a debate around PD-L1 levels, I was wondering if you can comment how do you plan to design that trial in terms of stratification of PD-L1 expression levels? And do you see any differentiation from your PD-1 and the other marketed bio drugs? Thank you.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Okay. So let's take that \u2013 Ying, thanks \u2013 in two parts. First, Bob can address what he thinks the market size is overall for anti-VEGF therapy, and what the branded versus non-branded split is. And then George can deal with your question on lung cancer and PD-1.","Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","I think it's \u2013 as we mentioned, the overall branded anti-VEGF market year-over-year grew by 9%, which is consistent with what we saw in our growth. So, you can assume that both products had approximately 9% growth. We did mention that in terms of what portion of the market is the branded market, it's approximately 65%. So...","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Which hasn't really changed...","Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","... hasn't changed.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","...so the market itself seems to be growing, although our figures showed a slight inventory drawdown, and we don't know well-enough what happened with Lucentis and whether there was some destocking at the end of last quarter, and then restocking with their new formulation or not. So, to get more granularity on that, Ying, you'll have to pester Roche. George?","George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. About PD-1 and PD-L1 levels and so forth, I don't think there is actually that much of a controversy. I think that all the data shows that in most cases a higher PDL expression correlates with better responses. The controversy I think that you're referring to has to do with the fact that the first line lung study from Merck with KEYTRUDA was very impressively positive whereas the very similar population studied with the BMS drug was not. And this did not really seem to be dependent on the PDL levels. People are really working hard to understand why the Bristol drug showed very disappointing results in that study.","Our goal is to show that our drug is very effective in the various lung cancer indications and we're designing, we hope and we believe robust studies to demonstrate that. And we are, I believe, going to be announcing that we're going to be \u2013 when we initiate these studies in the very, very near future.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Good. Next question.","Operator","Our following question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Question for Bob, could you contrast for us a little bit the cost of launching Praluent versus Kevzara and Dupixent? Essentially, when you think about the magnitude of cost to launch those two drugs, how do they differ?","And second, if we think about the international operations of Praluent, roughly when should we expect them to breakeven? Essentially, what revenue do you need internationally to breakeven on that product?","Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","I'll talk in generalities. I'm not going to get into any specifics on the financials, but what I can say is there is a major difference between Dupixent and Praluent in terms of the targeted audiences. Praluent is competing in the hypercholesterolemia market. That is a condition that's primarily treated by primary care physicians, but also was treated by a large group of cardiologists and lipidologists.","So, in terms of the effort on Praluent, one has to go broad to be able to get to the large physician audience. In terms of Dupixent, as we mentioned in the United States, we're targeting about 7,000 specialists. So, the effort is more limited in terms of who you have to call on and what types of support you have to give to those patients.","In terms of ex U.S., it's premature to talk about breakeven.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And just to reiterate what Bob said, I think if you do the math, we've hit about \u2013 in the neighborhood of about 25% of the doctors we targeted have actually written a prescription, which is really pretty good at this stage of the launch.","Next question?","Operator","Our following question comes from Carter Gould from UBS.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Congrats on all the progress with Dupixent. I got one for George or Len on Regeneron 2222. The PR mentioned enrollment was 1,200 but I think you've been targeting 1,500-plus patients. Does this impact your (48:41) for the primary endpoint or change how we should be thinking about the likelihood of hitting on one-time-a-season dosing? And I guess if anyone wanted to comment on the competitiveness of this program given Sanofi's distributor (48:52) program and subsequent decision to partner with MedImmune, that would be appreciated as well. Thank you.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","I'll comment on the latter, and George can comment on the former. The decisions that people make aren't always the best ones, and we love our partnership with Sanofi, but remember they are the ones that turned back EYLEA. So we'll see them in the marketplace. And we think we have a very good entry, and we love the friendly competition with really good partners. George can get more into the specifics.","George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Well, as you know, the power of the study is more dependent on events rather than numbers of patients that actually enrolled. We feel, though, there's always concerns, we feel that we're adequately powered, and we're hoping that the study will meet its expectations.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Our following question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe \u2013 George, I was intrigued by your comments on the long-term EYLEA VIEW data and the importance of adhering to the approved dosing interval. Do you think that proposition would also apply to Novartis' RTH, recognizing we don't have the Phase 3 data yet? But as you think what they're trying to accomplish with their drug, maybe help us think about the importance of longer-term data? Thank you.","George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. I think it will be a very long time before one has the long-term data with a new agent to be able to say whether or not it could possibly not only cause initial visual gains but maintain them, which is, I think, more important over the four- and five-year time intervals.","Right now, we have the only such study that shows that, and the only such data. I think that the field has been going in the wrong direction focusing on convenience, okay, as opposed to focusing on vision. We all know, we all cherish our vision. There's nothing more important than maintaining our vision, and we think that there's been an over-focus on convenience as opposed to on bringing back \u2013 these drugs have the ability to give back vision, and we have now shown that there's at least one drug with one regimen or an assorted regimen that has the ability to maintain this over the long term. And I think that we all have to focus on that and less on trying to save an injection or two per year, which is at most what all of these non-medicine-based approaches have been doing.","I think this is really important for the field, and we hope, as Bob says, that doctors can be educated about this and stop experimenting on their patients and instead follow the FDA guidelines.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alethia Young from Credit Suisse.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the progress over the quarter. I just had one on EoE. Can you talk maybe about the potential market size and thoughts on endpoints? I know there's been some conversions in public domains around the FDA discussing endpoints. Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So, in terms of market size, this is very difficult to ascertain. We know that the market size quote-unquote is \"increasing.\" What we don't know whether that's because there's more patients being diagnosed or it's just tracking the general increase in allergic diseases. So we remind you that there's a strong set of evidence to indicate that eosinophilic esophagitis can be a manifestation of food allergy. And so, as an allergy, we're seeing lots of these increase. The actual numbers, we just don't feel we have a good handle on the number of patients. If Bob wants to give a shot at it, that would be great.","In terms of endpoints, we saw clear results, as George mentioned, both on the patient-reported outcomes as well as the hard anatomic. In some cases in the past, for example, in ulcer disease or erosive esophagitis, FDA has used endpoints such as healing, actually, by endoscopy measured. We have not had the conversation yet with the agency about these data. They're very new to us, so we will do that and then sort of let you know what it's going to take from an approval perspective. Bob, you have...","Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Well, I think Len really nailed the situation with EoE. It is a disease that has generally been underdiagnosed. The current estimate in the U.S. among adults is somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000, but the true instance could be higher based upon underdiagnosis.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Okay.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on Dupi as well and kind of how you're thinking about the dynamics of a bolus of severe atopic dermatitis patients for Dupixent as we see these early trends and think about the launch going forward. 1,000 scripts written per week is obviously quite an encouraging number but, one, obviously, we can't expect to go on forever. So, how much pent-up demand do you see out there now that you're in the field? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yes. So, that's a very, also a very difficult question to get a hard answer on. When you talk to some doctors, they'll tell you, well, they had a list of patients that they were going to bring in. When you talk to other doctors, they'll tell you that they're not \u2013 the patients are just sort of showing up and they're incident patients which they are constantly seeing in their practice and that patients are aware of the product and want to discuss it with their doctors.","How long this goes on? Well, I don't know, and we don't have enough information to see what the trends are. Have we peaked because of a bolus? Are we increasing still? Are we decreasing? Really too early to tell you. We do know that we're focusing on in the 100,000 to 200,000-patient range who are the most difficult to treat. I think with any new drug class, some of it is also going to be dependent upon the doctors' reaction. The great data that I think we have in our label encourages doctors to try the product. But it will take individual experience and successes with individual patients for them to continue to use it. And so far, we even have heard some early anecdotes on that line as well.","So, bottom line is we just don't have enough information to guide you, we'd like to know ourselves. And I think anybody's guess at this point is as good as anybody else.","Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","I think Len makes an important point. There are patients in need of this important therapy and our job beyond this initial bolus is really to educate physicians and patients on the fact that there is now something that could help these patients.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","We do want to reach out and we'll reach out appropriately to patients directly because we believe, as Bob was just suggesting, that there are patients who have dropped out of the medical system because they've been to so many different doctors with so many different regimens and nothing has helped them that making them aware that there is something new is an important part of our effort. Next question.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator. In the essence of time, we have one last question. After that, we will be in our office to take additional follow-up questions and our apologies to those who are in queue and who didn't get a chance to ask their questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hartaj Singh from Oppenheimer.","Hartaj Singh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Hi. Thank you. Thanks for letting me take the \u2013 I have a question. We just noticed actually slightly different take on just on your operating expenditures you've managed your P&L very well this quarter. It looks like, on just a straight run rate into the end of the year, you would actually come below your guidance and with just 110 million shares outstanding, that's not trivial. Just any thoughts on the progression of operating expenditures and how you're thinking of managing it with the Kevzara launch and all the other activities? Thank you.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. No. Thanks for the question. You're right in terms of the guidance that we've set for the full year and where we are for the first quarter. As you can imagine, we do obviously spend a lot of time and effort in terms of forecasting where we're going to come out on a by-quarter basis, and the quarters are not always consistent. We are going to be in kind of full bloom in the second quarter when we get hopefully our PDUFA approval with Kevzara, and we'll have our full strength out there in the marketplace. And again, we do expect higher expenditures with regards to SG&A and with unreimbursed R&D in the second half of 2017.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, operator.

An archive of this webcast will be available on our Web site under Events and Presentations for 30 days.","Joining me on the call today are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President of Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer; Bob Terifay, Executive Vice President, Commercial; and Bob Landry, Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A.","I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call include forward-looking statements about Regeneron.

Once our call concludes, our CFO, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions.","With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Leonard Schleifer.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.","Thanks, Michael. A very good morning to everyone who has joined us on the call and webcast today. 2015 was another successful and productive year for Regeneron. EYLEA delivered impressive global growth and we received approval for and launched Praluent, which is indicated in the U.S. as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, who require additional lowering of LDL cholesterol.","We made significant advances in our late-stage pipeline submitting a Biologics License Application or BLA for sarilumab in rheumatoid arthritis and advancing Phase 3 clinical development for dupilumab in atopic dermatitis and asthma. In 2015, we also advanced two new antibodies into Phase 3; REGN2222 for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus or RSV infection in infants and our anti-NGF antibody for osteoarthritis pain. We also advanced our early-stage pipeline with progress across multiple therapeutic areas including retinal diseases, cancer, infectious diseases and cardiovascular diseases.","Turning to EYLEA performance, EYLEA is now the market-leading brand in anti-VEGF therapy for retinal disease in United States and continue to exhibit strong growth both in the U.S. and worldwide. We saw approximately 54% growth year-over-year in the U.S. with sales of $2.68 billion. On a worldwide basis, EYLEA sales were approximately 4.1 billion for the full year. For the full year 2016, we estimate U.S. EYLEA net sales to grow approximately 20% over full year 2015 U.S. net sales.","We are focused on maintaining our leadership in the retinal space. We are continuing clinical development with EYLEA, where we have ongoing combination programs with PDGF and with ANG2 and are pursuing important additional indications for EYLEA that George will review later in the call.","Turning now to Praluent, we are proud to have brought the first PCSK9 inhibitor to the market in the United States for patients with uncontrolled LDL cholesterol, which was approved and launched in July of last year. We are still in the early stages of this launch and have been working diligently to provide broad access to eligible patients and educating physicians and patients in order to increase adoption. Bob Terifay will provide some additional metrics on how the launch is progressing.","Our mission at Regeneron for 25 plus years has been to consistently and repeatedly bring important new medicines to patients in need, and we feel that we are well positioned to deliver on this mission with our innovative pipeline. Building on last year\u2019s approval of Praluent, we anticipate at least one approval each year for the coming years. In 2016, we anticipate the approval of sarilumab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Our breakthrough product dupilumab in atopic dermatitis is progressing and we expect to report top line Phase 3 data and submit a BLA in the U.S. during this year.","Beyond dupilumab, we have a rapidly developing late and early stage pipeline that now consist of 13 product candidates that were all discovered by the scientists at Regeneron, and we expect to put additional new candidates into the clinic this year. George will provide some perspective on this during his remarks. In summary, we are in the midst of a very exciting time at Regeneron with many important events anticipated in 2016.","With that, let me turn the call over to Dr. George Yancopoulos, Regeneron\u2019s Chief Scientific Officer. He will be followed by Bob Terifay and then by Bob Landry.","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D.","Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. As Len said, 2015 was a very successful and exciting year for R&D at Regeneron. I would like to begin with EYLEA. Diabetic retinopathy is the most common cause of vision loss in patients with diabetes and as a result of microvascular damage to the blood vessels in the retina. If left untreated, diabetic retinopathy can progress to profound and sometimes acute vision loss.","While EYLEA is approved to treat diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetic macular edema or DME, we believe that it could benefit a much broader patient population with diabetic retinopathy who do not have DME where there is no approved anti-VEGF therapy. Therefore, in the first quarter of this year, we plan to initiate Panorama [ph], a Phase 3 study of EYLEA in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema.","The National Institute of Health will also independently investigate the potential role of anti-VEGF therapy in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. This study called Protocol-W will be sponsored by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network or DRCR and will compare EYLEA to sham [ph] in patients with severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Protocol-W is expected to begin in the first quarter.","Our Phase 2 study of EYLEA in combination with our PDGF receptor antibody delivered as a co-formulated injection in Wet age-related macular degeneration or Wet AMD is ongoing and we expect to see top line data from this study by year end. This program has been granted fast track designation by the FDA.","Data from the Phase 1 study of EYLEA in combination with nesvacumab, our Ang2 antibody delivered as a co-formulated injection was presented just last week at the Angiogenesis Conference. These data show that the combination of EYLEA with nesvacumab was safe and well tolerated in patients with AMD and in patients with DME. We plan to initiate Phase 2 studies that will include both these patient populations in the first half of the year.","As Len mentioned, our Praluent launch is underway and you\u2019ll hear further details from Bob Terifay on the commercial front. Our 18,000-patient OUTCOMES trial is ongoing and we expect the first interim analysis, which will test for futility to occur later this year based upon 50% of the expected events from the trial. Also, we could potentially have our second interim analysis, which occurs after 75% of the targeted primary events have accrued by the end of this year and this interim analysis will test for overwhelming efficacy and futility.","As we previously disclosed, the stopping rule for the efficacy analysis is a hazard ratio of 0.802 favoring Praluent as well as consistently across subgroups and regions, positive trends for secondary endpoints including all-cause mortality and no excess non-cardiovascular mortality. These last points are all important as we would not want to unblind a trial early because of efficacy in the primary endpoint at the cost of not reaching significant and important secondary endpoints. In addition to the OUTCOMES trial, we plan to submit a supplemental BLA in the first half of the year for the Praluent monthly dosing regimen.","Turning now to sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody for rheumatoid arthritis. A regulatory submission was accepted by the FDA and has been granted an action date of October 30, 2016. The Phase 3 MONARCH trial, which is a superiority study of sarilumab monotherapy versus adalimumab is fully enrolled and we expect top line data from this study in the first half of 2016. Our European regulatory submission for sarilumab is expected to be made in the second half of 2016.","I share Len\u2019s enthusiasm for dupilumab, our IL-4\/13 pathway blocking antibody, which is currently in Phase 3 clinical studies in asthma and in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis where it\u2019s been granted breakthrough designation, in part because there are no FDA approved systemic therapy for adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.","We expect to report top line data from the Phase 3 atopic dermatitis study; SOLO 1, SOLO 2 and CHRONOS in the first half of this year and to complete the rolling BLA submission in the second half of the year. Our approximately 1,700-patient pivotal Phase 3 study of dupilumab in asthma is also enrolling. We also continue to explore other indications for dupilumab such as nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis as well as other allergic or IL-4\/13 mediated diseases.","Our Nerve Growth Factor antibody or NGF antibody fasinumab is another late-stage pipeline candidate. Pain is one of the leading reasons that patients visit a doctor and osteoarthritis is one of the major sources of pain in adults, particularly older adults. The increasing use of prescription opioids to treat pain has led to a growing epidemic of drug addiction and overdose-related fatalities as well as other opioid-related side effects.","Blocking NGF has already shown the ability to improve pain compared to placebo or an active comparator such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs in Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials. We now have a clear path forward from the FDA and will be starting a 10,000-pateint long-term treatment Phase 3 clinical study of fasinumab in the first half of the year. We anticipate reporting data from a 16-week study in osteoarthritis pain in the first half of the year.","In our early stage pipeline, we plan to share data from our Phase 1\/2 studies of nesvacumab, our antibody to Angptl-3 for dyslipidemia in the first half as well as data from our ongoing immuno-oncology programs such as our PD-1 program and the CD20 by CD3 bispecific program. We have obviously been very busy and productive. In fact, this year we expect to submit a record number of INDs and we look forward to sharing more details with you as these programs move into the clinic.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob Terifay.","Robert J. Terifay","Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter 2015 was a productive one for Regeneron. We continued to see strong sales growth for EYLEA or aflibercept injection both in the United States and the rest of the world. We also made substantial progress in securing access and reimbursement for Praluent or alirocumab among U.S. payors. In addition, the European launch for Praluent commenced.","Starting with EYLEA. Fourth quarter U.S. net sales grew 44% year-over-year. Net U.S. EYLEA sales in the fourth quarter were $746 million. Full year U.S. EYLEA sales were $2.68 billion, which represent a 54% year-over-year growth. A survey of 201 U.S. retinal specialists who evaluated their reported usage of VEGF inhibitors in the fourth quarter of 2015 indicates that EYLEA continues to be the market-leading product among FDA approved anti-VEGF agents in all of our labeled indications in terms of market share of treated eyes. Importantly, the market share of treated eyes for EYLEA in DME is roughly double that for ranibizumab and similar to that for off-label bevacizumab.","Turning now to Praluent. As reported by Sanofi, net sales in the fourth quarter were $7 million, which understates actual physician and patient demand. As we reminded you last quarter, we anticipated that it would take some time for commercial and government payors to conduct formulary reviews, make reimbursement coverage decisions and begin to process patient claims. Given these reasons, as well as strict utilization management criteria, we continue to expect a gradual uptick.","In response to potential delays in formulary and reimbursement decisions, we\u2019re offering free product to appropriate patients consistent with our labeled indications who are awaiting an insurance coverage decision. This delays uptick in commercial sales reporting. For example, much of Medicare Part D or government-paid patients are receiving free drug pending formulary coverage, which is expected later in the quarter. So, performance cannot be solely judged on sales or filled prescriptions. ","As a reminder, the reimbursement environment is complex and is carefully managed by payors. Our goal has been to ensure that payors and healthcare providers understand the value that Praluent can offer to patients. And to that end, we have been and are still actively engaged in discussions with payors.","There are approximately 240 million lives in the United States that have a drug benefit covered by commercial insurance or Medicare Part D plans. Coverage decisions have already been made for approximately 90% of these lives. However, implementation is ongoing and we expect continued rollout of the coverage over the next several months.","Overall, for approximately 50% of the covered lives, a single PCSK-9 antibody has been chosen in an exclusive or preferred position. In these exclusive or preferred cases, we estimate that Praluent was chosen for about 60% of the lives. The preference for Praluent was particularly evident in the Medicare Part D decision.","In Medicare, 80% of the lives have a single PCSK-9 antibody in an exclusive or preferred position. For these exclusive or preferred Medicare Part D lives, Praluent was selected approximately 95% of the time. We believe these Medicare coverage decisions are particularly important because our major indication for Praluent is for patients with a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and these patients tend to be older.","According to our estimates, about 28% of stat patients in the United States are Medicare Part D patients. We are pleased to see that Praluent is resonating well with payors. As plans begin to activate their coverage, we anticipate a potential uptake in prescription volume. Importantly, almost 90% of all prescriptions processed by the hub are for our lower 75 milligram every other week dose.","As a reminder, in our Phase 3 clinical studies, the vast majority of Praluent patients achieved their LDL cholesterol goals with the 75 milligram every other week dose. We continue our efforts to educate both patients and physicians on the benefits of using PCSK-9 inhibitor therapy. Outside of the United States, Praluent was approved in EU in September with product available in several countries. Reimbursement discussions are currently underway with several governments across Europe.","In the fourth quarter, we submitted a BLA to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for sarilumab, our interleukin-6 or IL-6 receptor inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis. We will be co-promoting sarilumab with Sanofi in the United States and are actively recruiting our field-based team. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made over time.","We also continue to prepare for the potential U.S. launch of dupilumab, our IL-4 and IL-13 inhibitor in 2017. We\u2019ve recently informed Sanofi of our intent to co-promote dupilumab in the United States. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made at a later date.","Next month, we will have a significant presence at the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology meeting in Los Angeles and the American Academy of Dermatology meeting in Washington DC.","With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry.","Robert E. Landry","Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone who has joined us today. Overall, we are pleased with the full year performance Regeneron delivered in 2015. For the full year 2015, we are in $12.07 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of 1.4 billion. This represents a year-over-year growth in non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income of 21% and 19%, respectively, for the full year 2015.","In the fourth quarter of 2015, non-GAAP net income per diluted share increased 1% to $2.83 versus fourth quarter of 2014 and non-GAAP net income of 327 million was unchanged versus fourth quarter of 2014.","Regeneron\u2019s 2015 non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense related to our senior convertible notes, loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with conversions of a portion of our convertible notes during 2015, and an adjustment for income taxes. Non-GAAP income tax expense is based upon cash income taxes paid or payable for 2015. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release.","Total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2015 were 1.1 billion and 4.1 billion for the full year of 2015, which represented year-over-year growth of 37% for the three months and 46% for the full year. Net product sales were 750 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and 2.69 billion for the full year of 2015 compared to 522 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 1.75 billion for the full year of 2014.","EYLEA net product sales in the United States were 746 million in the fourth quarter and 2.68 billion in 2015 compared to 518 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 1.74 billion for the full year 2014, which represents an increase of 44% and 54%, respectively.","During the fourth quarter of 2015, EYLEA experienced a slight increase in U.S. distributory inventory levels as compared to the third quarter of 2015, and overall a slight decrease in comparison to the fourth quarter 2014 but remains within our normal one to two-week targeted range. As Len mentioned earlier, our U.S. EYLEA net sales growth guidance for full year 2016 over 2015 is approximately 20%.","Ex-U.S. EYLEA sales were 413 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 297 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, representing a 39% increase on a reported basis. Ex-U.S. EYLEA sales for the full year 2015 were 1.41 billion compared to 1.04 billion for 2014, representing a 36% increase on a reported basis.","On an operational basis or constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 54% for the three months and 58% for the full year 2015. Product revenue from ex-U.S. EYLEA sales is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer HealthCare.","In the fourth quarter of 2015, Regeneron recognized 140 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the United States and 467 million for the full year 2015. Total Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue for the fourth quarter was 165 million and 580 million for the full year 2015.","Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was 166 million for the fourth quarter and 759 million for the full year 2015. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses and our share of profits or losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies.","In the fourth quarter of 2015, our share of losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies, primarily Praluent, was 96 million and for the full year 2015 was 240 million, which can be found in Table 4 of our earnings release. Netted within these losses were the global sales of Praluent as recognized by our partner Sanofi of 7 million for the fourth quarter 2015 and 11 million for the full year 2015. Recall that Praluent was launched in the third quarter of 2015.","Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were 389 million for the fourth quarter and 1.37 billion for the full year 2015. Our unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators and R&D non-cash share-based compensation expense was 214 million for the three months and 570 million for the full year 2015. We note that this comes in slightly above our 2015 non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense guidance of 540 million to 560 million, primarily due to higher expenditures for our NGF program. Our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expenses.","For 2016, we\u2019d like to reiterate our previously provided guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of 875 million to 950 million. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D spend is driven by three factors; advancing our pipeline outside of the Sanofi and Bayer collaboration, particularly our programs for NGF, RSV and CD20 by CD3; our obligation to pay for 20% of the Phase 3 clinical development expense following the first positive Phase 3 results of our partnered antibodies, primarily driven by the potential positive dupilumab Phase 3 readout in the first half of 2016; the advancement of our immuno-oncology pipeline in collaboration with Sanofi and proprietary R&D initiatives such as those in the area of human genomics.","Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were 213 million for the fourth quarter and 646 million for the full year 2015. We expect non-GAAP SG&A expense in 2016 to be in the range of 925 million and 1 billion. The increase in our SG&A expense is primarily driven by the ongoing Praluent launch, which is entering its first full year of launch and preparing for the potential commercial launches of both sarilumab and dupilumab.","As we have mentioned previously, in 2015 we began paying significant cash income taxes as compared to prior periods. Cash tax as a percentage of non-GAAP pre-tax net income for this quarter as well as for all of 2015 is based on an estimate of the cash tax paid or payable for the full year. This amount continues to be substantially lower than our GAAP effective tax rate.","On a non-GAAP basis, cash taxes as a percentage of non-GAAP pre-tax net income for the fourth quarter of 2015 and for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015 was approximately 16% and 18%, respectively.","For 2016, our guidance for cash tax as a percentage of non-GAAP pre-tax income is 35% to 45%. This includes a one-time tax of approximately 222 million related to $600 million of our December 31, 2015 deferred revenue balance remaining from the immuno-oncology upfront payment from Sanofi that we received in the third quarter of 2015. The cash tax impact of the immuno-oncology upfront payment will be spread equally throughout the year.","Our capital expenditures for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015 was 678 million. We expect our capital expenditures to be between 580 million and 680 million for 2016. These expenses continue to build on the manufacturing expansions made in 2015, which include expanding our facilities in Rensselaer, New York and Limerick, Ireland as well as the continued expansion of our Tarrytown, New York headquarters.","We ended the fourth quarter of 2015 with cash and marketable securities of 1.7 billion. As we have previously mentioned, we have been opportunistically entering into agreements that reduce the number of our outstanding warrants that we issued in 2011 in connection with our convertible debt.","In the fourth quarter of 2015, we paid 50 million to reduce these outstanding warrants and in January 2016, we paid an additional 135 million to reduce more outstanding warrants. We intend to continue seeking opportunities to further reduce these outstanding warrants into 2016.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Michael.","Michael Aberman, M.D.","Thanks, Bob. Before starting the Q&A, I just want to correct quickly that the 10-K will be filed later this week not later this morning. With that operator, we can start the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ying Huang with Bank of America.","Ying Huang","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks very much for the questions. First of all, we know that Amgen\u2019s CV outcome trial will likely readout earlier than you guys. I want to ask you about the thought on that. So do you think that will put Praluent potentially at a disadvantage in the commercial market or actually you\u2019ll get a ripple effect, because both drugs are in the same class of PCSK-9 inhibitors? Secondly, maybe for Bob, some investors are a little concerned about the cost trend here. So can you kind of layout in the outer years, for the next three, five years, what are your thoughts for the year on SG&A and also R&D costs, and also maybe some trend in long-term tax? Thank you.","Michael Aberman, M.D.","Let me just remind people, one question. Thank you. Go ahead, Bob.","Robert J. Terifay","I think on the cardiovascular outcomes trial, obviously as George pointed out we feel it\u2019s very important that not only do we meet the primary endpoint but that we ensure that if there are key secondary endpoints that we allow them to come to fruition so that we ensure that we have a robust out of package. In terms of the impact of Amgen coming earlier than us, it would be speculative to really say what that means. But we do think that Amgen having positive data will be positive for the overall class.","Robert E. Landry","Ying, hi, it\u2019s Bob. With regards to your question on costs, certainly it\u2019s something that we take very serious about this. As we mentioned several times in the quarters last year, we are in the midst of a sizable Praluent launch against the very formidable opponent. And on top of that we are in the midst of launching sarilumab in the fourth quarter of 2016 and we\u2019re also preparing for first half 2017 for dupilumab. So for those three launches, it is putting stress on our SG&A number. With regards to R&D, we\u2019ve highlighted some drivers with regards to the increase in unreimbursed R&D, the biggest one probably being the NGF program. As you\u2019ve heard from Len and George earlier, the program is full-speed ahead with regards to entering Phase 3 very, very shortly. We\u2019re also moving forward with our RSV. Now these are both un-partnered products. And then again, we get our first positive Phase 3 readout for dupilumab in the first half of 2016 and as you know and as we\u2019ve said before, that\u2019s a driver with regards to us picking up 20% of the program cost associated with that. So that would not only include atopic dermatitis that would also include the asthma indication associated with that. So all of these things associated are putting some stress on our expenses and maybe Len may have a few additional comments.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.","Thanks, Bob. I would just say that if you study this industry and companies in it, nobody ever has a perfectly spaced pipeline. These spaces are usually too wide with lots of whitespace and lots of worry what to do, where is the next drug going to come from or if very infrequently as is the case here with Regeneron, there\u2019s a lot going on that\u2019s very compacted in time. We, of course, would rather have the latter than the former and that\u2019s what I think is that we\u2019re managing through. It\u2019s an exciting time. And approval in 2015 for Praluent, 2016 we hope for sarilumab, 2017 the first approval for dupilumab and beyond that approvals for dupilumab in asthma, perhaps NGF coming up, RSV progress and perhaps approvals down the line there in immuno-oncology. So we have a very intensely compacted pipeline that we have to manage both from a technical point of view, from an operational point of view, a manufacturing point of view and of course, as Bob says, from a financial point of view.","Ying Huang","Thank you.","Michael Aberman, M.D.","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I\u2019m sorry for the background noise. On Praluent, just wondering if you can give us any additional commentary on the types of patients coming on to therapy, and maybe what percentage of scripts are actually getting filled versus rejected? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.","Yes, I don\u2019t think we can get into the metrics in terms of those things, Terence, unfortunately. It\u2019s a fairly competitive marketplace out there. I will reemphasize that some of the points \u2013 take this opportunity to reemphasize some of the points that Bob made, which is that we feel on the contracting side that process is starting to wind down in terms of about 90% of the lives who have either commercial or Medicare Part D coverage, decisions have been made. They haven\u2019t been fully implemented on many of them and in fact the rollout is just going to keep going over the next several months and even into the second quarter of this year, some coverage won\u2019t begin. We did particularly well in those cases where there was an exclusive or preferred decision made. We won that business over 60% of the time. And as Bob said in the Medicare business where it\u2019s a large proportion of the statin use and a large proportion of our patients, we were able \u2013 when there was an exclusive or preferred decision made and that was 80% of the time, when there was an exclusive or preferred decision made that went, 95% of the lives went to Praluent. So we\u2019re very pleased that our product offering is resonating well and that people I think are getting our message.","Robert J. Terifay","In terms of the patient types, as we mentioned there are very strict utilization management criteria in the category. So it is strictly within the labeled population, which is patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and patients with a history of coronary disease. So we\u2019re seeing patients who had myocardial infarction, patients with very, very high baseline LDL-C, patients who have FH. These are the patient populations for which the product is being dispensed.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.","And we\u2019re hoping in the elderly population where we did win so much of that business that the availability of our low dose is something that will resonate well with doctors, especially as they\u2019re treating elderly people and perhaps wanting to start on a lower dose. Next question, Michael.","Michael Aberman, M.D.","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges with Leerink [ph].","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks very much for taking the question. I might go back to EYLEA, if I could. I\u2019m a little confused both by the quarterly result and then by your guidance. You grew 1.5% sequentially Q3 to Q4. You originally guided this year for 25% to 30% and you grew 54%. And now you\u2019re guiding for 20% next year. If I run 1.5% sequential growth forward, it only gets to about 15% for the year. Can you give us a sense of were there any one-time items in either Q4 or Q3 or that you\u2019re anticipating for next year, or are you just taking a cautious approach? And how is the underlying demand trend from Q3 to Q4? Thanks.","Robert E. Landry","Right. So, I think \u2013 Geoff, thanks for your question. One point is that this is not driven by inventory or things like that. Inventory increased very slightly but within our range in the fourth quarter and year-over-year inventory actually decreased a little bit. So there really wasn\u2019t \u2013 that wasn\u2019t a driver. When you look sequentially, you do have to be careful. There are seasonality trends. Fourth quarter, lots of holidays; fourth and first quarter, lots of weather. And so you know how we feel about forecasting, it\u2019s about the most imprecise scientifically unscientific activity we do here. But it isn\u2019t a matter of guiding conservatively, aggressively or what have you, it\u2019s just trying to give you our best guess with the information we have and looking into the future, which is of course difficult.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thanks.","Michael Aberman, M.D.","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adnan Butt with RBC Capital Markets.","Adnan Butt","Hi. Thanks. So I\u2019ll ask a question on the EYLEA combinations. You have now seen data from both Ang2 and PDGFR. Which one seems more compelling? And in the past, you have shed some doubts about PDGF as a target. Has that view changed since seeing data? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.","George can comment but there isn\u2019t much to change our view because the only thing we\u2019ve really seeing thus far is that we can deliver these products in a combination and we can do that in what appears to be a safe way. Too early to talk about any efficacy. But George, do you have any comments on that?","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D.","Yes. Similarly, I don\u2019t think our views have changed that much. Mechanistically, the rationale we believe is a little stronger for the Ang2 and the PDGFR pathway. But either way, we would of course be excited if in the clinic either one of these combinations brought added benefit to patients especially because we think that with our ability to combine these agents into a single \u2013 formulation of single injection, if there is increased benefit we\u2019ll be able to have the most convenient delivery regimen for the patient. So we\u2019re only hoping for success with these combinations.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.","I might say on combinations, there are others who are trying to do a fixed bispecific approach and I think as George has talked about this in some of his previous meetings we\u2019ve had, which is that the rationale there to us seems better to be able to combine these as separate drugs in a single formulation so you can adjust the concentration and dose of each one to an optimal level. When you see a result with a bispecific, you don\u2019t know whether or not it\u2019s got anything to do with both drugs acting or only one just acting better than the monospecific antibody or a drug that you had compared it to. So, we like the approach we\u2019re using. We like the technology but the data are going to determine exactly where this goes.","Michael Aberman, M.D.","Okay. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Birchenough with Wells Fargo.","Nick Abbott","Good morning. It\u2019s Nick in for Jim this morning. Can I just go back to the PD-1 inhibitor? The trial has ballooned from 60 to now apparently 973 patients. There is now a quad arm of chemo, [indiscernible] and GMCs [ph]. So can you just talk a little bit about what data we\u2019re going to get from this trial and what exactly it is you\u2019re trying to show in this trail and perhaps contextualize that with what competitors are doing with their PD-1 inhibitors? This is obviously a very large and complex trial. Thank you.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.","Yes, we\u2019re not going to give out the data but George may want to comment on what the general approach is.","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D.","Right. The first point was just to convincingly demonstrate activity and where we think it fits compared to competitors. Second was to get a broad idea of which settings and which indications but also the notion of any novel combinations which could then direct us to both settings and combinations where there might be opportunities. And I think we\u2019ve said and Michael can say exactly when that we will be talking about some of this data in the not too distant future. Michael, when are we going to be talking about it?","Michael Aberman, M.D.","We just said later this year.","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D.","Okay.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.","And so the programs are going well. They have obviously been enlarged because we\u2019re pleased with the initial results that we\u2019re seeing and we\u2019ll be sharing some of that with you at the upcoming appropriate cancer meetings.","Michael Aberman, M.D.","Okay. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Raymond with Raymond James.","Laura Chico","Good morning. This is Laura Chico in for Chris Raymond today. I guess I\u2019d like to just go back to Geoff\u2019s question on the EYLEA guidance for a moment. I know you mentioned seasonal and weather potential impacts in Q1 but are there any other broader headwinds we should be thinking about in 2016? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.","Yes, so it\u2019s always hard to anticipate trends that will drive a drug at this point. Remember, we\u2019re in the fifth year of a launch, which is a pretty big deal to be expecting 20% year-over-year growth on a very large base. So we see the product still growing, which is I think the most important \u2013 if not quantitative, it\u2019s the most important qualitative statement. We\u2019ve become the leading brand in anti-VEGF in the market and we take this franchise very seriously as we think there are additional growth drivers. George talked about the fact that we want to develop in diabetic retinopathy and he\u2019s talked about looking at it in combinations with PDGF and Ang2. So we\u2019re still committed to developing this market both in the United States and with our partner Bayer outside of United States. We should note that the growth we demonstrated in the United States here was purely volume. We did not take any price increases. Now from a macro sense, if there are payor changes on how things are reimbursed or things like that what we can\u2019t say now because there are none in place. But if things change, I think there will be more rhetoric this year during election year than actual action. But we monitor this very closely. We think our drug is a sight saving, an important therapy and we\u2019re going to continue to try and grow this franchise.","Michael Aberman, M.D.","Okay. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Roden with UBS.","Jeffrey Hung","Thanks for taking the question. This is Jeff Hung in for Matt. Regarding the Protocol C trial, when should we expect the two-year data to be presented? And then secondly, in terms of what we might expect to see, it looks like the EYLEA acuity curve in the 20\/50 or worse group is trending a bit higher as you approach the one-year mark. So this raises the question, could the data get better versus competitors in the second year and how would you frame the two-year data for us? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.","Yes, I don\u2019t think we can frame the two-year data because we\u2019ll just have to wait and we expect it to come sometime in the first half of this year. We don\u2019t control the data obviously. The data is controlled by our friends at DRCR. I will say that for us the most important dataset was at the primary endpoint at one year where we did show superiority to the other therapies and we showed a very strong safety profile. As you go up to the second year when you have less patients, some dropouts and what have you, we\u2019ll have to see the dataset and we\u2019ll have to look carefully at hopefully to show our drug continues to have a strong safety profile as it has in all of our studies to date.","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D.","Yes, just to build on what Len is saying, really the only valid direct comparison would be in the first year, because that\u2019s when the drugs were really tried side-by-side using very similar paradigms, dosing regimens and so forth. In the second year, things get hopelessly confabulated by the fact that the dosing regimens change, there\u2019s a lot more PRN usage, there\u2019s a lot more laser usage and so forth. So it\u2019s going to be very hard to deconvolute I think the second year data.","Michael Aberman, M.D.","Okay. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So last year with EYLEA, Protocol T obviously a big driver of DME adoption. I wanted to see if you guys could talk sort of qualitatively about where you think VEGF share of the overall DME market is, what you think the next leg of growth is, and maybe what a driver of that is? Is it just more blocking and tackling in the marketplace or are there follow-on datasets that you feel like could be more meaningful to retinal specialists? Thanks.","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D.","So, Geoff, obviously we have seen a lot of our growth this year coming in the DME segment of the marketplace. Unfortunately, there still are a large number of patients who have diabetes that don\u2019t get yearly-dilated eye exams, don\u2019t get into the retinal specialists. And so DME is currently still undertreated although VEGF inhibitors are being used more broadly for patients who are diagnosed with DME, the opportunity for us is to make patients aware that they\u2019ve got to get their eye exam and get into a retinal specialist if they do have any problems with their vision. And that really is a major focus of our promotion this year.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.","And as George mentioned in his talk, remember we have an indication for diabetic retinopathy in the setting of DME but the much broader indication of diabetic retinopathy without DME, broader in terms of number of patients is something that we would like to get added to the label and that\u2019s why we are conducting pivotal studies to broaden the label for that indication. So, I think it\u2019s sort of the same, Geoff, but we see growth in demographics; more patients getting older, more patients with diabetes. We see strength in potential market share both from off-labels and from \u2013 coming from the off-label Avastin and perhaps from Lucentis. We see geographic growth with more room to grow outside the United States. Our ratio outside the United States is as not as high as it is inside the United States in terms of market share and finally new indications potentially as I mentioned.","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D.","And just to add to that, there is a lot of patient and doctor education that needs to be done. It\u2019s still true that unfortunately despite the data showing that anti-VEGF therapy can provide much better vision results than laser therapy, laser is still the preferred therapy in the DME population. There\u2019s a lot of patient education and doctor education there. And as Len said, that\u2019s just for the approved setting DME diabetic population. There\u2019s at least three times as many patients who have diabetic retinopathy without DME. So if the current studies really show their results, there\u2019s an opportunity there as well.","Geoffrey Meacham","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan.","Cory Kasimov","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019m curious what you think is driving the impressive Medicare uptake so far for Praluent, if it\u2019s something specific to the drug\u2019s profile such as the dosing options you mentioned, it\u2019s primarily the lower dose or does this have more to do with pricing discounts being offered? I\u2019m just trying to understand the dynamics there. Thanks a lot.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.","Yes, that\u2019s always hard to know because we of course don\u2019t know what the other side of financial offerings are, we only know ours. But we believe in all of these meetings, we spend a lot of time trying to educate the technical people with the payors about the product profile. We do believe that the low dose, particularly in elderly patients, might be something of value for physicians to choose. Remember, the vast majority of patients are able to get to their desired level using the lower dose. Now whether or not the attitude of doesn\u2019t matter how low you go and it\u2019s too complicated for doctors to be able to understand the use of low and high dose, I think that puts not quite enough faith in doctors and my colleagues in the medical profession. They get the difference and I think this maybe resonating frankly.","Michael Aberman, M.D.","Okay. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI.","Mark Schoenebaum","Thanks, guys. I\u2019ll follow Michael\u2019s rule of no more than seven questions.","Michael Aberman, M.D.","Thank you, Mark.","Mark Schoenebaum","Amgen has actually said that their base case at the final analysis for the CVOT trial is a risk reduction of about 25% to 35%. So I was struck by your statement that your DSMB would consider about a 20% reduction as overwhelming efficacy. Can you give us what your base case assumption is at the final analysis for risk reduction? And just related, Amgen talks a lot about their IVIS trial and how they think that\u2019s very important. To my knowledge, you guys aren\u2019t conducting one. I\u2019d just like to hear you speak about your decision there and your thoughts on if that data will be meaningful in the marketplace. Thanks so much.","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D.","All right. I guess we\u2019re not talking about a base case, we\u2019re telling you exactly what the study is actually trialed, is powered to pick up. So that\u2019s the numbers that we\u2019re giving. And certainly we\u2019re looking at a variety of imaging studies and so forth. As Bob said, we certainly realize and recognize that a lot of the outcomes data and these imaging studies and so forth, they are going to speak to the class effects. And so we\u2019re hoping that their results will be positive and we\u2019re also going to be looking at what studies that we can be doing in addition to our outcome studies and in terms of imaging.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.","It does seem, Mark, you may be one of the only people on the planet who can remember each and every outcome study with the statins and which statin that was used in the outcomes trial. But I do think for the most part there is some genericization. There will be subtle differences. And just to emphasize what George was saying about the power, I think Amgen is basically telling you, which is correct, which is that in previous studies the amount of risk reduction you get is proportional to the absolute number of milligrams per deciliter that you lower LDL cholesterol. Now, of course, in their Phase 2b\/3 studies and I should say their Phase 3 non-outcome studies as well as ours, the starting LDL cholesterol was higher and so the overall LDL absolute reduction was a lot and therefore the risk reduction was a lot. When you start out with a more modest LDL, which we\u2019re both doing in our outcomes trial, you have less LDL lowering and on average you should have less risk reduction but we think a very robust result. And we\u2019ll be able to look across the barriers, spectrums of people had this starting LDL and so on and so forth. So we\u2019re very confident in the LDL hypothesis. Remember, Brown and Goldstein were the first people to understand the LDL receptor on our Board of Directors, so this is something we\u2019ve been very close to for a very long time. So we believe in the LDL hypothesis and we believe the outcomes trials should continue to support that.","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D.","I think Len said it very well but it was a little complicated even for me to understand. I think the point is, is that the important message here from these studies, I think it\u2019s going to be more qualitative than quantitative. As the FDA always cautions, it\u2019s impossible to compare between studies and that\u2019s because there are so many inherent differences; in the type of the population just starting LDL, whether they had recent events or whether it\u2019s more of a secondary prevention type of a setting and so forth and so on. So there\u2019s so many differences between the populations. So I think one is looking more for qualitative messages here as opposed to just quantitative differentiators.","Mark Schoenebaum","Qualitatively, I\u2019d like to say thank you.","Michael Aberman, M.D.","You\u2019re welcome, Mark. Next question.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.","Qualitatively, you\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alethia Young with Credit Suisse.","Alethia Young","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on dupi. I thought I saw like a pediatric trial that was a small trial that was ongoing. Just wondered if you could give us your updated thoughts on the path forward in peds for dupi, please?","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D.","Well, as you know, pediatrics patients with atopic dermatitis are a very large population of people. And these children, many of them, suffer greatly. So we would love to see our drug program expanded to be able to treat the children. Of course, the normal way that this is done is that you wait until you have completed your Phase 3 studies in adults before moving more aggressively into children. But after I think looking at our program and an advisory panel on this subject, the FDA and the advisory panel I think pushed us and we agreed that we should be looking even before we had the final Phase 3 data, because the data we saw in Phase 2b was so strong. I remember it was designated a breakthrough therapy by the agency. So we have moved into pediatrics. We have a Phase 2 study that\u2019s ongoing in patients between the ages of 6 and 17 and we expect to be able to get you data from that perhaps later this year. And we have a Phase 3 pediatric study planned as well. So we see the need, we see the children who suffer and don\u2019t have good alternatives and we would very much like to expand to be able to treat them.","Michael Aberman, M.D.","Next question. Operator?","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Harrison","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to ask on both the Ang2 and the PDGF follow-ons, you obviously are now going to be running two large Phase 2 studies for both of those drugs. One will read out I guess end of this year and the next one, I assume, sometime next year. How are you thinking about bringing both of those into Phase 3? Will you decide on them independently or will you wait for both datasets to decide how to move them forward? And anything you can say around what kind of bar you think is relevant from an efficacy standpoint there to be able to move those forward? Thanks. ","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D.","Well, I think data always speaks for us and to us and that\u2019s how we make our decisions. So we I think have designed a very robust and comprehensive Phase 2 program for both of these combination approaches. And we\u2019ll make the decisions based on the data. I think certain advantages that we would have is that if the efficacy advantage or the interval differentiation is sufficient, we\u2019ll be able to conveniently and in a cost effective manner be providing both agents to the patients. So we\u2019re not really limited by sort of saying, oh well, yes, there is an advantage, but it\u2019s so modest, how do you justify a whole new biologic here? We\u2019re in the unique position of being able to provide both agents in a very cost effective manner regardless of what the benefit if there is definitive, convincing additional benefits. But it\u2019s all going to depend on the data.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.","Yes, I can\u2019t overemphasize what George just said so I\u2019ll repeat it, which is that \u2013 some people are trying to develop add-ons as two separate injections, which really means that you must have a robust efficacy and safety profile to justify the risks because injections in the eye although probably none have \u2013 there\u2019s been no more injections than I can imagine has been with EYLEA around the world, but the injections in the eyes still carry a small but real risk each time physicians sticks a needle in the eye without putting anything in there. And so if you\u2019re going to have a very small benefit, two needle sticks probably won\u2019t be justified. And as George said, the cost \u2013 we can deliver these at the same costs, if necessary, in a single injection. So we have both the financial burden as well as the injection burden really under our control. So therefore we can be driven to go to the market with smaller benefits than you might have to hold yourself up to if you have to do multiple injections and add-on costs.","Michael Aberman, M.D.","Operator, we have time for one last question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company.","Philip Nadeau","Good morning. Thanks for fitting in my question. Just a question on how you think we should model Praluent\u2019s uptake through 2016? I know in the past you\u2019ve said that it will take several quarters for sales to reflect end user demand. Is there a point in 2016 where you think the reimbursement negotiations will be finished and sampling will begin to subside where we can begin to see end user demand reflected in sales, or is 2016 really a preparatory year for the post event study uptake of Praluent?","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D.","So just to clarify although as we discussed, the class currently has penetrated 90% of covered lives. Many of the payors have yet to implement their insurance coverage. So we expect to see that coverage continue to come on board over the next several months. Once that coverage comes on board, there is going to be some time for physicians to understand what the utilization management criteria are and how to really document the prior authorization to get these patients through the entire process to get a dispensed prescription. So I would say you\u2019re going to see very gradual uptake for several months until we get to some kind of a steady state.","Michael Aberman, M.D.","Great. Operator, with that this concludes our call. I want to thank everybody. As per usual, myself, the IR team and Bob Landry, our CFO, are available for follow-up questions as needed at our office.

With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Manisha, and good morning to everyone who has joined us on the call and webcast today. 2017 was a strong and significant year for Regeneron with important progress on clinical, commercial and regulatory fronts and solid financial results. We received regulatory approval for two important new drugs: Dupixent, an IL-4, IL-13 inhibitor for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis; and Kevzara, an IL-6 receptor antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Both of these drugs have been approved in the U.S., Europe and Japan, with launches under way in several countries.","Our innovation engine continues to be productive. We currently have 15 product candidates in clinical development and expect to advance four to six new product candidates into the clinic this year. Our commercial pipeline and regulatory progress give us confidence that we are well positioned for sustainable, long-term growth. Importantly, two of our product candidates, dupilumab for allergic diseases and cemiplimab for cancer, each represent a single molecule with the potential for significant opportunities across multiple diseases and are truly pipelines within a product.","Turning now to EYLEA, I would like to address the demographic trends that continue to favor EYLEA, the opportunities in diabetic eye diseases which tend to be underdiagnosed and undertreated, an issue we plan to address, and our thoughts on some of the recent competitive developments. EYLEA has been in the market now for over six years in the United States and despite no price increase since launch, it has continued to deliver impressive growth.","EYLEA net sales grew 11% year-over-year in the U.S. and 19% year-over-year outside the U.S. Much of the recent growth in the U.S. was driven by demographic trends with an aging population, as well as an overall increase in the prevalence of diabetes. These demographic trends are expected to continue in the coming years, providing an opportunity for continued growth.","Focusing on diabetic eye diseases, currently the majority of patients with diabetic eye disease are underdiagnosed and undertreated, and even when they are treated, they may not be receiving optimal anti-VEGF therapy, which in several studies has been shown to be superior to laser therapy. Patients with diabetes are at risk for losing vision, because of diseased blood vessels in the eye. Vascular leak leads to retinal swelling and vision loss, or what is known as diabetic macular edema, a major indication where EYLEA is currently approved.","Based upon physician survey data, approximately between 25% and 30% of our total EYLEA net sales in the United States come from DME. It is estimated that only 8% of patients diagnosed with DME receive treatment with an anti-VEGF agent representing an important growth opportunity for EYLEA. The efficacy of EYLEA in DME has been proven over years in multiple studies including those performed by independent groups. As a reminder, data from the NIH-sponsored comparative effectiveness Protocol T have demonstrated at the end of one year when the primary endpoint was assessed, EYLEA treatment resulted in significantly greater gains in visual acuity compared to both Lucentis and Avastin, particularly in those who had vision worse than 20\/40.","Diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema, an indication we are investigating EYLEA in Phase 3, is another important and attractive opportunity. About 3.5 million people in the United States are diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema. Of these, about 1 million patients have either proliferative diabetic retinopathy or severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. And it is these patients who have the greatest unmet need and are at high risk for profound vision loss.","The majority of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy are currently being treated with pan-retinal photocoagulation or laser therapy. In the CLARITY study in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy published in The Lancet, EYLEA resulted in superior visual outcomes compared to laser treatment. We anticipate in the first half of the year, top line data from our Phase 3 study of EYLEA in diabetic retinopathy, followed by a potential regulatory submission later this year. In addition, the DRCR.net is also conducting an independent Phase 3 study of EYLEA in the diabetic retinopathy indication.","In addition to well established efficacy and safety, another important aspect for physicians and patients is to have flexible dosing regimen that includes monthly dosing for those patients who may benefit from more frequent dosing as well as having the flexibility to have a longer interval between doses. EYLEA provides this important flexibility for physicians and patients and is approved for monthly as well as every other month dosing.","In addition, we have submitted an sBLA for every three-month dosing in wet AMD and expect an FDA decision in August. As a reminder, in our Phase 3 studies, we demonstrated that about 50% of patients could be dosed every 12 weeks. We also continue to advance our preclinical research on extended release and gene therapy approaches.","We are focused on continuing to maintain our leadership position with EYLEA in the retinal space. Like you, we are well aware of emerging potential competitors for EYLEA. We will continue to execute on our long-term strategy, which includes growing the overall market, specifically in diabetic eye diseases, expanding the treatment interval options in the label and gaining approval in additional indications. We do not expect any new entrants until about the latter half of 2019. And even if approved, the first potential competitor will be limited initially to the wet AMD indication.","EYLEA has set a very high bar by demonstrating efficacy and safety across a spectrum of retinal diseases, both in company-sponsored as well as independently-conducted studies. The retinal community has deep experience with EYLEA with about 8 million injections given in the United States alone since launch. There has been significant concern and debate as to whether long-term treatment with anti-VEGF agents can maintain early vision gains.","For example, in a five-year follow-up of the NIH-sponsored CATT study comparing Lucentis and Avastin, early visual gains obtained with anti-VEGF agents were not maintained over the long term. And in fact, visual acuity reported at year five was below baseline levels prior to treatment and patients had lost on average over three letters compared to their original baseline, and 20% of patients had regressed to become legally blind.","Some have raised theoretical concerns that chronic VEGF inhibition in the eye might result in deleterious effects such as geographic atrophy. But in contrast to the observation with intraocular Lucentis and Avastin in CATT and the theoretical concerns about chronic VEGF inhibition, we have shown that chronic regular treatment with EYLEA results in visual gains that were maintained through four years of follow-up.","At the upcoming angiogenesis meeting at the Bascom Palmer Institute (sic) [Bascom Palmer Eye Institute], real-world data on visual acuity outcomes following treatment with intravitreal anti-VEGF agents will address the issue of whether underdosing is contributing to poorer visual outcomes over the long term.","As a reminder, a variety of retinal diseases are treated by the same specialists, who can choose which buy-and-bill products they want to use in their practice. We believe the extensive data, combined with real-world experience, broad label and treatment flexibility offered by EYLEA will make it an attractive treatment option for years to come. It will be quite a while before any emerging competitor can come close to matching the breadth of approved indications and the depth of long-term experience offered by EYLEA.","Two potential competitor programs you may have been hearing about are a bispecific Ang2 and VEGF antibody and a single-chain antibody fragment VEGF inhibitor, and many of our investors have asked for our thoughts on the competitive threats they pose. Both of these are studying higher molar concentrations of their drugs compared to the currently approved anti-VEGF drugs, with the primary goal of increasing visual acuity and\/or extending the interval between injections.","For example, the doses being investigated with the bispecific RG7716 are between two to seven times the molar concentration of the Lucentis comparator in the trial. The single-chain antibody fragment, brolucizumab, also known as RTH258, studied doses that were up to 12 times the molar concentration of EYLEA. Despite this twelvefold increase in molar dose in both Phase 3 studies, the high dose of brolucizumab did not demonstrate superiority to EYLEA in terms of visual acuity, nor did it consistently extend the dosage interval to 12 weeks in all patients as almost half the patients failed quarterly treatments and had to be returned to more frequent dosing. Brolucizumab demonstrated statistical non-inferiority to EYLEA on vision in both studies. It was, however, slightly numerically albeit not statistically inferior to EYLEA on vision in both studies.","There is a known potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events following the intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors as stated in our label as well as the Lucentis label. The Lucentis label additionally states that fatal events occurred more frequently in patients with diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy at baseline who were treated with monthly Lucentis. Therefore, given the high molar doses studied by both potential competitors, it will be important to see the assessment by regulatory authorities regarding the balance of safety and efficacy that these new agents might provide, particularly in the elderly and in diabetics before we are able to evaluate the extent of competitive risk to EYLEA.","Turning to Dupixent, our drug for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, it continues to gain momentum in the ongoing launch. Global fourth quarter net sales of Dupixent were $139 million, representing a 56% increase compared to the third quarter of 2017. Apart from a dip in the early part of the year due to the holidays and required reauthorizations at the beginning of the year, we are continuing to see a strong weekly number of approximately 500 new-to-brand scripts as tracked by the NBRx number.","The prescriber number has increased to over 8,500 and the first renewal rate remains high at above 90%. The feedback from physicians and patients continues to be positive about the efficacy and safety of the product although we are hearing some frustrations about the processes that payers have put in place in order to get the prescription approved, even where formulary decisions have been made. We and our collaborator, Sanofi, are working to ensure that eligible patients have fair access to this important breakthrough medication.","Our market research indicates that some health care providers are prescribing Dupixent to their most severe patients, which suggests there is significant continued growth potential. We continue to work on raising patient awareness and on educating patients and health care providers about new treatment options as well as working on improving access. The launch of Dupixent outside the United States is under way with the drug now approved in several European countries and in Japan.","The emerging clinical data with dupilumab strengthened our belief that the IL-4\/13 pathway is a key driver of several allergic or type 2 diseases. We have recently submitted a supplemental BLA for dupilumab in the uncontrolled asthma setting and expect a regulatory decision in the second half of this year. George will provide you with an update on the ongoing development programs with dupilumab in several indications. We, along our collaborator, Sanofi, have recently increased our financial commitment to these programs in an effort to accelerate and expand the dupilumab and IL-33 antibody programs. Bob will address the details of the financial agreement.","The launch of Kevzara for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is under way in the United States as well as in countries outside the U.S. On the access front in the U.S., we have payer contracts that took effect at the beginning of the year with some offering favorable positioning and market access for Kevzara. Outside the U.S., the drug continues to receive favorable reimbursement reviews and country-specific launches are under way.","Turning now to Praluent, we will be presenting data from the 18,000 patient ODYSSEY cardiovascular outcomes study on March 10 at the meeting of the American College of Cardiology. To be clear, the study has not yet been unblinded. We believe that the PCSK9 inhibitor class holds tremendous promise despite the slow initial uptake, and we look forward to providing you with additional information after the outcomes data become available.","2018 will be an important year for Regeneron with several significant events anticipated, including two new potential approvals, dupilumab in asthma and cemiplimab, our PD-1 antibody in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, which will mark our entry into the exciting and rapidly evolving field of immuno-oncology. We anticipate completion of the cemiplimab BLA submission in the first quarter and are preparing for the launch. While our initial indication will be advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, additional studies are either under way or planned in several other indications, including first and second line non-small cell lung cancer and cervical cancer.","As recently announced, we along with our collaborator, Sanofi, have increased our investment in immuno-oncology with the aim of advancing and accelerating these important programs. On the corporate front, we have recruited a new head of commercial who will be joining us later in the quarter.","With that, I would now like to turn the call over to George.","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. As Len mentioned, 2018 is shaping up to be a very busy and important year for Regeneron. I'd like to begin with Dupixent in atopic dermatitis where the drug is currently approved for use in adult patients. However, there is an unmet need in pediatric atopic dermatitis patients where the current treatment options are limited.","We are conducting three Phase 3 studies in atopic dermatitis in children between the ages of 6 months and 17 years. The first of these in children between the ages of 12 and 17 years is fully enrolled, and we expect to report data by midyear and submit a supplemental BLA in the United States in the second half of the year.","In asthma, we have reported positive data from three separate pivotal studies of dupilumab with profound benefits on the two major endpoints of exacerbations and improvement in lung function as measured by FEV1. These improvements were observed in the overall population and were even more pronounced in the patient population with a more allergic phenotype as defined by biomarkers such as eosinophils corresponding to approximately half of the patients in these studies.","One of our pivotal studies was conducted in a severe patient population that was dependent on oral steroids. In this severe population, patients treated with dupilumab saw significant reduction in their exacerbations as well as improvements in their lung function. These findings were even more striking since more than half the patients in this study were able to completely eliminate their use of oral steroids. We, along with our collaborator, Sanofi, have submitted a supplemental BMA (sic) [BLA] (18:53) in the asthma indication and look forward to a regulatory decision in the second half of the year.","A Phase 3 study of dupilumab in pediatric asthma patients between the ages of 6 and 11 years is ongoing. We have compelling Phase 2 data for the use of dupilumab in other allergic indications as well, including nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis, and have scientific rationale to believe that dupilumab could be used in several additional indications including food and inhaled allergies.","Two Phase 3 studies of dupilumab in nasal polyps are now fully enrolled, and we expect top line data at the end of the year. Our positive Phase 2 data in eosinophilic esophagitis was believed to result from unidentified food allergies, bolsters our belief that dupilumab has the potential to be used in food allergies themselves. This was further supported by our preclinical models which have shown that dupilumab accelerates and improves desensitization to food allergens.","Our first study in people with food allergy will be with peanuts and conducted in collaboration with Aimmune Therapeutics. We expect to initiate this Phase 2 study in the second half of the year. We also expect to initiate a Phase 2 study of dupilumab for desensitization of patients with allergies to airborne allergens later this year.","One of the most exciting opportunities and benefits that dupilumab can provide to patients is that it may be able to simultaneously address multiple manifestations of allergic disease in the same patient. As has been widely appreciated previously, and as confirmed in many of our own studies, patients suffering from one allergic disease often suffer from another. For example, in our atopic dermatitis program, about 40% of the patients had asthma and up to 50% of the patients had allergic rhinitis.","In initial attempts to explore such opportunities in allergic patients, we recently reported in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology that dupilumab significantly improved allergic rhinitis associated nasal symptoms in patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma.","Regeneron 3500, our antibody to the interleukin 33 ligand, is an exciting program that we believe has the potential both on its own as well as in combination with dupilumab to bring benefit to patients. Research performed by our Regeneron Genetic Center team has provided genetic validation for interleukin 33 as a strong target.","For example, there are common gain-of-function variants in interleukin 33 that increase the risk of asthma, while loss-of-function mutations conversely decrease the risk. Preclinical data that we have generated has shown that IL-33 could work in a manner that is complementary to dupilumab. We're currently planning studies of this IL-33 antibody in asthma, COPD and atopic dermatitis.","I'd like to turn now to immuno-oncology, which continues to be one of the most exciting areas of development for us and where we have adopted a multipronged approach encompassing checkpoint inhibitors such as cemiplimab, our PD-1 antibody, bispecific antibodies as well as other modalities. Having multiple approaches available under one roof will give us the flexibility and nimbleness to explore the use of combination therapies.","We view cemiplimab as the foundational therapy upon which we will build additional combinations in a thoughtful and logical manner. Our recent positive study with cemiplimab in patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, most of whom had failed surgery and multiple lines of prior therapies, demonstrated an impressive response rate of 46%, which is among the highest observed to-date with a PD-1 targeting agent in solid tumors.","Importantly, a majority of the responses were durable. The safety profile observed has been generally consistent with this class. Based on these data, we expect to complete our regulatory submission to the FDA by the end of the first quarter, with the European Union submission expected in the first half. Cemiplimab has been granted breakthrough designation status by the FDA for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.","Because of the intense activity in the PD-1\/PD-L1 space with over 1,000 ongoing clinical studies, many were surprised that we were able to identify an important unmet medical need setting that yielded such robust demonstration of activity and which has provided us with a fast-to-market opportunity. To be clear, we view cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma as a significant and important opportunity on its own. However, and just as importantly, this cancer setting allowed us to obtain a foothold into the arena of immuno-oncology and we hope will establish cemiplimab as a foundation for our future combination approaches.","We're also making significant progress with cemiplimab in our other indications such as first and second line non-small cell lung cancer, and several other settings where we either have ongoing or planned studies. We're exploring the use of cemiplimab both as monotherapy and also in combination with other molecules such as our own additional checkpoint inhibitors, immunomodulator such as CD38 and multiple vaccine approaches, and perhaps most interestingly, in combination with molecules coming from our bispecific platform.","Speaking of our bispecific technology, we think it can offer opportunities related to those seen with cell-based therapies such as the CAR T approaches. We believe if our bispecifics can approach the level of activities seen with the CAR Ts, their ease of production and administration, which is more akin to that of traditional biologics, might provide a major advance for patients. Our lead program here, a CD20\/CD3 bispecific continues to advance in the clinic. After careful dose escalation process to mitigate the side effects of cytokine release syndrome, we have recently reported dosing levels that have achieved 50% response rates without any dose limiting toxicities. And we continue dose escalation.","We are encouraged by the activity that we are observing at these higher dose levels and look forward to reporting these data as they mature at a future meeting. We expect to move two additional CD3 bispecific candidates into the clinic this year, a bispecific antibody to MUC16 and another to BCMA.","Fasinumab, our Phase 3 NGF antibody program for pain continues to advance in the clinic with Phase 3 studies, in osteoarthritis and chronic lower back pain. We don't have time to discuss all of our early stage programs or the additional candidates that we plan to advance into clinical development this year. However, one early stage program that I would like to highlight is the combination of our activin A and GDF8 antibodies. Regeneron scientists made the discovery that activin A might be as, if not more, important than GDF8, also known as myostatin, for controlling muscle mass in primates.","Consistent with this, we recently announced that a combination of our activin A and GDF8 antibodies resulted in dose dependent increases in muscle volume of up to 8% after a single dose in normal healthy volunteers with an acceptable safety profile. We're expecting to commence follow-up clinical studies of this combination. As a reminder, we're also studying our activin A antibody alone as monotherapy in the ultra-orphan disease, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva or FOP.","Lastly, I want to take a moment to comment on our recently announced consortium of biopharma companies to help fund the study of (26:30) 500,000 individuals in the United Kingdom Biobank. The Regeneron Genetics Center expects to carry out and complete this work by the end of next year, providing a near-term treasure trove of genetic insights, coupled with clinical imaging and other rich genotype data which is available in the UK Biobank. Importantly, these results will be made available publicly, providing the first such big data research resource that all researchers worldwide will have access to.","Many believe that this will serve as a great accelerant for both academic and biopharma research. We think it makes a great statement that so many from the biopharma community have stepped forward to help co-fund this effort including, AbbVie, Alnylam, AstraZeneca, Biogen and Pfizer.","And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob Landry.","Robert E. Landry - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. Regeneron posted strong fourth quarter 2017 financial results. We finished the year with continued sequential growth within our global EYLEA franchise, positive momentum with our U.S. Dupixent launch, the execution of several business development transactions and expanded funding for cemiplimab and dupilumab under our Sanofi collaboration.","In the fourth quarter of 2017, we earned $5.23 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $607 million. For the full year 2017, we earned $16.32 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $1.9 billion. This represents a year-over-year increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income of 72% for the fourth quarter, and a year-over-year increase of 44% in non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income for the full year of 2017.","Regeneron's fourth quarter 2017 non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense, the $25 million upfront payment made in connection with our agreement with Decibel Therapeutics, the income tax effect of non-GAAP reconciling items, and a onetime provisional charge related to enactment of the Tax Cuts and Job Act (sic) [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act], a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release which can be found on our website.","Total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $1.58 billion and $5.87 billion for the full year 2017, which represented year-over-year growth of 29% for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and 21% for the full year of 2017.","EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $975 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $3.7 billion for the full year of 2017, compared to $858 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $3.32 billion for the full year of 2016, which represents an increase of 14% and 11% respectively. U.S. EYLEA distributor inventory experienced a slight increase as compared to the third quarter of 2017, yet remained within our normal one- to two-week targeted range.","Ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales, which are recorded by our collaborator, Bayer, were $637 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, representing a 28% increase over the fourth quarter of 2016 on a reported basis and 23% on a constant currency basis. For the full year of 2017, global EYLEA net product sales were nearly $6 billion.","In the fourth quarter of 2017, Regeneron recognized $231 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the United States and $802 million for the full year of 2017. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $297 million and $938 million for the full year of 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company reported that the results from two Phase 2 studies of EYLEA, in combination with nesvacumab, an antibody to ANG2 did not provide sufficient differentiation to warrant Phase 3 development. Consequently, Bayer collaboration revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 includes $37 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the recognition of deferred revenue from the upfront payment previously received from Bayer.","Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $200 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $877 million for the full year of 2017. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line item primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred commercialization-related expenses, and the recognition of deferred revenue from the antibody and immuno-oncology upfront payments, partly offset by our share of losses in connection with the commercialization of antibodies.","Global sales of Dupixent, Praluent and Kevzara, as recorded by our collaborator, Sanofi, for the fourth quarter of 2017 were: Dupixent, $139 million; Praluent, $63 million; and Kevzara, $9 million. For both Dupixent and Kevzara, the sales were almost exclusively U.S.-based.","Despite higher Dupixent and Praluent sales in the fourth quarter of 2017, our share of losses in connection with commercialization of Dupixent, Praluent and Kevzara was $114 million, compared to a loss of $126 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. As a reminder, we anticipated a higher Alliance loss in connection with the commercialization of antibodies in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus the third quarter as the Alliance's profitability was negatively impacted this quarter by increased global launches to support Kevzara and Dupixent.","Regeneron's share of losses in connection with the commercialization of antibodies for the full year 2017 was $443 million as compared to losses of $459 million for the full year 2016.","The fourth quarter 2017 Sanofi collaboration revenue did benefit from an acceleration of the recognition of deferred revenue in connection with the termination of the Antibody Discovery Agreement on December 31, 2017. However, as mentioned during last quarter's call, the $130 million of 2017 annual funding from Sanofi under the Antibody Discovery Agreement was fully utilized during the first nine months of 2017, which attributed to the lower reimbursement of Regeneron R&D expenses realized this quarter as compared to the first three quarters of 2017.","In the fourth quarter of 2017, other revenue was $107 million versus $52 million during the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily due to the reimbursements from our collaborator, Teva, for the development of fasinumab along with a $35 million fasinumab development milestone the company earned and recognized into revenue. For further details you can find a summary of the full year components of other revenue in the MD&A section of our 10-K, which will be filed later today.","Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses was $444 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $1.78 billion for the full year of 2017. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total non-GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, was $265 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and $877 million for the full year 2017. Our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. For 2018, we'd like to reaffirm our previously provided guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $1.23 billion to $1.33 billion.","Next, non-GAAP SG&A expense was $348 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $1.11 billion for the full year 2017. As noted, on our November 2017 earnings call, we realized a higher SG&A spend level in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the first three quarters of 2017, primarily due to incremental spend on our two recently launched products, Dupixent and Kevzara, an increase in commercialization related expenses associated with EYLEA as well as prelaunch expenses for the anticipated 2018 U.S. approvals for cemiplimab in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and dupilumab for asthma. The increased 2017 fourth quarter spend was also influenced by the acceleration of discretionary expenses to secure tax deductions in 2017.","We reaffirm our previous guidance for non-GAAP SG&A expense in 2018 to be in the range of $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion. The increase in our forecasted 2018 non-GAAP SG&A expense is primarily driven by increased commercial support for Dupixent, both atopic dermatitis and potential asthma indication, EYLEA with an increased focus on diabetic eye disease, Praluent which incorporates increased spending post ODYSSEY OUTCOMES results and cemiplimab.","Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses, a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue, was $118 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $369 million for the full year of 2017. We reaffirm our full year 2018 guidance for Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses in 2018 to be in the range of $450 million and $500 million.","Non-GAAP cost of goods sold and non-GAAP cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing increased for the fourth quarter 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to drug substance manufacturing costs associated with the sales of Dupixent and increases in Limerick's manufacturing start-up costs which were anticipated. We are pleased to report that in December 2017, our facility in Limerick underwent a successful FDA preapproval inspection, resulting in a license to manufacture Praluent for the U.S. market.","Turning now to taxes. Our effective tax rate was 69% and 42% for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively, as compared to approximately 26% and 33% for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. The effective tax rate for both the fourth quarter and full year 2017 was negatively impacted by the provisional charge related to the remeasurement of the company's U.S. net deferred tax assets upon the December 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, partly offset by the tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation.","Excluding the impact of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, our effective tax rate would have been 10% and 27% for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. For the full year 2018, we are reaffirming our guidance for our effective tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 19% which includes the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As discussed at the JPMorgan conference last month, the 2018 benefit that we expect to realize from U.S. corporate tax reform is being reinvested into the business by increasing our investment in research and development and additional expansion of our U.S. facilities to support future growth. This has been incorporated into our 2018 guidance.","From a cash flow and balance sheet perspective, we ended the fourth quarter of 2017 with cash and marketable securities of $2.9 billion and generated full year free cash flow in excess of $1 billion. Our capital expenditures for the full year 2017 were $273 million. As we enter 2018, we are reaffirming our previous capital expenditure guidance of between $420 million and $500 million. Our principal driver of increased capital expenditures in 2018 is for the expansion of a portion of our facilities at our Rensselaer, New York manufacturing location as well as expenditures for our Limerick manufacturing facilities, and continued expansion and renovation of our laboratory space within our Tarrytown, New York facilities.","Finally, as announced in early January, Regeneron and Sanofi agreed to accelerate and expand the investment for the clinical development of cemiplimab to a minimum of $1.64 billion, an increase of nearly $1 billion over the budget set forth in the original immuno-oncology licensing collaboration agreement and to allocate additional funds to certain activities relating to the development of dupilumab and Regeneron 3500, our IL-33 antibody.","As part of the agreement, the company agreed to grant a limited waiver of the lockup in the amended and restated Investor Agreement so that Sanofi may sell up to an aggregate of 1.4 million shares of Regeneron common stock through the end of 2020, representing approximately 6% of the shares of Regeneron common stock Sanofi currently owns. If we do not elect to repurchase such shares from Sanofi, Sanofi may sell the applicable number of shares subject to certain daily and quarterly limits in one or more open market transactions.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Manisha.","Manisha Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Bob. Jason, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Alethia Young from Credit Suisse.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to talk a little bit more about immuno-oncology. It seems like it's kind of under-appreciated when we talk to investors, but can you talk a little bit more about your PD-1 strategy and your bispecific strategy? How does it all fit together, and maybe just a little bit more color on what you're doing in BCMA? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","George?","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure. We're very excited obviously about our PD-1 program and that, as we noted, I think we surprised a lot of people by finding an important indication, which was very responsive to our antibody and where we're hoping to get a rapid approval. And as we've said, we think this setting is actually a pretty important one, perhaps on par with that of melanoma and with substantial growth opportunity. But as we also said, we think that not only is it an important indication in and of itself, but it serves as a foundation to have our PD-1 antibody serve as a foundation for combination approaches going forward.","We have a series of additional combination opportunities, some of which we've already initiated, whether it'd be with things like a variety of vaccines, in many cases that we're partnering with, or with additional checkpoint inhibitors that we've developed internally. But perhaps we're most excited about our bispecifics. As we've noted, our first bispecific is finally getting to dosing levels that are showing pretty substantial efficacy in our early trials. And we think if our bispecifics start approaching, which we think they're beginning to, the sort of type of responses that people are reporting with CAR Ts, they could really represent a very, very important opportunity.","And the thing that's also exciting about it is, our strategy includes both combining our bispecifics with our PD-1 as well as our bispecifics with each other. We have a number of bispecifics that at least, in our preclinical model, look like they can be additive, if not synergistic in their responses. And because these are all coming from our laboratories and we have the abilities to study them preclinically as well as the ability to expedite studying them clinically, we think this offers an enormous opportunity for us to really try these combinations and look for advances that they can actually provide together.","So, for us, it's a very exciting opportunity. We think we already have our foothold, as we said, and we hope in the near future to be establishing, not only our first bispecific but a series of additional bispecifics as we said where we will be putting at least two in the clinic this year and a whole series of them shortly thereafter. So we think it's an exciting time, and it's a lot of opportunity.","Manisha Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we have Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much, and I appreciate the question. A financial one and an R&D one quickly. Bob, on the SG&A, it stepped up significantly and you highlighted that, and it looks as though it's going to be annualizing in 2018 as much the same rate as Q4. Could you talk about what the drivers are there? Have you sort of stood up your sales forces yet for both asthma and for the PD-1? And is there any sense that you might be able to redeploy some of your commercial expense away from Praluent over towards Dupixent, some of those other opportunities perhaps tighten up on that SG&A ratio? And then, quickly, just George, could you tell us what sort of dosing you expect to be likely for your bispecifics that you've learnt more about the characteristics of the first one?","Robert E. Landry - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure, Geoff. I'll answer the first one. And probably something that we haven't given a ton of color about, but with regards to kind of our fourth quarter SG&A spend, we always kind of get this annual seasonal EYLEA increase as we have to kind of reauthorize the insurance coverage and the reverification processes that have again. Obviously, the docs like this, so when the EYLEA patients come in the early January, the insurance is already in place and this is not a kind of a whole new start for them. So we do incur a decent amount of incremental spend that you don't necessarily see during the first three quarters in 2017 in the fourth quarter. And again, we did something similar in 2016.","Again, as we incurred in the fourth quarter of 2017, we are picking up spend for Kevzara and Dupixent. Again, after controlling Praluent for the first three quarters, we did additionally have an increase in Praluent fourth quarter spend. And as I alluded to, we did accelerate, Geoff, some 2017, in particular, G&A expenses into the fourth quarter. That probably ideally would have been a January incurrence. So, again, that's creating a little bit of the bump that you're seeing when you compare to the first three quarters of 2017.","As we get into 2018, again, we're putting a lot of money with regards to Dupixent in atopic dermatitis. We also have a lot of money laid out with regards to the launch of ASTHMA, which as you know, is going to be a very, very competitive field. And again, we continue on with Kevzara and we're assuming positive ODYSSEY OUTCOMES results on Praluent and we're putting the necessary dollars behind that.","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Okay. And, Geoff, this is George. Just regarding to your question about the bispecifics, I think that a couple of very important things that we learned, and I think these are some of the reasons why this is such an attractive class and in particular may offer some advantages over some of these cellular therapy approaches, where a lot of the major concern is controlling the cytokine release storm and other adverse events in which the cells might be attacking the host. Most importantly, we've learned that we can actually gradually up the dose in time in an individual patient. So we can start with a lower dose, gradually remove the target, and so we don't get an immediate blast of cytokine release storm. And then we continue to dose up. And we've now gotten up what we reported recently at ASH, our doses between 5 milligrams to 8 milligrams in terms of efficacy, where we reported these efficacy numbers of about 50% response rates and we also reported there that we had gotten to 12 milligram as a dose and we reported the safety profile there, but now we've even gone further beyond that dose.","These are still relatively low doses compared to standard biologics, but we've certainly seen that it seems like it really dramatically ups the efficacy range when you get to these levels. But I think a huge advantage here is understanding that you can gradually increase the dose and this way you really ameliorate the onset of these adverse events and you can keep them under control and then get up to the higher doses.","And then, of course, another major advantage is, if need be, you can back off the dose if you actually have to. But as a class now, I think that we understand the doses that we have to get to for efficacy, but also how to gradually get to those doses in an individual patient so that they can be well-tolerated.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Manisha Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Next question, please.","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","(47:58) I had a question for Geoff, by the way. I remember you said, oh, if in our muscle program we produce 5% to 10% increases in muscle mass, you'd get pretty excited. So what do you think about that?","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","He has no time to answer. Right now, he's already shut out of the line. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. And next we have Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray.","Christopher J. Raymond - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks. Had a question on fasinumab and also Kevzara, if you don't mind. So just on fasinumab, just looking at the long-term safety study in way of the knee (48:32), I think, which looks to be reading out this year. I wonder if you could maybe put some brackets around the sort of margin of error on the safety side in terms of what you think will be acceptable in light of the need for obviously non-opioid alternatives. And then also on Kevzara, I think it's fairly clear now that offering a lower cost is not necessarily an important thing for payers and PBMs, especially in the immunology space and in fact may even hurt you. Just wondering if you can talk about what can be done now with Kevzara to inflect that revenue curve upward. Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Right. So maybe George will comment on the NGF and, this is Len, I'll take the Kevzara question.","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Right. As you said, the story with NGF we think is one where there's an enormous opportunity balanced by a significant risk. I think a lot of people are aware of the risk about this issue of potentially accelerating arthritis in some patients and the question is the degree of tolerance of this acceleration. And remind you, one of the theories for this acceleration may simply be that when you cause pain relief, people over-use their joints but still the mechanism is not that well understood. In terms of the benefit\/risk profile and understanding what could be tolerated, we can't answer that exactly, but we think that what we're using as a sort of barometer is that these patients are already late stage patients, who are in many cases candidates for total joint replacements. So I think that that's a good way to sort of gate the adverse events and how they're impacting.","If overall, you're not causing an increase in the total number of joints that are adversely affected to the point where you need to get a total joint replacement and, if anything, if maybe you're preventing such events, while in some patients you're causing this acceleration, I think that would be considered a favorable benefit\/risk profile if overall in the vast population you're relieving pain. So if you're relieving pain in the large percentage of the population and you're not contributing or, if anything, you're preventing total joint replacements, I think that would be viewed as a profound positive.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","As to the Kevzara question, we refuse to believe that a drug with the strong profile that Kevzara has and the favorable pricing that we have offered cannot make sense in an environment where cost of medicines is a major concern. We applaud the actions of CVS, who gave us \u2013 who recognized that and gave us a good position on the formulary. We would be very disappointed and we'll be very vocal if it can't be that a drug with such good properties and such favorable pricing can't make strong headway. So we've got our work cut out. Our new head of commercial is up to the challenge and so we will report back to you as we go.","Manisha Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First one maybe on ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study since it's going to read out soon. Your competitor Repatha did not show any benefit in cardiovascular mortality. So how important do you think it will be for your drug Praluent to show that benefit? And then secondly, can you talk about life-cycle management strategy for EYLEA now that it seems Ang2 is not going to be going forward into Phase 3? Thank you.","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure. So just to cover ODYSSEY, I don't think that it's worth, Ying, speculating too much on what this result or what that result might be since we don't know the results, but we'll know the results by the March 10 ACC event. So I think we'll all look at the events together basically and we'll be able to judge then. About EYLEA.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","In terms of EYLEA, let me just say that I think we've tried to highlight a couple of things. People ask us a lot about competition. I think it takes a lot to compete in this space. You need a drug that can be given as safely and effectively. You need a drug that can be given as frequently as monthly because patients who turn out that every other month is not enough, doctors desperately want to be able to give them monthly and you need to have that in the label so you can get reimbursed for that higher dosing. You need a drug that has evidence of the long-term maintenance of vision, which has been a question in this field, and you need a drug that has all the indications covered.","The new entrants have yet to start or are only about to start Phase 3 trials. The RTH258 is just about to start or maybe just getting under way in terms of a DME and so they'll be coming to market sometime we believe in 2019 based on their disclosures which would come to market without, as far as we can tell, a monthly label so you can't use it monthly and without a DME label since they haven't even started their Phase 3 trials.","And, of course, when we developed EYLEA we struck a very careful balance which is what we tried to emphasize between safety and efficacy. When you give these anti-VEGF agents in the eye, they go into the systemic circulation. In fact, the very doctor who presented the RTH258 data was the one who was most critical that he didn't want to give our drug to his grandmother because of some subset and the risk of some systemic thromboembolic event.","When you now start to give 6 to 12 times the molar dose into the eye, it's hard to ignore the fact that safety, particularly for example in diabetics, which hasn't been evaluated yet, and the careful safety evaluation that the agency will give that's going to be an important part of this whole formula. So I don't think that the \u2013 the demise of EYLEA I think has been greatly exaggerated as the saying goes.","But in terms of following on, we too struggle when you've got to the heart of a disease which is excess VEGF causing leakiness of blood vessels, and you can block VEGF so exquisitely, you're not going to get too much down the road by adding other agents. We looked at Ang2. Others looked at PDGF. We looked at it. We didn't see a difference. It would not surprise us if the bispecific from Roche showed some nice activity because they're testing against 0.3 milligrams of Lucentis at a strong multiple of that dose.","In terms of our own efforts, we've got as we mentioned preclinical work ongoing in formulation to give you longer-term delivery of EYLEA as well as gene therapy. But at the end of the day, we all got to this field got to the heart of this disease pretty quickly, and that's why it's been hard for anybody to surpass these very powerful anti-VEGF agents. George, you want to add to that a little?","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yes. I just want to build on that just a little bit. We have been working very hard for a very, very long time, more than 20 years now, to build on the benefit that EYLEA provides. And obviously, it's been hard because the bar has been set so high with EYLEA, and I think Len referred to the data. Just imagine that.","I mean, with brolucizumab, they gave 12 times the molar dose of EYLEA, and they could not demonstrate any advantages vis-\u00e0-vis their primary endpoint visual acuity. In fact, as Len mentioned, they were numerically inferior in both studies. And they couldn't also extend substantially on the interval meaning that almost half their patients failed their quarterly interval. So that allows them to maybe allow to have about 50% of the people or so on quarterly dosing, which is just like EYLEA.","So EYLEA has such a high bar, and the only way that so far people are trying to address it is by giving much, much higher molar doses and these molar doses are not really achieving demonstrable, at least in terms of visual acuity or in terms of interval, any advantages. And I think it just shows the bar has been set very high, and I think the flip side is the safety concern.","And when you have something that you have such a long track record with safety, and with also long-term demonstration of ability to maintain the visual gains. That's something else that Len referred to. There's no other agents which have been shown in long-term studies to actually maintain the initial vision gains. That's a very, very high bar, and when Len refers to treating relatives or parents, I think that right now EYLEA would certainly for me be the drug of choice based on the safety and efficacy profile to be treating anybody that I care about.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Manisha Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, we have time for one last question. I know there are many people in the queue, who we're not going to be able to get to on the call, but please send me an e-mail and we'll follow up with you after the call.","Operator","We have Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for the question. I actually had two of them regarding Dupixent. First, I'm wondering if you could talk more about the payer process for Dupixent that's led to some of the frustration you mentioned in your prepared remarks. Curious what's maybe new or different there. Is it unforeseen step that it's prior auth or something else and kind of how you see this dynamic evolving over the course of the year?","And then the second part of the Dupi question is asking just about the relative breakdown of atopic dermatitis patients between adults, adolescents and pediatrics. I know you just started the ped Phase 3, but how much of an interim boost might that adolescent patient population represent given that you'll have Phase 3 data there in 28 (59:05). And is this also a population where you still see a lot of the comorbidities that are so common in pediatric patients? Thanks a lot.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Cory, for the questions. On the second one, we don't have a quantitative answer for you at this time in terms of what we might see the uptake in pediatrics or adolescents, but we do know there are a lot, a lot of patients there. But until we get the label and et cetera, et cetera, and able to promote it, we really can't give you too much of a feel.","In terms of the frustrations we mentioned, the process that Sanofi and Regeneron have undertaken has actually gone very well. Remember we had very rapid coverage from CVS and Express Scripts, almost first day coverage there, literally. And we have continued to grow. In summary 80%, 85% of the plans have made some sort of a decision already on coverage. So we're doing well on that.","The frustration I was referring to was that we still hear that, unfortunately and regrettably, and we hope to shine a light on that \u2013 perhaps we should start a hashtag, #deniedRx. But people, despite being on the right side of the need, the appropriate patients, failed all the right agents and then some, the paperwork has gotten frustrating because I think payers are concerned about the size of this class. And in some cases, they're using their standard tricks. We're going to have to figure out ways to fight back. If somebody wants to tweet about Rx, #deniedRx, it would be okay with me. We'd love to collect some of these stories and hear about how the paperwork has been \u2013 or the denials have been unfair.","We're not suggesting there's a new problem out there that's unique to Dupixent. This is an industry-wide problem that the payers are making it tougher. Praluent is a very good example. Payers are making it very tough for doctors to fill out the forms. We've made some progress now and some of the payers certainly are acting responsibly. It's not a monolith out there. And we want to get as many people on the drug who should be on the drug, and make that process as easy as we can.","Thanks, Cory.","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Well, we should just add that just to remind you, you said we were early in our program with the pediatric atopic dermatitis. One of our Phase 3 studies is fully enrolled and for the 12 to 17 age group, we hope to submit a supplemental BLA by the end of this year. So we're hoping that that opportunity is, in terms of benefiting the younger patients, is going to be pretty forthcoming.","Manisha Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, that concludes our call for today.

Once our call concludes, Bob Landry, Jay Markowitz and the IR team will be available to answer further questions.","With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.","Leonard Schleifer","Thank you, Mark, and good morning to everyone, who has joined us on today's call and webcast. 2018 marked Regeneron's 30th year anniversary and it was a remarkable year for the company. We are pleased with our pipeline progress, our commercial execution and our financial results. And we remain true to our founding mission of inventing important new medicines for patients in need. EYLEA, the market-leading anti-VEGF therapy approved across a range of retinal disease, continues to grow. 2018 U.S. net product sales were $4.08 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year. And 2018 global EYLEA product sales totaled $6.7 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year.","We continue to invest in retinal diseases and are pursuing new indications new formulations and new molecular entities. We have a PDUFA date in May for diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema, or DME, and our submission was based upon our Phase 3 PANORAMA trial, in which we were able to reduce vision-threatening complications of diabetes.","In 2018, we made progress fulfilling Dupixent's pipeline in a product promise by showing efficacy in additional diseases and patient populations. The clinical data continue to support our scientific hypotheses that Dupixent targets the molecular drivers of allergic and atopic deceases. In its first approved indication adult atopic dermatitis, Dupixent is now annualizing above $1 billion in net product sales in the United States alone. George and Marion will provide more detail, but let me emphasize that we are still in the early stages of the Dupixent opportunity with hopefully many more launches in new diseases, geographies and age groups.","Finally, despite the remarkable accomplishments in the nascent field of immuno-oncology most cancer patients still don't benefit from this approach. We believe that the comprehensive and differentiated strategy that George outlined for you at the JPMorgan Conference is already beginning to deliver on its potential: to bring the hope and promise of immuno-oncology to many more patients. In September 2018, Libtayo became the third FDA-approved PD-1 antibody and the first FDA-approved therapy for the treatment of advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. In December at the 2018 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting or ASH, we presented new data for REGN1979 our wholly-owned CD20xCD3 bispecific, which we are advancing this year into potentially registrational studies.","We simplified and amended our immuno-oncology discovery agreement with our collaborator Sanofi. In the new agreement, we will continue to collaborate on the Libtayo as well as our MUC16xCD3 and BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody programs. For the rest of our immuno-oncology programs including our co-stimulatory bispecifics Regeneron retains exclusive rights.","In summary, in 2018 we continue to build upon the foundation that we established over the last 30 years, which positions us for future continued success as an innovative biotechnology company. And as I said at JPMorgan after 30 years all of us at Regeneron feel that we are just getting started.","With that, I will now turn the call over to George.","George Yancopoulos","Thank you, Leonard, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to begin with our efforts to continue to expand and optimize the benefits provided to patients by EYLEA. As a reminder, in September of 2018, the FDA accepted our supplemental BLA for diabetic retinopathy with an action date of May 13, 2019. This potential label expansion to include patients with diabetic retinopathy without DME coupled with our existing approval in DME puts EYLEA on the forefront of treating diabetic eye diseases.","Let me emphasize data from our Phase 3 PANORAMA study in diabetic retinopathy. In addition to anatomic improvement, we have for the first time shown that EYLEA can reduce vision-threatening complications in people who have diabetic retinopathy. Contrary to the perception of some that diabetic retinopathy is a slowly evolving condition, our PANORAMA study demonstrated that patients with moderately severe or severe diabetic retinopathy may progress rapidly developing vision-threatening complications or new onset DME.","With more than 40% of the overall patient population suffering from these events and more than 50% of the patients in the severe category certainly showing the high risk that these patients are under. In the overall patient population, EYLEA reduced these events by more than 75%. In patients with -- in any case more complete data on the 52-week Phase 3 PANORAMA study will be presented in Angiogenesis Meeting on Saturday and has been submitted to the FDA. It is remarkable that despite many attempts to improve upon the efficacy of VEGF blockade for retinal disease based on the data we have seen no other mechanism has proven more beneficial and no other drug can have that pivotal trials has shown superior visual acuity compared to EYLEA, but we aren't standing still. Our goal is to further advance the treatment of retinal diseases.","Later this year, we will begin clinical development of a higher-dose formulation of aflibercept to determine whether it can safely provide improved efficacy and longer-lasting benefit. In addition, we are actively developed a new molecular entities, which we may advance to clinical trials as soon as this year. And we are in the earlier stages of development for the gene therapies and other noble approaches.","I'd now like to turn to Dupixent. Our own clinical study support decades of basic science suggesting the target of Dupixent that is interleukin-4 interleukin-13 signaling is a fundamental driver of type two inflammation common to many allergic or atopic deceases. This scientific insight underlies, the basis of why many believe Dupixent is a pipeline in the product. Following our FDA approval for adult atopic dermatitis in 2017 and our approval in asthma at the end of last year, we are anticipating three important upcoming regulatory milestones for Dupixent. First, a decision by the FDA in adolescent atopic dermatitis, with an action date of March 13, 2019; second an EMA decision in the first half of the year on asthma in adults and adolescents; and third potential FDA acceptance of the supplemental BLA for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis based on two overwhelmingly positive Phase 3 studies.","As Dupixent potentially expands into adolescence with atopic dermatitis, it is important to remember, how serious and devastating this disease can be. The teenage years are hard enough without debilitating skin condition and may impact self image lead and the ability to concentrate in school. Most of the patients in our trials are disease covering over half their bodies. And patients have described the accompanying itch as similar to unrelenting poison ivy that never goes away. As measured by EZ score, Dupixent reduce the extensive severity of skin lesions by an average of 60% to 70%, with significant improvements in other measures including itch. Beyond, its potential approval in adolescence, we hope to bring the benefit of Dupixent to even younger AD patients. In this year, we expect to report results of the Phase 3 trial in patients aged 6 to 11 years.","Turning to Dupixent in asthma. We are anticipating approval in the EU and Japan later this year. U.S. asthma launch is under way and it's particularly gratifying to see good early uptake among allergists, who have had prior experience in Dupixent for patients with atopic dermatitis. You will hear more about the asthma launch from Marion. It is widely appreciated for patients with serious allergic diseases. Our trials demonstrate substantial level of co-morbid conditions in individual patients. For example, in our adolescent atopic dermatitis trials more than 50% had asthma as well, and more than 60% to 70% had another allergic condition such as food allergy or inhaled allergies. Many believe that allergic atopic diseases is a systemic condition driven by immune imbalance due to the Type 2 inflammation, which manifests itself to different degrees in different parts of the body in different patients.","Consistent with this viewpoint and with our own emerging clinical data, we're exploring multiple potential new allergic or atopic conditions for Dupixent. As I mentioned previously, we have a pending supplementary BLA for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. In addition, we have recently initiated Phase 2\/3 study of dupilumab in patients and adolescents with eosinophilic esophagitis. The Phase 2 study in collaboration with Aimmune Therapeutics of dupilumab in peanut allergy were we have complete enrollment in Phase 2 study for grass allergy. We'll update you in the future about new trials and new indications.","We view our interleukin-33 program as a potential complement to Dupixent. We are studying REGN3500, our interleukin-33 antibody both as monotherapy as well as in combination with Dupixent in several indications including asthma, atopic dermatitis and COPD. We will report results of the Phase 2 study in asthma in 2019. Two Phase 2 studies in atopic dermatitis were recently initiated: an anti-interleukin-33 monotherapy dose response study and a combination study with Dupixent. While it is unlikely that interleukin-33 blockade alone will provide the degree of benefit observed with Dupixent, our program is designed to capture any potential incremental benefit that may result from the combination.","Moving on now to our immuno-oncology portfolio. We recently unveiled what we believe is a rational and comprehensive immuno-oncology strategy with our PD-1 antibody Libtayo at its foundation. In September of 2018, Libtayo the third FDA-approved anti-PD-1 became the first FDA-approved treatment of any kind for advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC. Outside the United States, the European Medicine Agency is reviewing our regulatory application and we expect a decision later this year.","To maximize the substantial Libtayo opportunity in dermatoencology, we will be commencing adjuvant studies in CSCC in the first half of 2019 with new adjuvant studies to follow. And we are studying Libtayo in other skin cancers that we believe will have a benefit. Beyond dermatoencology, we consider non-small cell lung cancer been major potential indication for Libtayo. Our Phase 3 program in non-small cell lung cancer is building on the rapidly evolving treatment paradigm.","As we stated previously, we have doubled the size of our trial comparing Libtayo monotherapy to chemotherapy in PD-L1-high patients. Regard in combinations, we'll be focusing our efforts in first-line treating and combination therapy of Libtayo with chemotherapy. The ongoing Phase 3 combination study is being augmented to enroll non-small cell lung cancer patients irrespective of histology and the levels of PD-L1 expression and to randomize to Libtayo plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone.","Amazingly enough despite the years of effort in many pivotal trials there's only one PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody approved as monotherapy in first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. If our ongoing trials succeed, we have the potential to be the second. Unfortunately for patients even in tumor settings with some response, the majority of patients still do not benefit from PD-1 blockade. Moreover, little benefit has been demonstrated with PD-1 and PD-L1 blockade or any other immunotherapy in many of the most common tumor types such as prostate, pancreatic, colorectal and breast. This honestly is an important area of unmet need.","As you heard me say recently, we are excited about our bispecific franchise. And in particular two classes: the CD3 bispecifics and the costimulatory bispecifics. We believe that these bispecifics may have important anticancer activity on their own and in combinations that can include the Libtayo have the potential to extend the benefits of the immunotherapy in both immunoresponsive tumors as well as thus far immuno-unresponsive tumor types. Many of our CD3 bispecifics are already in the clinic with one of them showing impressive initial results as a monotherapy in very-advanced late-stage patients.","In December of 2018 at ASH, we presented the exciting data from REGN1979 our CD20xCD3 bispecific for B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma or NHL. At doses we are considering for potential pivotal trials, treating these patients with relapsed\/refractory follicular lymphoma resulted in a 100% objective response rate and an 80% complete response rate. Nine out of 10 patients maintained their response during treatment. And the one patient who progressed did so in the setting of prolonged treatment interruption.","At higher doses, we're also seeing increases in the response rates in the harder-to-treat relapsed\/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or DLBCL. And are approaching the level of response reported with CAR-Ts. Based on our emerging data, in 2019 we're planning to initiate potential pivotal studies with our CD20xCD3 bispecific for third-line follicular lymphoma as well as DLBCL. Our second CD3 bispecific antibody to enter clinical development targets MUC16 for ovarian cancer. The MUC16 epitope that we target is the remaining nub of membrane-bound protein that when shed is known as CA125, the well-known biomarker for ovarian cancer.","And our BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody has just entered clinical development for the treatment of multiple myeloma. We're encouraged by preliminary results of both CAR-T as well as BiTEs targeting BCMA in multiple myeloma and believe that our BCMAxCD3 bispecific has a potential of being an important addition in this new area. We recently announced that we're introducing to the clinic an entirely new class of bispecifics which we term costimulatory bispecifics. Compelling data in our animal models indicate that this new class of bispecific can enhance the anticancer benefit when combined with our PD-1 antibody as well as with our CD3 class of bispecifics. This year we will be introducing two of these costimulatory bispecifics into the clinic.","We entered the field of immuno-oncology with a long-term and comprehensive addition. We have created a large number of rational combination opportunities, enabled by the mixing and matching of our technology platforms and capabilities. There are settings like advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma for Libtayo and advanced relapsed refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma for REGN1979, where our antibodies have demonstrated an impressive single agent activity in the clinical trials. In many other settings, however, monotherapy is unlikely to be enough. This is where our combination strategy comes into play. And to supplement our internal efforts, we have collaborations and companies like bluebird that our therapeutic modality is potential synergistic with those that we have in-house.","Let me change gears now to fasinumab, our antibody to nerve growth factor, or NGF, the chronic pain from osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. I want to highlight two key points regarding our ongoing program. First, as we reported in August, fasinumab continued to show good efficacy in our latest Phase 3 study. At week 16 the study met both co-primary endpoints and all key secondary endpoints. We believe that we may have identified the minimally effective dose that may mitigate treatment associated arthropathies in total joint replacement that have been observed at higher doses and are the major safety concern this class.","With each day that goes by, we've got safety signals stopping the Phase 3 studies, we are just one step closer to bringing this drug to the many people who are now suffering and sometimes seek alternative treatments such as opioids. I've given you just a few updates about some of the seven Regeneron-discovered drugs that are now approved and 16 additional drug candidates in our clinical pipeline. We don't have time in our prepared remarks to discuss them all, we were happy to take questions during the Q&A.","Before I close, I would like to highlight that the Regeneron Genetics Center has recently sequenced its 500,000 individual on top of this major accomplishment, our goal is to sequence another 0.5 million people in 2019. These genetic sequences are all linked to detailed electronic medical records. Along with our collaborators like Geisinger Health System and the UK Biobank\u2019s and with funding from our colleagues in the biopharmaceutical industry, we are amassing what would be the world's largest big data human sequencing resource, which is making a significant contribution to a drug discovery and development efforts.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marion. ","Marion McCourt","Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start with EYLEA. For the fourth quarter U.S. EYLEA net product sales grew 11% year-over-year to $1.08 billion and for the full year 2018 U.S. EYLEA sales grew 10% to $4.08 billion. EYLEA sales growth resulted from an increase in demand and not from price. Based on U.S. net product sales EYLEA continues to be the market leader with 72% of the overall branded U.S. anti-VEGF market in the fourth quarter. We continue to see overall market growth in both wet AMD and DME driven by the aging population increase in diabetes prevalence and physician preference for EYLEA. Approximately 90% of patients across all peer segments can access EYLEA as their first line of therapy.","Regeneron will continue to stay engaged with stakeholders in order to preserve physician choice and patient access to EYLEA and its significant clinical benefits. Building on our leadership position and wet AMD and diabetic eye disease, we see a major growth opportunity for EYLEA in diabetic retinopathy without DME. The PDUFA date for this new indication is May 13th.","As a reminder of the estimated 3.5 million people in the U.S. with diabetic retinopathy without DME approximately one million individuals have moderately severe or severe disease and are at greatest risk for progression in loss of vision. We believe the PANORAMA results that George discussed support early intervention with EYLEA and may help evolve the clinical treatment paradigm. Pending approval of EYLEA in this indication comprehensive plans are in place to support disease education focused on the benefits of early treatment. We also remain on track to launch EYLEA prefilled syringe in 2019 pending regulatory approval.","Turning now to Dupixent. Local net product sales in the fourth quarter were $319 million and in the U.S. alone reached $259 million, representing 18% quarter-over-quarter growth, and 89% year-over-year. Prescriber experience and depth continued to improve with approximately 14% health care providers having prescribed Dupixent and over 46,000 patients have received therapy. There is a notable increase in Dupixent prescribing trends with weekly new-to-brand prescriptions or NBRx increasing to between 750 and 850 patients per week compared to approximately 500 to 600 per week in earlier quarters.","We attribute our robust fourth quarter performance to patient and physician experience our overall promotional campaign, field force impact, national branded television advertisement for atopic dermatitis, and the asthma launch. On October 19th, the FDA-approved Dupixent's second major U.S. indication in moderate-to-severe asthma in patients aged 12 years and older with an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma. We expect a regulatory decision in the EU and Japan in the first half of this year. Three months into the U.S. asthma launch, we're encouraged by the early uptake in prescriber interest. Our goal is for Dupixent to be the preferred first-line biologic for indicated patients with moderate-to-severe asthma. At this point, in the launch, we estimate that over two-thirds of Dupixent asthma patients are new to biologics.","Allergists and pulmonologists recognize the benefits of Dupixent's differentiated clinical profile as the first and only biologic that targets two key cytokines central to Type 2 inflammation. Dupixent is also differentiated on its efficacy and exacerbations on lung function, establish safety profile and flexibility as the only asthma biologic to offer self or at-home administration. In addition, we would like to emphasize the positive impact of allergists familiarity with Dupixent for their atopic dermatitis patients.","Currently, a majority of our prescriptions are coming from the specialty. We look forward to providing insight on the asthma launch in the coming months. Additionally, we believe that substantial opportunity remains in atopic dermatitis. To-date, despite the impressive market experience that I described less than 15% of adult AD patients in greatest need have received Dupixent therapy. We expect further U.S. growth if the FDA approves Dupixent in adolescence ages 12 to 17 on our March 11 PDUFA date. As a reminder, we estimate that the number of potential adolescent patients is about half of the target adult atopic dermatitis population. Further, we expect data from our pediatric study in atopic dermatitis ages 6 to 11 in 2019.","I'd now like to turn to Libtayo, which was launched in the U.S. on October 1, as the first FDA-approved treatment for patients with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or local advanced disease who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation. In the EU, we expect a decision later in 2019. In the U.S., fourth quarter net product sales were $15 million, driven by demand. This launch we've made in-roads in establishing Libtayo is a standard of care across all lines of therapy in advanced CSCC. Engagement with the medical community remains very positive, especially with medical oncologists and most surgeons.","We quickly established broad market access in the reimbursement coverage for Libtayo, with approximately 95% of total commercial, Medicare and Medicaid lives covered. We believe that significant opportunities remain to increase Libtayo usage both for first-line and second-line treatment under our approved indication. As a reminder, CSCC is a life-threatening condition responsible for an estimated 7,000 U.S. deaths each year. Based on demographics and enhancements in patient identification referrals, we expect the number of newly diagnosed patients to rise annually.","Now to Praluent. Global net product sales in the fourth quarter were $93 million, including $60 million in the U.S. In 2018, we made strides to remove access and affordability barriers. And we continue to engage with key stakeholders to drive demand. As a reminder, this market is highly impacted by discounting and contracting, which may affect net sales. As noted last quarter, we've submitted data from the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial to regulatory authorities in the EU and in the U.S. Earlier this week, we announced a positive CHMP opinion for the proposed indication in Europe. And in the U.S., the FDA target action date is April 28, 2019.","Moving to Kevzara. Global net product sales in the fourth quarter were $35 million including $27 million in the U.S. as demand improved. Within the IL-6 subcutaneous class, Kevzara now has 38% of dispensed NBRx share and 23% of TRx share. Kevzara has reimbursement coverage for 98% of U.S. commercial lives with 79% of patients able to access Kevzara as either first-line biologic or after failing one or two other biologic therapies.","I'll now turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Landry","Thank you, Marion, and good morning to everyone on the call today. Regeneron delivered record financial results during the fourth quarter of 2018 and completed a year of strong financial performance. For the fourth quarter, non-GAAP diluted net income per share grew 31% to $6.84 on non-GAAP net income of $786 million. And for the full-year, non-GAAP diluted net income per share grew 40% to $22.84 on non-GAAP net income of $2.62 billion.","Total revenues were $1.93 billion for the fourth quarter and $6.71 billion for the full year 2018 which represented 22% growth versus fourth quarter 2017 and 14% growth versus full year 2017. For the fourth quarter of 2018, revenue growth continue to be driven by global sales of EYLEA and a significant increase in Sanofi collaboration revenue due to lower losses from the commercialization of antibodies and the recording of a cumulative catch-up adjustment to revenue, principally due to the amendment of the immuno-oncology discovery and development agreement. For the fourth quarter of 2018, global net product sales of EYLEA were $1.8 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. For the full year, global EYLEA net product sales were $6.75 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year. In our reported U.S. EYLEA results, distributor inventory experienced a slight increase in the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to the third quarter of 2018, yet remained within our normal 1- to 2-week targeted range.","Ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales recorded by our collaborator Bayer were $724 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 representing a 14% reported and an 18% operational or constant-currency basis increase year-over-year. For the full year of 2018, Ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $2.67 billion and grew 20% on a reported basis and 18% on an operational basis as compared to the full year of 2017. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $302 million of which $271 million was derived from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. The $271 million represents year-over-year reported growth of 17% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. For full year 2018, total Bayer collaboration revenue was $1.08 billion.","Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $428 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 and $1.11 billion for the full year of 2018. The increase in Sanofi collaboration revenue in the fourth quarter and full year 2018 versus the prior periods in 2017 was primarily due to increased spend and thus reimbursement for Libtayo clinical development activities, lower losses associated with the commercialization of antibodies and the recording of a cumulative catch-up adjustment to revenue of $149 million, primarily in connection with the amendment of the immuno-oncology discovery and development agreement.","Under the terms of the amended immuno-oncology discovery and development agreement, Sanofi paid the company $462 million which included the reimbursement of fourth quarter 2018 Regeneron incurred research and development costs of $46 million, the prepayment of $120 million for development activities for two bispecific programs, BCMAxCD3 and MUC16xCD3 in a termination payment. Revenue associated with the cumulative catch-up is recorded in the other line item of the Sanofi collaboration revenue reported in table four of our press release.","In the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized a loss of $44 million in connection with the commercialization of products under the antibody license and collaboration agreement with Sanofi, which compares favorably to a loss of $114 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. But as anticipated, this quarter's loss was slightly higher than the $39 million loss from the third quarter of 2018. The lower share loss versus the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily attributable to higher global net product sales of Dupixent and to a lesser extent Praluent and KEVZARA, continued cost containment for Praluent, partly offset by an increase in Dupixent commercialization expenses to support the launch in asthma and ongoing global launches in atopic dermatitis.","As we've discussed on our November 2018 earnings conference call, we continue to expect the Alliance's financial results remain variable for the next few quarters as we incur launch expenses for new indications, including a potential label expansion for adolescent patients aged 12 to 17 with atopic dermatitis and launches into new international markets.","Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $533 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 and $1.96 billion for full year 2018 as compared to $444 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $1.78 billion for the full year 2017. The fourth quarter 2018 increase in non-GAAP R&D expense was the result of an increase in Libtayo clinical cost and higher overall R&D headcount and facilities-related costs, partly offset by a decrease in Dupixent and Praluent development costs.","Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense which is calculated as the total non-GAAP R&D expense, less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, was $347 million for the fourth quarter 2018 compared to $265 million for the fourth quarter 2017. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by our share of higher immuno-oncology clinical cost and R&D activities associated with the growing number of wholly-owned programs. For year 2018, non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense was $1.22 billion. Our press release includes all the information required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense.","For 2019, we are reaffirming our previously provided guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $1.59 billion to $1.71 billion. The increase in our 2019 non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D guidance as compared to full year 2018 is primarily attributable to higher clinical trial and manufacturing costs to support Regeneron's wholly-owned programs, including four to six new molecules expected to be advanced into the clinic in 2019 and lower Sanofi reimbursement as a result of the amended immuno-oncology discovery and development agreement.","Next. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $411 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 and $1.36 billion for the full year 2018. As noted, on our November 2018 earnings call, we realized a higher SG&A spend level in the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to the first three quarters of 2018, primarily due to incremental spent for Dupixent, including DTC in the U.S. asthma launch, EYLEA, the launch of Libtayo, as well as higher contributions to independent not-for-profit patient-assisting organizations.","We reaffirm our previous 2019 guidance for non-GAAP SG&A expense to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. The increase in our guidance compared to full year 2018 is primarily driven by increased spend for Dupixent, EYLEA and Libtayo. Dupixent's increased spend will be focused on the recent U.S. launch of asthma, the expected U.S. launch in atopic dermatitis for adolescent patients and continued support for the atopic dermatitis indication for adults including DTC.","2019 EYLEA spend increases will be focused on capitalizing on potential new growth opportunity of EYLEA in diabetic retinopathy without DME as explained earlier by Marion and increased patient support programs. Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue was $127 million for the fourth quarter 2018 and $426 million for the full year of 2018. We reaffirm our full year 2019 guidance of Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses to be in the range of $510 million and $560 million.","Turning now to taxes. Our effective tax rate was negative 21% and positive 4% for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 respectively as compared to 69% and 42% for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. The effective tax rate for both the fourth quarter and full year 2018 was positively impacted primarily by the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the sale of non-inventory-related assets between foreign subsidiaries that was finalized at the end of 2018. Remember, the 2017 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as we had to write-down certain deferred tax assets due to a lower Federal tax rate.","In the fourth quarter 2018, we finalized our assessment of the remeasurement of our net deferred tax asset due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and elected to recognize deferred taxes for global intangible low tax income primarily referred to as guilty. The net tax impact from both the remeasurement of our net deferred tax asset and sale of non-inventory-related assets have been excluded from both fourth quarter and full year 2018 non-GAAP net income as outlined within table three of our press release.","We continue to monitor regulatory guidance under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and changes in the global tax environment and will respond as appropriate to ensure our tax strategy is efficient and aligned with our business operations. We are reaffirming our 2019 guidance for our effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 16%. I want to remind you that as in prior years, we will have volatility from quarter-to-quarter in our tax rate due to the timing of deductions for stock-based compensation.","Turning next to cash flow and the December 31, 2018 balance sheet. Regeneron ended the fourth quarter of 2018 with cash and marketable securities of $4.6 billion. And generated free cash flow in excess of $1.8 billion for full year 2018. We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures for the full year 2018 were $383 million. We are reaffirming our previous 2019 capital expenditure guidance of between $410 million and $490 million.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Mark.","Mark Hudson","Thank you, Bob. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ying Huang","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. First question on EYLEA, obviously you're waiting for FDA approval in diabetic retinopathy. Can you tell us whether you do think that's going to be a significant growth driver for 2019? Or do you think we should EYLEA -- we should expect EYLEA to provide market growth rate? And then maybe you can comment on the net pricing trend in 2019 for EYLEA as well? Secondly, can you talk about Dupixent outlook? Do you believe the asthma indication will start to be a more important growth driver versus atopic dermatitis for 2019? Thank you.","Leonard Schleifer","Okay. So thanks for the questions, Ying. On the issue of whether or not diabetic retinopathy is going to be a growth driver in 2019? I think it will be in the early stages of the launch that indication. It's going to think a lot of patient education because it's a paradigm shift. So we don't give guidance, but from a general point of view, I think is going to take some time to develop that market. Pricing trends, I'm not sure what you're getting at. Whether you're talking about external forces or not? But our price has been marked very modestly impacted to the negative side, based upon a slight discount that was provided across the board in 2018. And in terms of asthma, Marion? ","Marion McCourt","I am happy to comment on asthma. So I gave you some information today on what is very early in the launch and favorable indicators. As I look at your question on asthma growth opportunities for the future, we do see that as very important. It's not the only Dupixent growth driver asthma describe the atopic dermatitis growth opportunity in adults and with FDA approval potentially with the adolescents this year.","But back to your question on asthma, what's most interesting in these early stages of launch is the response that we're hearing from both allergists and pulmonologists to the differentiating profile of Dupixent. Both in terms of its clinical efficacy, the established safety profile and then also there's very, very important factor of patients being able to self administer or at home administer, that coupled with the fact that for some of these physicians, they're treating patients that have co-morbidities such as when other Type II diseases occur with asthma.","So again it's very early days, but we feel good about the early launch. And I look forward to giving updates in the future. I'll also remind, just in terms of size of patient population for asthma biologics, it's about a 1 million patients. But to-date only about 100,000 patients have been treated, eligible asthma patients with Biologics. So it is a market with tremendous opportunity. ","Mark Hudson","Operator next question?","Bob Landry","I'd like to just add to Len's point in response to the contribution in diabetic retinopathy market opportunity. I don't want to address the market opportunity specifically, but very importantly about whether this should really be paradigm shifting and whether or not there should really be a new way of treating patients? And I think that looking at the data, physicians are going to have make their decisions. But there is a lot of very important outcomes from our study. Number one is already mentioned. That the rates of visions threatening complications in progression in people who have moderate and particularly severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy is I think much higher than most people thought.","Once people progress, treatment at that point we know, is probably not going to be as good as prevention. And I think it's a very important question now asked in terms of physicians in the entire community, should we be working harder to prevent onsets of the diseases and loss of vision that you may never get back? And in this particular case, is a little bit of prevention really worthwhile for the so many patients who are in a such high risk? And I think that something that the community I'm sure is going to be debating strongly especially when all this data is comes out and it is digested and is discussed.","Mark Hudson","Operator, next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Q \u2013 Chris Raymond","Hey. Thanks. Just a \u2013 maybe a couple of pipeline questions. So first just on the CD20 costimulatory bispecifics. IgG antibodies have had some challenges I guess in the solid tumor setting due to the physiologic and physical properties of these tumors. So your bispecifics maintain an IgG-like structure. I guess, can you maybe talk about some of the properties of these antibodies that may allow for better tumor penetration? And how you going to be maybe little bit more descriptive of that as we get into the clinic with these two? And then, also maybe on your C5 antibody 3918, I think in your press release you talked about initiating a Phase 2 trial in PNH. But Len, I think I've heard you say last month in San Francisco that enrolling a switching study from eculizumab might be a challenge. So maybe any color there as to the plan just targeted at new patients or some other strategy? And maybe if there is some other complement-mediated disease that may make sense as well. Thanks.","Leonard Schleifer ","So it's a highly competitive space. So we're not going to get too much into our thinking on C5. But as we get down the road, I think our strategy will emerge. I'm going to let George of course deal with the CD28 question.","George Yancopoulos","Yeah I think there's a whole field of pseudoscience that somehow seems to think that the problem with getting responses in solid tumors have something to do with antibodies not having access. Actually, if one really looks carefully and objectively at all the data, if anything there is better access to the tumor immune blood vessels become actually more permeable and leaky in the levels of natural antibodies as well as administering antibodies is actually much higher in those settings. So that has nothing to do with our strategy or our approach. Our belief and I think the overwhelming science argues that the lack of response to has much more do with very specific immune recognition issues. And that's exactly what our co-stems do. They add another level of activation specifically targeted against tumor which will add to the immunotherapy benefits of either, for example checkpoint inhibitors such as PD-1 or the more conventional CD3 like bispecifics.","So it's all about properly manipulating the immune environment to attack the tumor. And the problems have really nothing to do with antibody access and whether you're using a full-length antibody or something that's smaller. And certainly, all you have to due to understand that is look at the performance of our CD3 bispecific compared to for example smaller bites. And that I think \u2013 even cross study shows that the activities are really not at all limited by the size of the reagents. And that's about it. ","Q \u2013 Chris Raymond","Okay. Thank you.","Mark Hudson","In the interest of time, I just want to \u2013 as a reminder to ensure that we get to many people as possible. We could just limit the Q&A to one question at this time. Operator, can you please go to the next caller?","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey Porges","Thank you very much. And congratulations on both the results and not being mentioned in the safety union last night. I wonder if we could talk a little bit about the cadence through the year, Bob, your revenue and income statement is notoriously hard to model. And you did have quite a few one-time items -- non-recurring items in Q4. Could you give us a sense of how we should be thinking about collaboration revenue through the year? And whether we should expect it to be a step down in revenue in Q1 which is what we've heard about for many of your peers. Thanks very much. You also commented about the cadence or expenses through the year, just so we can try and get our models a little bit more in line with your outlook. Thanks.","Bob Landry","Yeah. Geoff, as you know, I mean, we don't get into that much specifics with regards to the quarterly division on expenses and on revenue. I will say which may not be so evident. With regards to the fourth quarter for Sanofi 2018, right, I mean, we did call out the catch-up adjustment that we\u2019re talking about as a result of amending the I\/O discovery agreement. So I think that that's clear.","But what I also think didn\u2019t get caught during the year is that we did terminate the I\/O \u2013 sorry, the antibody discovery agreement at the end of 2017. So for each of my quarters in 2018 as it pertains to Sanofi, I was going up against the 2017 run rate that included $130 million of the antibody discovery agreement that I will not have to go up against in 2019. So when people saw the fourth quarter, sure, the one-time catch-up adjustment was significant. But also, I didn't go up against the 2017 fourth quarter Sanofi antibody development because it had been exhausted by the third quarter of 2017. So, again, a lot of maturations with regards to that.","I don't see anything special with regards to how we would break out expenses throughout the year. I mean, we don't have that much seasonal impact. I have been reading the comments that you've said amongst our peers. I do not express to have the kind of the same to same inkling that you've heard from them. And that's what -- that's been put out to the street on it.","Mark Hudson","Operator, next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Terence Flynn","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. The first one is I was just wondering now the common period is closed, would be great to hear your latest thoughts on the Part B demonstration project. If you think the final version will include a provision for EU reference pricing? And if you can't answer that, would love to hear about insight on the Libtayo launch. Maybe just talk a little bit about more about the kind of breadth of prescribing? How many of your target accounts are already prescribing or connect over the course of the year? Thanks.","Leonard Schleifer","So I'll let Marion cover them in on Libtayo and we'll give you your two questions since you guys are so convicted on your opinions about us. We'll anticipate something has got to give regarding the international reference pricing situation, because the public, the administration, myself personally and a lot of people in the industry I think feel and Americans in general feel it's a bit unfair for America to produce all the drugs to its research and development ecosystem and finance it to its financial marketplace and then pay for it for its consumers. And then have a very well-healed European companies get those drugs at a much lower price. The trouble is figuring out a system that can really balance that.","And as I've said before when you have a biotechnology companies who have given away the European rights, there is no way to connect those to pricing. You can open it up while you want, but you have different people making pricing decisions. So I think the administration does get that. To the extent that this will force people to give them as I said before courage we'll see. Our sense is a little bit of opposition to the way that has been proposed on the hill, but we have to see how it all come washes out.","Marion on the Libtayo?","Marion McCourt","So happy to comment on the Libtayo launch. First and foremost, incredibly important because Libtayo is the first product with the approval that I mentioned earlier this morning on four CSCC patients with metastatic and advanced disease where previously they didn't have a treatment therapy. So we've had great interest. To your question on the targets of our activities. We've certainly seen uptake in appropriate way albeit early in the launch from some of the most prestigious academic centers. And we see that on a geographic basis across the country. Similarly we're also seeing uptake, secondarily in more community, large hospital settings that has sophisticated oncology, and also in some instances move surgeons in their practice.","I'd also comment that as we look very carefully at the launch, I reported today on 15 million ex-factory sales, I mentioned that it is demand driven. This is not a product with a lot of inventory building and what we are seeing is that each month we're showing progress in terms of demand for a Libtayo. So early days we're pleased. The payor and access coverage as I mentioned went quickly and was very well managed by our team, so we feel very good about the launch of Libtayo. We're working very hard on it.","Leonard Schleifer","Everybody has their own metrics turns for how launch is going. But the one that I use is when oncologist calls us up and tell us that he had a gentleman who had had a continue squamous cell carcinoma and exhausted all possible treatments including multiple rounds of surgery, maximum radiation therapy, other types of targeted and chemotherapy.","And was in the midst of discussion and headed for hospice because the tumor had invaded from the skin deep into his jaw and then to the base of his skull. He wasn't able to eat let alone smile. Heading for hospice to the days after the drug was approved this oncologist had heard about drug and a podcast convinced the patient to try it. And six weeks later, the patient was home for the holidays with a big smile on his face. Those are the source of the anecdote that tell us that this launch is making a difference and will go pretty well. Next question?","Mark Hudson","Operator next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Carter Gould from UBS. Please go ahead.","Carter Gould","Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Question I guess for George or Len. On the bispecific -- on your CD20xCD3, just wanted to kind of get your latest thoughts on those think and specifically if you've nail down the go forward business with those pivotal studies, we recognize you're probably not going to give answers on this call, but just if you've nail those down internally and\/or you're still waiting on some of the higher-dose data? Thank you.","Leonard Schleifer","Well, I think as we've indicated and as we've shown in our presentations in follicular lymphoma, the results are so impressive. We certainly think we're in the right dose range. And with the DLBCL, we are now getting the sort of activities that are starting to approach, one might be seeing, with CAR-T-type therapies and so forth. So we certainly think we're in the right sort of dose range. And as we said, we anticipate being able to start pivotal studies in both of those settings this year.","Mark Hudson"," Operator, next question? ","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Geoff Meacham","Good morning, guys. Thanks a lot for the question. I appreciate it. Bigger picture question. So Libtayo opens up a new therapy area for you guys. But I want to ask about the broader I\/O strategy. If rational combos are the main basis, how much of an emphasis does Regeneron place on novel MOAs are targeted, versus evaluating targets, let's say, pharma or others have explored? I'm just trying get a sense for differentiation in the oncology strategy. Thanks.","George Yancopoulos"," Well, I think that it's a mix of course. But as you can see from our whole new class of bispecifics the CD28s, we I think are leading a whole new approach that will allow for an entirely new group of combination opportunities. And particularly as we tried to explain, the opportunity to now activate immune responses and activate the ability of checkpoint inhibitors like the PD-1s to actually help in cancers that historically have not been viewed as immune responsive, which is, as you know, the vast majority of them.","So we believe and I think a lot of other people now believe that we have one of the most innovative and leading-edge approaches to combination opportunities and that certainly having Libtayo as our foundation, approach is only going to help these novel approaches trying to extend the benefit to many more patients in need.","Leonard Schleifer "," And I would add to that Geoff the -- having the multiple approaches such as an approved PD-1 CD20xCD3, the costims that George mentioned and all the others, even some that others may have, under one umbrella one program I think is very powerful and efficient way to be able to move forward.","Mark Hudson","Operator, next question? ","Operator","Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Cory Kasimov","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask you about Dupixent and on the asthma side of things. Curious how you're thinking about kind of future biologic penetration in both the moderate and severe asthma patients kind of sub-populations with the entrance of Dupi and other biologics. I mean, today, it's obviously been pretty modest for other biologics, even in the severe setting. So I'm curious how you see that changing over time. Thanks.","Marion McCourt"," So our label, Cory, as you know, includes both moderate and severe patients. It's not unusual that early in a launch we'll probably tend to get some of the type of patients. As I mentioned, we skew a little bit more towards biologic-naive patients, then switches of -- at this point, that have heard discussions of both and see evidence and the data of both. But on \u2013 I think we'll have to give it a little time, so I can give you a more robust answer on patient types and uptake of the launch.","But certainly, we think the product profile that I've reviewed. In summary, the efficacy, the safety, the ease-of-use and the interest of the two major prescribing audiences of allergists and pulmonologists suggest that we have an important indication and a significant opportunity ahead.","Leonard Schleifer ","I think as Marion had mentioned maybe in her prepared remarks, but if not, just to reemphasize, a lot of factors of the allergists had a great experience with DUPI in atopic dermatitis and they might make up the fraction of prescribers. Not necessarily because they are treating patients with comorbid conditions although they can and that's in the label and they very well might. But the fact that they've had experience in another highly allergic disease has been so positive I think that that's having a nice halo effect for us, particularly amongst the allergists.","George Yancopoulos","And just like EYLEA has an opportunity really paradigm shifting in terms of having the opportunity to really change the practice of how you treat high risk diabetic retinopathy patient. I think Dupixent in asthma in particular, but in all of its settings has a real opportunity paradigm shifting, because I think there's increasing appreciation that all of these so-called allergic or atopic disease are really systemic conditions where the body's immune system has gone awry and gone in the wrong direction. And the data is starting to build up that Dupixent is really addressing this systemic probation of the immune system.","And as we accumulate more and more data more and more clinical studies and more and more indications this may become increasingly clear and increase the opportunity. This is really a paradigm shifting where you can really change the course of an immune system and how it's gone wrong: by correcting and correcting it in all of its manifestations, not just in one tissue and one organ which is how historically medical community treats diseases. So I think in the long term, Dupixent really has an opportunity a very paradigm shifting in this space as well.","Mark Hudson","Operator, next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Adnan Butt from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Adnan Butt","Thanks for the question. Maybe one detail. At this stage, are you able to break out that Dupixent asthma and atopic dermatitis and then the NBRx number Marion that you gave out, is that only for atopic dermatitis? Or is that a combined asthma number?","Marion McCourt","So the numbers that I gave you in NBRx those were combined numbers. And of course, you know the timing of the asthma launch for obviously covering the last couple of months of the year. I don't have specifics for you at this time of NBRx broken out by indication. But as we move further into the launch window and have additional experience, we will probably be able to get some additional insights on what the splits are starting to look like.","Mark Hudson","Operator, we'll take one more question.","Operator","And our last question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Citi. Please go ahead.","Robyn Karnauskas","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I really appreciate it. So moving to see big picture on the Dupixent, it sounds like people are pretty comfortable there. Can you -- and I get a lot of questions actually of food allergies because its becoming a bigger deal globally and in the United States. What are these trials going to look like? And how do you -- how does this market tend to evolve, because this could be something that could have maybe a quicker uptake versus say asthma. Can you just give us some sense about market that's going to be the next place that you go after EYLEA?","Marion McCourt","Well, I don't know about the market opportunity. For us, it always starts with the science. And I think that if you look at the science and is relating to what I was just talking about before and how all these allergic conditions seem to reflect the systemic probation of the immune system. And interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 seems to be the central drivers of the immune deviations that's leading to this incredible uptake in allergic disease in general and food allergies in particular. And based on our pre-clinical studies and actually a lot of other science as well, these two interleukins could be the central drivers in the whole process. And we believe that there is a possibility that we could be making fundamental difference in the many patients who are suffering from food allergies. And we of course are midst of important study collaborators at immune to explore this. We think that the data from our grass allergy study will also very relevant because desensitization approaches whether they are for food allergies or for aero allergens in some ways depend on the same sort of mechanisms. And we believe Dupixent is right centrally key in those and we'll see what the data shows, because we have these ongoing studies and depending on the data, and if it seems to hold true to the science, it could be important opportunity for so many patients who are suffering for these problems. ","Leonard Schleifer ","So obviously from our point of view, from the market opportunity we always like to focus on the most severe patients, which is why George mentioned go after or perhaps peanut allergy first or maybe later you go after people who are children who have highly food allergies, having difficulty driving, we certainly are all aware of anecdotes of people on Dupixent who tell us they were allergic to this and they've been taking it for their atopic dermatitis and now they're not. Obviously, that could be wishful thinking, but it's a sort of thing that we want to study. But I do agree you are correct. In the severe up polyallergic \u2013 poly-food allergic individual the uptake there could be quite strong. So that's going to become an increasing focus as we get through these initial trials that George referred to grass and peanut, but plenty more to come.","Mark Hudson","Great. Operator, this concludes today's call. Thank you everyone for joining. Again, Bob Landry, Jay Markowitz, and the IR team is here to answer any further questions. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Paulette, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Manisha Narasimhan, Head of Regeneron Investor Relations. You may begin.","Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Paulette. Good morning and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' third quarter 2017 conference call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under Events for 30 days.","Joining me on the call today are: Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President, and CEO; Dr. George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President, and Chief Scientific Officer; Bob Terifay, Executive Vice President, Commercial; and Bob Landry, Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A.","I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call today include forward-looking statements about Regeneron.

Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions.","With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Manisha, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us on the call and webcast today. In my remarks, I'd like to focus on to EYLEA and Dupixent, which are two important near-term drivers of our business, and also cover some of our late-stage pipeline progress.","EYLEA is a very important franchise to Regeneron and has continued to perform strongly in the third quarter, with 12% year-over-year growth in the U.S. and 20% year-over-year growth outside the United States. We are committed to maintaining our leadership in retinal diseases. Today, I want to talk specifically about our long-term strategy to drive EYLEA growth.","Our EYLEA sales are primarily derived from two large and distinct vision-threatening retinal diseases, age-related macular degeneration, also known as a wet AMD, and diabetic macular edema or DME. Wet AMD represents approximately 70% of our U.S. EYLEA net sales and continues to grow as the population ages. There are approximately 1 million patients with wet AMD in the United States, and about 60% of them receive anti-VEGF therapy. Our goal in wet AMD is to ensure that patients are optimally treated to achieve the best visual outcomes, and as importantly, maintain these vision gains over the long term, using regular treatment in accordance with the label indication.","Our DME business represents approximately 25% of our U.S. EYLEA net sales and has been growing steadily. We expect it to be an important driver of future growth. EYLEA is currently the branded anti-VEGF market leader in diabetic macular edema. This position was strengthened by data from Protocol T, which was an NIH-sponsored comparative effectiveness study in which diabetic macular edema \u2013 and demonstrated that EYLEA treatment resulted in significantly greater gains in visual acuity than both Lucentis and Avastin treatments as well as significantly greater control of the edema itself.","The current treatment rates in diabetic eye diseases remain low. In DME, the majority of patients are either untreated or receive laser therapy, which in our pivotal trials were shown to be substantially inferior to treatment with EYLEA. From a market penetration perspective, it's estimated that only about 10% of patients with DME in the United States are currently treated with an anti-VEGF agent. Thus, DME represents a significant growth opportunity for EYLEA. From a competitive perspective, we are not aware of any near-term late-stage competitive threats on the horizon in DME.","It is important to remember that DME represents only a part of the overall diabetic eye disease opportunity for anti-VEGF therapy, which includes both proliferative and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema. Recent data from a third-party study comparing EYLEA with pan-retinal laser photocoagulation in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy demonstrated that with EYLEA, the resulted improvement in visual outcomes \u2013 EYLEA resulted in improved visuals outcomes at the end of one year. These data from the CLARITY study were published in The Lancet in May of this year. George will review these important results in greater detail. As a reminder, EYLEA is approved in diabetic retinopathy for patients with DME.","It's estimated that there are approximately 500,000 patients in the United States with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and the vast majority are currently treated with laser therapy because of the perceived medical urgency. Data from the CLARITY study could potentially support the use of EYLEA in this setting.","In the U.S., there are approximately 1.8 million patients with vision threatening diabetic retinopathy, including DME, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Currently, fewer than 30% of these patients are treated with an anti-VEGF agent, representing a substantial potential market opportunity for EYLEA in diabetic eye diseases.","We have completed enrollment on our Phase 3 PANORAMA study of EYLEA compared to sham therapy in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy without DME, and expect top line data in the first half of 2018. George will review the strong data available that bode well for the PANORAMA study. We are actively pursuing the indication of diabetic retinopathy and plan to submit a supplemental BLA in the second half of 2018 for this indication based on the PANORAMA study should it be positive.","In addition to our PANORAMA study, the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network is conducting a government-sponsored Phase 3 study of EYLEA, known as Protocol W, in diabetic retinopathy.","Let's turn now to Dupixent. The launch in atopic dermatitis is underway and progressing very well. Right from the early stages of the launch and continuing to the present, we have had a steady stream of about 500 prescriptions filled weekly for patients who are new to the brand. Our patient and physician satisfaction rates are high, with over 90% of patients refilling their Dupixent prescription.","We have completed our Phase 3 program of dupilumab in asthma. And we and Sanofi are working toward a planned supplemental BLA submission to the FDA by the end of this year. We recognize it will be a very competitive area and are confident that the efficacy and safety profile of dupilumab will place it in a very strong position if approved in asthma. The dupilumab pivotal asthma program was the first with a biologic to enroll a broad population of uncontrolled asthma patients and demonstrate large and significant reductions in exacerbations and clinically significant improvements in lung function.","In terms of our broad strategy, we believe that dupilumab has the potential to improve the lives of patients with other allergic diseases because it targets a common central driver of Type 2 inflammation.","In addition to atopic dermatitis in asthma, we have completed enrollment in two Phase 3 studies in nasal polyps and recently reported Phase 2 data in eosinophilic esophagitis, a disease with no FDA-approved treatment. We believe this broad activity across these multiple allergic diseases is unique among the biologic therapies. George will update you further on dupilumab data and clinical progress, and Bob Terifay will update you on our commercial activities.","With regard to our PCSK9 antibody Praluent, we believe that there is substantial opportunity yet to be realized. We await data from our ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study in the first quarter of next year. And we continue to work on access, which is slowly starting to improve for this class of therapy.","We are pleased with the recent Appellate Court decision in our ongoing litigation concerning Praluent, which vacated the injunction and referred the case back for retrial in the District Court. The Appellate Court ruled that the law requires a written description of the invention, in this case the antibodies, not the antigen or epitope they bind to. Moreover, they instructed the District Court to admit important new evidence that was improperly excluded from the first trial.","Finally, our immuno-oncology program with cemiplimab, our PD-1 antibody, continues to advance. We are moving forward with the first planned regulatory submission in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, a difficult to treat skin cancer, as well as expanding the development program in first and second-line lung cancer, basal cell carcinoma, and cervical cancer, in addition to studies in combination with other antibodies and bispecifics.","Our pipeline continues to be robust, with 16 product candidates in clinical development, all of which were discovered in our own labs and serve as a testament to the fact that our innovation engine continues to be exceedingly strong and productive.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to George.","George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us on the call.","As Len mentioned, EYLEA continues to be a leader in the retinal disease space, with a number of important near-term opportunities. First, we expect to have our supplemental BLA for every 12-week dosing of EYLEA in wet AMD filed by the end of this year.","Echoing Len's thoughts, let me also update you on the potential opportunity for EYLEA in diabetic eye disease. In our original pivotal studies in DME, we demonstrated superiority of EYLEA to laser in terms of visual acuity and other outcomes. In the government-sponsored Protocol T study, EYLEA was demonstrated to be superior in terms of visual acuity to the other commonly used anti-VEGF agents at the one-year primary endpoint. In these studies, in addition to these endpoints, EYLEA demonstrated a two or more step improvement in the diabetic retinopathy severity score, or DRSS, suggesting activity in both proliferative and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.","Consistent with this, as Len mentioned, positive data from the third-party CLARITY study in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy were recently published in The Lancet. The medical urgency in this setting is reflected by the fact that the vast majority of proliferative patients are currently treated with pan-retinal photocoagulation laser therapy, or PRP, which has been the standard of care in this indication for almost four decades.","CLARITY compared EYLEA to PRP and showed that patients treated with EYLEA gained approximately four letters in visual acuity compared to patients treated with laser. This was the first time that an anti-VEGF agent has demonstrated superiority to laser treatment in patients with diabetic retinopathy without macular edema.","According to this published study, compared to PRP, EYLEA lowered the rate of new or increasing vitreous hemorrhage by about 50% and decreased the occurrence of macular edema at 52 weeks by approximately 60%. In addition, an improvement in retinopathy from proliferative to non-proliferative was observed in 64% of patients treated with EYLEA compared to 34% patients treated with a PRP.","There were no new safety concerns observed with EYLEA in this study. Inflammation was more frequent in patients who received EYLEA, with 8% of patients reporting inflammation compared to 3% of patients who received PRP. New or increasing vitreous hemorrhage was more frequent in the PRP group, with 18% of patients reporting this event compared to 9% in the EYLEA group.","PANORAMA, our Phase 3 study of EYLEA in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema exploring every 8 and 16-week dosing, is fully enrolled. We expect to report data in the first half of 2018, and if positive expect to make a regulatory submission.","A separate Phase 3 study in this indication, Protocol W, which is being conducted by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network, or the DRCR, continues to enroll patients. This study will explore every 16-week dosing of EYLEA, which is the only anti-VEGF treatment being investigated in this study.","Finally, on EYLEA, I want to remind you that we expect to have the top line data from our Phase 2 combination studies of EYLEA and nesvacumab, our antibody to Ang2, later this quarter. While we have not seen the data, we have been pretty clear about the high bar that EYLEA monotherapy sets for any potential combination studies. In our view, the results from the Ang2 combination studies are not central to the eye disease strategy that we have just outlined.","Turning now to dupilumab, our IL-4\/IL-13 blocker that is currently approved for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies and when those therapies are not advisable, we recently reported positive Phase 3 results from two studies of dupilumab in patients with uncontrolled asthma, LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST and LIBERTY ASTHMA VENTURE. These two studies, in addition to our first pivotal study, enrolled a broad population of uncontrolled asthma patients and demonstrated reductions in exacerbations or asthma attacks and improvements in lung function as measured by FEV1.","The VENTURE study, which enrolled patients who required chronic systemic corticosteroids for asthma control, showed that dupilumab could profoundly reduce systemic corticosteroid dependence, with half the patients eliminating this dependence entirely. Despite the reduction in systemic corticosteroid usage, dupilumab-treated patients still had prominent increases in lung function and fewer exacerbations compared to the control group. Based on these data, dupilumab offers the potential for an important treatment alternative to systemic corticosteroids for these most serious of asthma patients.","Beyond the profound benefit in terms of exacerbations, I would like to emphasize the importance of dupilumab's demonstrated ability to improve lung function in asthma patients. Since currently approved biologics do not consistently improve lung functions and were approved based on their ability to reduce exacerbations, this has resulted in a focus away from lung function in asthma. However, one of the most serious day-to-day issues that patients with uncontrolled asthma suffer from and which dramatically impacts their lives is their inability to breathe normally.","For example, the patients in our pivotal studies only retained an average of 50% to 60% of the predicted SAB1 at baseline, despite treatment with steroids and long-acting beta agonists. Moreover, only a fraction of this lung function could be reversed with high doses of short-acting bronchodilators. Therefore, we believe our finding that dupilumab improved lung function in all of our clinical trials in addition to reducing exacerbations is an important potential benefit to patients if approved in this setting.","Results from the QUEST and VENTURE studies along with data from our previously reported and published pivotal Phase 2b study will support the regulatory submission that we and Sanofi expect to make to the FDA by the end of this year. As a reminder, the recently reported QUEST and VENTURE studies included adolescent patients between the ages of 12 and 17 years. We are also currently conducting a Phase 3 study in pediatric patients between the ages of 6 and 11 years.","Work on the development of dupilumab in other Type 2 diseases such as nasal polyposis and eosinophilic esophagitis is ongoing. Following positive results in Phase 2, I'm pleased to report that both Phase 3 studies in patients with nasal polyposis are now fully enrolled.","Turning to eosinophilic esophagitis, or EOE, a chronic Type 2 immune-mediated disease that is strongly associated with food allergies, EOE is characterized by pain and difficulty swallowing and the possibility of food impaction, which are consequences of pathological structural changes in the esophagus. There are currently no approved therapies in the U.S. for the treatment of EOE. All corticosteroids are used off-label but with limited long-term efficacy and safety data to support their use.","At the recent World Congress of Gastroenterology, we presented additional data from our positive Phase 2 study. These data show that dupilumab significantly improved swallowing in addition to esophageal eosinophil counts, endoscopic features, histology, and esophageal distensibility in adults with active EOE compared with placebo. This safety profile seen in the study was consistent with that observed in the other studies of dupilumab. Dupilumab has been granted Orphan Drug designation in this indication, and Phase 3 studies are being planned.","I'd like to now turn to atopic dermatitis, an indication where Dupixent is approved both in the United States and in Europe. In September, we presented positive data from CAFE, a Phase 3 study of Dupixent in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who are inadequately controlled with or intolerant of cyclosporine, which is approved in certain countries outside the United States. This study demonstrated that in these difficult to treat patients, Dupixent in combination with topical steroids significantly improved measures of overall disease severity and patient-reported quality of life measures, with a mean improvement of 80% in the Eczema Area Severity score, or the EASI score. No new adverse events were reported in this study. We also continue to work on expanding development in moderate to severe pediatric atopic dermatitis patients.","Turning to immuno-oncology, which is another area of growing excitement for us, I'd like to begin with cemiplimab, our foundational PD-1 antibody. Our lead indication is advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC, for which we have been granted Breakthrough designation by the FDA. We expect to report interim data later this year and to make a regulatory submission to the FDA in the first quarter of 2018.","Our PD-1 program has continued to expand. We recently initiated a Phase 3 program of cemiplimab monotherapy in first-line non-small-cell lung cancer. This 300-patient study, which is being conducted outside the United States, will enroll patients who express greater than 50% PD-L1 and will compare cemiplimab to standard-of-care platinum doublet. The primary endpoint of this study is progression-free survival.","We are planning additional studies, including combinational studies, in non-small-cell lung cancer as well as clinical trials in second-line non-small-cell lung cancer. I remind you that with all the recent failures in this space, there is only one approved PD-1 or PD-L1 agent in the first-line non-small lung cancer setting.","We also recently initiated a Phase 3 study in second-line cervical cancer. With our ongoing potentially pivotal study in basal cell carcinoma, this brings us to four potentially pivotal programs with our PD-1 antibody.","We also have exploratory studies ongoing in melanoma and head and neck cancer, and we're also conducting and planning studies with cemiplimab in combination with our antibody to LAG-3 in a variety of indications, as well as a number of other combination approaches with cemiplimab, including with our bispecifics.","Turning now to these bispecifics, we will be presenting further positive data from our CD20\/CD3 program both as monotherapy and in combination with cemiplimab in B-cell malignancies at the December meeting of the American Society of Hematology, or ASH. As a reminder, the CD20\/CD3 program has been granted Orphan Drug designation for diffuse large cell B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL.","We are also conducting a combination study of our CD20\/CD3 bispecific with cemiplimab in CD20-positive malignancies. We plan to put additional bispecifics into clinical trials over the next several years.","Fasinumab, our NFG antibody, continues to advance in the clinic. We are currently enrolling patients in a Phase 3 study in osteoarthritis pain, where we are investigating fasinumab compared to naproxen. We also plan to initiate a second study of fasinumab in osteoarthritis pain.","I'll turn now to our mid and earlier-stage pipeline. Nesvacumab is our antibody to ANGPTL-3 for the treatment of severe forms of hyperlipidemia. We are planning Phase 3 studies in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or homozygous FH, and Phase 2 studies in severe hypertriglyceridemia and in heterozygous hypercholesterolemia, or HeFH. We plan to initiate by year end the Phase 2 study of Regeneron 2477, our Activin A antibody, in the ultra-rare disease of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP. We are also exploring the use of our Activin A antibody in combination with trevogrumab, our GDF8 antibody, in muscle and metabolic disorders.","Another exciting early-stage program is Regeneron 3500, our antibody to the interleukin 33 ligand, which is in the clinic and we plan to investigate for asthma, COPD, and other indications as both a monotherapy and in combination with dupilumab.","With that overview, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Terifay.","Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone.","EYLEA, or aflibercept, continues to be the market-leading product among FDA-approved anti-VEGF agents for all of its approved indications in the United States. U.S. EYLEA sales grew 12% year over year in the third quarter of 2017 in a market that grew by about 11%. Ex-U.S. sales grew by 20% year over year in a market that grew 13%. As was summarized by Len and George, we look forward to the potential of expanding the use of EYLEA in diabetic eye diseases, which we feel is a substantial potential opportunity.","Turning now to the recent launch of Dupixent or dupilumab in the United States for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, global sales for Dupixent in the third quarter were $89 million. This number almost entirely represents sales in the United States, since Dupixent only recently received regulatory approval in Europe at the end of September. We're pleased with the way the U.S. launch is tracking across a number of important metrics, and the commercial organizations are focused on delivering a successful launch.","Let me begin with the physician perspective. As of last week, over 7,000 healthcare providers had written prescriptions for Dupixent for adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. The prescription trajectory, as measured by total prescriptions, has remained strong and is trending ahead of comparable biologic launches in dermatology.","In terms of new patient starts, as assessed by new-to-brand prescriptions, we've seen on average approximately 750 new patients prescribed Dupixent each week and approximately 500 new patients starting therapy each week since the early part of the launch. Importantly, of the patients who have started on Dupixent, over 90% renewed their prescription, suggesting a high degree of patient and physician satisfaction.","On the market access side, we're happy to report that about 80% of commercial lives are now covered by health plans that have a published Dupixent policy. Of these patients, almost half have prior authorization to label, or in other words, they can receive Dupixent by stepping through only topical therapy without requiring prior systemic therapy or a severity requirement. In addition to coverage with Express Scripts and CVS, Dupixent is also on formulary at Optum, Aetna, Anthem, and United.","In the coming weeks, we'll be launching unbranded direct-to-consumer television advertising to increase awareness of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.","Outside of the United States, Dupixent has received regulatory approval in Europe, and we're preparing for launch in Germany. It's estimated that the addressable European patient population of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis patients is between 150,000 and 200,000 patients. A regulatory submission for Dupixent has been made in Japan, with a decision expected in the first quarter of 2018.","In addition to the ongoing launch in atopic dermatitis, we're also preparing to launch dupilumab in asthma. As mentioned earlier, we are on track to file a supplemental BLA submission to the FDA by the end of this year. Additionally, we and Sanofi plan to file a European regulatory submission in adult and adolescent patients in the first quarter of 2018.","Turning now to Kevzara, or sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, net global sales for the third quarter were $3 million. It's still very early given that Kevzara was approved and launched in the United States towards the end of May and reimbursement decisions for RA biologics take some time. Initial feedback from physicians has been positive, and we're working on building market access.","We're happy to report that just recently CVS Health announced that effective January 1, 2018, Kevzara will be designated as the preferred IL-6 receptor antibody on their national formulary. We've received EMA approval for Kevzara, with launches in Germany and the Netherlands underway.","Now let's discuss Praluent, or alirocumab. Net sales in the third quarter were $49 million worldwide, with the U.S. accounting for $32 million of the total. While we continue to be disappointed with the uptake of the PCSK9 inhibitor class, we're encouraged by ongoing discussions with payers with respect to improvement in utilization management criteria and documentation requirements. Recently, CVS Health announced that effective January 1, 2018, it would provide co-preferred access to Praluent through its CVS Caremark commercial formularies, which cover approximately 25 million lives.","We remain optimistic about the long-term potential for this class. The anticipated cardiovascular outcomes data for Praluent in early 2018 could have an impact on demand. We remain committed to our efforts to improve Praluent access and bring this important product to more patients who can benefit.","As George mentioned, cemiplimab, our PD-1 inhibitor program in immuno-oncology, is advancing, with a regulatory submission in CSCC anticipated in the first quarter of 2018. We will co-promote cemiplimab in the United States with Sanofi Genzyme. As a reminder, we will distribute and book U.S. sales.","With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry.","Robert E. Landry - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone.","Regeneron posted strong third quarter 2017 financial results. These positive results were driven by continued growth in our global EYLEA franchise, a strong U.S. Dupixent launch, and a significant contribution of revenue from both our Sanofi and Bayer collaborations. During today's call I'll discuss each of these matters in addition to highlighting changes to our full year 2017 guidance line items.","In the third quarter of 2017, we earned $3.99 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $470 million. This represents a year-over-year increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income of 27% and 29% respectively. Regeneron's third quarter 2017 non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense, including the income tax effect. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release, which can be found on our website.","Total revenues in the third quarter of 2017 were $1.5 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 23% compared to the third quarter of 2016. Net product sales were $957 million in the third quarter of 2017 compared to $857 million in the third quarter of 2016, which represents year-over-year growth of approximately 12%.","EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $953 million in the third quarter of 2017 compared to $854 million in the third quarter of 2016, which represents an increase of 12%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $2.73 billion versus $2.47 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of 11%. We are reaffirming our estimated full year 2017 U.S. EYLEA net product sales growth guidance of approximately 10% over 2016. As a reminder, this is the last quarter where we will be providing U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance.","Similar to the previous two quarters of 2017, EYLEA experienced another decrease in U.S. distributor inventory levels, albeit slight, during the third quarter, with distributor levels continuing to remain within our normal one to two-week targeted range.","Ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales, which are recorded by our collaborator Bayer, were $564 million in the third quarter of 2017 as compared to $471 in the third quarter of 2016, representing a 20% increase on a reported basis. On an operational or constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 19%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $1.59 billion versus $1.38 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of 16% on a reported basis and 18% on an operational basis.","In the third quarter of 2017, Regeneron recognized $205 million from our shared net profits from EYLEA sales outside the United States. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the third quarter of 2017 was $237 million.","Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $245 million for the third quarter of 2017. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line item primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron incurred commercialization related expenses, and the recognition of deferred revenue from the antibody and immuno-oncology upfront payments, partly offset by our share of losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies.","In the third quarter of 2017, our share of losses in connection with the commercialization of Dupixent, Praluent, and Kevzara was $98 million compared to a loss of $122 million in the second quarter 2017 and a loss of $112 million in the third quarter of 2016. The decrease in our share of losses was primarily based upon the profit contribution from increased third quarter Dupixent sales and lower alliance commercial expenses for Praluent, offset by a modest increase in our alliance commercial expenses for Dupixent and Kevzara.","Global sales of Dupixent, Praluent, and Kevzara as recorded by our collaborator Sanofi for the third quarter of 2017 were Dupixent $89 million, Praluent $49 million, and Kevzara $3 million. For both Dupixent and Kevzara, the sales were almost exclusively U.S.-based. As stated by our collaborator Sanofi on their earnings call last week, Dupixent third quarter 2017 net sales included modest wholesaler inventory stocking, not unexpected, and the $89 million sales figure is a true representation of the underlying demand.","While we are encouraged with the reduction in our share of alliance losses on the antibody collaboration in the third quarter of 2017, I want to continue to highlight that the alliance's profitability will continue to be negatively impacted by increased global launch expenses to support Kevzara and Dupixent. As a result, we are expecting a higher alliance loss in connection with commercialization of antibodies in the fourth quarter of 2017 than what was realized in the third quarter of 2017.","The third quarter 2017 Sanofi collaboration revenue also benefited from an acceleration of the recognition of deferred revenue in connection with the termination of the antibody discovery agreement on December 31, 2017. The $130 million of 2017 annual funding from Sanofi under the antibody discovery agreement was fully utilized during the first nine months of 2017. Due to this utilization, we expect Sanofi's reimbursement of Regeneron research and development expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 to be lower than any of the three previous quarters.","In the third quarter of 2017, other revenue was $62 million versus $27 million during the third quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily due to the reimbursements from our collaborator Teva for the development of fasinumab. For further details, you can find a summary of the components of other revenue in the MD&A section of our 10-Q.","Turning now to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $460 million for the third quarter of 2017. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total non-GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursement from our collaborators, was $227 million in the third quarter of 2017. Our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. We are lowering and tightening our full year 2017 guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $885 million to $915 million from our previous guidance of $925 million to $965 million.","Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $259 million for the third quarter of 2017 and represents a slight decrease from the previous quarter. Given our nine-month actual results and forecasted fourth quarter spend, we are tightening and lowering our full year 2017 guidance of non-GAAP SG&A to $1.07 billion to $1.1 billion from our previous guidance range of $1.12 billion to $1.16 billion.","Based on this revised guidance, you will see that we are forecasting a higher SG&A spend level for the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting from the delayed timing of third quarter spend. In addition, as I previously mentioned, we are expecting higher fourth quarter incremental global spend on our two recently FDA and EMA-approved launches, Dupixent and Kevzara, as well as prelaunch expenses for the anticipated 2018 U.S. approvals for cemiplimab in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and the dupilumab asthma indication.","Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue, was $90 million for the third quarter of 2017. We are tightening and lowering our full year 2017 guidance of Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses to $350 million to $375 million from our previous guidance range of $370 million to $400 million.","Non-GAAP cost of goods sold and cost of collaboration in contract manufacturing increased for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, principally due to an increase in startup costs and validation activities for our Limerick commercial manufacturing facility.","Turning now to taxes, our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2017 was 31% as compared to 28% for the third quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, we are tightening and lowering guidance for our effective tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 29% from the previous range of 27% to 31%. The updated guidance reflects higher actual and forecasted tax deductions from stock options.","As stated on previous earning calls, there will be volatility in our effective tax rate on a quarter-to-quarter basis since the tax benefit of stock-based compensation is included based on actual exercises in the quarter. We expect to experience this volatility in the fourth quarter of 2017, as the majority of our options are issued in December, and typically a large number of options vest and are exercised in the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect our fourth quarter 2017 effective tax rate to be significantly below both the third quarter and full year 2017 tax rates.","From a cash flow and balance sheet perspective, we ended the third quarter of 2017 with cash and marketable securities of $2.7 billion. Our capital expenditures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 were $60 million and $165 million respectively. We are tightening our full year 2017 capital expenditures guidance to be in the range of $265 million to $285 million from our previously provided range of $250 million to $285 million.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Manisha.","Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Bob. Paulette, we'd now like to open the call for Q&A. In the interest of time, we request that you limit yourself to one question. We will be available in the office after the call for follow-up questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Christopher Raymond - Piper Jaffray Companies","Hey, thanks for taking the question, just a question on the Dupixent prescriber base, if you don't mind. I just noticed in previous communications you guys had talked about an initial target base I think of 7,000 derms with previous biologic experience. I think I heard today Bob talk about having 7,000 doctors write a script for the drug. So maybe can you just talk about that mix? Is that current 7,000 base, is that the initial target, or were there others that you maybe didn't expect? And maybe talk about the road in front of you here in terms of getting other docs to prescribe the drug. Thanks.","Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So, Chris, you're correct. Our original target audience were physicians who have written a biologic for psoriasis in the past, and that was slightly over 7,000 patients. What we have found when we've gone out to the dermatologist offices is there are other dermatologists in those offices who take an interest in atopic dermatitis patients and have started to use the product.","For the future, what we anticipate is that we will see other prescribers as patients become aware through our direct-to-consumer campaign on the severity of the condition and the need to seek out a dermatologist, and that there could be an increased urgency to treat over time.","Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you very much and thanks for all the color on the call. A number of things, but perhaps we could talk. You suggested your product lifecycle management strategy for EYLEA alluded to on the call. But is there anything you could talk about first with respect to the pre-filled syringe offering for EYLEA? And then secondly, do you have anything in mind that you could do with Dupixent, given how important it's going to be to the company to reduce the dosing frequency with the product in some new formulation or preparation? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Right. Thanks, Geoff. So I probably don't want to get into Dupixent given the competitive aspect of that space, but we continue to look at all sorts of different ways to create value. We can assure you of that.","In terms of EYLEA and the pre-filled syringe, we had two issues. Genentech was ahead of us with the pre-filled syringe, and now they're fully launched. But I think as you saw in Bob's report, our market share was steady, and so that has not really created a problem for us. Nevertheless, we're still moving forward with ours, and I think we expect to have a filing perhaps sometime in the first half of next year or so. It's a complicated business, the pre-filled syringe, because of the sterilization requirements when you're dealing with eye diseases that took Genentech, I don't know, quite a long time to get there, and we hope to be not too far behind them.","Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question and congrats on the quarter. I have another question on Dupixent. Right now, Sanofi commented that most of the patients on Dupixent are the severe patients with atopic dermatitis. When do you think this drug can penetrate into the moderate patient segment?","And then also, are you planning to increase investment in Praluent, now that the court gave you a favorable ruling, or do you have to wait until you have the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES?","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Bob?","Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So with regards to Dupixent, Sanofi was correct. What we're seeing is that physicians are initiating Dupixent therapy in the patients with severe atopic dermatitis. Now what is encouraging is that the patients are responding. So even in those very, very severe patients, we're getting a good response. We do anticipate that physicians will become more and more comfortable with using a biologic for a condition they have not used one for before, which is atopic dermatitis, and that we should see expansion into moderate AD over the next several months. That should also be helped by our direct-to-consumer campaign.","With regards to investment in Praluent, I think we've been very prudent this year. We have managed our investment, focused in on where we can best get business, which is primarily on education, and will continue to be modest on our spend until we get the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES data and we move forward with the court case.","Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Citi. Please go ahead.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thank you. So I just wanted to ask a little bit about the top line (46:20). I thought you guys did a great job articulating the EYLEA business and how it can grow. For just the next leg of growth, maybe talk a little bit about how you envision your checkpoint drug being a next leg of growth and what has to happen for that to succeed. Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Robyn, I didn't. I'm not sure I heard the question. Were you asking about the immuno-oncology program? Is that what your question was about?","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Policy program (46:47), how do you see that being a next leg of growth? And what has to happen and how do you see that playing out over the next few years? How do you see that shaping up?","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Okay, George may have some comments on it. But I think the most important thing that he pointed out to me in some of his remarks is that despite all the effort, despite everybody viewing this as an incredibly crowded space, there's only one anti-PD-1 or PDL-1 that's been approved in front-line\/first-line lung cancer. And that is the biggest opportunity of all, which we are now busy enrolling a study in that indication in the greater than 50%. Beyond that, of course, combinations and George mentioned LAG-3 and bispecifics, and I think we have some pretty encouraging bispecific data coming up at the next meeting.","George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","It's just worth noting, obviously, it's going to be a long-term growth opportunity over we think a long period of time. By adding additional opportunities to it and combining things, we think we have one of the strongest portfolio of combination opportunities that we've already started studying in the clinic, and more will follow.","But even the very first indication should not be underestimated. If you look at the cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, there's enormous need there. And the actual \u2013 it is actually \u2013 the number of cases is huge, and it's been largely ignored because the vast, vast majority of them can be treated surgically.","But because there's something on the order of 1 million or 2 million cases, and even though something like over greater than 95% are treated surgically, that still leaves an opportunity of unresectable or metastatic disease, which is on the order of magnitude of melanoma. And like I said, I think it was largely ignored by the community because of the perspective that though it was one of the, if not the most common cancers afflicting patients, the vast, vast majority are treated successfully with these Mohs type surgeries and so forth.","So the important thing to recognize is, even that first opportunity, there's a lot of need there. There's a lot of patients who are failures or cannot be treated with surgery. And that opportunity is on the order of magnitude of melanoma, which as we know was a huge growth driver for the two original PD-1 agents.","Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thanks for taking the question. I guess I was hoping you could talk a little bit about PANORAMA and just talk to us about \u2013 you obviously outlined the size the markets for wet AMD and DME. How do you view diabetic retinopathy relative to the size of those other markets, and how do you see that being a growth driver for EYLEA, if you were to have a successful study? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","I'm going to let George talk about PANORAMA and why we have a reasonably high degree of confidence in that study in just a second.","I just want to say, in terms of the market opportunity, the lowest hanging fruit obviously is the proliferative diabetic retinopathy because people recognize that as really vision threatening, and most people get some sort of the laser that's been going on for decades, as we mentioned. So it's hard to know exactly how many people are there, but that represents a pretty big opportunity. And with this CLARITY study that was published in The Lancet, where you not only saw better visual acuity outcome in the year, you saw less hemorrhages. You saw less macular edema, less of the complications that you're so worried about, which is why you want to treat proliferative diabetic retinopathy.","But beyond that, even the treatment of severe diabetic retinopathy, which is non-proliferative, is really in its infancy. There isn't quite the same perceived urgency there. But I think if we can show that we can reverse that, I think that's going to maybe change people's view on whether or not people should get treated or should they wait, which is the current thing, wait for them to get the complications. Perhaps it is better to treat it early, and now George can comment a little bit about on the study itself and why...","George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","I think Len made all the important points, and let me just echo. The most important point is that where the need right now in diabetic retinopathy is perceived as the most urgent is in proliferative eye disease, there are roughly 0.5 million such patients in the United States. And 80% or 400,000 of them receive ablative laser therapy, the most serious of laser therapies. And now with the CLARITY data, one has a head-to-head comparison showing by every measure, from visual acuity to, just as importantly, halving the risk of developing vitreal hemorrhages, reducing by almost two-thirds the risk of developing macular edema, this is something that I think patients deserve to have access to and deserve to get in this setting, because without ablating their retinas, they can have better vision and better outcomes and avoid catastrophic events like vitreal hemorrhages.","I think that the 2 million or so people who have diabetic retinopathy that's considered a little less urgent, I think that this could be an important advance for those patients as well, and already, all the existing data suggest that. But I think that there will be probably slower uptake. It will be a longer haul to change the practice of medicine there, where many of those patients are treated with a wait-and-see attitude because they haven't had a drug like EYLEA thus far. But I really do think in proliferative eye disease, 500,000 patients, those patients deserve to get a therapy that's been shown in a head-to-head study to be so substantially beneficial, not only in terms of visual acuity, but in terms of preventing catastrophic outcomes, which is why they're treated so urgently with ablative therapy.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And just the last point on that, Robyn, is that the competitive environment is less acute there obviously because the near-term competition hasn't begun any diabetic macular edema studies. And by the way, in our DME studies, we looked at the same endpoint for the patients with diabetic retinopathy in our PANORAMA study because our DME studies were in patients with diabetic retinopathy, but we were treating their DME. Their diabetic retinopathy improved just the way we hope and expect that it will improve in PANORAMA, which is what the FDA just asked us to do, is to do a study in patients without the DME component. And that's why we have some, I would say, reasonably high confidence in that study.","Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Paulette, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my question. I was curious. For asthma, how important do you think baseline eosinophil counts will be when thinking about which patients to prescribe Dupixent in the real world? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Let's just review what the facts are. If you look at our data, and you can't make these cross-study comparisons and take them overly seriously. But if you look at our data, we enrolled a very broad population, but the drug works better the higher your eosinophil count is. And if you look in our highest eosinophilic count, you saw, I would argue, some of the best data that's been presented with any of the biologics, including a robust very significant effect on exacerbations as well as the effect on lung function.","But we also were able to enroll a very broad population in all three of our studies, so we would hope and argue that it doesn't really matter. If you're worried about treating the eosinophilic type, which has more exacerbations and may represent the more urgent need, we think our drug will offer a terrific opportunity, especially with the differentiating factors that we talked about around pulmonary function. And if you happen to have another allergic disease, and these things do run in packs and happened to also have severe atopic dermatitis or moderate to severe, you'd get two treatments for the cost of one.","But of course, we also think about that across the broad spectrum. Ours is the first biologic to be studied across that consistently in all of our trials. So no matter how you look at our data, we like it. We and Sanofi are very pleased with the data.","George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Maybe just to put it into a little bit of context, as Len said, we did three pivotal studies. And in the overall population, as Len said, it's hard to compare across studies, but I don't think anybody would argue that in the overall population, even in the worst of the three studies in terms of the numbers, they look quite comparable to the high eosinophilic groups for either approved biologics or for near-term biologics that are coming down there. And obviously, we also have even better data in the high eosinophilic patients.","And as Len said, I think the most important differentiator also has to be, not only do we have comparable results to what others have in the high O's in the overall population, but we have these lung function results. And I think that this has been just, as we tried to communicate during our prepared remarks, this has been somewhere where the field has been going away from, only because biologics to date have not been doing such a good job. If you remember the way Xolair got approved, up until that point, lung function was the standard for approval. But because Xolair had no effect on lung function, they switched the focus to these exacerbations, which obviously are very important and so forth.","But if you know anybody with asthma, you know that the thing that they suffer from and they worry about on a day-to-day basis is the shortness of breath that they can suffer from with a little bit of exercise or some other trigger that they might be suffering from. And I think it's really important to recognize that the results on lung function are really impressive, not only on the overall population, but even more impressive in the high eosinophilic population.","So once again, I think if anybody honestly looks at the data and looks at the effects, not only in the overall population, not only on exacerbation, but also on lung function, you would think that this is the treatment that patients deserve to be given to benefit their condition, and not only in the high eosinophilic patients but the overall population.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","I also think that you can't ignore mechanism here. There's been a lot of claims that people are getting to the fundamental mechanisms of allergic disease, and it's hard to say that you're at the fundamental mechanism of allergic disease if in one allergic disease it works and in another allergic disease it doesn't work. And it's hard to say you're getting into the fundamental basis of the allergic disease if you're only affecting part of the disease like exacerbations and not affecting lung function.","It's hard to say you're getting at the fundamental part of the disease if in eosinophilic esophagitis you can lower your eosinophils but you can't improve the symptoms of the actual inflammation that's going on in the esophagus. So I think that a lot of this goes back to the choices that were made a long time ago in what is the right fundamental way to interfere with this Type 2 allergic inflammation.","George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And I just want to add to that. Len brings up a really good point, which is that part of our clinical development plan is actually to do studies where we show that in the same patients, we will be able to benefit multiple allergic conditions. And that is I think something that, if you know people who are suffering from any one of these severe allergic conditions, whether it's atopic dermatitis, for example, or severe asthma, they generally are suffering from other allergic conditions as well. And wouldn't it be wonderful if there was a drug that was a central driver of all of allergic disease that could benefit essentially all of the allergic manifestations in a single patient.","So that is part of our clinical development plan going forward, that we are going to be doing studies to actually be able to show that, hopefully. And we don't think there's any other current biologics out there that even have the opportunity to consider the possibility of doing those studies.","Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Paulette, we have time for one last question.","Operator","Okay, and our last question comes from Josh Schimmer from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Joshua Schimmer - Evercore ISI","Thanks for taking the question, just one on the IL-33 antibody. Can you elaborate on its positioning, what it brings to the table in addition to or instead of Dupixent? And is this a general area that you expect to further build the pipeline? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","I think that's a great question. Thanks for bringing it up. Obviously, we didn't have enough time to really go into everything. But this is a really exciting target for us for many reasons, one of which is a lot of the biology that our group did to understand it. But just as much is that this is a recent success for our Regeneron Genetics Center, these large-scale sequencing efforts that we've undertaken to try to see how genetic variation is associated with disease. And IL-33 is one of the exciting premier targets that has been in our minds identified and validated by the genetics, not only in this disease but in some other allergic diseases.","So we've actually seen genetic evidence that if you have gain of function mutations in IL-33, it increases the chances of having some of these disease loss of function mutations are protective, and that gets us a lot of confidence. We've always been driven by genetics, but in this case, it's using the latest large-scale genetics approaches to actually identify and validate targets that gives us this confidence to move this forward so rapidly. And the thing that's very exciting to us is this is an area where we already feel we have made this advance and have this foundational treatment in dupilumab. And wouldn't it be great now if we could improve the benefit in some patients by combining it with the IL-33. And once again, we're considering doing this in multiple allergic conditions because the genetic support that this can be the case, not only in asthma, but in COPD and maybe atopic dermatitis and other settings as well.","George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Right. Josh, let's just close on one point that I think maybe we didn't even emphasize enough is that the other thing that's really important about dupilumab is we really do have an extensive clinical development profile from the safety point of view, and that's building every day in the commercial point of view. And going forward in this field, Dupixent has now set an extremely high bar I believe, not just on the efficacy side but on the safety side. In the rheumatoid arthritis field, people, because biologics came with a cost, are willing to accept that cost because they had great efficacy. We've got really what I think is terrific efficacy but also almost unprecedented safety that we've seen thus far in our clinical trials. We really haven't seen the kinds of immune dysfunction problems that you see when you block other angles of the immune system.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And just to add to that, again, I think this is the future. It's the future of medicine and it's the future of drug development. The genetics that we have that support our targets, for example, IL-33, not only are supporting that blocking IL-33 function or loss of function mutants in IL-33 can be protective, but they're also comforting us in terms of the safety profile going in. So genetics are really offering an opportunity to get insights before you ever do studies in humans into the future potential benefit, but also the safety profile, which is another reason why we're very excited about the IL-33.","Joshua Schimmer - Evercore ISI","Okay.","Manisha Narasimhan, Ph.D. - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Paulette, that concludes our call today.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn call over to Manisha Narasimhan, Head of Regeneron's Investor Relations. You may begin.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Sylvia. Good morning and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals second quarter 2018 conference call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under Events for 30 days. Joining me on the call today are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President and Chief Scientific Officer; Marion McCourt, Senior Vice President and Head of Commercial; and Bob Landry, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A.","I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call today include forward-looking statements about Regeneron.

With that, let me turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Manisha, and good morning to everyone who has joined us on today's call and webcast. Regeneron delivered a strong second quarter, as measured both by R&D progress, as well as our financial results, reflecting our commitment to discovering important new drugs and translating those discoveries into successful commercial products. Our pipeline now has 19 drugs or drug candidates in development, with particularly good progress in allergic diseases and cancer. George will update you on our R&D efforts and highlight some notable progress across our pipeline.","Our commercial efforts are focused on market leading EYLEA, the ongoing launches of Dupixent, Kevzara, and Praluent, and our ongoing launch preparations for cemiplimab, our PD-1 inhibitor in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Marion will update you on our progress. Operationally, we had a record performance on both the top and bottom line. Bob will review these results. So now I'd like to turn the call over to George.","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Len, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by updating you on the status of EYLEA. Our regulatory submission for EYLEA dose every 12 weeks in neurovascular age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD, is currently under FDA review with PDUFA date of August 11.","Yesterday, Bayer, which commercializes EYLEA outside the United States, announced that the European Commission has approved a new treatment approach enabling early extension of the injection interval for patients with wet AMD. The new approach is based on the results from the ALTAIR study, in which after 52 weeks 57% of patients had their next regularly scheduled EYLEA injection at an interval of 12 weeks or more, with many patients achieving interval of 16 weeks, the maximum interval allowed in the study.","Study participants gained an average of 9 letters, including 50% of patients who gained 10 or more letters of vision at week 52. These results were largely maintained during the second year of the study. These data have not been submitted for review to the FDA. We would also like to report some recent success with higher dose formulations of aflibercept in preclinical studies, which we hope to advance into the clinic in 2019.","Turning now to our immunology and inflammation programs. Dupixent, our interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 blocker, is approved for atopic dermatitis and is under investigation for other allergic diseases, also known as atopic or Type 2 inflammatory diseases, including asthma, nasal polyps, eosinophilic esophagitis, as well as food and inhaled allergies.","Dupixent is approved for the treatment of adults with atopic dermatitis and later this year we expect a supplemental biologics license application for SBLA for adolescents with atopic dermatitis, based on the positive top line data we announced in May. These data will be presented in more detail at a medical conference next month. Dupixent is also under regulatory review for asthma in adults and adolescents.","In addition, we are conducting pediatric studies in both atopic dermatitis and asthma. Later this year, we are expecting pivotal results from our Phase 3 studies in nasal polyps and we will be initiating our Phase 3 program in eosinophilic esophagitis, as well as earlier clinical programs in both peanut allergy and grass allergy. The emerging Dupixent clinical data continues to support our hypothesis that interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 are the central drivers of allergic disease.","Our interleukin-33 program complements Dupixent and has potential both as monotherapy and in combination with Dupixent. Interleukin-33 may be an important target in certain inflammatory diseases and is supported by evidence from work done at our Regeneron Genetics Center. We are currently investigating this molecule in asthma and atopic dermatitis.","Now I'll turn to immuno-oncology, which continues to be an area of enormous focus for us. Our BLA for cemiplimab in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is currently under regulatory review and the PDUFA date is in October. If approved, this will be the third PD-1 antibody to gain regulatory approval and the first in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, where we have observed response rates that have been among the highest reported with a PD-1 antibody for a solid tumor. Regulatory application for cemiplimab in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma are also under review outside the United States.","Non-small cell lung cancer is an important development opportunity for cemiplimab. Despite many efforts in the field, there is currently only one PD-1 antibody approved in first-line non-small cell lung cancer, and less than half the patients respond. We are pursuing a broad development strategy in lung cancer that encompasses patients with both low and high levels of PD-L1. Beyond first-line non-small cell lung cancer, we also have ongoing studies in other solid tumors, including second-line non-small cell lung cancer, second-line cervical cancer, and basal cell carcinoma.","Based on our review of recent data from competitor PD-1s in non-small cell lung cancer, we plan on increasing the size of our ongoing monotherapy Phase 3 study and expect it to readout in 2020. We're also reviewing any implications that these developments may have on our larger lung cancer program.","We recognize how quickly the field of immuno-oncology is evolving and are committed to being at the leading edge. Despite all the advances in the treatment of cancer, many patients still remain without effective treatment options. In addition to use as monotherapy, we expect cemiplimab to be the foundation upon which we build combination therapies to address a variety of tumor types. To that end, we have two additional checkpoint inhibitors, LAG3 and CTLA-4, in clinical development. We're also exploring our checkpoint inhibitors in collaborative combinations with vaccines and self-therapy approaches.","Our proprietary bi-specific antibody platform is another key component of our immuno-oncology strategy. We are investigating our bi-specific antibodies as single agents in combinations with each other and in combination with our checkpoint inhibitors. Having a broad set of tools within immuno-oncology enables us to choose the best ones for each particular disease. Our lead bi-specific program is a wholly owned CD20xCD3 molecule, which has validated the concept and given us confidence in the platform as a whole. We remain very encouraged by the strong response rates that we have observed to-date in both indolent and aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and expect to advance this program into registrational studies in 2019. Additional studies and data from this program will be presented at a medical conference later this year.","We are also advancing additional bi-specific candidates into clinical development. Our MUC16xCD3 bi-specific for ovarian cancer has entered clinical development and our BCMAxCD3 bi-specific for multiple myeloma will enter the clinic later this year. These bi-specifics will be studied both as monotherapy and in combination with cemiplimab. Early next year, we expect to advance into clinical development an entirely new class of bi-specific antibodies, which we will study in combination with the CD3 class of bi-specifics, as well as with cemiplimab.","Turning now to fasinumab, our Nerve Growth Factor antibody for pain. We are continuing patient enrollment in the Phase 3 osteoarthritis program. Following an evaluation by an independent Data Monitoring Committee, we are moving forward with only the lower dose-regimens in this program. We anticipate sharing top line efficacy results from our first Phase 3 osteoarthritis study later this quarter.","Now I'd like to provide a brief update on three of our wholly-owned earlier stage programs. Let me begin with our C5 antibody. Our goal is to provide patients with a convenient, self-administered, subcutaneous dosing option that doesn't require a high volume delivery device, and we have made significant progress toward this goal. In our Phase 1 study based on both pharmacodynamics and ex vivo pharmacodynamic assays of subcutaneous dosing regimen achieved the blood levels that we believe will be sufficient to prevent hemolysis in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH. We expect to report the full data in an upcoming medical conference and plan to initiate Phase 2 studies for PNH in early 2019.","Another exciting early-stage molecule is our antibody to Activin-A, which we are investigating in the rare and devastating disease called fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. We are pleased that enrollment in our potentially pivotal study is proceeding according to plan. We're also studying our Activin-A antibody in combination with our myostatin antibody in the setting of muscle atrophy and wasting, where in early studies we demonstrated an approximately 8% increase in muscle mass. We plan to initiate by year-end the first of multiple Phase 2 studies to ascertain whether this increase in muscle mass translates into functional and\/or metabolic benefits.","We currently have 19 product candidates that are in various stages of clinical development. Each of these was discovered by us in our laboratories in Tarrytown, New York. I'm pleased to say that we remain on track for the goals that we laid out at the beginning of the year to advance four to six new product candidates into the clinic in 2018. Just in the first half of the year alone, we have advanced three new molecules into clinical development.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marion.","Marion McCourt - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, George, and good morning everyone. I'd like to start with EYLEA, where global net sales in the second quarter were $1.66 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year. In the U.S., EYLEA continues to be the market-leading branded anti-VEGF for retinal diseases. In the second quarter, U.S. EYLEA net sales were $992 million, which represents 8% growth year-over-year. Based on net sales, EYLEA currently has approximately 70% of the overall branded U.S. anti-VEGF market. We're committed to maintaining our market leadership position with EYLEA and we've identified meaningful growth opportunities.","While EYLEA is well penetrated in wet AMD, there remains a large opportunity in diabetic eye disease. Less than 20% of patients diagnosed with clinically significant diabetic macular edema currently receive anti-VEGF therapy, and many others with diabetic macular edema are not even diagnosed. Approximately 25% of current EYLEA U.S. business is attributed to use in patients with diabetic macular edema.","Additionally, we expect the market to grow in wet AMD, because of the aging population, and in diabetic retinal diseases, due to the substantial increase in diabetes prevalence. We'd like to ensure that ever eligible patient with diabetic retinal disease or wet AMD is treated with optimal therapy, which, in the vast majority of cases, is anti-VEGF therapy. To that end, in the coming weeks, we will be launching an initial branded television campaign for EYLEA in DME in multiple U.S. test markets.","Another important potential growth driver for EYLEA is through gaining approval in additional retinal diseases and expanding the label. We have submitted an sBLA for EYLEA in diabetic retinopathy population. It's estimated that there are approximately 3.5 million people in the U.S. who are diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy without DME. Of these, approximately 1 million patients have the greatest disease burden and are at risk for vision-threatening complications.","Earlier this year we reported positive top line data from the Phase 3 PANORAMA study of EYLEA in diabetic retinopathy and we expect to report top line 52-week data later this year. Our regulatory submission for EYLEA dosed every 12 weeks is currently under FDA review. As George mentioned, earlier this week European regulators approved EYLEA for an extended dosing regimen in wet AMD. We have also recently submitted an sBLA for EYLEA in a pre-filled syringe with potential launch in 2019.","Turning now to Dupixent, global net sales in the second quarter of 2018, as reported by our collaborator Sanofi, were $209 million. In the U.S., net sales in the second quarter were $181 million. Approximately 50,000 patients have been prescribed Dupixent since launch in the U.S. Underlying U.S. demand for Dupixent is strong, with total prescriptions up approximately 27% sequentially from the last quarter.","New patient starts, another indicator of demand, and average weekly NBRx in the second quarter were approximately 550 new patients, excluding the holiday week. Overall patient refill and persistence rates remain high, especially in comparison to other biologics. Dupixent prescribers remain highly satisfied frequently referring to Dupixent as a drug that is transformational to the lives of their patients and their treatment practices. In the U.S., over 11,000 healthcare providers have prescribed Dupixent through the second quarter, with depth of prescribing continuing to increase.","Consumer education and activation is an important component of the Dupixent launch. We've been encouraged by the impact of our unbranded disease state awareness campaign and plan to roll out a branded Dupixent television campaign in the coming weeks. Outside the U.S., the launch of Dupixent in atopic dermatitis is underway in multiple major markets. During the second quarter Dupixent was approved and launched in Japan, with additional launches anticipated in other countries over the remainder of 2018 and thereafter.","Beyond adult atopic dermatitis, we look forward to the FDA's decision on Dupixent for moderate to severe asthma in adults and adolescents, with a PDUFA date of October 20. Based on our clinical data, we believe that Dupixent offers a differentiated profile among biologics for asthma, with a substantial decrease in exacerbation rate, and consistent and clinically meaningful improvement in lung function.","There remains significant unmet need in uncontrolled asthma, which accounts for an estimated 20% of diagnosed asthma patients. Currently, there are approximately 900,000 patients in the U.S. who are treated for uncontrolled moderate to severe asthma, who would be considered appropriate biologic therapy candidates. However, fewer than 10% of these patients are currently treated with a biologic.","In addition, we also anticipate meaningful opportunities for Dupixent in adolescent and pediatric atopic dermatitis, pediatric asthma, nasal polyps, and eosinophilic esophagitis, which are all at late-stage development.","Global net sales in the second quarter for Praluent, as recorded by Sanofi, were $74 million, representing increase of 61% compared to the second quarter of 2017. Earlier this year, we reported positive data from the ODYSSEY cardiovascular outcome study and have made a regulatory submission in both the U.S. and Europe. Over time, as outcomes data are potentially included in the label and, as guidelines are anticipated to change, we expect commercial uptake to be positively impacted. We continue to engage in discussions with payers to simplify utilization management criteria and to improve access for patients in return for flexible pricing.","In the second quarter, we announced that we would lower the net price of Praluent in exchange for straightforward physician prescribing and more affordable patient access. We're pleased that Praluent was chosen as the exclusive PCSK9 inhibitor on the Express Scripts national formulary. The agreement took effect on July 1, so it is too early for us to assess the impact. This is a competitive space with many decisions yet to be made. We continue to engage with other payers and remain committed to minimizing barriers related to access and affordability for patients.","Moving to Kevzara, global net sales, as recorded by Sanofi, were $24 million in the second quarter as demand improved. Within the IL-6 subcutaneous class, Kevzara now has approximately 26% of dispensed NBRx share and 10% share of TRx launch-to-date.","Recently Kevzara was launched in a pre-filled pen and is now the only biologic RA therapy in the U.S. that is available in a button-free pen. The Kevzara pre-filled pen is uniquely activated by pressing the pen against the skin. Data have shown that pens are preferred over syringes by RA patients taking chronic subcutaneous injections. We continue to make strides in growing the IL-6 class through improved understanding of mechanism of action. Along with its differentiated clinical profile, Kevzara is positioned to be the preferred biologic for those patients who are inadequate responders or intolerant to TNF antibodies. We continue to improve market access with an estimated 92% of commercial lives having coverage.","I'd now like to turn to cemiplimab, our PD-1 antibody. We're preparing for an anticipated approval and launch of cemiplimab in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma later this year. If approved, this will be the third PD-1 antibody to market, but the first for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Our PDUFA date is in October 2018 and we expect a decision by the European Medicines Agency in the first half of 2019. In the U.S., our specialized field based oncology team is trained and prepared for launch. Commercial supplier is ready to ship immediately following approval. As a reminder, cemiplimab is a collaboration product with Sanofi, where in the U.S. we will take the commercial lead and record sales.","Now I'll turn the call over to Bob.","Robert E. Landry - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Marion, and good morning, everyone. As Len referenced at the start of this call, Regeneron had strong top and bottom line financial results. Today I'll discuss the details of our second quarter 2018 financial results, as well as highlight change to our full year 2018 guidance line items.","For the second quarter of 2018, we earned $5.45 per diluted share on non-GAAP net income of $624 million. These results represent a 31% and 28% year-over-year increase in our non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income, respectively. Total revenues grew 9% year-over-year to $1.61 billion. Continued drivers of this growth are performance of EYLEA, both in the U.S., as well as ex-U.S., and a decrease in the loss in connection with the commercialization of antibodies resulting from higher Dupixent sales, which was partially offset by no longer having a contribution from Sanofi in connection with the Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement that ended in December 2017.","EYLEA net product sales in the United States grew 8% to $992 million compared to $919 million in the second quarter of 2017. U.S. EYLEA distributor inventory experienced a modest decrease in the quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2018, yet remained within our normal one- to two-week targeted range. U.S. EYLEA's gross to net percentage remained relatively constant compared to both the second quarter of 2017 and first quarter of 2018. In the second week of June 2018, we increased the existing EYLEA discount offered to physician practices, regardless of volume.","Ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales, which are recorded by our collaborator Bayer, were $666 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, representing an 18% operational and 23% reported increase on a year-over-year basis. We remain encouraged by continued ex-U.S. EYLEA growth. Through the first six months of 2018, ex-U.S. EYLEA net sales increased 26% on a reported basis versus the comparable period in 2017.","Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2018 grew 25% year-over-year to $263 million, of which $246 million was derived from the share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. The $264 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 29%, compares favorably against the $191 million realized for the three months ended June 30, 2017.","Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $238 million for the second quarter of 2018 compared with $222 million for the second quarter of 2017. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue line item primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred commercialization-related expenses, and the recognition of deferred revenue from the immuno-oncology upfront payments, partly offset by our share of losses in connection with the commercialization of antibodies.","The year-over-year increase in Sanofi as of the second quarter 2018 included a $53 million decrease in our share of losses in connection with the commercialization of Dupixent, Praluent, and Kevzara, and higher Sanofi R&D reimbursement revenue associated with our increased investment in immuno-oncology. Offsetting these revenue increases is the 2017 expiration of the Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement, under which we recorded $44 million of revenue in the second quarter of 2017 compared to no revenue this quarter.","Additionally, during the second quarter of 2018 we realized $29 million less reimbursement of Regeneron research and development expenses under the Antibody License and Collaboration Agreement from decreased reimbursement levels for Dupixent versus second quarter 2017.","In the second quarter 2018, we recognized a loss of $69 million in connection with the commercialization of antibodies compared to a loss of $122 million in the second quarter of 2017. As I briefly touched on earlier, the lower share of loss was primarily attributed to higher global net sales of Dupixent, Kevzara, and Praluent, and lower commercialization expenses for Praluent, partly offset by an increase in both Dupixent and Kevzara commercialization expenses.","I want to make a few comments regarding our share of losses associated with the commercialization of the alliance products. Sanofi and Regeneron have ongoing worldwide product launches for Dupixent, Kevzara, and Praluent. We are pleased that the alliance is beginning to realize profits in certain markets and indications, such as with Dupixent for atopic dermatitis in the U.S. However, we are still incurring necessary launch expenses for new indications in new markets, and these expenses continue to weigh on the alliance's profitability.","In the first half of 2018, the alliance incurred significant expenses related to the expected U.S. asthma launch in addition to other ex-U.S. launch and prelaunch spend across the alliance portfolio. For the second half of 2018, the collaboration is expecting to launch in approximately 30 new markets across the alliance portfolio, as well as incur prelaunch expenses for additional markets and indications expected to launch in 2019 and beyond. We and Sanofi are working diligently to ensure we have the appropriate level of investment to support these opportunities. As the sales of our alliance products continue to grow, we expect to improve the collaboration's profitability.","Turning now to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $470 million for the second quarter of 2018 as compared to $440 million for the second quarter of 2017. The increase in non-GAAP R&D expense was the result of continued late-stage clinical developments for cemiplimab and fasinumab programs, and higher R&D head count and facility-related costs, partially offset by a decrease in Dupixent development costs and the discontinuation of certain development programs.","Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, was $286 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $196 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. Almost half of this year-over-year increase is attributable to the expiration of the Sanofi Antibody Discovery and Preclinical Agreement at the end of 2017. The remaining increases were primarily driven by higher research and development activities for partnered and wholly owned programs. Our press release includes the information required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense.","Primarily due to previously announced modifications to our ongoing NGF program, we are lowering and tightening our full year 2018 guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense to be in the range of $1.21 billion to $1.26 billion from our previous guidance of $1.23 billion to $1.31 billion. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $324 million for the second quarter of 2018, as compared to $262 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017.","The higher SG&A expenses in the second quarter of 2018 were primarily due to an increase in commercialization-related expenses for EYLEA and prelaunch expenses for cemiplimab and Dupixent in adult and adolescent asthma. Given year-to-date activity and projected second half 2018 spend, we are tightening full year 2018 non-GAAP SG&A expense to be $1.34 billion to $1.39 billion from $1.325 billion to $1.395 billion.","Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue, was $106 million for the second quarter of 2018. We are tightening our full year 2018 guidance for reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses to be $455 million to $485 million from $450 million to $485 million.","Before turning to taxes, in the second quarter of 2018 we realized $34 million of other income within the other income and expense line item. This was partly driven by the recognition of unrealized gains on equity securities due to the adoption of ASU 2016-01 in 2018. This is compared to having reported $24 million of other expense in the second quarter of 2017, which was primarily attributable to the loss on extinguishment of debt that we realized related to last year's Tarrytown lease transaction. Please see our 10-Q for more details on the year-over-year change.","With regard to taxes, our effective tax rate in the second quarter 2018 was 16% compared to 26% for the second quarter 2017, driven primarily by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which lowered the U.S. corporate tax rate. The rate was also impacted by improved results from our international operations as compared to the second quarter of 2017. As we continue to assess the full impact of the new tax law, including some onetime items, we now expect our full year 2018 effective tax rate to be in the range of 13% to 16% from our previous guidance of 15% to 18%.","While our effective tax rate guidance has been lowered for 2018, we do expect that over the next few years our effective tax rate will be in the mid to high teens. Given the recent passage of the new tax law, we are still awaiting regulatory or other guidance that could impact our future effective tax rate.","Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet, Regeneron ended the second quarter of 2018 with cash and marketable securities of $3.7 billion and generated in excess of $800 million of free cash flow for the six months ended June 30, 2018. We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures for the three months ended June 30, 2018 were $112 million and totaled $191 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. We are tightening and lowering our full year 2018 capital expenditure guidance to $410 million to $450 million from our prior range of $420 million to $480 million.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Manisha.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Bob. Sylvia, this concludes the end of our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Citi.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just had a question, given that data's coming up soon in pain and OA, maybe you could help us understand a little bit you're just \u2013 you have the low dose. What would be clinically meaningful data? And the OA market's very complex, so maybe help us understand some of the market stats around where this drug might be used within this population. Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Robyn. It's Len. I think what we've said about this program all along is that we would anticipate, based on the data we have and Compellor (00:32:32) program, that the efficacy that's been demonstrated is good efficacy and would, on efficacy considerations alone, be a useful addition to the therapeutic armamentarium in osteoarthritis, especially as a non-opiate pain, new pain class. So we're anticipating that the Phase 3 data we have should show some efficacy, but, obviously, we have to see it.","The safety, of course, the long-term safety, which won't be answered from this study, because this study is not our long-term safety, is something that we can only wait for the data. As you know, we lowered the dose to a dose that the independent committee felt was appropriate to continue. So we're pleased with that, and our Compellor (00:33:32) program is continuing. But it's all going to have to wait till we really have long-term data to know just exactly the promise of this program. So I think it remains a high-risk, high-reward program.","George, I don't know if you want to add anything.","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","No, I think you've covered it all.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sylvia, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray.","Christopher J. Raymond - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey. Thanks. So Roche has talked about their Lucentis pre-filled syringe as sort of a key component of driving market share gains and I think as they put it, sort of across all lines of therapy. So I understand you guys filed an sBLA for a similar device last quarter, I think, for EYLEA, but you're probably talking about a 2019 launch. So just maybe talk about the competitive dynamic, I guess, between now and then. And, first of all, is it your view that this is a big differentiator for Roche, as they're saying? And are there any countermeasures you can employ between now and then? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, I think that we have not seen this as a big shift in market share. Maybe Marion wants to go into depth on that.","Marion McCourt - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure, happy to. In fact, in the fairly comprehensive survey data we use of physician prescribing, it would suggest that we're continuing to see share growth with EYLEA opposite Lucentis. And certainly over the lifecycle of the brand, as EYLEA has grown, we've taken equal share, about 20 market share points, both from LUCENTIS and from Avastin. So while we do think having a pre-filled syringe available \u2013 and, as I mentioned in my comments, that will be later in 2019 potentially \u2013 we believe having that extension, that line extension and that delivery system will be helpful to physicians. We don't see it as in any way a negative to our current profile in marketplace as we're competing, and certainly the performance we're showing, the share growth we're showing, and the preference, clearly, in physicians prescribing for wet AMD with EYLEA is important as it is in DME.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe I want to ask one on the PD-1 program in non-small cell lung cancer. Can you talk about the rationale behind the increase in enrollment? Is it driven by powering increase? Is it driven by assumption of the comparator arm, or whatever you've learned from the Merck progress (36:18)? And then also the availability of KEYTRUDA in certain markets, would that affect your enrollment in this program or not? Thank you.","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, I think you did a good job answering your own question. Certainly, the original smaller study, the positive study with the PD-1 antibody in first-line non-small cell, the data looked more robust than the second study. Clearly, the agent is very active, but the relative effect compared to control was not quite as robust in the second study. And so we adjusted, based on our power calculations and based on those results, the size of our study. So it was basically entirely as you described. And certainly, of course, we take into account what's available, where, and what the standard of care is in different territories in terms of where we carry out our studies and how we enroll them. So, yeah, that's about it.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Next question comes from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink.","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Are you on mute?","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Geoff, we can't hear you.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi, there. Sorry about that. Congratulations on the results. A couple of financial questions for Bob. Bob, could you just confirm what free cash flow was in Q2? I think you gave us number the first half of the year. And then, what's driving the change compared to Q1? But more importantly, as we look to the commercialization of cemiplimab, are you going to have a second collaboration losses line that you report?","And related to that, as your financial reporting gets more and more complicated, is there anything you think that you can do to simplify it so that investors really understand the value and what the outlook is? Because we're getting more and more of these collaborations and more and more costs and sort of puts and takes in each of those lines and the variance in terms of consensus expectations is all over the place. So have you thought about any way in which you can simplify things? Appreciate it.","Robert E. Landry - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, Geoff, I'll take the last question first. As you know, just kind of giving the dialogue we've had, I mean, Len is constantly challenging me and my team to, obviously, make these things interpretable in which the true value of the company comes out by looking at financial statements. There's no doubt it's complicated. We do our best, inclusive of documents we post at the JPMorgan meeting in January, with regards to getting into detail with regards to the modeling and we will continue to do that and continue to take your concerns under consideration with regards to that.","On your first question, with regards to cash flow, there is a pretty big difference between Q1 and Q2. I think you meant Q1 2018 versus Q2 2018. We had no tax payments in the first quarter of 2018 and we did in the quarter two of 2018, which is why we had $800 million in total, roughly $500 million, $300 million split, something along that line. With regards to cemiplimab, we are still under discussions with regards to exactly how we're going to show that, Geoff, and we'll put more out at that time at a later date. Thanks.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Next question, operator.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. If I could ask maybe a question on the C5 inhibitor that you talked about. Can you just talk about when you talk about blood level sufficient, are you comparing this to Soliris or ALXN 1210? And what's your view on sort of how the market's going to develop and what you think is the appropriate bar to look at as you develop this molecule? Thanks.","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, well, we're talking about our evaluation based on our assays of our molecules compared to what's known in the public domain, as well as using our own pharmacodynamic assays and measures of how well we're doing at inhibiting complement. So it's integrating all of that data. What we see that's important out there is to provide patients with a convenient home self-administered subcutaneous regimen that makes their life a lot easier and that keeps their disease in better control with less breakthrough. So we're trying to make their lives easier and better, while delivering better disease control. That's our goal.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So just to be very clear, in case if people aren't familiar with what George was saying. We not only measure our blood levels to determine whether we achieve what we wanted. We take the blood out of patients and do an ex vivo assay to see whether that blood can suppress in a standard assay for complement activation, and we achieve the blood level that fully suppresses that. Of course, that's not quite the same thing as doing a disease, but we expect and hope it will be a good predictor.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Schimmer from Evercore ISI.","Josh Schimmer - Evercore ISI","Thanks for taking the questions. Two quick ones. First, it looks like the commercial JV with Sanofi may have been trending towards declining loss, but based on the commentary and the guidance, is it correct that you expect that trend to reverse temporarily towards greater losses in the second half of 2018? If so, when do you expect it to return to kind of improving the losses and that will eventually become profitable? And then quickly on the C5 antibody, what do you anticipate the dosing frequency will be for the SubQ injection? Thanks.","Robert E. Landry - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Josh, I'll take the first question. And we're not going to give guidance with regards to when we think the collaboration is going to turn profitable. And, yes, directionally in the second quarter to your point, it is trending in the right direction. Again, my comments that were made with regards to second half spend, we are going to be entering a very crowded and very competitive asthma class, and we need to ensure, given the strength of our antibody, that we have enough support, that Marion has enough support with the Sanofi alliance behind us to ensure that it is a very, very successful launch and we come out of the gates very strong right away. And again, we're not going to give, in terms of quarterly, our profitability guidance on that note.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So as far as the dosing (00:43:12), typically one likes to think that the minimum acceptable interval, although, obviously, there are insulin and others and way more than that, would be a weekly dosing. And that's what we're able to achieve in the first study. Whether we can go longer than that, we'll just have to see as we get more into this. But right now, our comments reflect a weekly subcutaneous dosing regimen that we intend to move forward.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carter Gould from UBS.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, for Len and George, you mentioned your higher dose aflibercept and moving forward that, how fast do you think that could potentially get on the market? And any indication from your initial work, what do you think you can get the treatment interval out to? Thank you.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, I think it's a little bit too early to go into that, Carter. Obviously, we have a tremendous amount of experience doing these types of studies, both in the preclinical and the clinical. We've worked diligently to come up with a higher dose formulation and we think that that is something that would extend the half-life. It's a competitive field, so we probably don't want to comment much more about that.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Our following question comes from Phil Nadeau from Cowen and Company.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the progress. A question on Dupixent reimbursement, can you talk about any trends, notable trends that you saw in Dupixent reimbursement in atopic dermatitis in Q2? Was there anything that eased, that allowed the new prescriptions to grow so significantly? And then as you prepare for the launch of Dupixent in asthma, what are you doing to ensure access to patients as that launches? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So before Marion addresses the access issue, I just want to say what we continue to hear and we maybe didn't mention enough is that the feedback from patients continues to be really, really satisfying, and makes us \u2013 sort of reminds us why all of us are doing what we're doing. People who are miserable with this disease have felt and told us that it was life changing for them. And so, as I've said on previous calls, it is nice that the data that you saw and we saw in our clinical trials seems to be translating very well in the real world where patients are experiencing on an individual basis the kind of benefit that the data that we achieved in the controlled setting would have predicted.","So that is very nice. And both the doctors and the patients are extremely satisfied and, as I said before, thank goodness, we've also seen no new side effects to concern people. So the tolerability out in the real world is also very good. So, from my perspective, I would guess that is probably the biggest thing that's driving the continued use and growth and, of course, there is blocking and tackling that Marion can address if she likes.","Marion McCourt - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure, happy to. And to give a little bit more specificity on the access for Dupixent in atopic dermatitis, among commercial payers today, we have coverage with over 90% for \u2013 over 90% of covered lives. But then if we get a little bit more specific, and to give you the numbers, the percentage is about 65% of commercial lives have access to Dupixent following only one or two topical medication. So we've made significant progress and we did make some meaningful progress as well in the second quarter picking up another one of the major insurance companies.","So I think we feel really good about that progress. But I would also say that what \u2013 to Len's point, what is really driving the demand we're seeing, such as this 27% increase in TRxs that I referenced in the quarter-on-quarter comparison, and of course the number was 25% in the quarter-on-quarter comparison in the first quarter, this type of demand is coming because of the tremendous results that physicians are seeing in prescribing. Their toughest cases now moving into additionally not only their severe, but starting to move into their more moderate cases, and the tremendous value that patients are seeing.","As for asthma, we very much look forward to the launch. We certainly at the appropriate time will engage in payer discussions and, of course, I think some of the differentiating characteristics are really important to keep in mind. The clinical profile that George referenced, and also in my comments, differentiated by our profile as it relates to the impact we're seeing with Dupixent in moderate to severe asthma, a reduction in exacerbations, and also the consistency that we see in lung function is really, really important.","A second differentiating characteristic I've mentioned is that patients will be able to administer product self or at home, and that also is a distinguishing feature that is important. So we look forward to launch. We're ready and we certainly will engage with payers at the right time.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. A follow-up on Dupixent. So out of the 50,000 or so patients that have been treated with the product in the commercial setting thus far, do you have a good sense of the proportion of those that have overlapping allergic disease co-morbidities? And maybe even more specifically in terms of asthma? I'm curious how common this is. Thanks.","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. I don't think we have the real world data, but we know from our controlled studies \u2013 now, I'll say our controlled studies are a collection of the moderate to severe atopic dermatitis patient and, as Marion just told you, the doctors tend to provide their more serious patients or put their more serious patients on first. So what's been happening in the real world, you might think might be patients who actually have more disease and more co-morbidities. But in our controlled studies of the moderate to severe population on the order of 30% to 40% had co-morbid asthma, and 60% to 70% had at least one other co-morbid allergic condition. So, obviously, among the atopic dermatitis population, the moderate to severe, there is a very substantial amount of co-morbidity with other allergic conditions.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys. Want to ask you on Praluent. Post ODYSSEY and post a price cut in some populations, how would you characterize access today versus 12 months ago? And then, what do you think is the tipping point for the class overall, just to expand into a broader population? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Geoff. I think the answer is that access is definitely improving, in the sense that the artificial barriers that are out there, these complicated questions, requirements for documentation, et cetera, et cetera, are slowly being removed. I think we saw that with Express Script, where they went to a short physician at a station. I think others will be moving to it.","But the tipping point, I actually think, may come with sort of practice guidelines coming from a variety of sources where it will be, I expect that people will \u2013 practice guidelines will demand that patients who can't get their LDL down to an appropriate level when they have cardiovascular disease with the existing therapies, it will be standard practice, not optional, to go to a PCSK9 inhibitor. That probably will be the tipping point, but we'll see. Thanks.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Following question is from Matthew Luchini from BMO Capital.","Matthew Luchini - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. You touched on this a little bit in the answer to one of the last questions, but I was curious if you could provide a bit more color on the types of patients that are receiving Dupixent in terms of disease severity and how you think expansion into more moderate patients is going to evolve over the next 3, 6, 12 months. Thank you.","Marion McCourt - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So I think that it's not unusual that physicians in their first experience will try some of their very, very toughest patients. So that would have been in the earlier launch phase. As we now see the improvement in performance, as evidenced by numbers of physicians who are prescribing, depth of prescribing TRxs and the NRX numbers that I shared, we now know that physicians and also nurse practitioners, PAs who use Dupixent, are already starting to move from severe into their more moderate patients as they evolve into a broader experience. It's hard to give you exact numbers on that. That I don't have. But we are seeing evidence through discussions and through prescribing depth.","Having said that, if we were in times back thinking that we probably have roughly 300,000 to 400,000 potential patients who would have moderate to severe disease in the U.S., we really are only at a relatively small percentage of touching patients. So we have an awful lot more work to do and a lot more potential for Dupixent in atopic dermatitis.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. I think that our DTC that you referenced earlier, Marion, in your remarks should help. At least we're anticipating that that should help achieve that.","Marion McCourt - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yes. Thank you, Len, for the mention there. And then just to be clear, because we covered a lot, we are going to be launching a Dupixent on-air TV campaign nationally shortly. We've got great response to the disease state awareness campaign, as evidenced by many, many touches to our website, and patients coming for additional information and even physicians mentioning that they were seeing patients, because they had been engaged by the disease state awareness. We do think it's the right time to evolve into the branded campaign and very much look forward to having that on-air so that patients are educated, and we support efforts to get them the care they need.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Our following question comes from Brian Skorney from Baird.","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for fitting me in with a couple quick questions on the pipeline. On the BCMA bi-specific antibody, just given the subpar results we've seen so far with the ADC BCMA antibody compared to the CAR-BCMA, I mean, just what do you think about the bi-specific pathway could make it more competitive with CAR? And I just wanted to get your thoughts on the role of IL-33 in COPD versus IL-4, IL-13. Would a signal for REGN3500 make COPD a potential target for Dupixent, or is there just a much better bio plausibility around IL-33 for COPD? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","George?","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, well, certainly I think there's quite a bit of data, not only from us, but from others, but certainly pre-clinically. There is no question that the activity in animal models of the bi-specific compared to an ADC is two entirely different classes. And we certainly also compare them pre-clinically versus CAR-T approaches. And certainly, the bi-specific much more closely approaches CAR-T type of activities. So we are very excited about our BCMA bi-specific in terms of it now, very soon we're going to start hopefully seeing how it's going to be performing in patients. And, as I mentioned, we also have coming up combination approaches with additional classes of bi-specifics that will also be very relevant to the BCMA program, as well as a way to potentially finer tune or amplify its activity in terms of what we see there. So we're very excited about that program.","In terms of IL-33 and dupilumab for COPD, I think that there is a lot of questions in the field right now about how to pursue some of the biologics in the COPD setting and exactly what the implications are in terms of the biology, some of the genetics, what they call the so-called overlap syndrome. There's a substantial number of patients with COPD that have asthma overlap, and so there's a lot of questions there. And right now, we're really thinking about all this in terms of figuring out exactly what we're going to be doing also with COPD","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Our following question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Jason Jakoby - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. This is Jason Jakoby on for Terrence. Just another one on dupi. So with the adolescent expansion for atopic derm next year, can you just help us think about the potential patient numbers in the U.S. for this population versus the adult numbers, where I think you've said it's like 300,000? Thanks.","Marion McCourt - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, this is Marion. We actually have not yet given specificity on the size of the adolescent patient population. We very much look forward to (00:57:20) potential launch in this area and certainly would be very happy in the future to provide more insight there.","Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Our following question comes from Adnan Butt from Guggenheim Securities.","Adnan Butt - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe one on EYLEA, Len and George, some channel checks indicate that memories of the inflammation episode with EYLEA still linger a bit. So is that resolved? Has that EYLEA inflammation rate now normalized back to clinical data? And then, Len, you have talked about the potential differences on safety. Do you think inflammation is something that could be different for EYLEA versus new agents?","Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, so as far as the increase in intraocular inflammation, there's no doubt that there was a spike. To the best that we could do looking at every variable, it seemed to trace to several batches of syringes. But, of course, in the absence of doing a controlled trial, one can't be certain. But what we can say is that the background rate typically is about one to two cases of inflammations per 10,000 injections.","The marketplace notices when you get to 5 per 10,000 or 10 per 10,000, they notice it quite a lot. And I can tell you that we spiked up above the one to two, and we don't think we quite got to 10. But we certainly are now back to the baseline of one to two, and we monitor this very carefully. Not to break our arms patting ourselves on the back. I think that we handled that very transparently with all the various retinal associations and ophthalmologic groups. We shared the data directly with the key opinion leaders and anybody who wanted to see it. Marion's team was out there. We got lots of positive feedback. I'm sure we lost some customers during that, but I think that we're winning them back, because of our transparency and the fact that we've got the rate down.","Now, in terms of new agents, yes, inflammation could be a differentiating factor. I think I've seen rates in some of the newer types of agents that are up to 15 per 100, 150 per 1,000, 1,500 per 10,000. Remember, we're talking about in the outside \u2013 in the world as we monitor, we're looking at rates of one to two per 10,000. So, yes, if those rates don't come down dramatically, I don't think that we would be overly concerned about the competitive nature.","I just want to say that, to emphasize that, we look very carefully at the competition. We don't see anything coming along that is going to be highly differentiated from the data we've seen from our molecule. And remember, we have recently gotten, as George highlighted, an approval in Europe based on a study that the FDA hasn't seen yet, but the ALTAIR study, where we got a label that allowed for extension of dosing, through a treat and extend dosing regimen in the first year, where 57% of the people were able to get at the end of a year to an intended regimen of 12 weeks or more, and still gaining an average of about 9 letters and many patients achieving an interval of four months. So I think EYLEA has incredible profile and we don't see anything coming along that disrupts that profile. And we certainly don't see anything that can have the broad number of indications for a very long time that we have in our emphasis on diabetes.","George Damis Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","I do think it is worth emphasizing, your question, the point that you raised, about how the eye is such a sensitive readout for inflammation. And, obviously, having the experience, the wealth of experience that we have and understanding of this, and also our ability to track these things and so forth, yeah, I think it's really important. I think that if a physician is treating a patient, they have to take into account the risks and the experience and the confidence that they would have in any particular agent.","Manisha A.

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' third quarter 2015 conference call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under Events and Presentations for 30 days.","Joining me on the call today are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President of Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer; Bob Terifay, Senior Vice President, Commercial; and Bob Landry, our Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions and answers.","I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call include forward-looking statements about Regeneron.

Once our call concludes, the team will be available to answer further questions.","With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Leonard Schleifer.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Michael, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us on the call and webcast today. I'm pleased to share with you that we delivered another strong quarter. EYLEA continued to show growth both in the U.S. and globally. Praluent, our first-in-class PCSK9 inhibitor for the treatment of elevated LDL cholesterol was approved and the launch is underway. And we continue to advance our early and late-stage pipeline programs.","This quarter, I am particularly proud to announce that quarterly global sales of EYLEA surpassed $1 billion for the first time in the product's commercial history. Overall, EYLEA has driven the solid financial performance we delivered in the third quarter of 2015, which you will hear more about from Bob Landry.","Based on the continued strong growth in U.S. EYLEA net sales, we are increasing our full-year U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance to year-over-year growth of between 50% and 55% from the previously provided range of 45% to 50%. To help put in perspective how strong the performance of EYLEA has been during the first nine months, you may recall that our original guidance that we provided at the beginning of the year was for 25% to 30% year-over-year growth. Bob Terifay will review EYLEA sales in more detail.","In the third quarter, we received regulatory approval in the U.S. and the EU for Praluent, our PCSK9 antibody. While the U.S. launch is still in its early days and many challenges remain, we, along with our collaborator Sanofi, are encouraged by what we have seen so far. Bob Terifay will discuss the ongoing launch in greater detail.","We have also made important progress with our pipeline. Today, we have four late-stage antibodies: sarilumab for rheumatoid arthritis; dupilumab for a variety of allergic and atopic diseases; REGN2222 for respiratory syncytial virus; and fasinumab, our NGF antibody for osteoarthritis-related pain.","We also made important announcements around our early stage research programs, including a collaboration with the U.S. Health and Human Services' Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority Division, also known as BARDA, in Ebola, which highlights Regeneron's rapid response capabilities for emerging infectious diseases. And the publication of our discovery of the mechanistic basis for the rare disease known as fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP, in science translational medicine, as well as the identification of a therapeutic candidate for this terrible disease. You'll hear more about some of these advances from George.","As we discussed on our last quarterly call, early in the third quarter we announced a major new collaboration with Sanofi in immuno-oncology, and we continue to advance our programs in this area.","I want to take a moment to reflect on our achievements this quarter, as they highlight Regeneron's unique position. While we continue to have strong top line growth from EYLEA, we are also in the midst of an important launch with Praluent and are positioned to bring multiple important new medicines to patients in the coming years, including sarilumab for rheumatoid arthritis and three additional antibodies which are in late-stage development.","Our investments in R&D have the potential to help diverse groups of patients in need. We expect to make significant investments in the coming year to support these important programs in terms of launch and development costs. These critical investments will fuel our efforts to continue to move our pipeline forward and thereby, hopefully, allow Regeneron to continue to execute on its mission to provide important new medicines to patients in need. Bob Landry will update you on our financial results.","In addition to our progress with our late-stage antibodies, we maintain our commitment to continue to innovate, whether that is for rare diseases like FOP, emerging diseases like Ebola, or the genetics effort at the Regeneron Genetics Center, to name a few.","With that, let me turn the call over to Dr. George Yancopoulos, Regeneron's Chief Scientific Officer. He will be followed by Bob Terifay and then by Bob Landry. George?","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. As Len mentioned, we have remained committed to being a research-driven company, and the depth and breadth of our proprietary technology and the resulting pipeline of molecules, all of which have been invented in our own labs, is a testament to that vision.","Len and I are proud of our team and what they are accomplishing. One of the features that distinguish us as a company is that the core group of scientists who helped build Regeneron from the very beginning continues to be actively involved as leaders and is now being joined by the next generation of new scientists who are attracted to our research-based approach. To that end, we are proud that we are one of the top two employers by Science Magazine for the fifth year in a row, and once again the top employer in the biopharmaceutical industry.","Turning to developments this quarter. I would like to begin with Praluent, where we currently have a Phase III outcome study ongoing. We expect this study to be fully enrolled by the end of the year, with final data expected in 2017, and interim analysis by the independent data monitoring committee reported next year.","At the annual meeting of the European Society of Cardiology Congress, we presented new data from a pooled analysis of over 1,200 heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patients, one of the major group of patients for whom Praluent is indicated. This represented the largest group of HetFH patients ever studied in a Phase III program. This pooled analysis was concurrently published in the European Heart Journal. We look forward to presenting additional new analyses from our Phase III program at the American Heart Association meeting this upcoming weekend.","We have submitted our BLA for sarilumab, our interleukin-6 receptor antibody for rheumatoid arthritis, and look forward to a potential FDA action in the second half of 2016. Next week, at the American College of Rheumatology meeting, we will be presenting additional Phase III data for sarilumab, including data from the positive target study which was in patients who are inadequate responders to, or intolerant of, TNF alpha inhibitors, in combination with non-biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, or DMARD therapy.","We'll be hosting a conference call next week from ACR. The target data, along with the previously reported published data from the Phase III mobility study of sarilumab in combination with methotrexate in patients who were inadequate responders to methotrexate alone, are included in our regulatory submission in the U.S. In addition, the Phase III MONARCH study of sarilumab versus adalimumab in the monotherapy setting is now fully enrolled, and we expect to report data from this study in the second half of 2016.","Turning to dupilumab, our antibody that blocks the interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 pathways. We expect to see data in early 2016 from our pivotal Phase III studies in atopic dermatitis, both of which are fully enrolled, with the regulatory submission to follow in the second half of the year. A Phase II study in the pediatric atopic dermatitis population is also fully enrolled, and we are committed to moving as quickly as possible to address this important patient population.","In the asthma indication, our confirmatory Phase III study is ongoing and enrolling patients. As we have mentioned previously, following discussion with the FDA, we'll only need to conduct one Phase III efficacy study in this indication since the FDA has said that our Phase IIB trial could be considered pivotal. In addition, we continue to explore other potential allergic indications for dupilumab such as nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis.","Regeneron 2222, our antibody to respiratory syncytial virus is in Phase III clinical development. An open-label pharmacokinetic portion of this study has been completed in healthy preterm infants and has enabled dose selection for the second part of this Phase III study which is expected to commence shortly. A separate, second Phase III study is planned for next year.","Fasinumab, our antibody that blocks nerve growth factor, is currently in Phase III clinical studies for osteoarthritis-related pain. Last month, we announced a collaboration agreement in Asia for this program with Mitsubishi Tanabe and look forward to working with our new Japanese collaborators to advance fasinumab.","We also announced and launched our new immuno-oncology collaboration with Sanofi during the quarter. With the additional resources and commitment to immuno-oncology, coupled with our capabilities in both immunomodulatory antibodies and bispecific antibodies, our goal is to become a major contributor to this exciting new field. Our PD-1, which is expected to serve as a backbone of several future combination approaches, continues to enrolling patients in an early clinical study, as is our CD3xCD20 bispecific antibody, which is not included in the immuno-oncology collaboration, but will nevertheless serve as the proof of concept for our overall bispecific platform.","I'd now like to spend a few minutes on our earlier stage pipeline. In September, we announced that Science Translational Medicine had published a paper describing the discovery and preclinical validation of a key biological mechanism that drives the pathophysiology of a rare genetic disorder, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP.","FOP is a progressive, severely disabling and ultimately fatal disease in which muscles, ligaments, tendons and other connective tissues are transformed into bone. While FOP is a very rare disease \u2013 there's approximately 800 confirmed cases in the world \u2013 we've been inspired by the stories of the patients with this terrible disease by our interactions with the International FOP Association which represents the patients and their families, and the clinical community, particularly Dr. Fred Kaplan and his group at the University of Pennsylvania, as well as our own scientific drive to understand this important pathway's potential implications to other diseases.","A critical factor that enabled us to elucidate this signaling pathway and identify active (13:25) as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of FOP was our proprietary VelociGene technology. We used this to develop a genetically humanized and novel mouse model of FOP in which the hypothesized molecular pathophysiology of disease was elucidated. Additionally, our proprietary VelocImmune platform enabled us to generate an antibody highly selective to the therapeutic targets. We think underserved diseases like FOP highlights the need for innovative R&D, and we hope that our efforts may ultimately result in important new therapies.","Similarly, I would now like to provide you with an update on our efforts in emerging infectious diseases that pose a risk to public health such as ebola. We believe we can take advantage of Regeneron's rapid response technologies in this space as they can be immensely useful in emergency situations for diseases that cause a large and quickly expanding threat to the general population.","In September, we announced that we have received funding from BARDA to advance, test and manufacture a monoclonal antibody cocktail for the treatment of ebola virus infection. In addition to ebola, a proprietary antibody, Regeneron Rapid Response platform has been used to generate antibodies for Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome or MERS, which has been the recent cause of outbreaks in both Saudi Arabia and South Korea. It has the potential to address other emerging infectious diseases.","Before I turn the call over to Bob Terifay, I would like to briefly highlight the impressive speed by which the Regeneron Genetics Center, or the RGC, has become a leader in the human genetics space. In October, we presented several abstracts at the American Society for Human Genetics meeting, which showed the potential of our unique approach, which integrates genomic data with electronic health records from a growing database of patient volunteers. We are currently on track to sequence over 100,000 individuals by early 2016, approximately two years after we launch this initiative.","With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob Terifay.","Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President, Commercial","Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter was a significant one for Regeneron. EYLEA, or aflibercept injection, continued to demonstrate strong sales growth both in the United States as well as the rest of the world. In addition, in July, we launched Praluent, alirocumab in the United States, for the lowering of poorly-controlled low density lipoprotein cholesterol in certain high-risk patient groups. Praluent was also approved in September by European regulators.","Starting with EYLEA, third quarter U.S. net sales growth was 65% year-over-year. Net U.S. EYLEA sales to distributors in the third quarter were $734 million. Underlying physician demand has continued to remain strong and grew sequentially quarter-over-quarter by 10%. A survey of 200 U.S. retinal specialists who evaluated the reported use of VEGF inhibitors in the third quarter of 2015, indicates that EYLEA growth in the quarter was driven largely by growth in diabetic macular edema or DME and macular edema following retinal vein occlusion.","Third quarter net sales were also impacted by a slight increase in distributor inventory levels. I should note that fourth quarter net U.S. sales could be negatively impacted by several factors such as potential changes in inventory levels, seasonal fourth quarter holidays resulting in reduced offices and potential bad weather.","According to our third quarter survey of retinal specialists, the market share of eyes treated with EYLEA in DME is roughly doubled that for ranibizumab and similar to that for off-label bevacizumab. Our market share of eyes treated for macular edema following retinal vein occlusion actually surpassed the individual shares for both bevacizumab and ranibizumab in the third quarter. Per the survey, EYLEA continues to be the market leading product among FDA approved anti-VEGF agents in all of our labeled indications in terms of market share of treated eyes.","Outside of the United States where we share EYLEA profits with our collaborator, Bayer HealthCare, third quarter EYLEA net sales were $371 million, representing 34% year-over-year growth on a reported basis. This is notwithstanding substantial adverse currency impact. In constant currency, ex-U.S. EYLEA net sales in the third quarter grew 58% year-over-year.","Regulatory and pricing approvals for new indications continued to contribute to ex-U.S. sales growth. For example, just this past week, Bayer HealthCare received regulatory approval in the EU for EYLEA for the treatment of visual impairment secondary to myopic choroidal neovascularization.","Let's turn now to Praluent. While it is still very early in the launch, we are pleased with our operational implementation of the launch. The Regeneron and Sanofi field teams were fully trained and in physician offices on the first business day after approval. To date, we have jointly called on over 39,000 healthcare professionals and 4,600 healthcare professionals have participated in our educational programs.","Over 4,000 prescribers have submitted prescriptions to MyPRALUENT, our reimbursement and patient services hub. Of all prescriptions received, approximately 90% of the prescriptions have been filled for our recommended 75-milligram low dose option. As reported by Sanofi, net sales to wholesalers in the third quarter were $4 million. As a reminder, the reimbursement environment is complex and will be carefully managed by payers. Our goal has been to ensure that payers and healthcare providers understand the value that Praluent can offer to patients.","And to that end, we are actively engaged in extensive discussions with payers. We continue to emphasize to payers that physicians and patients should have choice in selecting a PCSK9 inhibitor. We expect that it will take several months for some commercial and government payers to conduct formulary reviews, make reimbursement coverage decisions, and to begin process of patient claims. Given these reasons, we expect an initial gradual uptake at launch. In response to potential delays in formulary decisions and reimbursement decisions, we are offering samples and free product to appropriate labeled patients who are awaiting an insurance coverage decision.","This may delay uptake in commercial sales reporting. For example, for Medicare Part D or government-paid patients, there can be up to a six-month coverage decision period. So, for the next several quarters, performance cannot be judged based upon reported sales or filled prescriptions. We would expect that this would understate both the volume of physician and patient adoption.","As a proxy for physician prescription demand, we are currently evaluating physician prescriptions submitted to the MyPRALUENT hub for reimbursement verification. In the third quarter of 2015, submissions were consistent with our expectations. Outside of the United States, Praluent was approved in the EU in September with some launches expected before year-end.","As mentioned earlier, we recently submitted a BLA to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for sarilumab, our interleukin-6 or IL-6 inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis. We're actively preparing for a potential U.S. launch in 2016. As part of our prelaunch preparation, we will have a large presence at the upcoming American College of Rheumatology meeting in San Francisco this weekend.","We also continue to prepare for the potential U.S. launch of dupilumab, our IL-4 and 13 inhibitor in 2017. For example, last month, at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology meeting in Copenhagen, hundreds of dermatologists participated in our educational symposium on atopic dermatitis. We are actively in the process of hiring internal commercialization team members for both sarilumab and dupilumab ahead of their potential launches.","With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry.","Robert E. Landry - Senior Vice President-Finance & Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone. Regeneron posted strong financial results in the third quarter of 2015. In the third quarter of 2015, we earned $3.47 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $403 million, which represents year-over-year growth in non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income of 38% and 37%, respectively. Regeneron's third quarter 2015 non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense related to our senior convertible notes, loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with conversions of a portion of our convertible notes during the quarter, and non-cash income taxes.","Third quarter non-GAAP net income is based upon an estimated full year cash tax rate that reflects cash income taxes expected to be paid or payable for 2015. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings were primarily driven by non-cash share-based compensation expense and non-cash income taxes. And a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release.","Total revenues in the third quarter of 2015 were $1.14 billion, which represented year-over-year growth of 57%. Net product sales were $738 million in the third quarter of 2015, compared to $449 million in the third quarter of 2014. EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $734 million in the third quarter of 2015, compared to $445 million in the third quarter of 2014, which represents an increase of 65%. During the third quarter of 2015, EYLEA experienced a slight increase in U.S. distributor inventory levels as compared to the second quarter 2015, but remained within our normal one to two-week targeted range.","As Len mentioned earlier, we are raising our U.S. EYLEA net sales growth guidance for full year 2015 over 2014 to be between 50% and 55%, from our previous guidance of 45% to 50%.","Ex-U.S. EYLEA sales were $371 million in the third quarter of 2015, as compared to $277 million in the third quarter 2014, representing a 34% increase on a reported basis. On an operational basis, or a constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 58%. Product revenue from ex-U.S. EYLEA sales is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer Healthcare.","In the third quarter of 2015, Regeneron recognized $131 million from our share in net profits from EYLEA sales outside the United States. Total Bayer Healthcare collaboration revenue for the third quarter was $158 million. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $225 million for the third quarter of 2015. The total, the Sanofi collaboration revenue line, primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, and our share of profits or losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies.","As a reminder, while we get reimbursed for antibody-related commercial expenses that we incur, these, along with the commercial expenses that Sanofi spends on the antibodies, are included as expenses in the calculation of antibody profits and losses.","In the third quarter of 2015, our share of losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies, primarily Praluent, was $75 million, which can be found in table four of our earnings release. Netted within this loss were the U.S. sales of Praluent for the quarter, as recognized by our partner Sanofi, of $4 million.","Additionally, in connection with our new immuno-oncology collaboration with Sanofi, in the third quarter of 2015, we received $640 million in upfront payments from Sanofi, of which we recognized $20 million as collaboration revenue during the quarter. These non-refundable upfront payments were recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt, and are being recognized as revenue ratably over the related performance period, which is currently estimated to be approximately eight years. Note that the deferred revenue balance from these upfront payments as of the end of 2015 is currently anticipated to be approximately $600 million, and subject to taxation at the U.S. statutory rate in 2016.","Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $362 million for the third quarter. Our unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as total GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators and R&D non-cash share-based compensation expense, was $135 million for the quarter. Our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense.","As a result of a growing number of unpartnered pipeline candidates and our having reached Sanofi's full year 2015 antibody discovery reimbursement level of $145 million during the first three quarters, we expect our unreimbursed R&D expense to continue to increase in the fourth quarter. Therefore, we are raising and tightening our guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $540 million to $560 million, from our previous guidance range of $510 million to $550 million.","Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $174 million for the third quarter, a sequential increase of 22% versus second quarter 2015 and 111% versus the third quarter of 2014. These percent increases are in line with our expectations and are primarily driven by the commercialization expenses to launch Praluent. We are tightening our guidance for non-GAAP SG&A to $630 million to $650 million, from our previous guidance range of $610 million to $650 million.","As we've mentioned previously, in 2015, we began paying significant cash income taxes as compared to prior periods. Our non-GAAP tax rate for this quarter, as well as for all of 2015, is based on an estimate of the cash taxes paid or payable for the full year, which will be substantially lower than our GAAP effective tax rate. On a non-GAAP basis, our cash tax rate for the third quarter of 2015 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was approximately 19% and 18%, respectively, of non-GAAP pre-tax income. As we approach year-end, we are tightening our cash tax guidance as a percentage of non-GAAP pre-tax income to be between 16% and 20% for 2015, from the previously provided range of between 15% and 22%.","In September, we entered into a collaboration with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation for our NGF antibody, fasinumab, which is in late stage development for osteoarthritis-related pain. Under the terms of the agreement, Mitsubishi will obtain exclusive development and commercial rights to fasinumab in Japan, Korea and nine other Asian countries, excluding China. The signing of this agreement did not have a material impact on the third quarter of 2015, nor will it materially impact the P&L for the full year 2015.","In connection with the collaboration, we received a $10 million non-refundable upfront payment from Mitsubishi, which was deferred upon receipt and will be recognized ratably as revenue over the related performance period. We are also entitled to receive up to an aggregate of $65 million in payments for development milestones achieved by us, and $150 million in other contingent payments, primarily related to development milestones achieved by Mitsubishi.","Our capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were $500 million. This spend is slightly lower than expected and as a result, we are tightening and lowering our full year 2015 capital guidance to a range of $625 million to $675 million, from $675 million to $750 million.","Our Raheen, Ireland commercial manufacturing site, which is under construction, continues to represent our largest capital investment in 2015, and is progressing as planned. This 400,000 square foot, state-of-the-art, biologics production facility is now operational, with the first production line on track to enter validation within a few months. In the third quarter, we also saw the completion and opening of two new buildings on our Tarrytown campus which has provided us with approximately 297,000 square feet of new laboratory and office space.","We ended the third quarter of 2015 with cash and marketable securities of $1.58 billion. This reflects both the $640 million of upfront payments we have received from Sanofi related to our immuno-oncology collaboration, as well as a $400 million disbursement made to reduce the number of outstanding warrants originally issued in connection with the issuance of our senior convertible notes in 2011.","Before I hand the call over to Michael for Q&A, let me reemphasize Len's comments regarding the important investment year 2016 is shaping up to be. This investment year will be anchored by the funding of Praluent during its first full year in the market and will also include preparing for the launch of multiple important new medicines that we plan to bring the patients specifically, sarilumab for RA and dupilumab for atopic dermatitis.","With regards to R&D investment, we are planning for significant expenses related to our late-stage pipeline which includes: initiating in the first half 2016 the funding of 20% of dupilumab's Phase III clinical development cost for both the asthma and atopic dermatitis indications, assuming positive Phase III data is reported for dupilumab and atopic dermatitis; the continuation of funding 20% of Phase III studies in both Praluent and sarilumab; advancement of our Phase III REGN222 and fasinumab programs in progressing our early stage, un-partnered pipeline forward (30:46).","In addition to incurring these investment expenses, it's important to remember that the intellectual property associated with our late-stage pipeline has been migrated offshore; thus these expenses will be incurred in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, which we expect will result in higher cash tax and effective tax rates for 2016.","With that I'd like to turn the call back to Michael.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Thank you, Bob. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call to Q&A. As we'd like to give as many people a chance to ask questions as possible, as always, we request you to limit yourself to one question. For other questions that you don't get to ask, our team will be available in our office after the call for follow-up questions.","Thank you, and operator, if you could please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. One moment for our question. Our first question comes from the line of Ying Huang of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on a great quarter for EYLEA. So, first I have a question on the formulary access for Praluent. You have got the branded Tier 2 preferred formulary access from Express Scripts. Should we expect a similar tiering for the other payers? And then some investors have been wondering that given this preferred status, branded Tier 2, you probably have to provide a sizeable rebate for Praluent. Is that the case?","And the secondly, maybe for Bob Terifay here, you have been gaining share for EYLEA in both AMD and DMD (32:49)? In the fourth quarter, maybe you're saying that there are some headwinds here, but shall we assume that you'll continue to gain share from both off-label Avastin and also Lucentis? Thank you.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Ying, thank you for your three questions.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Ying, do you have one of those that you'd like us to answer? We'll take them all.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","You can pick one, Len.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, first of all, as formulary access, we've always stated and Bob has stated that the company believes what's best in this field for patients is that patients and doctors have a choice, and they are the ones who make the decision. And so, that's where we'd like to see things turn out. How things actually turn out and the size of rebates, et cetera, et cetera, is not something that we can predict or speculate or comment on at this time. If Bob wants to comment on the EYLEA gaining share or, go ahead Bob.","Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President, Commercial","So obviously, we've been encouraged by the growth that we've seen, especially in DME with market share. Physicians have been very pleased with the outcomes of the independent Protocol T study which compared the three available products for DME in the marketplace, and have adopted EYLEA very rapidly there. To project where things are going to go in the future, Ying, I can't do that for you. So, we'll have to see how the market plays out.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Schwartz of Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.","Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much. You have two very large Phase II studies looking at PDGF and ANG2 in combination with EYLEA. So I was wondering if you could talk about how you're thinking about positioning the \u2013 or alternatively \u2013 are you looking to select one of these programs versus the other to take it to Phase III?","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I'm sure this is going to be a data-driven decision, and we'll see what we get. George, you have anything further to add on that?","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","Well, just as Len said, we let the data speak and help us guide our decision, so we can't predict how it will work out.","Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Partners LLC","Does it make sense to target any different solutions (34:50) with ANG2 versus PDGF?","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","We'll see.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","In terms of PDGF, as you probably know, it's not appropriate for use in diabetic macular edema. So certainly, the ANG2 has a broader potential application.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","But at the end of the day, we have to look at the data and we don't have it yet.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Next question?","Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. First, just on Praluent, can you comment at all of the prescriptions that have been submitted, what percent you'd expect to get filled? Or maybe to ask another way, what percentage meet the label criteria? And then just the second one is on the antibody for FOP. Just wondering what's gating to moving that into human and if we could see proof of concept data next year. Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, I don't think we can get into the details \u2013 I'm not even sure we have all the details at that level of granularity. In this competitive environment, we probably can't even share them. Sorry about that, Terence. In terms of FOP, George, any feeling when we might be able to get that into patients?","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","Yeah. I mean, certainly, we're moving it along. And I think, as with any complex setting like this in a rare disease, it's going to be \u2013 we're going to have to deal with the complexities of dealing with the patient population and also try and design the right clinical study where it's not clear that all the right endpoints and approaches have been defined to date. So, it's a complex problem, but we do think that there's a lot of reason for hope here. And we hope to do our best to bring the \u2013 to develop this in the right way and see if we can really make a difference in these patients' lives.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Great. And the next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Just a question on Praluent. I wanted to clarify exactly the range of outcomes around this ODYSSEY outcomes interim look. I think this is the first time I think I've heard you guys overtly talk about this interim look in 2016. Last time, I think I heard you guys talk about it, you were saying that the DSMB would be taking this look and you'd be blinded. Can you maybe talk about if there's a chance that there could more detail? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","George, do you want to take that?","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","Well, let me ask my man, Aberman here. Are we allowed to disclose the details on this?","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Yeah. There was a publication where these details were spelled out.","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","All right. Thank you.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","So, if people want to look at that, they can. But I wouldn't \u2013 not everything \u2013 but yes.","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","Okay. All right. So as you all know, this is an event-driven trial and it all depends on when the events actually occur and that's not entirely predictable. But the interim analyses are gated to occur when 50% of the events have occurred. That initial analysis will be an interim analysis by the Data Safety Monitoring Board for futility. And then when 75% of the events have occurred, there will be a second interim analysis for both futility and overwhelming efficacy.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I don't think that we'll be expecting to get anything, any information that we can relay other than if something has been met and we get that information. Beyond that, these things sort of occur out of our sphere of influence and information. They just go on by the DSMB.","Okay. Next question, Mike?","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Yeah. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adnan Butt of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Adnan S. Butt - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone. So, first on Praluent. One of the payers did not offer exclusivity. Could other payers take a similar approach, or could exclusivity still exist for others? And then on 2170, the combo PDGFR and EYLEA. Either Leonard or George, what kind of a benefit do you think would be of interest to clinicians over EYLEA alone?","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, on the first question, I don't think there's any real correlation between what one payer does versus what another payer could or might do. Obviously, we continue to feel that patient and physician choice is the best way to go and we'd like to see all or most of the market, if possible, go in that direction.","As far as what the patients \u2013 what doctors would like to see in any of these combination trials, it's always the two things; which is the potential for better efficacy or a longer duration of action with potentially less injections. George, anything to add to that?","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","Yes. I do think that it's important to point out that, I mean, obviously, safety here will be key because of the longstanding experience with EYLEA in this space. And so I think that that will be the first thing people, physicians should not want to be endangering their patients' lives for a little bit of benefit.","But if there is a benefit in the setting of good safety, I think it's important to point out that I think any benefit should be of interest to physicians, particularly because, in our approach, we will be providing both agents in a single intra-vigial (40:15) approach. So, for example, if physicians had to think about giving a second injection to gain just a little bit of efficacy, that would take maybe, a lot more thinking. But the fact that it's all provided in a single intra-vigial (40:29) injection, assuming that the safety is good, you would think that any benefit would then be adopted by the physicians and their patients.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Great. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is now open.","Matthew Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for taking the picture \u2013 for taking the questions \u2013 and congrats on a nice quarter here again. George, big picture of question for you on how you think about the opportunities you have with your bispecifics, as it relates to other technologies out there like cellular therapies, CAR T, et cetera. CAR T has shown some pretty profound efficacy in some smaller studies, selective indications, but bispecifics, of course, have potential benefits on logistics, convenience, potential safety advantages, et cetera. But I guess when I think about cancer therapy, I always think about efficacy being paramount. So, can you talk about what you'd like to see from your bispecific programs, whether or not you think a similar level of efficacy is potentially achievable with bispecifics versus CAR T, and if not, whether or not the other advantages are sufficient to be important to patients. Thanks.","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","Yeah. We agree with you. I mean, our goal is to have our bispecific program essentially achieve the sort of efficacies that one can imagine by genetically engineering the T cells themselves but also producing, and as you said, a logistically much more reasonable way, for more widespread utilization by physicians and patients.","So, yeah, our target, our goal, and the science that's backing it up, is hoping that we are going to be achieving those levels of efficacy. It may not be an immediate \u2013 there may have to be combinations of bispecifics and so forth \u2013 but that is, indeed, the goal.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Just to add one of the things that George, I think, has talked about publicly about this, is that bispecifics do add the advantage of better ability \u2013 not just convenience and logistics, but dose titration. George, maybe you want to comment on that?","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","Yeah. That's also an important point in that, as we've seen with the CAR T cells, one will be able to, for example, slowly dial up the bispecific level to get more gradual kill, which could result in much better safety and efficacy in the patients. And also, in settings where one might want to withdraw treatment, either temporarily or permanently, you have those opportunities as well.","So, as Len said, there is the possibility \u2013 and there's also the possibility of mixing and matching the right bispecifics, that one could get actually even better efficacy and improved safety and so forth. But of course, it's going to be a long process. There's going to be a lot of work to be done, and there's a lot of unknowns here. But we have a lot of potential here, we feel.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And of course, building the whole pipeline of immuno-oncology under one program allows us, I guess, George, to do combinations which...","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","Yeah. I think that that's the one thing that we are, perhaps, the most excited about is \u2013 it's not clear to me if anybody else has the toolkit \u2013 has built a toolkit over the years that we have here. And that we have here, in ways which are more easily, perhaps, matched and tested. So, that's one of the reasons we also have a lot of excitement about this program.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Operator, next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison, Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. I just wanted to go back to EYLEA and some of the potential headwinds that you guys had mentioned for the fourth quarter, and just make sure that we understood what you were trying to say. If you look at your guidance, obviously, at the high end of the range, there's some sequential growth, and at the sort of midpoint, it actually goes negative quarter-over-quarter. I'm just wondering, are you expecting a lot of inventory? Do you view your guidance as conservative? Or do you just think the seasonality that you've seen in years past, and you're sort of baking that into the number? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, we're trying to give the best guidance we can give based on the information we have, and while we've always said to you (44:58) that looking into the future is not necessarily the most productive thing one can do, but we do our best. And the fact is \u2013 Bob, you want to comment that you took into account?","Robert E. Landry - Senior Vice President-Finance & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think historically, if you look even last year, when we had rapid growth occurring in diabetic macular edema, fourth quarter over third quarter growth did slow down. And it's related to a seasonality we see. We do see some inventory adjustments many times. We also have the holidays. And it's not just, for example, a Thanksgiving or a Christmas, it's the days preceding and the days following, where a number of the patients just don't want to go to the doctor's office around the holidays. So we see less visits and less injections.","Len calls me the weatherman. I can't project what's going to happen with the weather, but we do have to take into account that the fourth quarter often does have storms, which also does impact office visits. So, that's why our guidance is the way it is; some growth on the high end, and some loss on the low end.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Great. And next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Phil M. Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the progress. First, one clarifying question. On your guidance for the interim analysis for Praluent in 2016, is that specifically referring to the first interim? And, when do you expect to see the second interim at 75% of events? And then second, on the scripts for Praluent. I know you said that they're not accurate. Your competitor, Amgen, is saying that, in their opinion, their scripts are becoming increasingly more accurate. Is the difference between you based on your sampling program specifically? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. As far as the interim analyses, this is speculation, because it's not based on enrollment or time. It's based on the number of events. We think there's a good possibility that we could see both analyses during 2016, based on the event rate that we've seen. The first one is, George mentioned, would be for futility, and the second one would be for futility and overwhelming efficacy.","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","And remember, you don't know what to root for because, if the drug works really well, you'll actually accrue events at a lower rate, so it's complicated.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Anyway, as far as \u2013 I don't think we have anything further to add on the Praluent story, Bob, unless you have any...?","Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President, Commercial","I would caution you, if you look at the IMS prescription data, the numbers are very, very small right now. Both companies are offering samples and have bridge programs for patients who don't yet have insurance coverage, to allow patients to get access to the product while we're working with the payers to achieve coverage. So, it's hard \u2013 I wouldn't project anything off samples at this \u2013 or off RXs at this time.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And just remember, for example, as Bob mentioned I think in his remarks, that Medicare can take up to six months. And many of our \u2013 since one of our main indications is for people who have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and insufficient lowering, with current therapies, of their LDL, many \u2013 since they have disease, many of these people are elderly, are Medicare, and they may not get coverage for six months, which would put us into the early part of next year.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Mark Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for taking the question. And Lenny, just for the record, I thought this was fantastic, absolutely fantastic quarter. And I thought, for my question, I would just back up a little bit. And as one of the longest serving CEOs in big-cap biotech and big-cap pharma and small-cap biotech for that matter, just wondering if you could share some wisdom about what we're all hearing right now around drug pricing? And I think coming from the platform of Regeneron to opine on this is powerful because you're developing specialty medicines, primary care medicines, biologics across all different disease types including ultra-orphan, as well as things like obviously the PCSK9 canine antibody.","So, what do you think is happening right now? Do you think the current price points of drugs are sustainable? Do you think the rate of inflation's got to decline? What's your sort of \u2013 what are your sort of thoughts on that, Len? Thank you.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. This is probably more than a 30 second comment. There's a lot of...","Mark Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","I've got till 4:00 PM booked. So...","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, we can take it offline because I do have a lot of thoughts on the subject of drug pricing. I am a big believer that we need pricing power in this industry. Pricing power comes from patents. I like to say, remember what President Lincoln said is, that patents add the fuel of interest to the fire of genius. And I think that basically translated into modern terms, capital being the fuel that fires things up here, capital is agnostic. And it will only go where we can get a good return. So, if we want innovation, we want new drugs, we have to figure out ways to make sure that it's attractive for investors, and that means to be able to reasonably price.","On the other hand, to some respect, the pharmaceutical industry, maybe might say the biopharmaceutical industry, is reviled for lots of different reasons and is attacked from many different quarters, including some from my next door neighbor in town, Secretary Clinton, and sometimes for very good reason. There have been some scandalous things that are done in the industry. You read them about every day, and it's no surprise if you couple that with high prices that people get very disgusted with the industry.","On the other hand, as I said, if you're an innovative company such as \u2013 that we are \u2013 innovation needs to be rewarded but you have to do it in a way where you create value for patients in the healthcare system.","So, Mark I would like to just go back to \u2013 I'd like to say that we have a lot we can say on that issue \u2013 but I prefer changing the subject back to what I thought I heard you say which is we had a fantastic quarter, which is nice of you to say that.","Next question.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Thank you. Next question operator.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lyn Boyton (52:04) of Guggenheim. Your line is now open.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think we lost that question.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Why don't we go to the next person?","Operator","All right. Our next question comes from the line of John Newman of Canaccord.","John Newman - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question and my congrats on the quarter even if it's not \u2013 I suppose \u2013 as enthusiastic as Mark's, but great numbers. So, my question is a general question on Praluent. I'm just wondering, how do you think long-term about the compliance on the product? Because even with oral drugs, sometimes, unfortunately, patients don't take their medication but given the dosing interval for Praluent, I'm just curious when you think about the drug internally, what do you think about in terms of kind of the ranges of compliance that (52:57)?","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, compliance for a drug that is preventative for a silent killer can be very difficult because people for lots of reasons don't want to think or admit that they have problems that need to be treated. They feel fine. Why do I have to take these medicines, et cetera, et cetera? In terms of specifically compliance for Praluent, the only thing \u2013 the only data that we have because it's too early to tell from the commercial world yet \u2013 the only data we have is from our clinical trials where, I believe, and Bob or George can correct me if I'm wrong, that the compliance for the injections was extremely high, even higher perhaps than for the concomitant statin therapy that people were on.","Robert J. Terifay - Senior Vice President, Commercial","That is the situation with the clinical program. One thing I would say is that Praluent is an injectable specialty product. The nice thing about that is we have to refill the prescription by mail on a monthly basis to the patient. So, we have an opportunity to encourage patient adherence with the product on a monthly basis, actually with outbound calls or if the patient wants a text message or however. So, I do hope that with the constant contact with the patients, we will be able to add to the adherence. I will also say that at least from the clinical program, the safety profile for Praluent was very good so the patients were not feeling bad on the product which should also help with adherence.","George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. - Founding Scientist; President, Regeneron Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer","And I think it should also be pointed out that paradoxically, one should realize that there may be advantages vis-\u00e0-vis compliance with long-acting antibody drugs because if you're late by a day or even a week or longer with the dose, it's not like skipping even a day or let alone a week with one of these small molecule drugs where you completely lose your efficacy, because these are such long-acting drugs. So, I think that in terms of the biological effects and the ability, not that we would encourage it, but being late or even missing a dose, you can still retain long-term biological effects. And I think that that's \u2013 those sorts of effects of missing doses of short-acting drugs, obviously, that's been demonstrated in other fields such as in the hypertension field and so forth \u2013 so I think that that's something to consider as a major advantage for long-acting biologicals.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Operator, another question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. It sounds like from Bob's comments in the prepared remarks that 2016 will be a big investment year. And I know you guys aren't a position to give guidance for next year, but I was hoping to maybe in broader brush strokes to get a sense as to what some of the bigger variables were as you look to next year? Thanks.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Geoff. I think, if you go back over to transcript, what Bob referred to and what I was trying to direct you towards, is that we have a lot of investment related to the launch of Praluent. We have investment related to the ongoing ODYSSEY trials where we split 20%. In dupilumab, if in the early part of the year, if the Phase III are positive, we'll start picking up 20% of the expenses in the entire Phase III program for both atopic dermatitis as well as in asthma. And also, we'll be picking up prelaunch expenses for dupilumab. We also have some unpartnered assets in NGF and RSV and we also have the launch of sarilumab.","So, those sorts of pipeline events, we think these are great investment opportunities because we think of the potential \u2013 if you think about the potential, for example, of dupilumab, we think that's a very high-potential product \u2013 and the rest of the pipeline has high potential. So, we have to make these investments. But clearly, we will be making them next year.","Bob, did you want to add anything?","Robert E. Landry - Senior Vice President-Finance & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So, just to punctuate what Len said, I mean, again, it's the convergence of a lot of things, as Len kind of listed verbally and again, what's in our transcript all kind of coming to ahead in 2016. And again, it's also important that we've talked about the migration of our late stage antibodies, offshore. And again, a lot of our expenses related to these things will be taken in tax jurisdictions that are going to be lower than the federal statutory tax rates. So that will also have an impact with regards to ETR and cash tax rates. So again, it's all of these things together, all for \u2013 as a good story type message.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Operator, we have time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you for squeezing me in here. I wanted to ask more broadly on Praluent. Now that you've had three months on the market, are you able to gather and share any real-world feedback on the key aspects of Praluent's profile that's really resonating most with physicians? Or maybe said in other way, are there any early points of pushback aside from gaining broader coverage? Thanks a lot.","Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I mean, I think, Bob has said in his talk and what's important to emphasize is that we have a low dose option and that's the recommended starting dose. And what we're seeing in our prescriptions is 90% of docs are opting for that recommended low 75-milligram starting dose, so we think that's resonating with physicians. Beyond that, I think it will kind of much further to say, it's too early.","Michael Aberman, M.D. - Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations","Thank you, everybody, for joining. Operator, this will be the conclusion of our call. And again, if you have any follow-up questions, please e-mail myself, Manisha, Colleen (59:00), on the IR team and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. That does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone."]}}
