And welcome to The Interpublic Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All parties are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. [Operator Instructions]","Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce, Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jerry Leshne","Good morning. Thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com, and we\u2019ll refer to both in the course of this call.","This morning we are joined by Michael Roth; and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 Eastern.","During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company. These are subject to the uncertainties and the cautionary statement that are included in our earnings release and the slide presentation, and are further details in our 10-K and other filings with the SEC.","We will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful, supplemental data, that while not a substitute for GAAP measures, allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance.","At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Jerry. And thank you all for joining us this morning as we review our results for the fourth quarter 2014. As usual, I\u2019ll start out by covering the highlights of our performance. Frank, will then provide additional detail and I\u2019ll conclude with an update on our agencies to be followed by our Q&A.","We are very pleased to report strong performance for both fourth quarter and full year. Among the financial highlights, organic revenue growth was 4.8% in the quarter, which brought our organic growth to 2.5% for the full year.","Operating margin in the quarter was 19.6% and for the full year increased 120 basis points to 10.5%. As a result, operating profit increased 12% in Q4 and grew 20% for the full year.","Fourth quarter earnings per share was $0.73 and was $0.57 adjusted for net tax benefit in the quarter. Full year earnings per share were $1.12 and were $0.98 as adjusted for discrete items that Frank will cover in detail. That represents an increase of 26% from comparable 2013 earnings of $0.78 per share.","It's clear from these early positive results that are people outperformed the financial targets we set for 2014. Our colleagues can take pride in this accomplishment. We thank them and all the talent dedicated and for the great work that they do every day on behalf of our clients.","Turning to more color on the fourth quarter, revenue growth was 4%, which consisted of a 4.8% organic increase and another 1.5% due to acquisitions, while currency was a negative 2.3%.","We grew in all our major markets with the exception of Continental Europe. The U.S., China, India and Brazil were important markets in which we saw notable strong performance.","U.S. organic growth was 3.4%, excluding a decrease in pass-through revenues that is offset with lower expenses U.S. organic growth was very strong at 5% in the quarter. Organic growth was 5.4% in the U.K. and double digits in Asia-PAC, LatAm and our other markets group. Continental Europe decreased 4.1% organically in the quarter.","Our growth reflects contributions from all major disciplines, including advertising, public relations and media. We had especially strong performance from the digital services we have embedded across the portfolio. This strategy of nurturing native digital expertise and capabilities within all our units is something we've been working at for some time and which differentiates us from some of our peers.","In terms of the specific agencies contributing to our Q4 performance, a wide range of the portfolio was represented. That list was led by McCann, FCB, Lowe and Partners, Mediabrands, HUGE, R\/GA, Weber Shandwick, Golin, Octagon and FutureBrand. The top performing client sectors in Q4 were healthcare, food and beverage and retail.","Another highlight of the quarter was that we continue to build in our new -- build on our new business record for the year. We were pleased to add important assignments from Sprint, Grupo Bimbo, Sherwin-Williams and Reckitt Benckiser among others. As a result, our net new business was positive in the quarter and for the full year.","Turning to operating expenses and margin, underneath total revenue growth of 4% in the quarter, total operating expenses increased 2.1%, excluding last year's fourth quarter charge for restructuring. The result was Q4 operating margin expansion of 150 basis points.","Full year operating margin was 10.5%, an increase of 120 basis points, reflecting leverage on both our base payroll and on O&G expenses.","In Q4, we repurchased 7 million shares using $127 million. For the full year we utilized $275 million for the repurchase of 15 million shares and our average share count eligible for dilution decreased 4%, compared to 2013.","This initiating our return of capital programs in 2011. We returned a total of $2 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. Over this period of time, we have reduced our outstanding shares by 25%.","We are additionally pleased to announce this morning that the actions of the Board raising our quarterly dividend by 26% to $0.12 per share and authorizing an additional $300 million for share repurchase. With $144 million remaining on our existing authorization as of the year end, this brings us to a total of 444 million authorized share repurchase.","In sum, the competitiveness of our agencies and a high quality of our offerings continue to drive strong performance. The accomplishments of our agencies and our talent are also being increasingly recognized and awarded by our industry.","As we enter 2015, you can see in our report today that the overall tone of business remains solid in most markets around the world, including the U.S., the U.K. and several of the larger high-growth markets. The dynamic shifts we are witnessing in the media landscape also represent an opportunity for us and our industry.","Given these factors and the strength of our offerings, we believe we\u2019ll continue to see solid organic growth. There are two key factors that temper our outlook compared to last year and therefore need to be called out. First is a volatile currency environment and its possible negative effect on client spending plans. Second, we have to consider those markets with continued macro headwinds, notably Europe.","In light of this environment, for 2015, we\u2019re targeting 3% to 4% organic growth. Our acquisitions to date should add another 50 basis points to our growth and the currency impact to our topline as well as to our operating expenses at current FX rates is expected to be approximately negative 4% for the year.","In line with this growth target and in order to build on the strong progress we made during 2014 in improving profitability, our 2015 target is 80 to 100 basis points of operating margin expansion. As in the past as the year unfolds and we get more clarity around the macro issues that are creating uncertainty, we will review our perspective and report back to you during our regular calls.","We will, of course, continue to focus on the execution of our strategy, which is built on world-class creativity and digital expertise, strength in emerging markets, and our increased focus on and success in delivering customized integrated solutions combined as always with discipline and costs.","At this stage, I'll turn the things over to Frank for additional detail on our results.","Frank Mergenthaler","Good morning. As a reminder, I\u2019ll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. On slide two, you'll see our results. Fourth quarter organic growth was 4.8%, U.S. organic growth was 3.4% and International growth was 6.4%, with growth in all regions except Continental Europe. Q4 operating profit was $433 million compared with $385 million a year ago before last year\u2019s structuring charge.","Operating profit increased 20% for the full year. Full year operating margin was 10.5%, an improvement of 120 basis points from a year ago. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.73 and $0.50 per share, excluding certain discrete tax items. For the full year, diluted EPS was a $1.12 per share and $0.98 per share excluding both the positive $0.16 per share impact of the Q4 tax items and the negative $0.02 per share impact of our charge in the second quarter for the early redemption of our 6.25% notes. This is an increase of 26% from 2013 earnings per share of $0.78.","We used 275 million of share repurchase during the year. Our board this morning once again significantly increased our common share dividend to $0.12 per share quarterly and added $300 million to our share repurchase authorization.","Turning to slide three, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail on the slides that follow, as well as a couple of slides to clarify non-operating adjustments.","Turning to revenue on slide four. Fourth quarter revenue was $2.21 billion, an increase of 4% compared to Q4 \u201813. The impact of the change in exchange rates was a negative 230 basis points and that acquisitions added 150 basis points. Resulting organic revenue increase was 4.8%.","With the U.S. dollar continue to strengthen against most currencies, it's worth pointing out that revenues and expenses of our businesses are variable matched in functional terms. For the full year, revenue growth of 5.8% consisted of 5.5% organic growth and 130 basis points from net acquisitions while currency was a negative 1%. It's worth noting that our pass-through revenue decreased approximately $30 million compared to 2013, which is offset by $30 million decrease in our O&G expense.","As you can see on the bottom half of the slide, growth in the fourth quarter was mainly at our Integrated Agency Networks segment, which had 5.7% organic growth. The decrease in pass-through revenue weighed on reported growth at CMG, which grew 3.2% organically, excluding net effect led by public relations and high single-digit growth in sports marketing. On the right hand side of the slide, you\u2019ll see that both segments had very good growth rates for the full year with 5.5% organic growth at IAN and 5.8% organic growth at CMG.","Moving on to slide five, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q4 organic growth was 3.4% on top of 6.9% a year ago. Organic growth was approximately 5%, excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenues, which again are offset with lower expenses. We had strong domestic fourth-quarter performance in our three global integrated networks, McCann, FCB and Lowe as well as at HUGE and Mediabrands.","Healthcare continue to be a leading client growth sector followed by food and beverage. For the full year, U.S. organic growth was 4.7% and 5.8% excluding the impact of pass-throughs with increases across all major disciplines in nearly all agencies. Leading client sectors were once again healthcare and food and beverage, as well as auto and transportation and financial services.","Turning to the international markets, U.K. grew 5.4% organically in Q4 and 10.6% for the full year. We had contributions from all of our agencies. Total revenue growth in U.K. was 21%, which includes organic plus 5% from our acquisitions such as FCB Inferno and Profero and another 5% attributable to the strength of the pound during the year.","In Continental Europe, the environment continue to be challenging. Our organic decrease in the quarter was 4.1% and included decreases in Germany, France and Italy. For the full year, revenue decreased 1.3% on an organic basis, slightly lower than the assumptions we factored into our planning as we enter 2014. Including our acquisitions, revenue in the region increased 1.2% of excluding currency.","In Asia-Pac, our largest international region, organic revenue growth was 12.8% in Q4. That was driven by double-digit increase in Australia, India and Singapore, as well as strong results from China. Mediabrands\u2019 public relations, McCann and R\/GA led our growth and these same agencies led our 8% organic growth in the region for the full year. For the year, we had double-digit growth in Australia, China, Singapore and Korea with more modest increase in India. ","In LatAm, we increased 11% organically in the quarter with double-digit growth in Brazil and Argentina. We had growth across all of our agencies, including our marketing services offerings, our digital specialists, McCann, FCB and our media business.","Full year growth was strong at 10.8%, on top of 10% a year ago. In our other markets group, which is made up of Canada, the Middle East and Africa, organic growth was 11.7% in the quarter, driven by organic increase in the Middle East and South Africa. On slide six, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 5.5%, corresponding to calendar year 2014.","Moving onto slide seven, our operating expenses, in the fourth quarter, total operating expenses increased 2.1%, compared to 4% revenue growth. For the full year, operating expenses increased 4.4%, compared to total revenue growth of 5.8%.","Our ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue for the full year was 64%, compared to 63.8% in the prior year. It's important to point out that the decrease in pass-through revenue, which is offset dollar-for-dollar and loan, O&G expense results in some deleveraging in SRS and some leveraging of our O&G while resulted in no impact to the operating profit.","For the full year, our ratio of base payroll benefits and tax expense to revenue was 52.6%, compared with 52.9% in the year go, which has improved 30 basis points and improved 50 basis points excluding the change in pass-through revenue. Expense for temporary labor was 3.8% of revenue for the full year in 2014, compared to 3.6% a year ago.","Severance expense was 0.9% of revenue in 2014, compared with 1.1% in the prior year. Incentive expense was 3.5% of revenue for the full year 2014, reflecting higher performance-based accruals compared to a year ago, due to this year\u2019s strong performance.","Our other salaries and related category was 3.2% of revenue, which is the same level as the prior year. At year-end, our total headcount was approximately 47,400, an increase of 4.4%, which is made up of 2% from acquisitions and 2.4% from organic hiring. The increases were in higher growth areas of the portfolio, which last year included McCann, public relations and digital, as well as growth regions of the world and in support of a number of major new business wins.","Turning to office and general expenses on the lower half of the slide, O&G expense was 23% of Q4 revenue, compared with 25.3% in Q4 \u201813. For the full year compared to our revenue growth of 5.8%, total O&G expense increased only 50 basis points. We had leverage across all of our O&G categories.","For the full year, we have 40 basis points of leverage on occupancy expense, 20 basis points on telecom, office supplies and travel and 20 basis points on professional fees. In addition, we had 50 basis points of leverage in our category of all other O&G expense, as pass-through expenses decreased from a year ago along with the related revenues. These expenses are mainly in our events and direct marketing disciplines.","On slide eight, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. As the chart reflects with the most recent data point at 10.5%, we have come a long way. While pleased to achieve double-digit operating margin, we know there is still much work to be done. We therefore remain highly focused on attaining our goal of competitive 13% operating margins.","Slide nine, for clarity, on our year end comparison, we have provided more detail on the level line adjustments in the quarter. This is the impact of our net tax benefit this year along with the impact of the charge we took in Q4 \u201813. This year, we had a net reversal valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in Europe. The net amount was $68 million, which is a positive to reported earnings in the quarter and the year.","There were two primary drivers, both of which were non-cash items. We reversed a previously established valuation allowance of $125 million due to our business tax planning actions. That benefit was partially offset by the establishment of the $57 million tax valuation allowance in other European market due to our operating history.","The EPS benefit was $0.16 per share in the fourth quarter. Excluding these discrete items in the fourth quarter as you can see on the slide, our effective Q4 tax rate was 37.1% compared to 30.1% in Q4 \u201813.","Slide 10 addresses the full year comparison. This picks up the impact of our second quarter charge for debt redemption as well as Q4 items. As you can see, adjust for those items, our effective tax rate for the year was 39.4%, which is in line with our indications earlier this year. In 2013, the full year includes the charge for debt redemption. Our comparable 2013 adjusted tax rate was 36.2%.","In sum, the adjusted EPS comparison was $0.98 per share this year and $0.78 per share in 2013. And while there was clearly volatility around our effective tax rate, it's worth noting that our cash tax rate was again significantly lower. These adjustments also makes clear the impact of our share repurchase with average diluted shares outstanding decreasing 4% from a year ago to $425 million.","Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on slide 11, we ended the year with $1.67 billion of cash and short-term workable securities, which compared with $1.64 billion a year ago. We\u2019ve returned more than $430 million to shareholders during the year through share repurchases and common stock dividends.","On slide 12, we turn to cash flow. Cash from operations in Q4 was $1.05 billion, compared with $1.02 billion a year go. The comparison includes the seasonally strong contribution working capital. Our business tends to generate significant cash working capital in the fourth quarter and uses cash from working capital in the first quarter.","For the full year, cash from operations was $670 million, compared with $593 million in 2013. Investing activities in Q4 used $59 million, mainly for capital expenditures. For the full year, CapEx was $149 million, while net cash used in acquisitions was $68 million. Our M&A pipeline continues to be strong. While timing can shift between periods, we continue to target $150 million to $200 million annually.","Financing activities used $169 million in Q4, mainly $127 million for the purchase of our common stock and $39 million in common stock dividends. For the full year, our financing activities used $344 million. That reflects $275 million to repurchase common stock and $159 million for dividends and our common shares, as well as lower bank borrowings.","Additionally, we issued new debt that was partially offset by debt redemption. In 2014, our net increase in cash and marketable securities for the full year was $25 million. On slide 13, we show our debt decreasing from $2.35 billion in 2007 to $1.73 billion at the end of 2014. In the second quarter of 2014, we issued $500 million of new 10-year notes at 4.2% and redeemed our 6.25%, $350 million notes.","Slide 14 shows the total of our average basic plus diluted shares over the last few years. And in far right shows the total as of year-end 2014. This has been an area of strong progress for us, with our average total shares decreasing approximately 25% between 2010 and 2014. Our starting position for 2014 is $480 million on the right.","In summary on slide 15, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and the year. Our team has executed very well with respect to supporting strong revenue growth while maintaining expense discipline and our balance sheet continues to be a source of value creation, as evident in the key actions taken by our Board today. That leaves us well-positioned entering 2015.","With that, I will turn it back to Michael.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Frank. Well, as you can see from our results, 2014 was a very successful year, in which we saw significant accomplishments in terms of performance in the marketplace and our financial results. We further strengthened our capital structure and built on our capital return programs, while continuing to enhance the competitiveness of our offerings, with particular emphasis on digital and creative talent and capabilities. Importantly, we also expanded operating margin by 120 basis points.","Highlights of our performance included solid progress at both McCann and FCB, further market share growth at our best-in-class PR and sports marketing agencies within CMG and strong financial performance from our media operations. We also continue to see dynamic growth from our digital specialist agencies and within the embedded digital capabilities across the portfolio. We posted strong performance in emerging international markets, particularly in Asia and Latin America on top of outstanding growth in recent years.","The competitiveness of our agencies was reflected in a very strong new business performance for the year. I believe it's fair to say that the quality of our offerings is at its highest level in at least a decade. During 2014, this was evident in the recognition we've received across the portfolio in the form of awards from industry press as well as our performance in the most important creative and effectiveness competitions in every marketing discipline. We once again excelled in Cane, where McCann kept up its strong momentum. FCB posted its best ever performance and Lowe also showed well.","We also performed strongly at FP award shows around the world. More recently, IPG agencies enjoyed the strongest showing of any holding company in the prestigious A-List by Advertising Age. R\/GA was a number one ranked agency in 2014, and it became the first digital agency to ever top the A-List. Deutsch and Weber Shandwick were also named among the industry's top four agencies in terms of innovation, quality of work, and success with clients and new business. Huge and Mullen were sighted on the list of agencies standouts just outside the Top 10, as was Lowe India among international shops and Harris Diamond, the CEO of McCann was named Advertising Executive of the Year.","Across the range of our agencies, we\u2019re seeing good progress in terms of talent and the quality of work product. 2014 was a strong year for McCann, which saw a range of client wins, including additional fourth quarter assignments from Reckitt Benckiser, State Street Global Advisors and an integrated win on OppenheimerFunds led by MRM. This came on the heels of integrated McCann wins on Choice Hotels, also with MRM and Office Depot working closely with UM.","FCB continues to improve performance, attract new talent, and grow and standing with clients such as Nestl\u00e9, which awarded them new assignments from their waters and health and wellness divisions, as well as Bacardi in China. The recent Michelob Ultra win was evidence of increased vitality on their success.","At Lowe, we are pleased with the integration of Profero and with fourth quarter wins of R\u00e9my Martin and the CFA Institute to build on the additions of Lenovo and Fiat early in 2014.","We continue to look for ways to bolster the agencies presence in the U.S. which is fundamental to sourcing large multi-national for the global network. The agencies capability as a creative powerhouse with expertise in emerging markets remained evident in a very strong relationship that continues to enjoy with new lever.","Progress continued at CMG led by the outstanding team at Weber Shandwick. The evolution of that agency into a digital and strategic leader across all disciplined has been remarkable. Golin is filing a suite and the performance of Octagon reflects the shifts they are making to transform the passion points of sports and entertainment into powerful drivers of consumer engagement.","The integration of Genuine, a leading digital shop, acquired at midyear to Jack Morton is going well and we should see the benefits of that agency\u2019s capabilities going forward. Mediabrands posted strong financial results in the quarter and continue to deliver on full range, leading-edge traditional and digital capabilities, such as Cadreon and Reprise and Ansible, as well as strong specialist assets such as ORION Holdings, ID Media, and Out-of-Home Rapport.","Fourth quarter wins included true value at UM and bodes at Initiative. At a time of such dynamic change in terms of technology and media channels, the focus on the growth of programmatic platforms is understandable. Yet, we should not lose side effect that what we ultimately provide to marketers is a consultant service and insights. So the key will continue to be our impartiality and our ability to apply consumer data to our clients' real-time business challenges so as to maximize the impact of their investments.","I covered off the success we are seeing in R\/GA and MRM. Huge also had a very strong year and has established itself as one of the country's most innovative digital agencies. A full range of digital capabilities is also what sets apart Mullen and Deutsche, particularly in their LA office. With The Martin Agency and Hill Holliday, this gives us a strong portfolio of integrated agencies that are thriving and can win business on their own, as well as take part in our customized and multi-agency client solutions.","This focus on delivering open architecture solutions that integrate the best of our talent across the organization by means of customized client teams was once again contributed to our results. We won the largest consolidation in the industry during 2014, when we prevailed in a hotly contested Microsoft review. We also want a consolidation with one of Latin America's most important companies when we invested a number of our key competitors in the Grupo Bimbo pitch in Mexico. We saw many additional multi-agency opportunities coming to the group, domestically and internationally and we continue to improve our delivery of custom integrated solutions on a number of existing multinational clients.","Overall our performance in 2014 is a result of a series of long-term strategic decisions, which we back with significant investments over time. Talent acquisition and development, particularly in creative and strategic roles, as well as building digital expertise in all our agencies have been key drivers in the strong organic revenue performance we\u2019re seeing across the group. We've also continued to invest behind our strength in the U.S. and the major emerging markets where we have strong and growing presence.","During 2014, we saw further progress across a range of areas related to financial management of our company. First and foremost, significant improvements in profitability put us on track to achieving our goal of 13% operating margin. Our return of capital programs continue to positively impact results and we crossed the $2 billion threshold in terms of total return to shareholders since 2011.","We remain fully committed to further improving margins and building on our robust capital return programs. The latter is evident by our Board's actions today, which further increase our dividend by 26% and provided for a current authorization in access of $440 million to share repurchase.","We're well-positioned as we go into 2015. The value proposition of our portfolio of offerings is highly relevant in today's dynamic and complex consumer media landscape. Despite a range of geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions around the world, the general tone in the business remains solid.","We are therefore targeting the 3% to 4% organic growth for the year and improvement in operating margin between 80 and 100 basis points. Coupled with strong capital returns, we are confident that achieving these targets will allow us to build on a strong track record of enhancing shareholder value.","We thank you for your time and continued support and we look forward to updating you on our progress on the next call.","At this point, I\u2019ll open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we do have our first question in queue from Alexia Quadrani from JPMC. Your line is now open.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you. Just couple of questions, I guess, first with such impressive performance in 2014 would sounds like great contribution from just about all your major agencies. I guess, beyond more of the same, what\u2019s the incremental lever that will help you drive your margin targets for \u201915? I guess, what assumptions, perhaps for Continental Europe is sort of underlie that target you gave?","Michael Roth","Well, our assumption for Continental Europe continues to be -- we\u2019re not expecting a big recovery in Continental Europe. The fact that we were down in 2014 was a little bit below our plan. With the uncertainty out there, it\u2019s not wise for us to count on the big recovery there. So what we are refreshing our talent. We\u2019ve had made some changes in personnel in Continental Europe.","We did some acquisitions certainly with Inferno and Profero and a couple of smaller acquisitions and we continue to look to bolster our competitiveness there. But we\u2019re basically keeping eye in there without making any big bets in terms of a strong recovery in terms of our forecast for the rest of the year.","Our leverage in terms of approving, our margin continues to be focusing on our people, our creative products, our competitive offerings and obviously, converting that revenue into 30% target that we already said. It was nice to see in 2014, we converted it the 30% ratio.","So when you look at our assumptions in terms of 3% or 4%, that\u2019s how we come to the 80 to 100 basis point margin improvement for 2015. We\u2019re coming into the year 2015 with some tailwinds, because we were net new business positive in 2014 and of course, Alexia, I know you going to ask how we are doing so far. And for 2015 we continue to be net new business positive.","In terms of those tailwinds, I think you'll see the effect of those more in the first half of the year and in the second half of the year we'll see some cycling down absent to any new businesses wins in the meantime.","And so, I think, it's more focusing on our cost. We\u2019ve instituted the number of additional programs to make sure that our SRS ratios don't get out of line. I mean, clearly, that's where we see the biggest leverage.","We did see an improvement in base benefit, as Frank outlined in his discussion. We did have -- so we had a good performance so therefore incentives were up a bit and that accounted for some of the higher number on SRS ratio.","But we continue to be very careful in terms of how we add headcount and we're gaining efficiencies. We are -- for example, McCann, we have craft and we\u2019re using production facilities with greater efficiency on a worldwide basis. These went to greater margins for us in bringing those dollars. We keep them in-house as oppose to going out and we see a lot of that happening in our other agencies as well.","Alexia Quadrani","And Michael, just a follow-up if I can. You have a lot of insight having gone through the budgeting process or at least large part of it for 2015 recently. I guess, any further color you can provide us in terms of what the client are saying in terms of spending outlook, in terms of maybe allocation of spending for \u201915, anything incrementally different than \u201914 and maybe just an overall budget?","Michael Roth","Our budgets from a bottoms up perspective. So we look at existing AOR contracts. As the year progresses and as our clients begin to feel more comfortable that\u2019s when we start seeing some incremental spend, which frankly helps us in terms of higher-margin business.","The tone is solid. Is their concern? Of course there is. We\u2019re in a global business right now and there are affects of currency which affects -- potentially affects our business. That's why we tempered some of our assumptions going into 2015.","It's not the translation affect on our P&L that be tempered because we\u2019re match from a revenue and expense point of view. It\u2019s the tone of the affect of these currencies on our clients and they\u2019re spending and how that potentially converts to our business. But the tone of the business is solid.","Our clients are working with us in terms of our plans for the year. They're spending money. Some of the money is coming. I know one of the questions is always that how much of it is in TV versus digital.","We\u2019re seeing a tremendous focus on allocating media dollars and where it should go and our offerings in media brands are toned into doing exactly that in the use of Cadreon and the use of our tools and planning techniques real-time. We continue to invest in those because clients want to know whether it should be digital, whether it should be TV, how it should be allocated and can they change it quickly.","So we're working very closely with our clients and of course, programmatic and automation are part of that. So I think, the questions, whether it's digital versus TV, I think, we\u2019ve seen certainly an impact on TV if you just look at the result of the media owners in 2014 and the challenges they face in 2015. And our job continues to be to help our clients navigate through that.","So we have the tools. We have the talent. Our clients are talking to us. They're not pulling back per se. The issue is how much more they going to spend and the pressure is on us to be efficient and for us to be responsive in terms of moving the needle and that\u2019s what we\u2019re here to do. So we feel good about our forecast and I think, it's a realistic assumption for us to use going into 2015.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you very much.","Michael Roth","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Janedis from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Michael Roth","Hi, John.","John Janedis","Hi. Thank you. And maybe Michael, a bit of a follow-up to your comments earlier that you talked over the years about the O&G and the SRS line and I know there are a lot of puts and takes here. But is this the year where more of the margin leverage comes from the SRS line or should we start thinking about the expense buckets in the aggregate rather than the 60% SRS target that you have out there?","Michael Roth","Well, one of the reasons we called out the effect on O&G is because of CSAPR, financial organizations in all our units, our focusing on our debt or SRS ratios. Now, the good news is as we develop new business, we ramp up and that causes us to throw those ratios a little bit out of track. And frankly, that's not a bad thing to happen, okay.","If we\u2019re investing with new business, it\u2019s not atypical for us. When we win a new business to have to ramp up and add 50 to 100 people in terms of staffing and that staffing usually comes ahead of revenue. So there is timing issues in there. But the fundamental basic benefits, if you will, and tax, we saw 50 basis points improvement in 2014 and for \u201815 we will have to continue to be very careful with that. And yes, the answer is ultimately we have to get those SRS\u2019 numbers down and that\u2019s where our focus is going to be, John.","John Janedis","Okay. Thanks, Michael. Maybe just a follow-up on Europe to Alexia\u2019s question, to what extent is there an opportunity to further reduce cost or consolidate agencies if the business doesn\u2019t pick up?","Michael Roth","We are always looking at that. We always look at double doors. I think, what they say is, the low-hanging fruit in terms of our expenses, we took that big charge and I\u2019m pleased to report as Frank indicated. We realized the benefits that we said we are going to have as a result of the restructuring charge that we took. And we monitor that all the time.","In terms of consolidations, yeah, there are all possibilities for that. We are looking for efficiencies, but we have three global networks that are very competitive and on top of that our marketing disciplines in our media businesses and so on. And we are well positioned.","So there is a recovery in Europe. I think we will participate. Some of our pull back in Europe again was client specific. 11% of our business is in Continental Europe, that\u2019s good and bad depending on how you look at it. And so as a result, if one or two clients pull back, it has a bigger impact on our results and we saw that in 2014, which frankly one of the reasons we missed a little bit in terms of our planning process.","But we are well positioned, we continue to invest in Continental Europe in terms of talent and that\u2019s where we have to and we are looking for a good organic growth as the recovery comes back. But we\u2019re monitoring it and we will be looking at efficiencies whether it\u2019d be combining agency -- not agencies but combining couple of goal situations we are also looking at that.","John Janedis","Thanks a lot.","Michael Roth","Thank you, John.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Bank of RBC Capital. Your line is now open.","David Bank","Okay. Thanks very much. Michael, in your kind of closing comments, you made some reference to the importance that you felt, kind of independence in the programmatic world that you're pursuing programmatic. But on an agency basis as opposed to a principal, how has that resonated with clients? Have you sort of gotten feedback with respect to the way you guys are handling that business as opposed to your peers. And how do you think about the way it impacts you on a relative basis now, from a markets perspective in terms of ad -- in terms of organic growth and end margin, right? How does it fit into where you kind of view yourselves in the landscape there? Thanks very much.","Michael Roth","Thanks David. Obviously, we could spend hours on this.","David Bank","And that\u2019s we have.","Michael Roth","Look we continue to believe that our model of agnostic advice, in terms of, where client should be putting their money, it\u2019s the proper model, okay. I think there is no question that some of our competitors as you move to with take inventory position on your digital assets. And they are using right hand and left hand, and I think as these rolls out our clients are going to see the profits that are being made from inventory owned and we feel that that\u2019s inconsistent with our model of being independent, in terms of how we allocate media dollars on behalf of our clients.","Now we think the clients tell us that they prefer model obviously, yes. If you look at our performance, we had a great performance in the Mediabrands and that whole model isn\u2019t lost on our clients. I mean the reason there are clients among other things is exactly that. That they view us as being their partner in terms of advising where they put their money, I\u2019ve said this before and I continue to say if as this rolls out, if in the marketplace, it is not viewed as we view it, then obviously we are going to re-look at how we do this. We do it on the part of Orion and the barter business where it\u2019s disclosed upfront and we\u2019re seeing very nice margins on it.","But right now, our model is consistent and yes, I think larger multi-national clients, one of the reasons they bring some of this programmatic in-house is because they don't trust our business, not ours per se. I\u2019m saying speaking generically in terms of the transparency that goes into this pricing in this black box that they\u2019re dealing with. And I think the fact that there is inventory owned being sold doesn\u2019t help. I know they can disclose it and I know they argue that they are buying more efficiently and so on. But in terms of pricing, we don\u2019t see that we\u2019re being -- we don\u2019t do it and we are very competitive on the pricing side of the business.","So, we believe our role is to be agnostic and we do think our clients choose us. And that's why we stick to this model. And frankly when I was the client, I would look at it the same way. I find it difficult to saying that the role that they calm, they put up and the large margins that some of them claim they are getting on that isn\u2019t at the cost of advice that I'm getting on the buying side. So that\u2019s my personal view on it. But we continue to look at it. It\u2019s a reasonable question.","By the way, you are seeing the big ramp -- I might as well do this. You\u2019re seeing a big ramp up in terms of the organic growth and potentially some margin on this. As you cycle through that, that advantage isn\u2019t going to be there on reported numbers, right. And I do think the margin on that business is going to shrink because clients are just going to want greater transparency on it and that\u2019s where the margin impact will come down so.","David Bank","On sort of average, do you think it\u2019s a higher margin business when the core, kind of media buying business or is it, like on average, right, is it a higher margin business or not?","Michael Roth","I don\u2019t think so. I think some players -- again, it\u2019s on a buyer by basis, right. But I think, frankly, if you look at one of our competitors who just recently announced, I think they were alluding to not as big margins on it as everyone thinks, whereas one of our other competitors, clearly they're making a lot of money on this, which sort of builds to the issues with the transparency. So, I would say on average, it is certainly margin accretive. But I think over time it becomes less.","David Bank","Thanks very much, guys.","Michael Roth","Thank you, David.","David Bank","Nice end to the year","Michael Roth","Thank you.","Frank Mergenthaler","Thanks.","Operator","All right. Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Wieser from Pivotal Research. Sir, your line is now open.","Brian Wieser","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Can you talk about the ","current state of client pricing pressures and more specifically, the degree to which you marketers are trying to get like-for-like services through lower prices and then you make it up by selling additional services? Or alternately, do you feel like there are situations where you have pricing power than free services.","Michael Roth","It\u2019s always. Yes, the clients want more for less. Think that as a given.","Brian Wieser","All right. That\u2019s done.","Michael Roth","In 2014, it was true. It is going to be to be true in 2015. Yes, as we pick up clients and as we add more services, typically, the additional services carry with it a greater margin, that\u2019s the nature of our business. Which is why as you know Brian, when we pick up new clients, margins are new clients in the early years aren't quite where they are as they mature as we go forward and that\u2019s the business model. We bring in another service and we add value. But none of the services that we bring to the table are clients willing to pay extraordinary margins adds.","So the burden is on us to show values add. So when we bring in the extra services, it's all with a view towards moving the needle and how we enhance their margin and frankly at the same time it helps us. I think that pressure is there. It will continue to be there. It will be on the media side just evidenced by, as you know in your write-ups that the big client reviews typically are occurring on the media side of the business because they continue to believe this pricing advantage is by putting that stuff up for bids and review. And it\u2019s incumbent upon us to be able to buy appropriately, give advice, couple it with proper planning and be efficient in how we operate our own businesses and so that\u2019s never going way.","Brian Wieser","Thanks for that. And just maybe relatively, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about -- little more about trends impacting working capital. It was negative for you guys since you are not over the course of the whole year, not pronounced or anything. But it was interesting that two of your other peers had negative working capital for the first time in five years.","So, I was just wondering you may have a broader sense of what\u2019s been going on because it has been the positive contributor for you guys for last several years that it has been for some of the others. Do you get a sense that payment turns are getting tighter, or is there something else in an industry level that\u2019s been happening, just any thoughts on that?","Michael Roth","I\u2019ll let Frank add to it. It seems part of it has to do with the mix between media and traditional advertising and that affects our working capital. But I\u2019ll let frank talk about it.","Frank Mergenthaler","Yeah. The term question -- probably two years ago, there was more pressure than there is now. I think that kind of settled in because the industry kind of held the line. We are not a bank. And the key driver of working capital is around media primarily and where media billings are flowing. So, you can have flat revenue, but if you are seeing shifts out of certain markets where there is a working capital advantage that could adversely impact your working capital. There is nothing structural in our model that\u2019s changing.","Michael Roth","And it\u2019s difficult that in the fourth quarter we see positive than we see the first quarter as you know, it flows out. So, I think we had a good year, I think it was a typical year for us in how it came in and went out. And as Frank said, it has to do with the mix between media and traditional.","Brian Wieser","Got it. Thank you very much.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Brian.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Your line is now open.","Michael Roth","Good morning, Craig.","Craig Huber","Yeah. Hey. Good morning guys. A housekeeping question first, maybe I missed this. The currency -- what are you budgeting the currency impact of total revenues for the first quarter and for the full year that\u2019s my first question?","Michael Roth","For the full year, Brian, it\u2019s 4% and we are not going to close the first quarter.","Craig Huber","4% across the portfolio. Okay.","Frank Mergenthaler","Yeah. And that\u2019s using existing rates. Obviously, as that changes we\u2019ll have to adjust.","Craig Huber","Okay. And then my second question and I haven\u2019t asked you this question quite a while. You will be well aware of this. In the first quarter every year for the last 10-plus years dating back before you guys were even at the company. You guys always lose money on the operating profit line and obviously on the EPS line, which obviously has a major drag in the full year operating profit margins for the company.","And I'm just wondering, it seems like it\u2019s a really good opportunity for you guys to get this improved this in the first quarter in particular. I\u2019m just wondering, is there much more you can do here on the cost front to make it more variable in the first quarter to enhance that margin dramatically and\/or shift revenues in there -- or shift more revenues in there?","Frank Mergenthaler","It\u2019s not a cost issue, [Brian] [ph]. It\u2019s more of a seasonality of our revenue. Our folks are working on clients in the first quarter. Client contracts are being negotiated and resolved. We\u2019ve got just a natural deferral of certain revenues in the first quarter, that\u2019s our revenue recognition policy that we are not going to change.","Michael Roth","Yeah. And by the way, our staffing needs are not done. Our agencies when they come in with their budgets and their plans, they have a staffing requirement for the year. We tried to calendarize it obviously, but as Frank says, we can\u2019t control the revenue side of it in terms of win clients, because we are -- and it\u2019s crazy for us to do abnormal things to be in line for audit, which is why we gave -- we talked in terms of full year. The quarter -- the quarterly variances in our business are very hard to predict. I can tell you this much. I don\u2019t know what quarter it\u2019ll be, but there\u2019ll be surprises quarter from quarter because that\u2019s the nature of that business, which is why we talk on a full year basis.","Frank Mergenthaler","And it\u2019s 5000 clients in a 100 countries, Craig, so that to normalize that is very, very difficult.","Craig Huber","Yeah. I\u2019m just asking the question, because you always obviously talk of your goal of getting the 30% operating margin with Omnicom\u2019s level of margins and they generally run a 150 to 200 basis points lower in the first quarter than the full year operating margin. Obviously, your bet is much larger. So are you saying how you account for the revenue is significant different, that\u2019s why you end up having this loss in the first quarter? I am just trying to\u2026","Michael Roth","There is nothing structurally different in our business than Omnicom\u2019s right. So we are very comfortable that the 13% target is a reasonable target.","Frank Mergenthaler","And just let me restate, I think looking at our business on a quarter-to-quarter basis is a slippery slope, both on the positive side and the negative side. And I think 2014 was a good example for us. Frankly, historically, it\u2019s always been that way. And the question for us going into 2015 is, what is the tone of our business? And as we say, it\u2019s solid. What\u2019s our focus? Our focus is on our competitive product, which is talent, creativity, digital, media, all the stuff and focusing on the cost side of the business. And we have our disciplines up and running and we look at it on a full year basis.","Craig Huber","So you are obviously trying to get your profits in the first quarter, the significant profit territory interest, the margin line overtime?","Frank Mergenthaler","Yeah, but obviously, it\u2019s a good start of the year on a strong quarter. But again, we\u2019re looking at it on full year basis.","Craig Huber","Right. Okay. Thank you, guys.","Frank Mergenthaler","Thank you, Craig.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Barry Lucas of Gabelli & Company. Your line is now open.","Frank Mergenthaler","Hi, Barry","Barry Lucas","Thanks. Good morning. Two quickies. Michael, you alluded to some possible client concerns, maybe holding back a little spend because of currency fluctuations. You have another positive dynamics on fuel prices, which certainly should help consumers in many places. So, is that a bigger tailwind potential and have you heard anything come out of clients with regard to that more favorable trend?","Michael Roth","Yeah. It\u2019s all anecdotal. I mean, intuitively, it\u2019s a same as you would look at it. As gasoline prices fall, the consumer has more money in the pocket, discretionary spending in terms of consumer goods products and things like that. Have I seen a big change in their forecast as a result of that? No. But as everyone kind of used that as a bit of a buffer in terms of expectations on the economy, I would say the answer is, yes. And Barry, the concern we raised is of uncertainties. It\u2019s not that I can specifically point to a client and say because of currency, we are cutting our spend by10%.","This is the beginning of the year. This business is just like I was talking before with Craig. This business is, it's a journey over the year. And all we can do is take our best shot right now in terms of bottoms-up and what we overlay in terms of potential wins and god forbid losses. But I think the tone is solid and that\u2019s the takeaway I think from this call. And some clients are little more concerned than others and that has to do with their geographic locations. So it\u2019s a legitimate question I think. All of our competitors have raised it. And it\u2019s more of a sense of making sure we are cautious before we put numbers out there, because we always want to make sure we at least meet or exceed the numbers we put out there.","Barry Lucas","Thanks. One more quickly on a different topic, but you\u2019ve changed the makeup of the Board, a little bit of constitution of the Board and added a new finance committee. What do you expect to happen and how do you interact with the new board members and maybe provide a little color on that?","Michael Roth","Well, yeah, we -- as a governance matter, we\u2019ve always looked at the Board. We have the tenure of our boards. And frankly, we had a process going on all along in terms of replacement of some of our Board members and what you see is a reflection of that. I think we've added -- I know we've added three very capable independent Board members.","The finance committee, a lot of what the finance committee is doing is what the audit committee was doing. We always look at strategic plans, capital allocation and costs and how we target and so on. So the finance committee is a typical committee factoring in on the number of the Boards that I sit on have separate finance committee.","So since our focus is on making sure we achieve our margins. The emphasis are focusing on that for the finance committee is going to be welcome and knowing our Board, because we usually view these things as a full Board. I will suspect the attendance that our finance committee will probably be made of entire Board. So, I think, well, does it show our continued emphasis on getting to those margins that we put out there.","Barry Lucas","Great. Thanks very much for the commentary, Michael.","Michael Roth","Okay. Thank you, Barry.","Operator","And thank you. That was our last question. I would like to turn it back to our host for closing remarks.","Michael Roth","Well, I thank you all, obviously, we are very pleased with 2014, but now we are off to 2015. So I look forward to our next call. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. This now conclude today's conference. All parties may disconnect at this time.

All parties are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jerome Leshne","Good morning. Thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com.","This morning, we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 Eastern.","During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company. These are subject to the uncertainties in the cautionary statement that is included in our earnings release and the slide presentation and further detailed in our 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.","We will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP measures, allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance.","At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Jerry, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we review our results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2017. I'll start out by covering highlights of our performance, and Frank will then provide additional detail, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies and the tone of business to be followed by our Q&A.","Our organic growth in the third quarter was 50 basis points and was 1.5% excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenues. For the first nine-months of the year, organic revenue growth was 1.1% and was 1.6%, excluding the impact of lower pass-throughs.","As a reminder, our pass-through revenues are offset dollar-for-dollar in expenses. As a result, increases and decreases of pass-through revenues do not change our operating profit. Operating profit in the quarter grew to $219 million, up 5.3%, which reflects strong Q3 operating margin expansion of 70 basis points to 11.5%.","Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.37 and was $0.31 as adjusted for below the line items. We continue to see positive growth momentum in the quarter, from a number of key disciplines and agencies; notably, our media operations, where we had continued strong growth in both the U.S. and our international markets from existing clients as well as new business wins.","Our creatively driven advertising business had solid U.S. growth in both our larger networks and our domestic independence. This performance, combined with strong new business trends lead us to conclude that the revenue slowdown we are experiencing is not secular.","In terms of our agencies, we were led in Q3 by increases at Mediabrands as well as FCB, Deutsch and Hill Holliday. Among client sectors, healthcare continued its strong trend in Q3 and we also continue to see notable growth in the auto and transportation and government sectors. These increases, however, were largely offset in the quarter by continued softness in the client sectors we had called out earlier this year.","Consistent with our second quarter, we saw significant reductions in client spend in the CPG sector and continued weakness in tech and telecom and in financial services, due largely to cycling through prior year client loses.","On our second quarter conference call, we called attention to the issue we had begun to the see in the project-driven part of our business. During the third quarter, several of our largest clients continue to differ or cancel project spending, which particularly weighed on the growth of our digital and marketing services disciplines. This was true even as some projects that had been pushed back earlier in part of the year came on stream during the third quarter.","The net of this, however, was a negative to some units that have been among our higher growth disciplines in recent years. These same agencies and disciplines generated strong new business wins in the quarter, which should translate to growth as we look forward. On the project front, R\/GA won significant new digital assignments during Q3, as did Weber Shandwick in public relations.","The pipeline for project assignments remained active. And we know that our offerings are highly competitive.","Another question that we are being asked relate to the fundamentals of our business model, it has to do with new entrants into the sector. Despite a great deal of press coverage, announcing their consultants are making inroads into our business, we do not see them in any material way in new business. And when we do, we've been very - quite well on these opportunities. A notable example was the recent McDonald's U.S. digital pitch, won by Huge against a range of agency and consultant competitors.","Turning to our regional performance, third quarter U.S. organic growth was 1.3% and importantly was 2% excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenues. In light of current macro industry environment, that's an encouraging data point. We see it as an indicator that the business is fundamentally sound in our largest geographic market.","Organic growth of our international markets decreased 70 basis points compared to a very strong 8% a year ago. Excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenues, international organic revenue was up 70 basis points. We had organic increases in the UK, continental Europe and our other markets group, while Asia-Pac and LatAm decreased.","During Q3, we used a $101 million to repurchase 4.7 million shares. Over the trailing 12 months, we utilized approximately $326 million with share repurchases. As of quarter end, we have $240 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Since instituting our return of capital programs in 2011, we've returned $3.5 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases as well as reduced our diluted share count by 29%.","Turning to our outlook, we continue to be confident of our company's long-term position in the marketplace. Our talent and our agency brands are strong and highly competitive. That said, slower growth through nine months combined with the challenging comp in Q4, require us to adjust our view for the short-term.","Our revised financial targets for the full-year, our significant margin expansion of 40 basis points compared to a year-ago with 1% to 2% organic growth for the full-year. We will, of course, try to do better, but we feel these are appropriate goals as we head into the always important fourth quarter.","Following our industry-leading growth of the last several years, we are focused on executing in effective program to bring expenses fully into line with this year's revenue reality, so as to drive margin. In those areas of the business, where our growth has slowed to leverage our headcount, temporary labor, and short-term discretionary expenses such as travel. As reflected in the quarter, we also have in place a pay-for-performance incentive model in which revenue growth against the target set at the beginning of the year, is one of the principal performance metrics, in addition to margin expansion.","Looking a bit further ahead, as clients return to a growth agenda, which is their only path to sustain value creation, we expect to see improvement in our organic revenue performance. Our pipeline of new business opportunities remain strong overall. In addition to pitching and winning new business, we are aggressively core selling services and continuing to deliver on the open architecture, integrated opportunities that have historically been a significant contributor to our growth.","At this stage, I'll turn things over to Frank for additional details on our results, and join you after his remarks for an update on key trends in the business and our operating units to be followed by our Q&A.","Frank Mergenthaler","Thank you, Michael. Good morning. As a reminder, I'll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast.","On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of results, a number of which Michael touched upon. Organic growth was 50 basis points in the quarter and was 1.1% for the first nine months. While, our top line slowdown puts pressure on overall profitability, we nonetheless drove higher Q3 margin and operating profit.","Operating profit was $219 million compared to $208 million, an increase of 5.3% with operating margin of 11.5%, an increase of 70 basis points. For the first nine months, operating profit was $445 million, which is flat with a year-ago. And our margin was also equal to the nine months of 2016.","Third quarter diluted EPS was $0.37, and was $0.31 as adjusted for: one, the disposition expensive to small non-strategic agency; and two, a sizable benefit for tax credits in the quarter. That is comparable to 32% reported and 31% as adjusted a year-ago. For nine-months, the adjusted comparison to $0.63 this year compared with $0.66 a year ago due to higher adjusted tax rate so far this year. Q3 average fully diluted share is decreased 2.6% from last year due to our share repurchase program.","Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow.","Slide 4 has a more detail on revenue growth. Revenue was $1.9 billion in the quarter, a decrease of 1% compared to Q3 2016. The impact of the change in currency exchange rates was a positive 40 basis points. The impact of net dispositions was 1.9%. Resulting organic revenue increase was 50 basis points. Again organic growth was a full point higher, 1.5%, when excluding the $90 million decrease in our pass-through revenues, which occurred mainly in our events business in the UK and the U.S.","To remind you pass-throughs are mainly in our event businesses. They are recorded when we used third-party to support the delivery of services, and we are the principal on the third-party contract as opposed to an agent. We paid a third-party that's our expense, we collect from our client that's our revenue. Events business a big discrete projects and as we have said many times, we can add some volatility to organic growth. This is especially true when our revenue is divide into annual quarters and regions.","We tell you about it when they make a material difference to this critical metric either up or down. We've called it out a year-ago in Q3 2016 when pass-throughs added 90 basis points to growth at that time. Just to reiterate, all of this has nothing to do with our media business. We run a pure agency media model, with no owned media inventory.","As you can see on the bottom half of the slide, the organic increase in the quarter was 2% our integrated agency networks. This was led by notably strong performance at Mediabrands and FCB.","At our CMG segment, the organic change was a negative 5% in Q3. Excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenue, the change was not as steep at 1.7%, it's still reflect to the challenge we've seen this year on our project-based businesses.","Moving onto Slide 5 revenue by region. In the U.S., Q3 organic growth was 1.3% and was 2% excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenue. We had very good performance from Mediabrands as well as FCB, Deutsch, Hill Holliday and Octagon.","In the UK, organic growth was 3% and again growth were significantly stronger 8.1%, excluding lower pass-through revenue due to one-time event a year-ago that did not repeat. We had solid growth across most major disciplines led by McCann and Mediabrands.","In Continental Europe, our organic revenue change was 40 basis points on top of 8.3% growth in Q3 2016. We continue to see mixed performance in our largest markets with growth in Germany and Italy, and decreases in France and Spain.","In Asia Pacific, our organic decrease in Q3 was 2.1% among our largest markets, solid growth in Australia were R\/GA continue to be a standout was more than offset by decreases in China, India and Japan.","In LatAm, our organic - our Q3 organic decrease was 9.9% against 18% growth a year-ago, which included the 2016 Olympics. The decrease was due to macro weakness in Brazil, the region's largest market. We continue to see very strong growth in Mexico, Argentina, Chile and Colombia. And our other markets group, organic growth was 3.4%, which was due to growth in Canada and South Africa.","Moving onto Slide 6, we chart the longer view of organic revenue change on a trailing 12 month basis. Most recent data point is 2.3%.","On Slide 7, we turn to operating expenses. In the quarter, our total operating expenses decreased by 1.8% from a year-ago and our reported revenue decrease of 1%. Our ratio of total salaries and related expenses to revenue was 64.5% compared to a year-ago, we deleverage on our expense for base payroll, benefits and tax, due to decelerating revenue growth. And also due to decrease in pass-through revenues, which are offset in our O&G expense.","Going the other way, however, we had strong leverage on our expense for incentives. Total headcount at quarter end was approximately 50,400, which is flat from a year-ago. In our office and general expenses, our ratio of total O&G revenue was 24%, an improvement of 130 basis points from a year-ago, result of lower pass-through expenses.","Slide 8, depicts our operating margin history on a trailing 12 month basis. Most recent data point is 12.1%.","Slide 9 is provided for the clarity of our year-over-year earnings per share comparison. This is the adjustment from diluted earnings per share of $0.37 as reported in the quarter to $0.31 per share as adjusted.","As you can see, our pre-tax results include a below-the-line loss of $8.7 million related to the sale of small non-strategic agencies with a small tax benefit against the loss, which is shown here.","The net impact was a loss of $0.02 per diluted share. Moving to the right side on the slide, our tax provision reflects the benefit of significant federal tax credits in the quarter $31 million or $0.08 per share. For the nine-months, we are adjusting similarly, from $0.66 as reported to an adjusted $0.63 per share.","Slide 10 is our cash flow for the nine months. Cash used in operations was $139 million, compared with $27 million a year ago. You'd recall that our cash flow is high seasonal. We typically use cash in operations over the first nine months of the year followed by sizeable cash inflow in our fourth quarter.","While our working capital results can be volatile from year to year, note that before working capital changes, cash from operations generated $474 million in this year compared with a similar level $465 million last year. Vesting activities used $141 million over the first nine months, mainly in CapEx. Our financing activities used $113 million, chiefly for share repurchase of common stock and our dividend, partially offset by an increase in our short-term borrowings.","Our net decrease in cash for the period was $392 million compared with $611 million a year ago.","Moving on to Slide 11, the current portion of our balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $705 million in cash, compared with $892 million a year ago. Comparisons to December 31 reflects that our cash level is seasonal and tends to peak at year-end.","Under our current liabilities, the current portion of long-term debt is our $300 million 2.25% notes maturing next month. We continue to be opportunistic and we use either commercial paper or tap the capital markets to refinance that maturity.","On Slide 12, you will see $400 million increase year-to-year in short-term debt. This increase is primarily attributed to funding our seasonal working capital needs. And we expect that our debt levels at year-end will be in line with 2016.","In summary on Slide 13, we are confident that the quality of our talent, along with our focused investment and cost disciplines, mean that we are well positioned for continued value creation and our balance sheet remains an important source of strength.","With that, let me turn it back over to Michael.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Frank. Our results in the quarter reflect the broader trends that we're seeing across the industry. As mentioned in my earlier remarks, there were number of discrete items that are negatively impacting our performance. Last quarter, we called out the impact of macro uncertainty and political gridlock both domestic and international.","These continue to contribute to client caution. Like our peers, we also have some clients who are having to adopt to disruptive technologies and business models, and others who are responding to the wave of activists shareholders and private equity. The first line of defense in such situations is always to address costs, but the focus will ultimately have to return to growing the top-line, which is where our capabilities and expertise had significant value.","Our people remain among the best in their respected disciplines. We have some of the industry's most respected agency brands, whether in media, advertising, public relations, healthcare, experiential, sports or other marketing services. And as you know, we long ago embedded digital expertise into every one of our agencies, which is what has made our offering so relevant and successful in recent years.","We're also proud of our long-standing commitment to promoting diversity and individuality. That's always been front incentive for us. In an idea-driven business, it will remain absolutely vital to our success going forward. We can all see in the news these days, the degree to which getting the cultural right and respecting diversity and inclusivity are areas in which many creative companies still have very long way to go.","Engaging the tone of business for the balance of the year, it's fair to say that although performance with our existing client-base has been negatively impacted due to the factors I just enumerated. We do continue to see a strong flow of new business opportunities.","In terms of margins, the quarter demonstrated that we have the discipline and the tools to enhance profitability, even in a challenged top-line environment. We've proven this in the past and we enter the fourth quarter fully focused on protecting and enhancing margin.","Highlights in the quarter were led by Mediabrands, which once again posted a very strong quarter. UM won the highly competitive Spotify account, a very progressive marketer that will allow us to do some exciting digital and data-driven work globally. Initiatives new positioning, which like UM, draws heavily on a very strong assets and capabilities in data and combines them with deep cultural insights, resulted in the global win of the Carlsberg business.","As I mentioned previously, the range of digital capabilities at Mediabrands, notably Cadreon and Reprise are best in class. And with new business activity in the media space continuing at a high-level, we always want to call attention to our commitment to transparency and the fact that we don't take inventory positions in media. Practices which fully align our interest with those of our clients.","McCann's performance in New York and a number of international markets was also strong. The agency put in place new leaders in China, where it has strong operations across all of its disciplines. New regional leadership was also named in North America and senior women executives were elevated to lead strategic planning globally for Worldgroup and to the presidency of McCann New York. New business highlights included HomeGoods in New York and Bombardier in Canada.","FCB had a solid quarter with a range of wins across the world, including Uber in Brazil, BMW in Canada, GSK and Tata Docomo in India, and Huawei in the UK. In Chicago, the acquisition of global design comp agency, Chute Gerdeman, is a strong addition to FCB\/RED, the agency's outstanding retail marketing division.","FCB Health also continue to win business and awards, reflecting its standing as an industry leader in healthcare marketing. MullenLowe concluded the Salt and 101 acquisitions, which rounds out the agency's hyper bundle offering in the important UK market, where it recently added the national trust and Eurosport Digital accounts. The agency's Mediahub unit is performing well and won staples and pods during the quarter.","In addition, the review that was among the industry's most competitive with over 100 agencies participating was Whole Foods, in which MullenLowe was announced as a creative agency of record earlier this month. As mentioned in my opening remarks, the current environment is taking its greater toll on CPG clients and project-based businesses, especially those in marketing services and to a lesser extent on digital specialist agencies.","Here, we have some of the industry's most recognized and awarded agencies like R\/GA, Weber Shandwick, Huge and Golin. We know that our offerings in these areas are exceptional. R\/GA consistently sets the vision standard for digital market, and there are few agencies that can deliver in the UX and e-commerce space like Huge.","Weber Shandwick is the most awarded PR firm up over the past five years. And Golin has created new ways of working that are at the forefront of client-centric models. Despite the proven excellence, however, the current environment has led to attrition in projects at these businesses and others like them.","We are encouraged that our digital and PR agencies posted wins in the third quarter. And the fourth quarter is traditionally one of which a great deal of project spending takes place, but due to client caution we have yet to see return to normal activity. So we are monitoring the space closely. There is little doubt at the evolution of marketing is impacting the kinds of capabilities and service solutions that are required of us by our clients. Consumers have more power than ever before to dictate how and when they will engage with brands and their messages.","The explosion of media channels and marketing technology adds another dimension of complexity. And accountability is more important than ever. In both regards, we are well positioned and we are constantly developing our service offerings.","First and foremost, there is our open architecture approach, which is totally customizable and client centric. We access the marketing challenge and determine, and bring to bear the best resources from across the portfolio. That can mean CRM and analytic skills to plot the consumer journey, or insights tools to understand their mindset and craft the most effective creative execution. It could also mean our media expertise to segment and identify the right audiences as well as target the delivery at the right messages at the right times, our experiential teams that activate the campaign on the ground and specialty players in healthcare if the key audiences or influencers are in the medical or pharma space.","The list goes on, but the point is that we have the uniquely broad range of talent and know-how. When we bring in together in a seamless fashion with the focus that's entirely are the needs of their clients and their consumers, it's a difficult offering to match or to beat.","As you've heard in recent calls, we are also investing behind the scale data stack that builds on our strong capabilities at Mediabrands and will inform the full range of marketing disciplines all across into public, from strategic planning on the creative side of the business, through the delivery of highly targeted and relevant messages across all media channels.","The ultimate goal is to shed light on the value that we deliver and perhaps open the door to new opportunities in terms of pay-for-performance.","Despite the current revenue environment and the need to manage cost and deliver margin enhancement, our investments in open architecture and data are key strategic priorities, to which we will remain committed.","Going forward, our targets for the full year and improved profitability relative to 2016 levels by 40 basis points, with 1% to 2% organic revenue growth. Combined with the strength of our balance sheet and our proven commitment to capital returns, this will allow us to enhance shareholder value.","As always, we thank you for your time and support. And with that, I'll open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Alexia Quadrani of JP Morgan. Ma'am, you may begin.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you very much, Michael. Thank you for all the data you provided about the weakness we're seeing in the quarter. I guess, I'd just like to push a bit more on that point. If you look at the weakness, I think you highlighted the change in the digital, maybe in the marketing services. Is it really isolated to maybe the consumer packaged goods sector, where you're seeing a bit more of a pull back or is it a broader base across many verticals?","And really, if you look at sort of the growth we're seeing today versus maybe a year ago, you enjoyed stronger growth. I guess, anything else, any other delta you're seeing, any other change you're seeing that we might want to be aware of?","Michael Roth","Yeah, that's a fair question. Obviously, look, we're not happy with the results, but I do think we - we spent a lot of time analyzing what's going on with respect to our specific clients. The reason why I don't think it's secular, first, let's look at the areas that you raise, consumer goods.","Obviously, our entire industry is seeing some pullbacks there. And as I indicated, the threats in the consumer goods in terms of profit margins for our clients are real. But I think the clients have recognized, they had stated that their object here is to consolidate agencies and be more efficient.","And in that case, we're very well positioned with respect to our clients in the consumer goods side. And we believe we will end up on the plus side of that consolidation with respect to our major clients. And again, consumer goods is about 8% of our sectors. But that said, they're big clients and they presented good opportunities for us in the future.","What's interesting in the consumer goods side, frankly, we saw a positive in the U.S. on consumer goods as a result of particularly FCB winning a particular client. So that's encouraging for us, although overall consumer goods was down.","The other area, which is not too dissimilar, is parts of food and beverage. And we saw a negative impact in that. And candidly, a good reason for the decline in the food and beverage reflect some client losses that we had in that sector. So that is weighing on us in terms of particular segment. On the positive side, when you look at our strength in healthcare, healthcare is 22% of our business.","Once again, we saw a very strong performance in healthcare, across McCann, FCB, our key healthcare global agencies and we've seen positive opportunities. I might add that we also want some additional business from these clients. So healthcare continues a strong sector for us.","Other actually is a strong sector for us, it was quarter as well, which - particularly government side and some unique companies and some technology side. One that historically has been very strong for us was tech and telecom. And in this quarter, we saw a reduction in tech and telecom. But a good part of that is the impact of pass-throughs.","Last year, we had two very big events in tech and telecom which didn't repeat. So that had a negative impact on tech and telecom. And frankly, the other reason that some of our sectors are down, is we are cycling through some large clients in the United States. Now, the good news is we continue to be net new business, slightly positive, let's call it equal for the full year. But we still have to cycle through a number of larger clients, particularly in the U.S., although SEAT was in Europe that is hurting our organic growth.","So I know - we have new business coming on stream, which offsets the cycling through of these losses. And I don't get to do this, but I'll say it anyhow. Had we not had those losses our organic growth would be on the top of the scale if you will in terms of organic growth. So that's another reason, I'd like to say, why I think the tone of the business is not reflected in the results that we're seeing today.","There is a lot of new business activity. We see that. There aren't a lot of big agency of record pitches that are out there. But certainly on the media side, we're seeing a number of pitches and we're faring well in those and hope to add some new ones, wins to announce shortly. So I hope that gives you a sense of what's happening out there.","Alexia Quadrani","Yeah, now that's very helpful. And just to be sure, I'd say on the digital side, where you said there is a little bit of weakness, that - you're not seeing some of that business go in-house. You're just sort of saying a pullback in terms of\u2026","Michael Roth","Well, look, there is no question that there is a tendency to some clients to bring digital in-house. But the reality is what we're talking about are large projects. We said this in the last call. Our digital businesses have become so embedded into the clients' businesses they're very large projects.","And as we know like any project business, when those businesses are challenged from a P&L point of view, the easiest place for them to cut on the cost side is to cut those projects, so in particular on the digital side of these large projects. And frankly, I know you're being kind on asking why we didn't do this in the second quarter. We had these projects on the shelf and, frankly, we thought they would be coming to fruition within the third or fourth quarter. And clients are yet to be able to - or indicated that they will be pulling the trigger on those projects.","So therefore it was appropriate for us to change our outlook and a lot of that has to do with these large scale projects both in the digital side of our business and in our PR side of the business, which as you know are very much project oriented. So that's why I believe going forward there is no question that the value-added of these agencies are real and clients will need to frankly implement a lot of these projects at their environment gets competitive.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you. And just a quick follow-up if I may, just about the longer-term outlook. Do you think - I mean, I believe you're about to go - I'm sure will in November, December, kind of the budgeting process where you get a better sense of the outlook for 2018, so I'm sure, it's a bit too early to comment on what you'll see then. But do you think, there is any reason to assume the visibility will change in the sense with these sort of more short-term in terms of knowing how 2018 is going to come? Or do you feel when you go through the process you should have a decent sense like you do every year?","Michael Roth","You're always asking those questions, Alexia. They're the right questions. It's too soon for us to comment on 2018. Obviously, where we will focus on in our businesses is what the visibility and likelihood of the project. We can forecast agency of record type businesses. We know what's in the contract, we know what the Xs are, we know what the deliverables are, and obviously, we do a bottoms-up analysis of it. And we'll have to overly our best guess on what happens to these projects.","And the good news is - these are not insignificant projects. They're necessary for our clients. They're key to the deliverables that we deliver with respect to the targeted growth of our clients. So I believe, they will come on stream, the difficulty we're doing this quarter-to-quarter, as I've always said is clients don't pay attention to our quarters. And we will do whatever we can to help them see the light in terms of the value of these projects. But it's too soon for us to say, how that's going to shake out in 2018.","Alexia Quadrani","All right. Thank you very much.","Michael Roth","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Janedis of Jefferies. Your line is open.","John Janedis","Hi, thank you. Michael, maybe two questions. One is just on APAC, it's been a little bit challenge in this year, when you think about the region, say, India and China, in particular, has your longer term outlook there changed? I know, you have a lot of multinational clients, but local players shift in money to local agencies and then separately, I guess, it seems like a bit of an unusual year from a project perspective. We tend not to hear much about it until the fourth quarter. So I was wondering, is there any read-through from project business from, say, the prior three quarters and the fourth quarter?","Michael Roth","Yeah, look, I think, there's no question that China, a lot of the expectations for growth in China were overblown. And I think, what we're seeing in China is coming back to a more normal expectation for growth in China. That said, there's growth in China. We were negative in China in the quarter, I think, those were - I know, those were more client specific than the industry, and you're correct. Local businesses have had an impact on the pullback in that.","Our multinationals in China will continue to spend in China, but local businesses is something that we have to focus on and there those are very much project oriented. The good news is in Australia, we saw a very strong impact in the third quarter, particularly at R\/GA, which is again one of those digital type project based businesses, where we see - when we win them and the clients pull the trigger, it has a very positive impact on our business.","And I think that's what we are going to be seeing. Also we saw a strong - we saw strength in Singapore last quarter, and this quarter. We have been seeing such strength and remember our comps were much - a little more difficult from last year. But the tone in China is more realistic than the high growth. And I think, you're right to focus on local, which why we've added, for example, McCann, we've added a lot of new talent in China too and the same in FCB to focus on local markets.","John Janedis","Anything on India, and also on the project side?","Michael Roth","Yeah, India - historically, India has been one of our stronger market, I think, you have to look at India as being very client specific. Again, it's not that large and but it's one of our stronger markets. And in particular, we were cycling and had some negative impact on clients in India, I don't think it's an overall industry or economic issue, it's very client specific to us. Frankly, we lost a client in India, and we're seeing the impact of that.","John Janedis","Anymore color on the project side, Michael? I just back to my question before, it feels like we tend not to hear much about projects in 2Q and 3Q. And then so, is there any kind of read on a go-forward basis into 4Q, meaning is it more confidence that - I know, you talked about, but some of them projects in 3Q actually gets done in 4Q or any kind of read for us to think about?","Michael Roth","Well, yeah. Again - the reason, we adjusted our numbers is because it's hard to predict when these projects are going to be going online and when clients are going to pull the trigger. And we all of a sudden, didn't get much smarter now than we were before on projects, clients surprise us. When we put out our forecast in the second quarter, we had these projects ready to go, and that's why we put out the numbers that we did and clients just pullback.","So yes, you're right, fourth quarter is typically project-based businesses. But I think, what we're seeing in these large projects are all year-long, not just the fourth quarter, and we're dependent on the timing when clients are going to pull them on stream.","The good news is, take for example R\/GA. R\/GA had a lot of new business wins in the third quarter, and they will flow through. Now whether they'll flow through in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter of next year, we're still mapping out. So I can't really ask you - answer that question. But the good news is, they're winning business, and the question of timing of that is something that a little more difficult now given the project environment that we're in.","John Janedis","All right. Thanks so much.","Michael Roth","Thank you, John.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Peter Stabler","Good morning. A couple, if I could. First with Michael. I want to spend a minute on the marketing services side, CMG is about 20% of your business. But when we look at the quarter, and we look back nine months, and then we look across the competitive set, it seems that fairly obvious at the marketing services part of the puzzle appears to be under kind of sustained pressure. So wondering if you could comment on whether you're seeing secular changes in the appetite for the services and whether portfolio changes might be something that you consider.","And then, a follow-on on that would be the call out of pass-through, we understand it. Have you contemplated maybe changing the types of contracts that you strike? Is that something of interest to you, where you become maybe less exposed to some of the volatility associated with these pass-throughs? Or is that not material to you? And then, I've got one quick follow-up. Thanks.","Michael Roth","Okay. Let me talk about pass-throughs, because it's a very relevant question. It sounds like every time we say this, it sounds like we're being defensive about it. You're right, we've been in the process over the last - Frank and the CMG team have been looking at contract changes, and some of them - frankly, some of the differences as a result in changes the contract, okay.","I have to point out, I know, they're looking at me, and they don't want to me say this, but I'll tell you. Next year, the accounting for these things are going to be different, okay, and in fact, next year under the new accounting rules, which we will be implementing, we will be showing it net, okay. Because, that's the way the rules dictate. So both - the answer is yes, we're constantly looking at our contract to change them to agency versus principal, and we've had some success with that.","But more importantly, the accounting I believe, next year will more probably reflect the net revenue and the impact, which is, again, why - when I say that we added in the 2% in the U.S. after pass-throughs that's the true measure of our business. And 2% is more consistent with what we're seeing in the industry and what we were forecasting than the number that shows gross without adding back the impact of pass-throughs. So it's confusing. We apologize for doing it both ways, but next year, we won't be doing that. And you're right, we are focusing on contracts.","With respect to CMG, look, Weber Shandwick, for the last, I don't know how many years have beaten the entire industry, and it's been a key driver for our organic growth. And as you know, this business is project-based business. And frankly, it was disappointing to see, particularly at Weber Shandwick, a drop-off in that project business. And all the reasons we were talking about project businesses before we're applying to Weber Shandwick.","I'll let Frank add some details to that since CMG reports up to Frank.","Frank Mergenthaler","Peter, we don't see a secular change. There has been a common theme in both Weber Shandwick and Golin, where existing clients are just cautious on their spend. And I think that goes back to the comments, Michael made earlier. It is somewhat discretionary in the short-term, but what we do works. It's been a leading driver growth for us for the past five years. We've got the most awarded PR agencies in the industry. So we're just working our clients hard and try to provide value and we're confident that the growth will come back, when some of these cautious start to dissipate.","Michael Roth","Yeah, some of the government spending is, in fact, in Weber Shandwick as well. And that you've read about, particularly in the healthcare side, and that was - that's a perfect example of project-based businesses that are nice-sized businesses that for whatever reason, whether it be government pullback or the president or whatever you want to say ended up and putting it and taking it off the shelf and not triggering it. So we saw an impact of that particularly at Weber Shandwick.","Peter Stabler","So it sounds like PR was one of the primary drivers of weakness in CMG?","Michael Roth","Yes.","Peter Stabler","Okay. And then, one quick follow-up\u2026","Michael Roth","By the way, let me just add on the other side of that, Octagon had a very solid quarter, and they are not - although they're part of CMG, they are performing very well.","Peter Stabler","Great. One quick follow-up. Just on the AOR concept. Just wondering whether you think or whether you're seeing the appetite of clients to strike AOR-type relationships is changing in anyway. If the overall industry is going more project-related, are you seeing an increase in the number of clients who want to engage your agencies on shorter-term contracts? And is that impacting your ability to forecast the business at all? Thanks so much.","Michael Roth","Yeah. No, that's - I mean, that's - as usual that's a great question. There's no question that there are clients out there that are viewing the AOR relationship a little differently and tend to be more project-based business than historically. The other side of that coin, we continue to have particularly at McCann, very strong long-term relationships with large multinationals that require an AOR contract, because of the breadth of offerings within McCann servicing those clients on a global basis.","So those clients, obviously, the AOR relationship is critical, and we see that continuing. There may be some pullback in spending here and there, but the relationship with those clients, they're 75-years old, and they continue to be very embedded into what the businesses are, but there are some projects within that, that affect us.","What's interesting is we are seeing, and it's a good chance for me to talk about this open architecture, call it whatever you will, we use open architecture, because we feel that by bringing all the different resources within IPG and not restructuring the entire company is a much more efficient and better way for us to meet the needs of the clients as they look to us for more services that's the opportunity.","I have to tell you, the last few pitches that we've received even when they start out as media RFPs, they're looking for open architecture solutions, where we can bring and put as a seat at the table, other resources within IPG to help those clients.","That's where I think the opportunity is, with respect to what our business is looking at. This is when we can bring in media, the data analytics, the insights and then bring them to life with execution with strong creative opportunities, execution, experiential. This is the kind of stuff that when we're sitting in the room on these pitches, and you bring all these different resources. This is what clients are looking for, they don't have to do it on a piecemeal basis. And if we do a good job at it, we have tremendous opportunities here.","And again, it also ties into your questions about whether consulting firms can do this. Consulting firms have yet to be able to be in a position of providing all those different resources that we put at that table, whether it be media, whether it be experiential, whether it be the creative. Let's not forget the value of our creative offerings.","You have seen tremendous success at McCann, at FCB, at MullenLowe. All of these are very strong powerful creative offerings that clients still need. Where it's distributed and how you distribute it needs the resources of all the different businesses that we bring to the table, but you still need that creative offering to bring light to the relationship between the brands and the consumers.","So I'm very bullish about our ability to bring those resources together. So if clients, yes, has some of them go to a project-based business, and we can compete head-to-head with anybody. But the overall relationship is one, that I think really adds value to our clients. And when we do it right, frankly, it compelling.","Peter Stabler","Thanks for the color, guys.","Michael Roth","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you. Good morning, one for Michael, one for Frank. Michael, can you talk how we've beaten marketing services projects down a bit. So I just wanted to turn to the media business. Why do you think that business is, A, proven more resilient and can you give us any insight? You guys don't report media as a segment. What is the growth of that business look like this year versus last year? Are you seeing - some of the pressures you mentioned elsewhere in the business show up in some moderation, and any color you can give us on the outlook for media would be helpful. And then I have a cash flow question for Frank.","Michael Roth","Yeah, look, the media business continues to be our best performing business within our businesses. And it's not by accident, because all the confusions out there is - I use my favorite term, confusion - all the confusion that's out there in the marketplace needs an independent view of where clients should spend their money, whether it'd be in digital, whether it'd be TV, whether it'd be experiential.","And the insights in data analytics that our media businesses bring to that table are incredible. I've sat in on a number of the pitches that we've been involved, and I just sit there and listen to the insights and the capabilities that we bring to some of the most sophisticated marketers in the world. And they're looking for that. And frankly, that's why we're seeing an uptick in media RFPs, because they realize that the only place that they can get those that type of insight and capability are from our types of businesses and our media businesses.","And that's why I think we've invested significantly in the data analytics. As you know, we made a commitment in the beginning of the year to bring a good part of that data analytics into IPG, so it's available across all of our agencies, not just the media side. And that's working well. Cadreon and Reprise are doing tremendous in terms of digital growth and insights. And frankly, when we win these businesses, we win it because of the tools and resources that we bring to the table.","So, yes, media is where all the action is happening right now and we bring in the insights, the digital capabilities on a regular basis and it's proven that we are best in class. And we beat a number of our competitors obviously in this arena, given the new business wins that we had on the media side.","There is pressure if you will on the media side, with respect to pricing and that there is no question that there is some competitors out there that view getting into the media business as an opportunity to get into the other sides of the business. And therefore, they're willing to do what I call the irrational acts on some of the pricing. But the sophisticated clients that we have known that that's not a long-term solution in terms of how they handle their media business and we emphasize that. And so, media is a very strong course if you will for us driving our business.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you. And, Frank, you commented a little bit on this in your prepared remarks, but just could you about the drivers of the working capital drag increase this year versus last year, how you're managing that. We saw the same, at least directional trend in Omnicom. They talked a bit about pressure around collections or execution on collections. But any comment you can give us to help us understand what has been a trend I think across the holding companies now for a kind of a year plus, which is sort of the working capital or cash conversion out of EBITDA would be interesting.","Frank Mergenthaler","Yeah, the working capital is volatile and it's driven by our media business spend. And normally, in a normal year, it's usually a use of cash for three quarters. And in the fourth quarter, we generate significant cash. In 2016, you had the Olympics in the third quarter, so lot of the fourth quarter media spend was pulled forward, so that resulted in significant cash generation. For this quarter, we're seeing the normal volatility. We expect our debt levels at the end of the year to be consistent with last year.","So is there a change out there in payment terms? No, we're seeing pressure around it, but we manage it quite well. We got rigorous controls to ensure we're not going beyond what we believe are appropriate. We look at cash collection and cycles. I think we've been very efficient. We've got shared service centers around the globe that helps that conversion to be efficient. So we don't see any change in the business model.","I think clients are getting more sophisticated around how they pay us. Media owners are getting more sophisticated. But again, we're managing through them.","Michael Roth","I do want to add. We've been talking about getting to investment grade. And we always said one of the reasons investment grade was important to us was to have a commercial paper program. So we have that up and running. It's a very effective way for us to handle the ups and downs in terms of cash requirements, given the volatility on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And the commercial paper program is doing very well and we expect to see that move forward as one of the tools we have to manage our cash flow.","So I think we're very well positioned, both in terms of handling our maturities on the balance sheet, as well as handling the working capital ups and downs that Frank was talking to through all the different commercial paper programs and access to capital markets that we have.","Ben Swinburne","Okay. Thank you, both.","Michael Roth","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we have Dan Salmon of BMO. Your line is open.","Daniel Salmon","Hi, good morning, everyone. Michael, could I return to part of your prepared remarks where you spoke about the impact of new competition, particularly the IT services and consultants. And you noted that you continue to not see them in a material way in your new business activity, and then also followed it up to note that you won some new digital business head-to-head against a group of them. So, could you just clarify that a little bit more?","Is it a matter of not seeing them in core creative and media assignments, and that you are seeing them in emerging digital services. And then I got a follow up on that.","Michael Roth","Yeah, look, the most logical place for them to grow as an add-on to what they're already there. Look, they're basically systems consolidators out there. And while they're there they bought digital expert - what they think are digital experts to help them. And frankly, sometimes they throw them in for nothing, because they want to make sure that they continue the relationship. So the digital part of it is where they have the best argument that they can add some CRM expertise and that's more where we see them.","On the creative side, they made attempts to buy some creative agencies. Candidly, I think one of my competitors commented about some of the agencies that they bought. And I agree, I mean, the firepower that we have on the creative side of the business, and how it's embedded in what we do is going to be very difficult to unseat by these particular companies. That said, that's what we bring to the table when we compete with them. And we don't see a lot of them, but if we're going to see them, we see them more on the digital side than anywhere else. And frankly, we saw it in the case that I talked about. And, given the firepower that Huge brings to the table, both on the digital side, creative side, as well as other areas of insights that we bring, that we're comfortable in our ability to compete.","R\/GA I might add has also come up against them. And frankly, I think I mentioned this on the last call. There was one piece of business that we lost to one of them. And six months later, we got the business back, because they couldn't deliver. So, yeah, they're out there, they're trying and I understand it. And I've always said this. I think it's better for those firms to partner with us, than compete with us. I still am waiting for my phone call.","But, look, I do believe that they have some expertise, they have some relationships with clients that are very strong. And if we were to work closely with them and bring in our firepower with theirs to meet the needs of their clients, it's a pretty compelling offering. But who knows what's going to happen in the future. But right now, we're pretty comfortable with our ability to compete with them head to head.","Daniel Salmon","Okay. And then, if I can just follow up on that, if I think of the components of organic growth, traditionally that would be - obviously, new client wins and losses and the net impact there. Increases in spend from current clients, but you're always evolving your offering to meet the evolving needs of CMOs.","My question is, I don't know if we can quantify what that last portion is, but are these companies competing for that portion? More specifically, would you say like, we're focused on digital and those are the emerging services? But is that another way to approach this in sort of how you see them versus your business?","Michael Roth","Yeah, look, right now it's easier for them to focus on the digital side of the business. And again, it depends on which consultants you're talking about. Take business transformation, because that's really an area that, that - it's a different consultancy, right? And, for example, R\/GA and Huge have business transformation offerings that are very attractive. There we come across the consultants more than we do on the pure digital side.","But there we are able to bring in from cradle to grave all the different issues that business transformation requires, whether it'd be new product deliveries, whether it'd be design capability. All of these things are within our capabilities that we bring to the table. So that's - again, I think consultants have an ability on the business transformation side, because of the relationships they have with these clients.","But we have relationships, and you're right, the CMO will be a depository, if you will, of all these different offering and everyone banging on their door in terms of what they can bring to the table. And where there is wealth and we fought for those relationships. And what we do is with our clients we constantly bring to them the various offerings that we have within IPG or the network for example that's working with them, and the ability under the open architecture to bring in those resources to meet the needs of their clients.","That's what we have to do more of and that's why in these RFPs that we're getting they're asking us to put forth what we can deliver. So, yeah, the business is changing, but I'm very comfortable with what we have, whether it'd be through our global networks, McCann, FCB, MullenLowe, our digital capabilities and our media offerings. And then if you add PR to it, that's a very, very impressive resource that you bring to the table.","Daniel Salmon","Okay, great. Thank you.","Michael Roth","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have reached the bottom of the hour and the end of the call. I will turn it back to our speakers for closing thoughts.","Michael Roth","Okay. Well, thank you very much. And we'll see you at the end of the fourth quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time."],"11886":["The Interpublic Group Inc.

All parties are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jerry Leshne","Good morning. Thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com. This morning, we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 Eastern.","During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company. These are subject to the uncertainties in the cautionary statement that is included in our earnings release and the slide presentation and further detailed in our 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.","We will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP measures, allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance.","At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Jerry, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we review our results for the first quarter. As usual, I'll start out by covering the highlights of our performance, and Frank will then provide additional details and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies to followed by our Q&A.","We're pleased to report another quarter of strong financial performance. The organic growth of net revenue was 6.4% in the quarter that's on top of 3.6% a year ago, and brings organic growth over the trailing 12 months to 6.2%. These continue to be outstanding results, especially when compared to our peers.","In the U.S. organic growth was 5.7% and international growth was 7.7%. We again grew organically in every region of the world propelled by very broad participation across disciplines and client sectors.","In our integrated agency network segment, we achieved 7.4% organic growth in the quarter, with outstanding performance at Mediabrands, and FCBHealth along with notable contributions from the McCann Worldgroup, Deutsch and MullenLowe.","Our CMG segment grew 1.9% organically, which was led by another very strong advance in public relations and Weber Shandwick. Among clients sectors globally, we saw strong growth across healthcare, industrials, consumer goods, financial services and retail. The total growth of our net revenue was 13% in the quarter. That reflects our strong organic increase, as well as the revenue of Acxiom, which is not yet included in our calculation of organic growth. We continue to be pleased with Acxiom performance, which is on track with our expectations.","Total net revenue growth also reflects some year-over-year drag from the impact of currency changes. And apart from Acxiom, the net disposition of certain small businesses.","Turning to adjusted EBITDA and operating income, first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $103.6 million, which excludes the restructuring charge of approximately $32 million that we mentioned to you we'd be taking during February's conference call. While operating income was $50.2 million. Our adjusted EBITDA margin as a percent of net revenue increased 270 basis points to 5.2% compared with 2.5% in Q1 2018.","First quarter diluted loss per share was $0.02, and was positive $0.11 as adjusted for the charge. The amortization of acquired intangibles and below EBITDA net losses from the disposition of small, non-strategic agencies in the quarter. Adjusted EPS of $0.11 compares to $0.04 a year ago. During the quarter and as we announced in February, we increased our common share dividend by 12% to $0.235 per share, marking our seventh consecutive year of higher dividends.","While Q1 is our smallest seasonal quarter, our year is off to a very solid start. The results we're reporting this morning continue to demonstrate the many strengths of our company led by our client centric integrated offerings and the quality of our people. It's another quarter of organic growth atop our industry, the position we've held now for some time.","As such, this first quarter continues to underscore the quality of our talent and the successful evolution of our offerings, amid significant change in the environment in which we operate. All of our people can take pride in these accomplishments. The great work they do every day on behalf of our clients is what drives such winning results for clients and for our shareholders.","With these results, we continue to be comfortable with the financial targets for the full year that we recently shared with you, 2% to 3% organic growth, and 40 to 50 basis points of improvement to adjusted EBITDA margin. As always, we will update our outlook as the year progresses in our second quarter call.","On that note, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Frank, for additional detail on our performance, and I'll return with an update and highlights of our business.","Frank Mergenthaler","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. As a reminder, I'll [indiscernible] on the slide presentations that accompanies our webcast.","On slide two, you'll see a summary of our results. First quarter net revenue growth was 13% and organic growth was 6.4%. U.S. organic growth was 5.7% and international organic growth was 7.7%, with increases across all ranges in a range of 4.5% to 24%, in the case of LatAm. Q1 EBITDA of $104 million as adjusted for the charge to mainly address certain account losses. That compares with $44 million a year ago.","For the quarter, our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.11, which excludes the charge I just mentioned, the amortization of acquired intangibles, and $9 million of pre-tax losses below our operating income from the disposition of certain small, non-strategic agencies.","Turning to slide three, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. Here it's worth noting that interest expense increased as expected due to the financing we added in late September last year to buy Acxiom. Also note, that net other expense includes the $9 million of disposition losses.","Turning to Q1 revenue on slide four, net revenue was $2 billion, compared to Q1 2018, the impact of the change in exchange rates was a negative 2.8%, with the U.S. dollar stronger against every region. Net acquisitions added 9.4%, which represents the addition of Acxiom plus other net dispositions over the past 12 months, resulting organic revenue increase was 6.4%.","At the bottom of the slide, we break out our operating segments. As you can see, our IAN segment was our principal growth driver in the quarter, with 7.4% organic growth. Underneath that terrific result was growth in all major disciplines including media, our creative led integrated offerings and our healthcare specialist. Total growth in IAN was 15.5%, which includes Acxiom. At our CMG segment, organic growth was 1.9% in the quarter, driven by another quarter standout growth by Weber Shandwick.","Moving on to slide five, revenue by region. In the U.S. first quarter organic growth was net revenue was 5.7%. Our growth was led by our IAN segment with standout performances by IPG Mediabrands, FCB, MullenLowe and Deutsch.","In our CMG segment, marketing services specialist growth continued in Q1 at Weber Shandwick. Note that total U.S. growth was 20% which includes Acxiom.","Our international markets, - in our international markets we had another strong quarter as well, with organic growth of 7.7%. In the U.K., organic growth was 5.7%, a very solid increase on top of 7.8% in Q1 2018. Leading client sectors included CPG, financial services and retail.","In Continental Europe, organic growth was 7.6%. This was highlighted by very strong growth in each of our national markets, Germany, France, Spain and Italy. In Asia Pac, our largest international region net organic revenue growth was 4.5% in Q1. Among our largest national markets, growth was paced by Japan, India and China, with a decrease in Australia.","LatAm grew 23.8% organically in Q1 with strong organic growth across the region led by Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina. In our other markets group organic growth was 5.2%, led again by strong growth in Canada.","Moving on to slide six and operating expenses, which were again well controlled in the quarter. Compared to net revenue growth of 13% the net operating expenses increased only 9.9% as adjusted for the chart this year in the amortization of acquired intangibles.","Our ratio of total salaries and related expense to revenue in our seasonally small first quarter was 70.9%, an improvement of 410 basis points. This reflects leverage in the base IPG business as well as benefit from the consolidation of Acxiom.","Underneath that we continue to drive efficiencies in our investment in base payroll and benefits, which is our largest cost category, in which leverage improved by 290 basis points. We also saw solid operating leverage on our temporary labor, severance and other salaries and related, which was slightly offset by the increased expense of performance based employee incentive compensation as a percent of net revenue.","At quarter end, total headcount was approximately 54,000, an increase of 7.8% from a year ago, with more than half of the increase due to the addition of Acxiom and the balance due to the many growing areas of our portfolio.","Our office and other direct expense was 19.4% in the first quarter net revenue compared with 18.3% a year ago, with office and other expense, we levered our expense for occupancy by 60 basis points from a year ago. That was more than offset by the expense profile of Acxiom, which is accretive to our margins overall, while consolidating relatively more investment in data and technology.","Our SG&A expense increased as reported to 2.1% of net revenue, which again reflects some increases in our expense for performance based incentive compensation. Our expense for depreciation increased 2.5% of net revenue, which is due to the consolidation of Acxiom this year, as was the case for our amortization expense, which was $21.6 million in the quarter.","Our restructuring charge is approximately $32 million, which is toward the lower end of the $30 million to $40 million range, we had shared with you in February. The charge is mainly to address the headcount and real estate related to certain accounts loss towards the end of last year. These were principal U.S. costs and accordingly we expect to realize a reasonably short payback period in this action.","Turning to slide seven, we present detail on adjustments to our reported first quarter results, in order to give you better transparency, and a picture of comparable performance. This begins on the left hand side with our reported results and steps through the adjusted EBITDA and our adjusted diluted EPS.","Our D&A expense includes $21.6 million of the amortization of acquired intangibles and the restructuring charge of $31.8 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA of $103.6 million.","Below operating expenses, we had a loss in the quarter of $8.6 million in other expenses related to disposition of few small non-strategic businesses. At the middle of slide, you can see the after tax impact per diluted share of each of these adjustments. Their total is $0.13 per diluted share, which is the difference between the reported loss of $0.02 per diluted share and income of $0.11 as adjusted.","On slide eight, we turn to Q1 cash flow. Cash used in operations was $94 million compared with the use of $730 million a year ago. As you know, our operating cash flow is highly seasonal, and can be volatile by quarter. We typically generate significant cash from work up in the fourth quarter and use cash in the first quarter. During this year's first quarter cash used in working capital was $166 million. That historical low cash use of Q1 was due to the timing of large collections and disbursements around last year end and the first few business days of this year.","Investing activities used $31 million in the quarter for CapEx. Our financing activities provided $87 million net due to an increase in short term borrowings, mainly utilizing our commercial paper program. We used $91 million for our common stock dividend. Our net decrease in cash for the quarter was $44 million.","Slide nine is the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the year with $631 million of cash equivalents. Under current liabilities is it worth calling to your attention, the current portion of operating leases at $263 million, which is new. This is our first reporting period under ASC 842, which is the new standard for lease accounting.","Accordingly, we have recognized a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability in our balance sheet. The current portion of our lease liability is shown on the slide. Our long-term lease obligation as of March 31st, is $1.2 billion, while our right of use asset is $1.4 billion. We expect that the new lease accounting will not have any significant impact on our results of operations or cash flows.","Slide 10 depicts the maturities of our outstanding debt. The total debt at quarter end at $3.9 billion and diversified terms and maturities going forward.","In summary on slide 11, while Q1 is our smallest seasonal quarter, we are pleased with the start of our year. Our teams continue to execute very well, our balance sheet continues to be a strong and meaningful source of value creation, all of which, has us well positioned.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Michael.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Frank. As I mentioned at the outset, we're pleased with results in the quarter. While the headline news may be a strong organic revenue growth, we also saw a good new business performance, the onboarding of impressively talent and very high levels of industry recognition.","We invest in our people, and always put our clients and agency brands first. Our results this quarter show that we remain on the right track.","Growth in the quarter came from a very broad range of both our existing and new clients, as well as a cross section of our agencies. It's fair to say that our top line performance during the quarter is in line with our expectations. It's also worth noting that the client losses that we saw in the back half of 2018 had yet to impact our results. While there is still macro uncertainty, we continue to believe that economic fundamentals are sound, especially in the U.S., where we once again delivered industry leading performance.","As we've noted before, we operate in a media landscape that evolves at a rapid pace. Media channels continue to fragment and clients face an increasingly complex consumer environment, in which data which fuels the digital economy is central to most contemporary media offerings, and marketing capabilities.","To address today's marketplace, we acquired Acxiom, adding a foundational world class data asset. This future facing step for IPG benefits our clients and shareholders alike as we bring our ability to manage and leverage data at scale to market. Acxiom enables us to develop deeper relationships in the marketplace among clients, consumers and media.","As we previously stated, we have notably been focused on leveraging Acxiom with our media assets initially. Going forward, we see Acxiom adding tremendous opportunity for our creative assets as well. Allowing for personalized storytelling done globally and at scale for our clients.","Turning to our, Integrated Agency Network or IAN am reporting segments, which includes Acxiom and Mediabrands, as well as our creative networks. Mediabrands, again led the quarter posting a very strong performance initiative was recognized as Ad Age comeback Agency of the Year and Ad Week U.S. Media Agency of the Year and continue to add new business in the quarter, including clients Nintendo and Dir. Pepper [ph].","The agency's unique culture driven reverse upfront continues to gain attention with marketers and the industry. UM added energizer and TGI Friday's to its roster and was named a standout agency by Ad Age, as well as the Best Place to Work in 2019.","MAGNA continues to stay on top of ad trends releasing its latest predictions for the U.S. this month. The agency also appointed its first U.S. president now one of the top women in the media buying space. McCann World Group saw another solid performance starting the year strong with major industry accolades. You may have seen that just last week the FE index named McCann World Group the Most Creatively Effective Network in the World for the second year in a row. This follows another impressive number one creatively effective network ranking on 2019 WARC effective 100 list.","At the Ad Age, A list and creativity awards McCann was recognized among the top 10 industry performers with its global Chief Strategy Officer named Chief Strategy Officer of the Year. The network also saw senior leadership appointments globally, McCann, Canada, MRM McCann London named new CEOs, McCann welcomed a Global Chief Creative Officer and McCann World Group has just been named ADT's Creative and Strategic Agency of Record.","FCB saw a strong quarter with a number of new business wins in global markets. The agency was also named to the top 10 list of industry performers at the Ad Age A list awards and FCB 6 the network's Toronto-based unit was awarded Data Analytics Agency of the Year. We have an exceptional group of healthcare agencies on the IPG and FCB Health continues to be a major driver of growth.","Just recently FCB Health named a new Executive Creative Director in New York. MullenLowe continues to perform very well in new business on boarding a number of significant accounts this quarter. Notable wins, included Great [indiscernible] Sennheiser global consumer business and Mediahub's recent agency of record win, Fox Sports and Fox Entertainment. Mediahub was also recently named Media Agency of the Year by Ad Age.","RGA under the leadership of its new global CEO was named the Magic Quadrant Leader amongst global marketing agencies by Gartner and an Ad Age agency to watch and the agencies venture studio announced it will be partnering with Kinship the newly launch ventures tech and business innovation arm of Mars Pet Care for the RGA innovation exchange this year. The program will feature female led international startups that are building consumer brands of the future.","Brooklyn based Huge gained four prominent clients this quarter, realtor.com. Brooks Running, Value Retail and most recently Sinai Health. The agency was named the visionary among global marketing agencies on Gartner's magic quadrant. Our U.S. integrated independent agencies continue to round out our portfolio, they delivered the full suite of marketing services to their clients and can also combine with the rest of the IPG offerings on the collaborative, open architecture solutions.","Highlights within this group came from Deutsch, an agency that just won Reebok, the Martin Agency, which just work with initiative to an open architecture collaboration to bring in UPS globally at the start of the first quarter. The agency also expanded its relationship with Buffalo Wild Wings and launched a cultural impact lab within its creative department and its first ever female CEO was just named Executive of the Year by Ad Age.","How Michael Lynch and call Michael Lynch relate added Xcel Energy and Red Wing Shoe to the client roster, respectively. And Hill Holliday launched Hill Holliday Health, the agency's very own dedicated healthcare practice. South Carolina based EPM Company one of IPG's agencies to watch continues the successful run of client growth and was named the standout agency by Ad Age.","At CMG our marketing services agency saw a positive organic growth, Weber Shandwick and Golin continue to be standouts among PR agency networks. Weber Shandwick aided influence responsibilities for Kellogg U.S. and PR agency of record for Buick and GMC. The firm's president was named Agency Professional of the Year by PRWeek U.S. showing that IPG has the top woman leader in the PR space. The agency also announced expansion with technology and corporate expertise with the addition of new senior leaders in the U.S. West region, as well as the launch of MediaGenius, a resource for deeper learning on the forces shaping today's tech driven media landscape.","This quarter, Golin launched the industry's first consumer experience PR suite CXPR marrying customer care with public relations to drive sales and reputation. It was an exciting quarter for the Octagon Sports and Entertainment Network as Rogers and Collins VIP Services division Film Fashion and Octagon Celebrity Consultancy First Call were both rebranded as ITB Worldwide.","At Jack Morton, one of the world's largest experiential agencies, we saw new clients added this quarter, including James and Irish Whiskey and MillerCoors and the appointment of a new Chief Creative Officer.","When we say we are client centric holding company, it means we support and invest in our agency brands, and put collaboration at our core. This focus has meant we remain vital in new business. We drive high levels of industry recognition, and we are able to attract and retain diverse talent who want to develop their careers with us.","The best creative ideas come from strong agency brands. These kinds of ideas of platforms that help our clients uncover new ways of doing business. Creativity also enables our integrated marketing experts to craft campaigns that connect more deeply with people and help brands earn their way into people's lives. Ultimately, this means that our most creative people can actually build the new products and services that help clients drive business transformation.","The strength of our agencies was made clear two weeks ago, when IPG agencies dominated the Ad Age A list awards, with more agencies included in the evening than any other holding company.","This investment in people and brands also explains why LinkedIn recently ranked IPG the number one holding company to work for within the ad sector. And why just a few weeks ago, the Human Rights Campaign named IPG, a Best Place to Work the LGBTE quality, marking our 10th year of receiving the ladder distinction.","Looking ahead, new business activity remains sound. And we're seeing all of our agencies invited in a range of opportunities. Of course, we also remain disciplined when it comes to managing costs. This is what has allowed us to make such great strides when it comes to enhancing the company's profitability over the long-term.","The first quarter is seasonally our smallest quarter. And we have most of 2019 still ahead of us. But the tone of the business is solid, as you've seen today. Our client conversations are constructive with respect to their plans for brand investment, and consumer engagement. These discussions reflect the value that we bring to the table and helping clients navigate the complex media and consumer environment.","The results that we're sharing today is indicative of the solid start to 2019. We believe that we remain well positioned to deliver the financial targets that we outlined earlier this year of 2% to 3% organic growth. Given the headwinds we'll be facing as well as the fact we will be comping against industry leading growth rates, targeting competitive organic growth performance speaks to the strength of our underlying offerings.","Along with this level of growth, we continue to target adjusted EBITDA operating margin of 40 to 50 basis points compared to our 2018 results, excluding the impact of our charge in this quarter. This builds on a strong long-term record in this area. At the same time we will continue to invest in the outstanding talent and emerging capabilities that are required to position us for the long-term.","Combined with the transformative opportunities of our enhanced ability to connect marketing with data and our commitment to capital return, that means there remain significant potential for value creation and enhance shareholder value. As always, it's appropriate to thank our clients and our people who are the foundation of our success.","With that, I'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JP Morgan. You may ask your question.","Alexia Quadrani","Hi, thank you very much. I guess, Michael, looking at the impressive outperformance once again in the quarter, can you provide a bit more detail on I guess what were the drivers behind it specifically? I know you touched on a lot in your opening comments. You talked about the strength in Mediabrands and the Health Group, for example, and the verticals. But I'm trying to really more figure out how much is just this ongoing healthy growth we're seeing in your underlying business versus maybe how much was still a benefit or more an additional benefit, I should say from new business tailwinds?","Michael Roth","Well, there's nothing wrong with having new business tailwinds. And certainly the fact that we came into the year with new business on the box and we've actually had a good first quarter in terms of new business add that helps. And that's the solid sign of our tone.","I think, we said this now we've outperformed now for like five years, something like that. And I think it really goes through our strategy and our core competencies, we really - the notion of open architecture, the notion of having strong brands that we bring to the table to focus on the client's needs, and we have the resources and talent to meet those needs. I think we're seeing that in our results.","I've attended a number of these top to top meetings with the senior management CEOs of our clients and we're sitting in a room with media, with FCB and McCann with Weber, we're all sitting in the same room focusing on client's needs. I mean, that that is what clients want to see from us. And if you look at our new business wins, you see that cross collaboration of our agencies coming to life. And I think clients realize that we have the resources to meet their needs. And frankly, if the agency of record is not the agency that is bringing it to them, they can look to the rest of IPG to solve their solutions.","And I strongly believe that the fact that we have the talent, we have a solid organization that is stable. We continue to outperform, which is an indication that we continue to have a strong retention of our key people and we continue to invest. I think the Acxiom investment that we made is proving out, I mean, a lot of the meetings that we're having include Acxiom sitting at the table. And frankly, we really even haven't rolled out these opportunities we see with Acxiom as we said, we're going to do that later in this year. So the integration of Acxiom is going along very nicely, and it's evident in the new business and servicing our clients.","So I think when you put it all together and the fact that we still maintain those brands and clients like to be dealing with brands and we continue to invest it, we didn't reposition all of our assets to do what we should be able to do just by bringing in the best of IPG and the tone reflects that.","Alexia Quadrani","And then just a follow-up, if I May, if we look forward, I know you don't like when I ask more short term questions, but I'm going to sneak one in. We've heard some of the accounts seem a bit slower to move the ones that have announced they might be - they're shifting agencies. They seem a bit slow to move. But I noticed in your opening remarks, you also mentioned that you didn't really feel a lot of the losses that you - a few losses that you had in the back half of the year. You haven't felt them in Q1 yet. Should we assume that maybe some of those headline losses are more of a second half of the year headwind versus Q2?","Michael Roth","Yes. Which - I thought you were going to ask right out, why you were 2% to 3% when you have such a strong first quarter.","Alexia Quadrani","That could be my next one.","Michael Roth","Okay, well and look we're very transparent, we called out that we have the headwinds, I hate losing clients and we lost a number of clients at the end of the year. And as I said, we're not going to see the impact of that starting in the second quarter, but on the second half of the year, which is why the 2% to 3% - by the way, 2% to 3%, still is on the high end of our sector, and that builds into the loss of those clients. We do a bottoms up for the full year when we put out that number.","So the loss of those clients are reflected in our forecast. And we're still forecasting numbers that are better than the sector. So I think it goes to the confidence we have in our people and our agencies. And yes, I mean, that's why we've kept it at 2% to 3%.","Now, hopefully, when we get to the second quarter, we're going to take another hard look at that, and see how the new business wins are coming on board and how we're performing and we'll take another look at that number. But that's the reason we haven't adjusted 2% to 3% and I think it's a smart thing to do given that we haven't yet seen the impact of those client losses.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you so much.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Alexia.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, you may ask your question.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you, good morning. Michael, I don't know if you were surprise or not when Publicis bought Epsilon, I am sure you had some reaction that you won't share on this call. But I was really hoping to get how you see the competitive landscape shifting as we see a lot of your competitors diving dig into sort of the broad data technology world in a way we haven't seen in the past.","And when you guys announced the Acxiom last year, obviously it was a big deal for IPG and it's been a lot of focus on it. And I'm just wondering if you could update us on how you look at these assets and how you think they compare to what your competitors are pulling together either through acquisitions like Epsilon or maybe through the organic stuff like omni? Because it seems like this is - you started a trend that I don't think is finished. So I love to hear your thoughts on that.","Michael Roth","Yes, look, I mean, when we brought Acxiom frankly the good news is when we bought Acxiom we had choices right, there were other assets out there and we chose the asset that we felt best provided us from a cultural fit, as well as the capabilities that we see that we need. And so we continue to believe that we were fortunate to be able to pick up Acxiom. And yes, I think we've been looking at data as a critical piece of the future facing IPG for a number of years now. And what's great about Acxiom for us is that we were already working with Acxiom.","So the culture fit was clear to us. We looked at the issue of integration. Unfortunately in our industry integration is not exactly the strongest suite as proved by some of the transactions that are out there. So what we like about Acxiom is the fact that we believe and it's working out that way that the integration of Acxiom with us is going to be smooth, look, it's not without bumps, but it's smooth because we know them, they fit culturally, we're not duplicating assets within IPG that we have to worry about as some of these other transactions may indicate.","They have the core competencies that we were looking for, we view data management as a critical piece of the future part of our business and Acxiom is the leader in data management. We felt that privacy in GDPR was a critical component and Acxiom is rated five start Forester the other offerings that are out there are not. The issue of LiveRamp was one of the questions and we felt that LiveRamp raised some potential issues on conflict and so what we did was, we have a choice. We have a long-term agreement with LiveRamp, which we continue to use, but if our clients want to use another offering, we're comfortable doing that and plugging it in where some of these other transactions, it's part of their core competency.","So, I think, there is an inherent issue of conflict going forward and the key to a lot of these transactions is a smooth integration. And we believe that Acxiom for us gives us a competitive advantage on the integration and the core offerings that they have going forward. And frankly time will tell. We're very comfortable with our competitive position clearly in the integrated offering and our results reflect this. And when you add the Acxiom capabilities to best-in-class offerings that we have, we're very comfortable with our competitive position. Even with the transactions that are out there.","Ben Swinburne","Just a follow up, let me be more specifically are you now bringing Acxiom folks into pitches with your broader organization. And you mentioned in your prepared remarks, creative to serve and not an obvious one for this business is that something that you're already starting to weave into the pitch activity in new business or is that further down the line? Just any specifics on the integration would be helpful.","Michael Roth","Yes, we said at that outset that we don't want - the worst thing you can do, because we feel the opportunities with Acxiom is so great is to inundate them with opportunities and basically really confuse and stretch the people and the integration. So we chose intentionally just try it on the medial side. And as I indicated in my remarks we don't - it's not until the latter part of this year that the new products that we were looking at that Acxiom in our media offerings are looking at are not going to be rolled out.","So, yes, we do believe that creative and our other offerings even PR have a tremendous opportunity using the capabilities of Acxiom. But we haven't really rolled it out but that doesn't mean we haven't had our clients meet with Acxiom. So what we are doing, in fact, if you look at some of the new wins that we've had Acxiom had a seat at the table. And I wouldn't tell you that it was a critical piece, although we did win some big media business where Acxiom arguably had a critical piece in the win.","But as far as the integration of Acxiom with our other agencies, the mere fact that they're sitting at the table, and it's an interesting offering, that clients are really interested in learning about, helped us in the wins. But I'm not going to tell you that that was the critical linchpin in the wind, but let's face it. When you sit at a table and you have the creative capability we have, we have the PR capability, we have the experiential sports and now we have data capability, all sitting in the room, addressing the questions of our clients. It's the holy grail of our business. So - which is why we're so excited about it.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Salmon with the BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Dan Salmon","Hey, good morning, everyone. Michael, I'm going to ask about M&A a little bit too. But the one I'm interested in is Accenture and Droga [ph], I'd love to hear your\u2026","Michael Roth","That question was going to come up either.","Dan Salmon","I figured you were prepared for it. But just your latest thoughts on where not just Accenture, but the traditional consultants sit in terms of their ambitions of continuing to come into the agency and marketing services were it's a business services model. It's not a piece of technology or anything like that. But love to hear your thoughts on that.","And then just to circle back on the sort of short-term organic questions, I just want to confirm I think you did say in your prepared results that the first quarter organic growth was in line with your expectations. I know you guys don't guide quarterly, but just maybe to reiterate that.","And one last one for Frank, you look with the good performance of the company, that leverage is headed in all the right directions that it should be, but your updated thoughts on the pathway for the balance sheet and the potential restart of share repurchases. I think that's something investors are interested to hear about too.","Michael Roth","All of that Dan. Okay. First of all, yes, it's in line. I mean, it's hard to forecast the 6% organic growth, but we know the first quarter was going to be solid. I kid you if I can tell you, we forecasted it to be 6%. But I think it is consistent with a roll up of all of our agencies. So that part of it is true.","Look, the consultants are out there, and again, I'll say, we are just in our business reviews, and actually we're doing our talent reviews right now. We haven't seen a lot of our fees were competing with Accenture. Now, that doesn't mean we're not competing with them. They're already at our clients, which is the - that's the hidden competition that's there. And sometimes there's businesses that they just give to the consultants that they're not giving to us. And that's why part of our business strategy, for example, in Huge and RGA and some of our other agencies, we have business transformation as an expertise that we can bring into our clients itself.","In fact, this morning, we're going to be meeting with one of our top clients where RGA has put forth a business transformation case study for them that they're very excited about. And clearly that's the area that we compete with the consultants and it proves that we can compete with them very well.","So, yes, they're a force. We've been competing with them now for a while now, it's not news. So the fact that we continue to outperform is an indication that when we go up against them, we do fairly well. But it's those pitches that we don't really get to see that I think when you hear them talking about their growth in their businesses that's there.","And we're trying to get at that by expanding our business transformation expertise within our agencies. The fact that they acquired Droga. Look, we compete with Accenture, we compete with Droga. In fact, the win that McCann just had at ADT, Droga was one of the competitors that they won. I told you guys, I'll get to that.","So, we're going to compete with them. Now one of the issues of these consulting firms is they are silos, they make our silos look like cakewalk. And the ability for an Accenture to integrate Droga is going to be interesting to watch. Frankly, Droga was with another organization before that, and I don't think there was a lot of integration going on there. So, this will be - they're a formidable agency and we'll continue to compete against them and will continue to compete against Accenture.","But the difference is, we have the capabilities and now with the data and with the business transformation consultants that we have in-house, I think we're more formidable for them now. And that's our strategy, how we're going to deal with them. It's part of the business and what's interesting is everything you're seeing happening there is kind of copying our game plan. So, I guess, that's an indication that what we're doing is going pretty well.","Our balance sheet - I mean, we committed to the rating agencies that we're going to be out in the market, we're making progress on those numbers. And as soon as we feel comfortable with the rating agencies, we'll return to buying back shares. In the meantime, we increased our dividend, we understand the importance of buybacks to total shareholder return. We've returned $4 billion to shareholders, including dividends and buybacks, and that's part of our game plan moving forward. Whether it's going to be x date or another, I can't give you an answer to that. But it is on our game plan to get back into the market with those options.","Dan Salmon","Thank you, Michael.","Michael Roth","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Nolan with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open, you may ask your question.","Tim Nolan","Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about Acxiom, coming back to this again. Could you discuss, if this deal is more about third-party or about first-party [Technical difficulty] some comments this week, about a possible flow there in targeted advertising to come for it in the second half of this year, I was quite surprised to hear that especially talking about GDPR for them. But you seem to be pointing to third-party data and regulation around that as being the issue for them. I just wondered if you could maybe comment on if you're seeing anything there? And sort of what Acxiom does you in that regard, if it's more the first party data that gives you the advantage?","Michael Roth","By the way, I'm sorry, your questions, I didn't get to all your questions, they were kind of garbled, I'll try to guess what you said. Look, when we looked at Acxiom, they have a first party data management business that's 70% of their business, okay. And that's a core business that we like, that's a core business that's going to grow. And if you look at the reach of that business and the client base that they have, they do 50 of the top 100 companies. So that is a key driver in acquiring Acxiom.","Third-party data is always going to be an issue. And there were plenty of outlets for third-party data and obviously, Acxiom has capabilities in those areas. But as I said before, we - that doesn't mean we're wedded to one particular source of that and we continue to have use other third-party data. But I think the core competency of Acxiom in terms of first party data and managing that data is a critical reason for the transaction. And the use of third-party data is inherent in our business and it will continue to be a key part of it and Acxiom will play an important role of it. So I think all of that is true.","And on the GDPR, we're just beginning to see that happening in the United States. And as you know, we're all pushing for uniform legislation. What a nightmare it would be, if we have state by state GDPR. But the fact that Acxiom is the recognized leader in this, and we have experience with it is another core competency that Acxiom brings to the table that we will certainly leverage as we move forward.","Tim Nolan","Yes, that answers it. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Your line is open, you may ask your question.","Jason Bazinet","I just had one question around sort of your comments about industry leading growth and that being driven impart by your open architecture. I guess my question is, if everyone is sort of following your lead on the data side with Epsilon and Merkel, which parallels what you did with Acxiom where would - how would you characterize where the industry is in terms of arranging their assets more effectively to compete with IPG? Do you see movement on that front? Or do you still feel like you're ahead of the pack? Thanks.","Michael Roth","Well, I will tell you that five years ago, all the holding companies were similar, right. And it was appropriate to look at when one holding company perform one way, you would expect the other companies to do the same. I think right now, you're actually seeing a disparity in the go to market strategies in the assets within the holding company for the first time. And Acxiom as part of our portfolio is one of the drivers that distinguishes us from our competitors. The fact that they're out there, Merkel actually to be truthful, Merkel was a transaction that occurred before Acxiom, we did look at Merkel, I will tell you that and it's a good asset.","But the fact that [indiscernible] had Merkel now for a while, and we've been competing against them, or actually we're competing against them before we had Acxiom and we did okay. So with Acxiom, we're pretty confident that we can continue to do well from a competitive set.","What happens with Epsilon and Publicis, this isn't an easy thing to do integrate, and I think the history of integration there hasn't been exactly stellar. So, we'll deal with them in the marketplace. And I think, certainly, it's an attempt by them to be more in line with ourselves and others in our industry. So yes, it's capabilities when you're successful everyone wants to have similar capabilities. So, yes, I think the answer is there is a convergence, but we have a good head start. And even when we're competing head-to-head, I think our results indicated that our assets are better than the others.","Jason Bazinet","Can I just ask one follow-up, if I think about the sort of the world of data, it seems like what we're talking about, and maybe I'm wrong, but with Merkel and Acxiom and Epsilon is sort of a pretty narrow slice of data capabilities, meaning it's the raw data, but there's a ton of other capabilities that you need on top of that. Are there other sort of pieces of the data puzzle that you or others in the industry need to crack the code on? Or is it really just a function of once we have the raw sort of inputs, IPG sort of knows what to do with it.","Michael Roth","My guess would be, now that you see these transaction in these data companies, there'll be startups that are focusing on holes within those assets. And then, you'll see acquisitions going on within that space. So there's always going to be a bigger boat, or a new offering, that we will be opportunistic in the marketplace. Right now, these are the players that are out there. And we're very happy with our positioning in that market. But we are - we do believe that there'll be other offerings out there as the market evolves.","So, yes, I mean if you look at our industry right now, five years ago, it was a totally different environment. So the reason we bought Acxiom is because five years from now, we want to still be relevant and competitive.","Jason Bazinet","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with Moffett Nathanson. Your line is open, you may ask your question.","Michael Roth","Michael?","Michael Nathanson","Hey. Can you hear me?","Michael Roth","Yes, yes.","Michael Nathanson","Oh, cool. Thanks. So, I have one for Michael and one for Frank. So for Michael, what are the keys to IPG's growth has been healthcare. It's been pretty impressive. So I know you call it FCB Health this quarter. But when you step back the past year or two, what is driving in that growth, is it a capability, is it client wins, special sauce you have in healthcare? Because it's truly fascinating any other company in the space that you compete with?","Michael Roth","Yes, I know. It's a fair question, actually 26% of our business is in healthcare. And by the way, McCann Health is a global health care provider, we need to exclude them, I said we had healthcare assets within IPG and McCann Health is certainly a key part of that. And yes, I think that's where the action is right now. Frankly, if you look at where a lot of the media bodies are right now, a lot of the media spend is in the healthcare side of the business.","What we do what always impresses me about our healthcare offerings is the depth of our expertise in terms of - it's actually experts, and it goes to the pharma side of the business and capabilities by drugs. And we have the ability to fill teams that know that specific disease, and we have doctors and we have experts within it communicating with the doctors themselves in terms of how you - how these particular drugs are used, and when is it appropriate.","So the depth of our expertise within IPG and healthcare is just amazing. And like I said, when you use open architecture, we can actually pick the right agency by disease. So one of the tops that I was sitting at was a healthcare client. And we had FCB Health and we had McCann Health sitting in the room because each of them have a different expertise that the clients want to tap into. I mean, that's the most powerful offering you can have.","So I think it's not by accident that we're seeing growth, because candidly, we have that kind of capabilities. And it's, the creative part of it, it's the data part of it. We have unique data with respect to healthcare, and we have all these tools and resources that are just amazing. And when you see it come to life in these meetings with their clients, you feel good and you understand why not only is it 26% of our business is growing double-digits. So that's a pretty good combination to have in this environment.","Now, that said, I remember when healthcare was not growing double-digits when a lot of the products were coming off of patent and the generics were there. So right now, there's a healthy pipeline of new drugs and we're a very competitive force in that marketplace. And I like our positioning in it for sure.","Michael Nathanson","Okay. And then can I guess you ask Frank one math one, I can't believe you made it this far. We got questions this morning on organic growth at Acxiom because I know there's a divestment number in the acquisition number, but when you look at the growth from last year. Looks like it's slowed down a lot this quarter. So can you help us understand the actual organic growth in Acxiom this quarter?","Frank Mergenthaler","Michael, we don't disclose it. It's growing consistent with our expectations, the business is healthy. So I don't know what math you're doing, but we're not going to get into talking on the call about things that are not in public disclosure.","Michael Nathanson","Okay, thanks.","Frank Mergenthaler","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Joyce with Evercore ISI. Your line is open, you may ask your question.","David Joyce","Thank you. Just a follow up on the Acxiom discussion. When you are meeting with clients and talking about data privacy concerns. What's the current status there? I know we're still waiting for legislation, but are there concerns that you have competitors that may be using the service as well or might be leaving, if you could just talk about those puts and takes?","Michael Roth","I can't talk about our competitors, but I can tell you our capabilities. And we've been through it in Europe. We came through it very well. We didn't see any hiccups on GDPR, we saw actually there were more opt ins than opt outs. So everything was handled pretty smoothly. And that gives us a high level of comfort that when it gets launched in the United States, our capabilities are going to stand out again. And frankly, that's why Forrester has us rated as hot.","Look, the key to this is trust. And it's very important when clients turn over their data or work with their data, that they do it with an organization that has that kind of reputation of trust and has the experience and that's what we liked about Acxiom, the longevity of the relationship with the clients is amazing. Their view of the client surveys on their capabilities have been very impressive. And even when we did our due diligence on buying Acxiom, they were onboarding a new client and the feedback we got from that particular client on onboarding versus where they were was pretty impressive.","So I'm very comfortable that whatever comes out in GDPR in U.S., we have the assets that will be very competitive and solve our client's needs.","David Joyce","Thank you.","Operator","At this time, I'll turn the call back over to Michael for final thoughts.","Michael Roth","Well, I thank you all for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir you may begin.","Jerome J. Leshne","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Thank you as well for your patience this morning as the release was behind schedule due to problems at our service provider. But we have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com, and we'll refer to both in the course of this call.","This morning we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 a.m. Eastern.","During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company, which are subject to the uncertainties in the cautionary statement included in our earnings release and the slide presentation and further detailed in our 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.","At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael I. Roth","Thank you, Jerry, and thank you for joining us for our review of our second quarter and first half 2012 results. As usual, I'll start out by covering the key highlights of our performance, Frank will then provide additional details on our results and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies and outlook to be followed by a Q&A.","To begin with the highlights, we're pleased to report Q2's diluted earnings per share growth of 16%, along with operating margin expansion that supports our targets for the year. Our organic revenue growth in the second quarter was 0.8% and 1.7% for the first half of the year.","In the U.S., our organic revenue decrease in Q2 was 3.2%. The approximate 5% impact of last year's account losses more than offset sound U.S. performance. We had growth at several of our integrated agencies and across the CMG portfolio.","Our digital services continue to make strong contributions. That includes both the capabilities we built within our agencies and, of course, our digital specialty agencies.","Internationally, organic growth in the second quarter was 6%. In the Asia Pac and LatAm regions, double-digit growth was due to the strength of all our global networks: Media businesses, digital capabilities and our marketing services specialists.","In the U.K., we again had solid growth in Q2, while in Continental Europe, organic revenue decreased moderately due to continued macro challenges. Turning to the client sectors. We had growth during the quarter in auto and transportation, financial services and food and beverage. As expected, we had decreases in the tech and telecom and consumer goods categories. It's worth noting that absent the loss of SC Johnson, the consumer goods category showed solid growth, a sign that our U.S. business is solid.","In health care, we continue to see industry-wide softness due to patent expirations and regulatory uncertainty. Retail sector revenues in the quarter decreased due to some pullback from existing clients. These trends weighed particularly heavy on our U.S. revenue in the quarter.","For the year-to-date, we are net new business positive. I'll cover specific wins when I provide detail on the agencies in my closing remarks. But we've seen good results thus far this year in major pitches, such as Bank of America, Unilever, as well as with growth with current clients like Microsoft and General Motors.","While first half revenue growth is below our full-year objectives, we are targeting a stronger second half and our full-year objective continues to be 3% organic growth.","Moving to operating expenses and margin, our results continue to reflect careful and effective cost management, along with disciplined investment in the growth areas of our businesses, through talent acquisition and development as well as targeted M&A activity.","Q2 operating margin increased 30 basis points to 10.3%. For the first half of 2012, our operating margin was also up 30 basis points compared to a year ago. On a trailing 12-month basis, our operating margin increased to 9.9%, which is once again the highest level of 12-month profitability that IPG has posted in over a decade.","We are well-positioned to deliver on our 2012 objective of 50 basis points or more of margin improvement. Q2 diluted earnings per share were $0.22, an improvement of 16% from a year ago. Diluted shares decreased 13% as a result of our share repurchase program and the elimination of the convertible notes retired earlier this year.","We continue to place a priority on returning capital to shareholders in the quarter. During the second quarter, we repurchased another 6 million shares, bringing our first half total to 11 million shares. Along with our quarterly common stocks dividend, we returned over $170 million to shareholders in the first half of 2012. Given the seasonality of our cash flows, we are planning to increase our share repurchase activity in the second half of 2012.","With that as an overview, I'll turn things over to Frank who will take us through our financial performance.","Frank Mergenthaler","Good morning. As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast.","On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of our results. Organic growth was 0.8% in Q2, result of solid international growth of 6% organically and lower U.S. revenue. Q2 operating income was $176 million. Operating margin was 10.3%, an improvement of 30 basis points compared to last year second quarter. The sequential progression of our expense base from Q1 to Q2 continue to be very well controlled. As a result, trailing 12-month operating margin increased to 9.9% and conversion of our constant currency revenue growth to operating profit is well over 30% for the trailing 12 months.","Our Q2 diluted earnings per share was $0.22 compared to $0.19 a year ago. We maintained strong liquidity with $1.5 billion of cash and short-term marketable securities on the balance sheet at quarter end compared with $1.8 billion a year ago. That comparison includes having used $640 million to repurchase shares, pay common dividends and pay down long-term debt over the past 12 months. To be clear, the comparison does not include our remaining stake in Facebook.","Turning to Slide 3. You see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail on the slides that follow. It's worth noting a couple of items. Our effective income tax rate in the quarter was 32.3%, which due to discrete items in the quarter is below what we consider underlying run rate this year of around 37%. Our average basic share count for the quarter was 437 million shares, a decrease of 8% from a year ago. Average diluted shares for the quarter decreased 13%, which reflects the retirement from convertible debt in March.","Turning to operations on Slide 4, beginning with revenue. Revenue in the quarter is $1.72 billion, a reported decrease of 1.4%. Compared to Q2 of 2011, the impact of changes in exchange rates was a negative 280 basis points. It's worth noting that we were well-matched in functional currencies between revenue and operating expenses, so there was minimal impact to our operating income and margin from change in exchange rates. The effect of net acquisitions and dispositions added 60 basis points of revenue growth. Our organic revenue increase was 0.8%. In the first half of 2012, organic revenue growth was 1.7%.","As we called out on our last conference call, revenue headwinds are approximately 3% for the year and our first half weighted with more U.S. impact than international. They mainly impact client categories in the consumer goods and technology areas.","As you can see on the bottom half of this slide, the organic revenue change at our integrated agency networks, IAN segment, was negative 0.5% for the quarter. This is where the revenue headwinds from prior year account losses are. First half organic growth was 0.5%.","Organic growth at our CMG segment was a strong 8%. We have solid performance across our marketing services portfolio and strong growth in every -- in nearly every region of the world. First half organic growth was 8.3%.","Moving to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., our organic decrease of 3.2% was a result of underlying growth being more than offset by client losses from last year. We saw a growth in the U.S. from several of our integrated independent agencies, Lowe & Partners and CMG. We had client sector growth in U.S. in auto and transportation and financial services. Health care continue to be soft. The retail sector decreased due to reductions spent at specific clients.","Pass-through revenues also weighed on our U.S. organic revenue performance. As you know, these pass-through costs are profit neutral, but they accounted for 90 basis points decrease in organic growth from last year's Q2.","Turning to international markets. Organic growth outside the U.S. was 6%. U.K. revenue increased 4.2% in Q2 on top of 15% organic growth a year ago, which is a solid result. Growth was led by our events business, the continued international expansion of R\/GA, and our media business. Our reported increase also includes the contribution of several acquisitions we completed over the last 12 months.","Continental Europe decreased 2.5% in Q2. Given macro conditions, that continued to impact client spending, this was not a surprise. We had growth in Germany and France, but it was offset by decreases in other countries.","On a reported basis, we have double-digit percentage decreases in the quarter and the half in Continental Europe. That is due to the effect of the stronger U.S. dollar against the euro.","Asia Pac continues to be very strong. Organic revenue growth was 14.3% in Q2. We saw a strong growth in our media business, in marketing services and at McCann. This includes both new business wins and growth in existing clients. We have double digit increases in China, Japan, India and Australia.","In LatAm, Q2 organic revenue growth was 27.2%, included broad-based growth across all client sectors. We were led by double-digit growth from McCann, CMG and media and had strong increases from Draftfcb, Lowe and R\/GA. Growth was outstanding in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Mexico also had strong growth.  Our LatAm organic growth for the first half was 16.7%. In our other markets group, revenue decreased 4.2% organically in the quarter due to decreases in South Africa and Canada, partially offset by growth in the Middle East.","On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data points is 3.7%, which is updated to include Q2 throughout 2012.","Moving on to Slide 7 at our operating expenses. Our operators continue their effective focus on expense management. In Q2, total operating expenses increased only 0.4% on organic basis compared to last year. Sequentially moving between Q1 and Q2, operating expenses remained very well-managed, and for the trailing 12 months increased only 1.8% organically, well below organic revenue growth of 3.7% over the same period.","Total salaries and wage expenses were 63.5% of revenue in Q2 compared to 62.9% of revenue last year. On a trailing 12-month basis to June 30, total salaries and wage expenses were 63% compared to 63.8% for the same period a year ago.","Headcount at quarter end was 42,800 people, a year-on-year increase of 1.7%. 1\/3 of that increase was from net acquisitions completed over the last 12 months. The remaining hiring reflects investment and growing disciplines such as media, public relations and the digital services throughout agencies. It also supports growth in markets such as China, India and Brazil. Offsetting these investments were reductions in Continental Europe and the U.S., tracking our revenue decreases.","Severance expense was 1.2% of Q2 revenue compared with 1.3% a year ago. Incentive expense in the quarter was 3.3% of revenue compared with 3.5% a year ago. For the full-year, we continue to expect incentive expense in the range of 3.5% to 4% of revenue.","Turning to office and general expenses on the lower half of the slide. O&G was $450 million in Q2, a decrease of 2.3% on organic basis from a year ago. O&G expense was 26.3% of revenue compared to 27.1% a year ago, an 80 basis point improvement. We drove 40 basis points of leverage on occupancy expense as we continue to find efficiencies in our real estate portfolio. We had 50 basis points of leverage on our other O&G category. This is due to lower pass-through costs, which I previously mentioned.","For the trailing 12 months, O&G expense was 27.1% of our revenue compared with 27.9% a year ago.","On Slide 8, we show our operating margin improvement on a trailing 12-month basis, with the most recent data point of 9.9% for Q2 2012. As we have said previously, our target level for 2012 is to improve at least 50 basis points with our objective fully competitive profitability by 2014.","Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 9, we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion cash in marketable securities compared with $1.8 billion a year ago, a decrease of approximately $300 million. The comparison includes $490 million return to shareholders over the last 12 months in the form of share repurchase and common stock dividends, as well as a net reduction of $150 million in our long-term debt.","The effect of the stronger U.S. dollar on our international balances also reduced that comparison by $80 million. We had a net cash inflow in August of 2011 of $134 million from the sale of approximately half of our interest in Facebook. A restricted marketable securities line seen here of $136 million is our remaining 4.4 million shares in Facebook mark-to-market as of June 30. The restriction refers to the 180 day period from the Facebook IPO date or until mid-November. The significant increase in value from our cost base is recorded as unrealized gain in equity and not through the income statement.","On Slide 10, we turn to the cash flow for the quarter. Cash provided by operations was $157 million compared with $199 million in Q2 2011. Cash used in working capital was $16 million in Q2 '12 compared with the contribution of $67 million last year. In investing activities, we used $77 million primarily for acquisitions and CapEx.","Acquisitions in Q2 reflect our emphasis on high-growth disciplines in expanding our digital capabilities. They include a London-based European digital search specialist group, a full service digital agency in France and a health care market research access agency in the U.K.","Our financing activities used $112 million, the largest component, of which was $65 million for share repurchases, $26 million on our quarterly stock dividend and $35 million to acquire additional interest and consolidate subsidiaries. The net decrease in cash and marketable securities in the quarter was $72 million.","On Slide 11 you see our total debt outstanding at quarter end 2012 and at year end from 2007 through 2011. This depicts our reduction of total debt over the last several years. Since the end of 2007, we reduced total debt by over $700 million. The net decrease of long-term debt of $150 million during 2012 took place during the first quarter with the retirement of $400 million, 4.25% convertible notes, net renumerations of $200 million, 4% notes.","Looking ahead over the next 12 months, we will have additional opportunities to further improve our balance sheet and reduce our effective cost of debt.","In summary, on Slide 12, we saw some pressure on U.S. revenue in the quarter, offset by very strong revenue growth internationally. We will cycle through the revenue headwinds by year end and we are managing through this challenge effectively. We are therefore on course to deliver the margin expansion that we have targeted for the full-year. This is a credit to our operators, who are managing expenses very effectively. Our cash flow and balance sheet continue to make significant contributions to value creation including 16% diluted EPS growth in the quarter.","With that let me turn it back over to Michael.","Michael I. Roth","Thank you, Frank. As always, at this time of the year, we review first half results with our operating leadership. We access the tone of business and gauge our outlook for the balance of the year.","The tone of the business remained sound though the overall macroeconomic climate will require continued vigilance and caution. As we have shown, we effectively manage the business to deliver on our margin objectives. Overall, our pipeline remained solid and the revenue of our agencies need to convert in the back half of the year in order to deliver their plans as largely consistent with the trends from past years.","For the year, we remain net new business positive. Significant wins in Q2 came from Bank of America, Microsoft, Unilever, SeaWorld, Aetna, Ernst & Young and MillerCoors digital.","We continue to see the benefits of our digital strategy, in which the primary pillar is embedding digital capabilities at all of our agencies, enhanced by best in class digital specialties.","Our investments in emerging markets are also being rewarded. In the quarter, Brazil, India and China posted combined organic growth of greater than 30%, and year-to-date, that number is more than 20%.","Contributions to this strong performance are coming from across the portfolio, with all 3 global ad networks, Mediabrands and CMG all playing a part. The global expansion of R\/GA is also taking hold and contributing to our growth as are MRM's international operations.","CMG posted strong performance across-the-board at Weber Shandwick and GolinHarris as it expands its global footprint, Octagon and Jack Morton. We saw good wins at a number of our U.S. independents and for marketing service offerings in other areas of the group such as Momentum worldwide.","Other notable events in the quarter included strong performance at Cannes, which validates the creative capabilities of many of our agencies. Of the 5 Titanium Lions awarded to ideas that redefine markets and drive exceptional business results, our agencies won 2. One from Lowe in Columbia, and the Titanium Grand Prix for R\/GA on Nike. R\/GA also took home the Grand Prix in the digital category.","On the M&A front, the pipeline is strong. We are further increasing our digital footprint, especially internationally, and are looking to add our presence in emerging markets, including the BRICs. But also developing economies such as Indonesia, Columbia, Mexico and Vietnam.","We also continued to look at high-growth marketing services such as PR, shopper marketing and the more sophisticated capabilities in the health care space. Frank mentioned the deals we closed in Q2. In early Q3, we've already finalized transactions in the PR space in London, for a full service digital agency in South Africa and a scientific content specialist health care agency in Japan, and just recently, a leading retail design company in New York that will give Momentum an even more powerful global shopper marketing capability. And we have another -- a number of other transactions in process that we believe will close shortly.","Additional developments that bear watching are the launch by Mediabrands, one of our strongest performance of the brand programming network, a third global full-service network that should help us be more active in the pursuit of new clients and the continued rollout of Cadreon, our very successful demand-side platform, which should be active in 8 international markets by year end.","In looking at the year-to-date, we see that we have posted both organic growth and margin expansion for the first half. We've outlined for you the factors that weighed on Q2 organic revenue growth, but we also have demonstrated our ability to manage through this and deliver to the bottom line, increase EPS and continue to return capital to our owners. It's important to note that our comps in the third quarter will be challenging given that we posted organic revenue growth of 8.7%, and increased margin by 350 basis points in Q3 last year. However, as we've often indicated to you, we managed the full year and we set our financial objectives on a full-year basis.","For the full-year 2012, our objective remains organic revenue growth of 3%. Given our revenue performance through June, we are targeting a stronger second half to achieve this goal. The services that we provide to our clients remained in demand due to the speed of change in digital media. And our agency brand delivered full contemporary offerings and are competitive in the marketplace.","With respect to profitability, our objective remains to deliver 50 basis points of margin improvement or better. Our ability to effectively manage expense is something that this management team has demonstrated in a range of revenue environments. Focusing on our clients will be key. We also stayed disciplined on cost and on deploying our financial resources and the strength of our balance sheet to support the needs of our business, return capital to our owners and drive shareholder value.","Thank you. I will now open up the floor to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani, JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Could you just provide a little bit more detail on the softness in U.S. organic revenue growth in the quarter? The comps did ease meaningfully yet results were a little bit softer? Was it primarily the pullback you saw in the -- among the retail clients? And if you can also remind us what the headwinds from the account losses, the impact will likely be in Q3.","Michael I. Roth","Yes, Alexi. Well first of all, as I say indicated, the pullback in the U.S., we had approximate 5% headwinds in the U.S. as you know, notably from the loss of Microsoft on the media side and SC Johnson. And that's reflected in the sectors that we're focusing. The additional pullback was in particular with respect to retail. We saw a specific pullback at some of our retail clients, as well as health care. I think health care, everyone has seen that because of patents coming off-line and some regulatory issues, we've seen some pullback. So if you look at it, I think it is -- from a combination point of view of the headwinds, which are significant and the particular pullbacks in those lines of a -- those particular companies in those sectors, that accounts for the reduction, if you will, in organic growth in the U.S. If you pull those out, and obviously they're there, and we recognize we have to deal with that, but our businesses otherwise, are solid in terms of growth. If you look at financial services, they grew, food and beverage grew, auto and transportation grew. And obviously, as I indicated, consumer goods -- if you just it add back SC Johnson we had a good growth in the quarter. So I think the sense is that, there's nothing fundamentally wrong with our business offerings in the U.S, and our pipeline is solid and our businesses are performing. It's just taking us a little bit longer to cycle-through those headwinds. For the second half of the year, we're expecting 2.5% to 3% of headwinds throughout the second half. We don't do it by quarter, Alexia. But by year end, we will cycle-through all of that.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And any sense if the pullback in the retail group or the retail clients, was it Q2 specific? Or should we assume that pullback may continue to be a headwind in the second half?","Michael I. Roth","I wish I could tell you it was all just a timing difference, but I think a lot of it is subject to the macroeconomic environment. So let's assume some of it is timing, and let's assume some of it may be some type of pullback for the year. But we'll see how -- frankly, we'll know that in the in 4Q when obviously those are very sectors strong for us, and we'll see a real sense of their spend. We already have seen some pickups, if you will, in some fall programs, and we've seen some recent wins in those categories. So I'm cautiously optimistic.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And just one last one. If you could update us on McCann? I don't think you mentioned it as one of the agencies that were particularly strong in the quarter. I'm assuming maybe some of the retail clients were there. Any update on McCann you could give us in U.S., I know that...","Michael I. Roth","Yes. McCann had a solid quarter for us, and I didn't mean to exclude them. I think the transformation of McCann is moving on. We've made some personnel changes that are very strong in terms of taking us into the future. We've had our operating review with Nick and the team, and they're confident in their ability to deliver on their results. And we support them in terms of some of the acquisitions we've been doing are in support of their offerings, particularly in the health care side of the business, which is very solid. The Worldgroup piece of the business, particularly Momentum and MRM, have very strong offerings, and with the personnel changes and the movements we're making our offerings in McCann, we are comfortable with the transition, and we are watching it go forward. So frankly, the results in the quarter were solid for McCann.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. The first is you kind of clarified the 3% organic revenue growth target. But given the volatility between domestic and international, I was wondering if you could give a little more clarity on what the acceleration you were expecting between -- or changing conditions you're expecting between those 2 geographic categories for the balance of the year? And the second is, could you give -- kind of talk about the ORION-Pitney Bowes partnership and how that sort of impacts the business itself in terms of potential operating savings for you and potential kind of revenue growth?","Michael I. Roth","Let me take Pitney Bowes. In the interest of full disclosure, I'm on the Board of Pitney Bowes. By the way, there was -- I can officially say this, there was no connection between my involvement of this and the relationship with IPG and Pitney Bowes. We have ORION Trading, which is one of our successful units part of the Mediabrands. They have very strong unique offerings, particularly in the broader side of the business. They saw a niche in terms of the ability to provide some outsourcing of printing facilities and frankly, they were looking for a partner that can deliver on a global basis and Pitney Bowes was able to do that. I think it's a unique offering. We think there's a huge opportunity for us in terms of servicing clients. This isn't necessarily just for IPG. This is for an offering of ORION Trading to the marketplace. So it's a unique offering. We already have some business in the pipeline, but that one is just a new offering. We're  excited about it. We're particularly excited, I am, that it relates to Pitney Bowes. But we will see that as it unfolds. It's a very unique offering. It provide savings on the printing side, and so far it's been well-received in the marketplace. As far as the organic challenges for us, look, the U.S. is still -- obviously, it provides 57% of our revenue for the first 6 months, and generally that's where we are for the full-year. It's an important part of our offering. Our independents as well as our global networks have strong offerings in the United States, as well as the rest of our businesses, marketing services, PR, and these are very solid offerings and they're performing well. We are very comfortable with these offerings. If you look at the macroeconomic environment, the United States growth, depending on whose forecasting you use, is in the low single-digit numbers. And so what we put out for the year of 3% organic growth reflects those type of markets as well as cycling-through our headwinds that we had from lost clients. Obviously, a significant part of our growth comes from our existing client base. We have a couple of new wins that we've announced. We have a couple that are yet to be announced, and we have some pitches out there that we're in the finals on. So all of this, as we roll it all up, count on a recovery, a growth in the United States but not as large as we are seeing in the emerging markets. Asia Pac, Latin America, we've seen strong double-digit growth, and that's consistent with where we're forecasting from a global perspective. So if you look at our business, you see our business lining up pretty much where the growth in the world is, and we're falling in line with that's -- tells us that we're very competitive in all of those markets. And as a result, we're comfortable with the numbers that we're putting out there.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So is that -- do I take away from that, that your outlook for the outside of U.S. market should be pretty consistent with what we've just seen?","Michael I. Roth","Well, a lot of it has to do with our comps to last year. I mean, for example, we were just looking at this morning, Brazil, we were up organically 50%. That's a pretty good number.  If I can [indiscernible] we can grow our business 50% every quarter, I'd be a happy camper. So a part of it has to do with our comps, but we do believe solid double-digit growth is consistent with the macro forecast that we're seeing, and we're delivering on those kind of results and frankly, in some markets better. So I think that will -- that clearly is consistent with the marketplace. We always have to put in the caveat of the macroeconomic. We had some good news this morning in terms of the European issues, but we don't -- that's today's news, who knows what's going to tomorrow. So that's why we always say we're cautious because obviously, this will spill over to other markets if it doesn't -- if we don't solve these problems. But our numbers are consistent with the global forecasting that we've seen out there.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Janedis with UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of questions. One, Michael, if you look back historically, do retailers tend to be a leading indicator for the broader client base that you have? And maybe from a margin perspective, if you can't hit the 3%, I'm wondering how much below that 3% organic can you do and still hit that 50 basis points or more target on margin?","Michael I. Roth","We've always said, John, if we see slight organic growth, we can expand margins. And I think we said that on Investor Day when you asked the same question. And I think, we've shown our ability to manage our expenses very carefully. Now in order to continue to grow margin in a lower growth environment, we have to be able to do that. And I think if you look at our track record, you've seen us do that. So we're very comfortable with our ability to manage our margins in even a small growth environment, okay. And I think this quarter is a perfect example of how that works. We're ahead of the issue. We knew we had some headwinds. We knew we lost some business. We have to take some costs out of the business and as we pick up new business, we add staff and we only add staff as it follows the revenue. So I think -- I hope we're getting credibility on the ability to manage even in a lower growth environment. As far as retail being a leading indicator, certainly, some of this is unique to specific clients, if you will, and their challenges in terms of margin improvement and footprint. Some retailers are using this as an opportunity to gain market share. So although with some leading indicators certainly on the consumer side, I wouldn't use it as a major indicator for our global revenue.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Frank, maybe a quick one for you. You've done a great job over the years on the O&G line. Historically, you've obviously talked about the leverage in the SRS line and the need to see the revenue growth to do that. Assuming that you guys have that 3% organic, can we see the improvement in that line this year?","Frank Mergenthaler","Yes, John, we've seen it. If you look year-to-date, we have seen SRS in the trailing 12 months, we've got 70 to 80 basis points of incremental leverage. So that's there as you well know, that is going to be a key component of us closing the gap between our current margin performance and competitive margins. We're getting the point in O&G, especially, in occupancy. We'll continue to focus on it, but most of the runway going forward is going to have to be in the SRS area, and we have seen progress.","Michael I. Roth","Now, if I might add. If you look at our footprint in terms of real estate footprint, I think we've always said we've done a tremendous job on that, but we keep seeing new opportunities. And I think our results for this quarter are reflective of the fact that when we see opportunities to consolidate space, to be more efficient in terms of fee per square foot per individual, we've been doing a great job in that, and we're seeing the effects of that, and we keep doing it and we expect to continue to keep our eye on those opportunities.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Chesler with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It fully seems to be that as you look through the quarters of that last month sort of drives the full quarter result. If you look back at the second quarter, was there anything about June that either increased your confidence in the full-year or made you a little bit more cautious?","Michael I. Roth","Yes, I think it's a fair question. We looked at June and that's where we see -- we saw a big impact on the U.S. side of the business. That's where, frankly, the specific client spend that we were looking for really showed up. So hopefully, as I indicated, some of that is timing, and we'll see a pickup on that. I think as the economy unfolds for the rest of the year, that will decide whether that pullback is greater or less for the rest of the year. But it was in June, and mainly it was in the U.S.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I can't help but ask you if you've seen it continuing to July.","Michael I. Roth","We've been focusing on preparing for this call.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","On the buyback, you indicated it's going to pickup in the back half of the year. Is there any -- should we have an expectation as to whether that will be proportional to your cash flow? Although it's kind of hard for that to be since the first half cash flow is negative and it should be positive in the second half.","Michael I. Roth","Well, that's why we say we've been a little bit less in the first half, and we expect to ramp it up in the second half. We have a $300 million authorization from our Board. We never said that we were going to take the whole $300 million and do it all in one year. But it looks like we're spending a fair amount of it and if you read into my statement, that would be a little more aggressive in the second half of the year, that's exactly what it means. So if we spend $118 million to $120 million in the first half of the year, and I indicated that we'll going to be a little more aggressive in the second year half, then our intention is to be more aggressive. So I think you can interpolate from that.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","When is the next opportunity that the Board can discuss revisiting or upping that allocation?","Michael I. Roth","Well the Board can do it anytime they want. But we like to do this on a regular basis. So come next year, we will take a look at our authorizations, obviously, on the dividend, as well as the buyback. We've had some healthy discussions with our investor base as to their preference, as to whether dividends make more sense than buybacks. At that point in time, we'll make a presentation to our Board, and they will make a determination of what we do with our cash flow and any excess cash we have on our balance sheet. And we'll be responsive to what the marketplace is looking at. Of course, we have to be sensitive to any potential changes in tax law as to whether dividends are preferable to buybacks. All of that gets factored in. We also have a little thing that we call Facebook investment. If you recall the last time when we did have an opportunity to sell our Facebook shares, we used that as an opportunity to use of the entire proceeds from that transaction to increase our authorization. In November, our restrictions on our Facebook shares come off, and we're free to do whatever we decide to do. We've indicated that our Facebook investment is not strategic and will be opportunistic in the marketplace, and what we do with the proceeds if and when we sell, will be up to our Board and the market conditions. So that's another avenue we have in terms of returning money to our shareholders.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to ask you guys a little bit on the revenue outlook as well. You called out a 5-point hit to U.S. organics in Q2 from account losses. Can you help us think about Q3, and into Q4? That would seem to be a number you have a decent grasp on just because you obviously know what happened last year?","Michael I. Roth","Yes. I think what we said was, we said for the second half of the year, not by quarter, we have 2.5%to 3% as it rolls off. By December all of it will have rolled off, and we'll start 2013 a fresh. We don't --","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just to be clear, the 2.5% to 3% is overall or it is that the U.S. I think the 5 points was the U.S. number.","Frank Mergenthaler","Correct. Correct. We said 3% for the year, first half weighted. So first half is in the 3.5% range that will incur the back half is, something less than 3%. And to Michael's point, we haven't given any color around quarters. That's for the back half of the year.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then you mentioned the Latin American comp, I don't know if you have basis point number you'd throw out for that piece. I know Q3 was up a lot last year particularly in Brazil, but you can see the LatAm number, just trying to think -- it would seem like Q3 is a tough comp in general, and so I just wanted to ask about that piece as well?","Michael I. Roth","Well, we  had 8.5% revenue in the third quarter last year. That's a pretty tough comp in this environment and last year in the third quarter, if you recall last year our second quarter, we had some Latin American revenue that flipped from the second quarter to the third quarter, and that was in that comp number last year. So what that says is we continue to be bullish about our outlook for Brazil and Latin America. We have a tough comp, but we still think the businesses there are solid across-the-board. And for the year, we're comfortable with how it falls into our overall numbers.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just going back to the cash flow statement on acquisitions. I know last year, you sort of underspent your budget for the year, sounds like you got a lot of activity going on currently. I don't know if there's any way to put a finer point at what you expect for acquisition spend for the year 2012?","Frank Mergenthaler","Ben, we had said about $200 million of new money for the year, that's still probably pretty good number.","Michael I. Roth","Yes. By the way, that's just a guideline. If we see some really attractive transaction out there that we can't pass on, we'll look at it. But so far we haven't seen that.","Frank Mergenthaler","And to your comment about underspending last year, the reason we underspent there was a number of transactions that were deep into the pipeline, they just didn't close until this year. So the pipeline has been on -- has been consistently robust, actually for the past 3 years.","Michael I. Roth","What's encouraging is that our acquisitions are across-the-board. All our different segments and agencies on a global basis are -- obviously, they're digital. We've had some search companies in the mix. We have health care companies. We have PR companies, we have digital companies both in Europe and Latin America and India. So I like the fact that we're spending our money where the money -- where the growth is, and that's obviously good, and we're enhancing our offerings where we need it. So in McCann, for example, the question was about McCann, we added to their health care offerings, if you will. We added or we will be adding something, hopefully, in the digital capabilities in Europe. So I think this is a good opportunity for us to enhance our overall offerings and there are some transactions that are there that we find very attractive.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So a couple of questions. First on CMG, continued strong growth there. I know that the PR assets are best in class. Can you give us a sense of your visibility into subsequent quarters on PR, then I got -- and all of CMG for that matter? And then I've got a quick follow-up.","Michael I. Roth","Sure. It's always scary. CMG, we like to think of CMG as a retainer base recurring model. And we're doing a lot of things particularly in the PR side and the event side that will enable them to do that, but we still have a long way to go. So we have what is known as to be generating where the business that we hopefully identify, but having yet realized. And in the CMG space that's a big number because that's the nature of that business. It is project-oriented and what's interesting is every year, we go through the angst of going through that and every year, they do great. And that's a credit to our people both at Weber Shandwick and now GolinHarris is rolling out on a global basis and having great traction. Jack Morton, as well as Octagon and FutureBrands are having very solid years. And -- but it's a -- and that was sort of bite your fingernail business. But for -- we're very fortunate when you have best in class offerings, they continue to deliver, and I don't see any reason why they shouldn't continue to do that. They're gaining market share. It's not just growth in the business. When you look at our competitor's results, particularly in the PR side, where we do have some visibility into what our competitors are doing, I think you continually see Weber Shandwick outperform our competitors on the PR side, and that's a tribute to that business.","Matthew Walker - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, great. And then the new business success that you called out, Michael. Just given the fact that 3% still remains a target, I mean, 2Q is a large quarter. We've got to assume really pretty substantial growth in the second half. Can you give us a sense to whether there's new business wins? It seems like they're going to be full contributors to both Q3 and Q4. It's not as if some of these things are going to ramp really slowly and only trickle in later in the year. Is that a fair assessment?","Michael I. Roth","Yes, I mean, like I said we're counting on a stronger back half of the year, and certainly some of the wins that we've already achieved are in those numbers. Frankly, there's a couple of wins in there that we haven't announced, that we hope to see flow-through, if you will, particularly in the fourth quarter, and hopefully, we'll be able to announce some of those wins as well. So we don't just pick of these numbers out of the air. Each of our business units do a roll up of where their pipeline is and where their new business flows in, and that's how we develop the numbers that we use. So clearly, new business is an important part of it. The real strength in our company is growth from our existing businesses, and that's where it's at. And like I said, in some of our existing clients, we already see some fourth quarter campaigns that we're going to be working on, which is giving us some comfort obviously as we go forward.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And lastly, I know the U.K. is a real small number, so need to be very careful with the organic growth numbers here. You see Olympics bump here?","Michael I. Roth","Yes, actually we will see a small Olympic bump, particularly on the event side of the business because that's where you see it. And we will see a small bump, but it's not going to make the year, if you will. But it's nice to see, and we're excited about it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Michael, you mentioned, as you noted that across the industry there's a lot of weakness in health care, but also cited it as one of the areas where you're investing in. Are there may be drugs in your clients' pipelines that you're seeing? Are there specific areas of health care that you see rebounding that's driving that investment?","Michael I. Roth","Yes, I mean, that's a great question. Obviously, certainly, that's a question that our Board asked. If some softness [indiscernible] acquisitions, so it's a fair question. Look, we think health care is a very important -- we're very strong, first of all, in our offerings. All of global networks, Lowe, Draftfcb and McCann have very strong health care offerings. We have strong health care offerings on the PR side of the business as well, as well as the event business. So we see that as a very important segment of what we do. And, frankly, yes, there will be new drugs coming down the pipeline. Just to give you an idea, health care is about 15% of our overall business, which is a nice sector for us. And yes, there's consolidation in that business but the research extending through all of these things are an important piece of this. And we have the digital offerings, if you will, and the data to help our clients in that environment. So it's not just patents pulling off the line here. And yes, some of our clients are pulling back in that area, but we are trying to help them. We're here to help and certainly the recent transactions that we've been doing on research and the data and the digital part of it goes along those lines. So we still think it's a great growth opportunity for us. McCann health care, for example, is doing very well, as well as our other health cares. And we see some unique pullbacks because of specific drugs, and hopefully, we'll see them turn that around.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Holdings, Inc.","I have -- I have still one for Michael and one for Frank. Michael, can I just get back to you with the question for a second? The question was I think, more narrow on maybe your sports and marketing offerings in the U.K. but in general, what kind of bump do you think you guys get from the Olympics in maybe late 2Q, early 3Q? Is there anything you can quantify for some of your response to work you're doing.","Michael I. Roth","Yes, we're doing it, obviously. It's -- This is some -- a bump, but I don't give out the number. It's not a material number. Frankly, we're more excited about what's happening in Brazil. The FIFA Cup, we see, is a big opportunity for us. We have strong offerings down there. We've already won some assignments for the FIFA Cup and we're going to have a very strong presence there, as well as the Olympics in Latin America. So frankly, we're looking more forward to those Olympics and what we're seeing here in the U.K. As you know, as you may not know, McCann did the advertising for the McCann -- for the London Olympics. Wasn't a big revenue generator for us, but it gave us more exposure and that's what we're looking for in that market, particular marketplace. So Olympics is a good thing for us. It's a good chance for us to meet some clients and work with them, but it isn't a big revenue enhancer for us.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Holdings, Inc.","Okay. And then to Frank, I know generally you shy away from giving too much color for guidance. When we look at you incremental margins, and look at your third quarter margin from last year, which was about highest margin, I think third quarter we've seems maybe a decade, right? When we look at this year's incremental margin for the rest of the way, should we be expecting this to be more heavily fourth quarter weighted than it has been in a long time? So how do you -- how should we prepare our own thinking about the margin lift the rest of the way?","Frank Mergenthaler","Michael, your comment about the third quarter is exactly right. It was the strongest revenue growth and margin growth we've seen here in a decade. So we're looking, talking full-year for the back half of the year, would have put -- it would put a lot of that, the growth pressure on the fourth quarter.","Michael I. Roth","And, Michael, and that's why -- it's not just because we had a little issue in the second quarter that we talked this way. When we were overperforming in the first quarter, we said the same thing, all right. You have to look at this business on a full year basis. We don't have -- our clients aren't interested in our quarterly performance, okay? And it doesn't come in at a level basis. So it really doesn't make sense. And I know you have to put together a model. I know you have to extend out what this all looks like. But we truly manage our business on a full-year basis. Our expense profiles are on a full-year basis, our revenue forecasting, our new -- everything is on a full-year basis. So it kind of frustrating. Put it in context, and I said this last year, I'll say it again. If you look at our quarter, we had $1.7 billion of revenue in the quarter. The differential is $35 million, if you were to take a consensus number on the revenue number versus where we're at. $35 million in the quarter on $1.7 billion for a full year. It's not insignificant in the quarter, but for the full year, we managed our business and all of these gets factored into it, which is why even in the first quarter, when we outperformed, we stuck to our target of 3% organic growth, and everyone kept saying, \"Well, why aren't you upping that?\" And the answer was we weren't upping it because we know we have headwinds. We know that this is a full-year business, and that's how we manage our business. So I wish I could tell you what is going to be in the third quarter, but we can't.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Nollen, Macquarie.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","Most of my questions have been answered already, but I do have one more, and that is regarding your tax rate and NOL usage, please. Assuming with Europe down on revenue terms, it's difficult profitably there. I don't know if you care to comment on that but if you could at least let us know what to think about tax rate going forward, please?","Frank Mergenthaler","We have said 37% for the full year was a reasonable number, and we still think that's a reasonable number. We had a number of discrete items this quarter that pushed it down to 32, 33, but 37 is probably a good number for the year. And on the NOLs, you're exactly right. We were overweight in the NOLs in Europe, Europe profitably is key to that. And with Europe down on revenue, utilization will probably be stressed a bit.","Jerome J. Leshne","Okay. Well, thank you again. We appreciate all the support and we still have a half a year to go, and look forward to our next call.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn over the call to Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jerry Leshne","Good morning. Thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com. This morning, we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 Eastern.","During this call, we will refer to Forward-Looking Statements about our Company. These are subject to the uncertainties in the cautionary statement that is included in our earnings release and the slide presentation and further detailed in our 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.","We will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP measures, allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance.","At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Jerry, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we review our third quarter and year-to-date results. I'll start by covering highlights of our performance, Frank will then provide additional detail and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies to be followed by our Q&A.","We are pleased to again report strong financial performance. Third quarter net revenue organic growth was 5.4%. Our adjusted operating income increased 7% to $273 million adjusted for one time transaction expenses from our acquisition of Acxiom. Operating margins similarly adjusted expanded 50 basis points from a year results to 14.4%.","The quarter reflects our continued growth in every major world region. U.S. organic growth was 5% while international growth was 6% highlighted by strong increases across LatAm, Asia PAC, Europe and the UK. We also continue to drive growth across all of our major service disciplines led by notably strong performance in media, and increases in advertising, public relations and at our digital specialist agencies. Extensive list of contributing agencies is headed up by Mediabrands, FCB, McCann World group, Huge, R\/GA, Weber Shandwick, Golin, MullenLowe and Octagon.","In terms of client sectors in the quarter. Our growth was phased by healthcare, tech and telecom, financial services and consumer goods. We saw both existing client increases from a year ago and the benefit of net new business wins. Through nine-months organic growth was 4.9% a strong year-to-date results that again was driven by increases in every major world region and discipline.","Growth at these levels continues to underscore the distinctive talents of our people and the strength of our agency brands as well as the differentiated structure of our Company. Our approach to highly strategic areas such as our expanding capabilities in data and analytics and our ability to create seamless open architecture solutions across our agencies has been consistently validated in our results. These are competitive strengths that drive business results for clients and sustain the growth leadership that you are seeing from us once again today.","Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.41 as reported and was $0.48 as adjusted for transaction expenses for our acquisition of Acxiom and for business dispositions in the quarter. That compares with adjusted diluted EPS of $0.37 a year ago, an increase of 30%. The nine-month period diluted EPS was $0.75 and with $0.93 as adjusted.","Turning to our outlook for the full-year, you will recall that we came into 2018 with financial targets of 2% to 3% organic growth and 60 to 70 basis points of operating margin expansion. We raised our sites in April to the high-end of the growth range and raised it again following our strong second quarter to 4% and 4.5% for the full-year.","Through nine-months we are confident that performance to date in the current tone of business have us on track to meet or exceed this higher revenue growth range. Along with that, we have also increased our investment in the talent and tools to support current and future growth, while continuing to drive towards our target of 60 to 70 basis points of net revenue margin expansion, excluding one-time deal cost.","As you know the quarter was highlighted not only by strong performance, but also by the steps we took to further strengthen our offerings and expand our Companies industry leadership going forward. The quarter began with our announcement that we would acquire Acxiom marketing solutions and concluded with our well-received transaction financing in the debt capital markets followed by our acquisition closing on October 1.","Acxiom is a world class data asset, there are many opportunities between our companies which we will discuss later, but it's important to note that with ownership we get Acxiom\u2019s first part of data management business as all companies look to make their first party data work harder for them and do so in an increasingly regulated and secure environment, Acxiom is considered a premier provider of these service.","Furthermore, we see Acxiom\u2019s ability to leverage data for marketing insights as the foundation for a growing set of opportunities and partnership with our own Media business plus our advertising and marketing services across our Company. As data is playing an increasingly central role in consumer engagement and a creation of the most effective media and marketing solutions, we believe this is a transformational acquisition for IPG.","Accordingly, Acxiom\u2019s expertise and skill positions us to deliver unparalleled benefit to our clients, reception of our acquisition by our people and the people of Acxiom and the support and enthusiasm of both organizations clients has been both gratifying and additionally encouraging.","In my closing remarks I will have additional thoughts on Acxiom and the many opportunities ahead of us, along with our updated on our agencies. So at this stage I will turn it over to Frank for additional detail of our results.","Frank Mergenthaler","Thank you Michael, good morning. As usual, I'll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast.","On Slide 2, you will see an overview of our results. Organic growth of our net revenue was 5.4% in the third quarter that reflects strong worldwide performance with U.S. growth of 5% and international growth of 6%. For the nine-months year-to-date organic growth was 4.9% with the U.S. up 4.6% and international growth of 5.4%.","Q3 operating profit was 262 million and is 273 million as adjusted to exclude one-time cost the Acxiom transaction and operations. Operating margin was 14.4%, again excluding the deal costs, which is increase of 50 basis points from the year ago.","Our third quarter results included total of 24.6 million of one-time deal expenses from the Acxiom transaction that consists of 11 million in operations in our SG&A expense and 13.6 million below operating income. The quarter also includes 5.8 million of non operating losses from sales of small nonstrategic agencies. Our adjusted results excludes these items.","Diluted EPS in the quarter was $0.41 and was $0.48 as adjusted. For the nine-months, diluted EPS was $0.75 and was $0.93 as adjusted. This year compared with $0.73 a year ago, an increase of 27%.","Our Acxiom acquisition financing consists of two billion senior notes and four 500 million tranches and was completed on September 21. In addition, we also took down our 500 million acquisition term loan facility and that was on October 1.","Turning to Slide 3, you will see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail and the slides that follow. On Slide 4, net revenue was 1.896 billion which is an increase of 3.4% from Q3 2017. The impact of the change in exchange rates was a negative 1.3% while net dispositions of small nonstrategic agencies were negative 70 basis points. Resulting organic increase was 5.4%.","On the bottom half of this slide, net revenue organic growth was 5.7% our integrated agency network segment. We had contributions to the growth from all IAN disciplines and across all of our largest agencies. CMG grew 3.9% organically led by our public relations agencies Weber Shandwick and Golin and by our Octagon\u2019s sports marketing agency.","Moving on to Slide 5. Net revenue change by region. U.S. organic growth was 5% in Q3. Increases were broadly shared across disciplined in agencies. Most notably at Mediabrands, FCB, Huge, Weber Shandwick, Golin and Octagon. In terms of client sectors we were led in the U.S. by healthcare financial services auto and transportation and consumer goods. Organic growth was 4.6% for the nine-months.","Turning to international markets, we posted another strong quarter in the UK, which grew 6.8% organically, performance was led by our creatively driven integrated offerings at McCann, strong contribution from Mediabrands and growth at R\/GA. Year-to-date UK organic growth has been outstanding at 9.7%.","In Continental Europe, Q3 organic growth was also strong at 5.8%, with contributions from both new business wins and increases with existing clients. We grew in each of our largest national markets Spain, Italy, Germany and France as well as many of the smaller markets. The nine-months organic growth was 6%.","Asia-Pac growth accelerated 7.5 in Q3 supported by increases across nearly all agencies. Among our largest regional markets, we saw strong growth in Indian, Japan and China while Australia decreased. LatAm grew 12.4% organically.","We continue to have very strong growth in Mexico, Argentina and Colombia, while Brazil returned to growth in Q3. With the nine-months organic growth was 9.1%. In our other markets group, net revenue decreased 1.6% organically. Our growth in Canada was more than offset by decreases in the Middle East.","Moving on to Slide 6 on operating expense. Net operating expenses excluding the one-time transaction costs increased only 2.9% under our net revenue growth of 3.4%. our ratio of salaries and wage expenses to net revenue in the quarter improved by 50 basis points from the year ago to 66% in the quarter.","Operating leverage on our expenses for base payroll and our expense carried to other salaries and related expenses. Going the other way, we delevered against increased expense for performance-based incentive compensation, a result of our stronger financial performance and against increased expense for temporary labor. Our total headcount at quarter end was approximately 51,400, which is an increase of 2% from a year ago.","Our office and other direct expenses were 16.7% of net revenue in the quarter compared with 16.5% in Q3 2017. We had 10 basis points of occupancy leverage, but delevered by 30 basis points in all other office and direct expenses in the quarter. Through nine-months, operating leverage on office and other expenses improved by 20 basis points.","Our selling, general and administration expenses increased to 21.6 million as reported. That includes 11 million of Acxiom transaction expenses. Excluding deal expenses SG&A expense was 10.6 million in the quarter compared with 13.6 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was 44 million and was 2.3% of net revenue.","Slide 7 is the bridge between our reported diluted earnings per share of $0.41 to the adjusted $0.48 per diluted share. As you can see the expense of business dispositions was $0.01 per share. Acxiom transaction expenses were $0.05 per share.","These are almost entirely legal and banking costs along with a small amount of net interest expense due pre funding had a closing. Similar bridge for the nine-month period is in the appendix to the presentation on Slide 20, just to note, we expect to report additional Acxiom transaction expenses in Q4 and will call this out accordingly.","On Slide 8, we turn to cash flow. Cash from operations in Q3 was 231 million, working capital use 30 million, our investing activities used 50 million in the quarter, mainly for CapEx. Financing activities generated 1.2 billion, results of the two billion from our debt issuance netted against the decrease of 674 million in short-term debt. Our common stock dividend use 80 million. Our net cash increase in the quarter was 1.37 billion.","Turning to current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 9, we ended the third with 1.86 billion of cash and equivalents that would be a seasonally high cash flow for September but reflects the proceeds of our debt issued on September 21 plus the reduction in outstanding commercial paper. Completed the Acxiom transaction on October 1st.","On Slide 10, total debt on September 30 was 3.3 billion, on October 1st we also barred another 500 million term loan facility from our bank group. Accordingly this picture of our debt matures total of 3.8 billion.","To finance the Acxiom transaction, we issued four debt tranches in September of 500 million each maturities of two, three, 10 and 30 years. Those are shown in the blue on the slide, we are very pleased with the participation we received from the fixed income community with the offerings more than six times over prior subscribing and we thank them for their support.","Term loan facility matures in 2021, which is indicated here, but is pre payable in part or in whole before maturity and we thank our bank group as well. Our credit ratings remain where they were prior to the transaction, BAA, BBB and BBB Plus, respectively, Moody's and S&P and Fitch. In the case of S&P, they moved us to negative outlook, while looks at Moody's and Fitch are stable. As we have said previously, we are committed to maintaining solid investment-grade ratings and to significant financial deleveraging over the next few years.","In the presentation appendix on Slide 21, we have provided a perspective on income statement modeling for the Acxiom acquisition. As a reminder, beginning with our fourth quarter and for the full-year we will be adding metrics of EBITDA, EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS.","Summary on Slide 11, it has been a strong quarter in first nine-months, we are pleased with performance and looking forward to the next stages of our growth and with the Acxiom on board.","With that let me turn it back over to Michael.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Frank. Of course we are pleased with our results in the quarter in terms of growth and profitability which continue to distinguish us from our peer group. At IPG, we have been addressing both the opportunities and challenges of an evolving marketing landscape for many years, we have had a differentiated approach on how we collaborate on building out our digital capabilities, our commitment to transparent media practices and now recently our significant investment in data.","Taken together, these strategic steps has positioned IPG to address the challenges of the modern market. Furthermore, our values and our culture of the reasons where we are able to attract the best talent. And its why clients want to do business with us.","Decade ago we put in leadership across our agencies who like us, believes and investing in our agency brands which allowed us to embed digital expertise across the organization including in media, advertising, PR, healthcare, activation, branding and our marketing services.","Our leadership understands that creativity and insights are hiking when you have diverse teams, and inclusive workplace, especially one where people feel empowered to come forward and report issues that run counter to our values.","Since that time we have had stable and collaborative leadership in our organization. Leaders who believe in our vision of strong agency brands at work together. This becomes especially important when others are disinvesting in their brands.","We believe our strategic decisions over the years, coupled with our talent centric culture one that focused on collaboration, diversity and inclusion have led us to another year of distinctive growth.","Looking forward, it\u2019s key to keep in mind that ours is a constantly changing media and consumer environment, and new opportunities for clients are part of the business that keeps us energized. Engaging the tone of the business for the balance of the year, we see a continued flow of opportunities with existing and potential new clients which underscores our confidence in obtaining the high growth targets we have set out earlier this year.","Furthermore, we are net new business positive so far this year. In terms of margin, the quarter demonstrated that we can balance business reinvestment with expanding profitability. As we enter our important fourth quarter, we are fully focused on continuing to enhance margin and achieve our targets for the year.","Highlights in the quarter were led by Mediabrands, which once again posted very strong top and bottom line growth. The headline wins for UM or Quicken loans as well as their retention of Charles Schwab. A key win given the agencies nine-year relationship with the brand and the fact that every holding company competed for the business.","In addition both UM and initiatives were deeply invested in several major industry pitches during the quarter, including American Express which was awarded to UM last week. Initiative had a string of wins during the first half of the year, including Revlon and Converse and then the third quarter secured the Liverpool Victoria insurance company a major UK advertiser. Their returns and strong growth is a great story for IPG in the industry.","Back to media agency report convergence ranked initiative the number one agency in net new business wins naming it the Best Performing Media Agency through the first half of 2018. Our creative networks once again drove solid growth in the quarter. FCB delivered a continued progress, a reflection of the network's focus on its creative product, science and culture.","Recent successes included the Kimberly Clark global assignment wins and FCB Canada's win of Home Depot. FCB Health continued its impressive performance with multiple substantial new business wins. The agency is involved in several large pitches as well as especially in the Chicago and New York offices.","McCann\u2019s performance was driven by strong growth in the UK and Latin America. Gains in U.S. as well as a number of additional international markets. Just last week McCann UK was named Effectiveness Network of the year at 2018 IPA Effectiveness Awards.","In addition, McCann World Group India was named Agency of the Year at the 4A\u2019s 2018 Jay Chiat Award last week. New business wins in the quarter included additional global assignments from Reckitt Benckiser and Opel auto brand in Europe. Tan Health continued its strong performance in the quarter and continued to garner industry recognition for sector leadership.","MullenLowe also delivered solid revenue growth adding new brands to their client roster in Q3, including stable and seasons entertainment and more recently the UK's co-op bank. MullenLowe media hub continues to be a star in both new business and recognition winning blooming brands last week.","You may have seen the intention getting cover image on add week last month celebrating Mediahub's win a Best In Show for a campaign increase for Netflix. MullenLowe is also growing its business transformation consulting practice and saw some nice wins in that space. As we have mentioned on recent calls, we continue to see an improved tone of business among CPG clients with growth in the sector in Q3 and year-to-date.","MullenLowe marketing services agencies and CMG, we saw an acceleration of top-line growth, which we expect to continue heading into the fourth quarter, which includes a number of new business wins. Octagon our fourth marketing firm was notably strong in the quarter with a renewed focus on big event strategy for upcoming Olympics, World Cup and music and entertainment events.","Their growth was followed closely by Weber Shandwick, which launched a new agency model called the X Practice, bringing together the power of the PR firm's global technology practice, data analytics, media, digital and creative technology talent to better support major clients. This platform serves as a catalyst for the PR industry\u2019s two biggest wins of the year, including IBM.","Our digital first agencies continue to lead the industry with new offerings, creative products in digital marketing with R\/GA, Huge and MRM, McCann each having to find strong and unique brand positioning.","Under new leadership Huge has been focused on creating experiences that connect on and off-line marketing to engage users and deliver value. They have also appointed news U.S. and UK managing directors as the agency continues to expand its footprint in Europe. We are excited to see what they can deliver for clients moving forward.","Our U.S independence round out our portfolio. These agencies deliver a range of integrated services to their clients and can also combined with the rest of the IPG offering on our collaborative open architecture solutions. During the quarter, highlights within this group include Deutsch's win of numeric zone and the Martin Agency's win of Wizards of the Coast has real has brand.","Thus this month AV Pete & Co announced their win on LinkedIn, this comes on the heels of a very strong start of the year for the South Carolina based agency with one clients like Lowe's and John Deere and highly competitive national pitches. AV Pete & Co continue to do some of the industry's most innovative digital work for clients like Denise ad Lenovo.","As mentioned earlier at IPG, we believe in our brands and continue to invest behind them. As you know, our open architecture strategy was an early foray into addressing the challenges of an increasingly complex marketing and consumer landscape, bringing together the best specialists to act collectively on behalf of our clients.","Our success on that front as meant the Company has been able to post strong results without needing to restructure our major brands. Some open architecture successes in the quarter included Honeywell where we created a custom agency powered by digital B2B marketing specialist MRM\/\/McCann, Experiential agency Jack Morton, PR firm Weber Shandwick and a range of specialized agencies from across the holding company.","In addition the Colombia's sportswear win was an open architecture solution that brought together a cross section of IPG agencies led by McCann World Group. In addition, the other launched PR consolidation this quarter was Novartis which was won by a range of IPG agencies including Weber Shandwick, Creation, DNA Communications, Golin and Virgo Health.","As you know, we closed on acting on October 1st as mentioned earlier. Net core business are managing first part of data with their plans with a steady and grown business. We continue to believe that this acquisition will create revenue opportunities for our organization, starting with our media offering with the prospects of the greatest.","With Acxiom our Company can now deliver foundational data management capability to our clients, including many of the world's largest brands. This is a critical capability, increasingly our largest clients attached us with creating cross channel brands that leverage their first-party data advertising and marketing technologies as well as creative insights. With Acxiom we are better able to answer that need and in the process become better partners for our clients.","We know how important data privacy is to marketers and to consumers. We see daily headlines that reminds us that we review our current performance in Acxiom's best-in-class knowledge of data management coupled with its industry-leading reputation for ethical standards and data gathering and respect for consumer privacy are values we share. They are key reasons why our partnership will add to shareholder value.","Going forward our targets for the full-year, our net revenue organic growth of 4% to 4.5% in 2018. We remain committed to furthering our long-term record of margin expansion as well with 60 to 70 basis points of improvement as updated on the last call. Of course, we remain committed to deleveraging our balance sheet and the return of capital to our shareholders in the form of increasing dividends. We expect to resume our share repurchases in a reasonable timeframe.","We view our current performance, our long-term strategy as significant factors that will continue to further value creation and enhance shareholder value. As always, we thank you for your time and support and with that I'll open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Alexia Quadrani","Good morning. Thank you very much. Michael another very impressive quarter, I guess any color you might be seeing in the marketplace. I\u2019m trying to understand what is different for you guys now versus a year ago. I know you mentioned package good company, some good, some feature are stronger which is fantastic news now year-to-date. I guess anything else that you see sort of is really changed.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Alexia and by the way welcome back. Look that question was frankly asked in the last quarter and my comments which is has quoted why don\u2019t you just believe we are better than everyone else.","But I mentioned in my remarks. I think the way we are structured as a Company is a key differentiator, we actually believe in the brands within the agency and we didn\u2019t need to restructure our company, the key to that is our focus on our clients and what they need.","So when appropriate we use the open architecture model which we've been doing now for 12 years and you can do that unless A, you have the best talent and tools available to our people. The second is they have to have a good feeling that they can call on other resources within IPG and leverage that on a collaborative basis and we are seeing that in the marketplace.","And I mentioned, just two wins where we used the open architecture, but it\u2019s not even just in the wins. We have the ability to bring in other IPG resources when a given network feel the firepower that another agency can bring and help. Now of course we do that recognizing issues of complex and we don\u2019t run afoul of that, so that is the one caveat on that part of it that we have to maintain.","But I do believe that clients believe that we are looking out for their best benefit, not necessarily our own silos and when you have a relationship with clients like that it makes a difference. And so you know I think that is certainly a key factor in why we are doing better.","The other part of it is, we have spent a lot of time, money and tools and resources to invest in our talent. And without the talent that brings that to life with our clients none of this works and our mantra is client first and our people are comfortable focusing on clients and know that they are within an organization that values their career and the opportunities for them as well.","So I think, I always talk about us being different than the other holding companies, I think that is reflective in the environment and our values and that just works out to clients that want to do business with us and us being able to meet their needs on a seamless basis.","Alexia Quadrani","I guess Michael that is such a great explanation of how come you have had such a relative outperformance versus your peers which obviously is continuing. But I guess more, I\u2019m looking also why you also IPG doing better than you guys did a year ago, is it the clients are recognizing all these things that you sort of elaborated on or is the overall environment a little bit better, I\u2019m trying to get a sense of how come its better now.","Michael Roth","Well there is no question as the terms of business is better, I mean just remember 60%, 61% of our business in the U.S. the tone of our business and the strength of our business in the U.S. is very solid. I think look at our media offerings right now, I mean that clearly is where a lot of the pitches are, where clients who are looking for us to add value and our media business is our best-in-class and now they are further strengthened with the opportunity to work with Acxiom to bring the insights at are next sturdy.","I mentioned this, it\u2019s worth saying it again, we are going to start using Acxiom and Mediabrands as our first volley in terms of the opportunities that created on a synergy basis and an opportunity basis both with respect to Acxiom as well as the IPG clients. We have had inbound enquiries from our existing clients to see what actually you can do for us as such the Acxiom clients have inbound question, as to what IPG can bring.","But we also see this as an opportunity for our creative agencies, because they too need to get insights that are necessary to reach the consumers in effective way. So I think it\u2019s an indication that we are looking forward to the future of what is necessary and frankly in the marketplace clients look to see whether we continue to invest and have those kind of resources.","It doesn\u2019t hurt that the economic environment is better. We see UK for example, and continental Europe. I have said this before and that is we are 8% to 9% in those respected markets. So one or two clients can make a difference in our results and we've been fortunate in terms of some of the business wins in those markets and retention of clients in those markets and those clients are doing fairly well and investing. So I think that is part of the answer.","And the other part of it is that the general tones for example Latin America you see a very strong recovery in various markets and even Brazil which has been a problem for us and everybody else. We saw a return to growth this quarter and that is as a result of some additional new business wins. So I think it's a combination.","And the final point which is one that is a really good indicator. If you look at our Top 20 clients for the last couple of quarters, we were relying a lot on the project-based businesses. Remember we were talking about project-based businesses, the large wins you have to find repeats that we were finding as many repeat on large project-based businesses.","When you look at Top 20 clients, which aren\u2019t necessarily considered project based although some of the work there is projects. We have seen a return to good growth in our Top 20 clients. So I think that is a solid backbone of IPG, because we had some of the world's largest clients in terms of marketing and services and advertising and we are seeing a recovery there. So I think that is a key point.","Alexia Quadrani","That is very helpful. Thank you for the color. Can I just squeeze in one more question about Acxiom. A lot of your peers are restructuring and divesting under the building. I guess post Acxiom do you feel you are sort of well positioned in terms you have everything you need to compete going forward?","Michael Roth","Yes. Well, we did do some dispositions. We committed to looking at our portfolio and eliminating businesses that aren\u2019t strategic and not being accretive to us from a margin point of view. But those are one of us, but our solid core - we had the luxury of looking at our strategic assets when we were going through some difficult periods and we eliminated. Remember our first year, I think we closed 50 agencies on a worldwide basis.","So we have been repositioning for a while and right now we have our core businesses and they are open for bidding in a way that we're comfortable with or have opportunities to contribute more, so we think our core business are where they should be. We don\u2019t see any holes in any of our offering so there is no need for us to go out and do another transformation transaction such as Acxiom.","So we will continue to invest in our brands, use our open architecture as the market dictates, invest in our new acquisition Acxiom, working with Mediabrands, which is our big growth vehicle right now in the marketplace and we are very well-positioned to compete and I think our results reflect that.","Alexia Quadrani","Well, thank you very much.","Michael Roth","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Tim Nollen","Thanks. A couple questions on Acxiom please and one about your creative business. On Acxiom could you maybe give us a little bit more color as to what Acxiom did to contribute to the American Express win which I believe was the situation. Also the numbers you have given on Acxiom in the slides in the back of the deck are the same as what you gave on the account on the announcement of the acquisition. I wonder are there any updates you can give us help us with modeling this in and why not given the updated numbers since March 31st and then lastly sort of follow-up to Alexia\u2019s question, I wanted to asked about your creative businesses, because a couple of your peers at least have talked about weakness on the creative side and yet you seem to be doing very well. What is the difference, is it investment in talent or why are you doing good job of creative where some your peers are not.","Michael Roth","All of that, okay. Thank you Tim. Let me start with the creative, because you are right. I mean, in fact one of our competitors acknowledged when they were going through their restructure that they were not as strong as the other holding company and in fact they called out IPG and McCann.","Tim Nollen","And then specifically.","Michael Roth","So yes, we are very proud of our creative capabilities. We feel creativity and creative offerings are critical to the growth of our Company. So we, yes we have invested in talent. If you look at the key creative talent that we have at McCann in terms of SEB, MullenLowe and our independent agencies.","These are top notch creative people that have been recruited to IPG frankly now a couple of years ago. And the investment we made in them and the people they were able to recruit are going forward is paying very nicely in terms of the core businesses and their growth.","And that is the beauty of our open architecture and that is - what clients are really looking for are the integrated offerings where we can bring a combined opportunity to bring in creative, bringing media, bringing PR, bringing experiential all with a common purpose of working together to move the needle for our clients and now with Acxiom added to our media capabilities initially and then on our creative we have the insights in terms of how we can reach those consumers.","So we think creativity and creative talent is a critical component of our offerings and we didn\u2019t lose sight of that and as a result I think our core global agencies are performing well as a result of that. As far as the numbers go, all I can tell you that numbers we gave you, numbers we are using, I will comment on one point of it and that is we make assumptions on Acxiom for the rest of the year and modeling forward and it looks like we should be on target for achieving those goals. I think that is an important point.","So we wanted to make sure that we come out of the box and Acxiom is a proof point of the value that it adds to our portfolio. I'm very encouraged in terms of where the transition is going, the way the teams are working together and focusing on opportunities between the two without losing sight of their core data management business. So we're very pleased with the way the teams have handled the transition and the opportunities to that.","The question on American Express, I can tell you that sure, the fact that we have acting is a very important factor looking forward in terms of the opportunities that we have, but UM already was a one of the top-performing media agencies in the business, their track record reflected that. They were very strong in the offering.","And I can tell you that one with necessary in terms of the win, I will tell you it didn\u2019t hurt that we owned Acxiom, but I can tell you that it was because of Acxiom that we won. In fact I believe we were very competitive even before Acxiom transaction. This just made it even better.","Tim Nollen","Can we assume Acxiom is part of some of the ongoing pitches now?","Michael Roth","Well, you can count on it, an appropriate pitch is going forward the answer to that is yes.","Tim Nollen","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ben Swinburne","Thanks good morning. Just sticking on the Acxiom topic Michael. What is a realistic expectation for us in terms of the timing of any revenue benefits or revenue synergies? I know you have to integrate the businesses you are focused on cross selling and bringing them into pitch activity. Is that something that sort of starts immediately? Or do you think we should be thinking more about that over a period of time? And then I had a couple of questions in the quarter for Frank.","Michael Roth","Okay. Well look you know you don\u2019t take the $2 billion transaction and all of a sudden come out of the box and say all the synergy is there from day one. We have had extensive meetings and analysis. In fact we are presenting to the Board next week where we are on the transition in the synergy opportunities. But they are going to take some time before we see the full impact of that.","We don\u2019t want to do anything stupid. In fact we are absolutely - well I think this problem right now, but one of them is holding back. In other words the inbounds we are getting from all of our agencies to have access to Acxiom we don't want to inundate Acxiom folks and really throw a lumpy range in terms of the smooth transition. So we are actually holding back on some of these opportunities. So I think it will take a while before we see the full synergies.","That said, and what we said when we did the transaction you know we expect it to be accretive after adjusting for the causes and the amortization in the first year, and we believe we are certainly on-track to be able to say that and indicate that. We also made an assumption that we thought we would see about 5% growth on the Acxiom business and we are in target to do that.","Ben Swinburne","Okay that is great to hear. And then just on the expenses in the quarter, given how strong the top-line has been. I guess I would have guessed incentive comp would have been higher as a percent of revenue is down from last quarter, I know it\u2019s up year-over-year, but the business is going much faster now than it was a year ago. Any comment on where bonus accruals may have showed up and I saw it temporarily, but it was a quite a bit just any color on that and also all other O&G was up I think 6% to 7%; just any comments on that as we think about kind of the incremental margins on the business.","Frank Mergenthaler","The increase in the incentive advantage due to performance alright. So it's is based on where we think the year is going to land. So there is no surprises there we expected it to be higher as we continue to improve in the top line. On the temp labor, it's quite a little bit around supporting new business wins, new business on-boarding and pitching. So again with growth, you don't have the full-time employees to cover the incremental revenue needs so that is where you hit the temporary labor line.","Michael Roth","You know we also saw a 2% increase in our headcount. When you are growing like we are growing and as we expect to on-board new clients on new wins there is a bit of a miss match sometimes between as far as and new business being on-boarded, because you don\u2019t see revenue until later but you certainly have to staff up early. And that is one of the change, right that is one of the challenges we have to deal with as we on-board new clients.","But that is the kind of investment you like to make, right, because you know that the revenue is going to be there, it\u2019s just a question of timing and as Frank said sometime we use temporary labor, but ultimately the better answer is to have the right people in the right job on a full-time basis.","Frank Mergenthaler","And to your other O&G its primarily the spike is driven by pitch cost.","Ben Swinburne","Got you. So all good problems to have.","Frank Mergenthaler","Yes, exactly.","Ben Swinburne","Thanks a lot.","Frank Mergenthaler","Thanks Ben.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Cahall with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is now open.","Steve Cahall","Thanks. Maybe to start off with Michael with just a question on growth, so you reiterated the 5% that you have been seeing in Acxiom and your business is up around 5% year-to-date and everything you said sounded pretty constructive. So it's kind of 5%, the new kind of run rate in this environment for IPG is that a number that you are comfortable with?","Michael Roth","Well you know first of all, I reiterate what I said is we expected I mean 5% growth to be consistent through the rest of the quarter, I didn\u2019t know exactly commit to it. But I think it\u2019s reasonable and obviously our targeted 4.5% not 5%. So what I said was that we are comfortable in reaching 4.5% or something higher than that. And I will stick to those words, okay, but obviously the tone of our business and the new business wins put us in the high-end of the range on the revenue side.","Steve Cahall","Okay, yes, that is fair. And then, Frank maybe just a couple more on the model, I mean I guess, first, if we think about the margin impact from Acxiom its fairly significant. So as we just start to look forward, even with a little bit of declaration in margin expansion. Should we think of any reason why we don\u2019t just model in that extra margin from Acxiom that you have shown in the slide and then maybe if you could just help us a little bit with what you think about for your interest run rate and remind us what you are paced to deleverage back down to your target is. Thank you.","Frank Mergenthaler","Steven on the margin, we are in the planning process now including MS folks are coming in next week. So we will guide on February call where we think our 2019 margin target will be. So right now I don\u2019t really want to comment on that. On the deleveraging comment, we will say investment grade is critical for us, we have committed to the rating agencies delever, we haven't put a timeline out there as to how we are going to progress against that, other than is very important for us to maintain our investment grade rating and we will delever accordingly.","Michael Roth","You know, one of the things that sometimes get to overlook, when we announced the transaction, we thought there might be a downgrade in our ratings okay, and we were prepared not that we are asking them to do that, but the fact that the rating agencies one put us a little further put us on negative, but they held their ratings at least for a while.","The fact that the others held our ratings is an indication of the strength of our balance sheet and our modeling going forward. So I think we have been pretty good in terms of protecting the financial strength as well as dealing with shareholder returns in an appropriate way while maintaining our leverage and our financial strength. So that is what we are going to do.","We do see us returning to buyback whether it\u2019s one year versus another it will be totally a function of the macroeconomic environment and this is performance. And like I said we don\u2019t see any big transactions there we need capital for. So if you look at our CapEx let's assume we have 200 million of CapEx and we do some bolt on transactions of a nominal size.","Whatever in excess capital we have we still maintain belongs to our shareholders and protecting our financial strength on the balance sheet and our ratings. And the one thing we have been consistent over the last 14 years is being able to manage that and we expect to do that going forward.","Frank Mergenthaler","Next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Your line is open.","Jason Bazinet","I just had a question on the Slide 21 related to Acxiom. You guys mentioned that you are going to use adjusted EPS as a key indicator going forward. And I'm guessing I mean even in this quarter you have adjusted EPS. So I'm guessing, what that really is quote for as cash EPS. And I guess my question is have you guys ever sort of traded on cash EPS before, because when I go through just back of the envelope it seems like that the street moves to cash EPS number opposed to GAAP is worth like somewhere between $2 to $3 a share and your share price depending on what multiple stream you use?","Michael Roth","Well look you know, doing the expert on how we multiple, we just deliver results. We are just trying to be as transparent as we can so smart analyst can evaluate what the evaluation of our business today.","Frank Mergenthaler","Yes, but I understand your point and look, we went for a period of time in our Company where EPS was totally irrelevant, because of all the issues we were dealing with. So that is why we think the EBITDA number is a good one to compare this and by the way thank you to your analysis and position that you came out with this morning. We appreciate it.","Jason Bazinet","Yes of course. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Dan Salmon","Good morning everyone. Michael I just want to follow-up on one of the prior questions on Acxiom, you mentioned beyond Mediabrands, you highlighted the creative agencies. Should we take that immune as you think about moving beyond Mediabrands that is sort of the first place you want to bring the Acxiom offering, just may be more broadly we would love to hear about what you are thinking now that the deal is closed and you are getting more internal feedback on how you might extend those services and those products across the rest of the holding company? And then second you called out healthcare once again as a strong sector, we would just love to hear your high-level thoughts on not just what is contributing the IPG strength there. But what is going on in the broader marketplace there and how much do you expect to continue to see strengthen the vertical. Thank you.","Michael Roth","Yes. Let me talk about healthcare, because it\u2019s a great point and it\u2019s obviously a key driver. I mean year-to-date healthcare is 25% of our business, which has been growing as you pointed out over a number of years and of course the performance is our best performing sector. So it's always good to have an overweight in the sector that is over-performing. Now one follows the other obviously.","What we are seeing on the healthcare side is exactly what we were talking about in terms of open-architecture. The recent wins in healthcare are basically tailor-made to the open architecture structure. Healthcare company, in fact on in the global, I was in a meeting with one of our global - one of the pitches actually on the global healthcare and they were using the term open architecture to us.","So what they are looking for the resources that we have within IPG that can help them either by drug and expertise. So that expertise maybe at SEB, it maybe McCann Health. So we have to be in a position to bring in teams of that expertise and the only way to do that is through an open architecture structure.","And healthcare businesses are doing quite well and we have global offerings within that sector that meets the needs of our clients. And then when you overlay PR is I indicated Novartis win, it really gives us a great opportunity to show what open architecture can deliver to the client and the love that and it\u2019s up to us to make sure that is collaboration going within our agencies.","Because obviously the same agencies that are collaborating, sometimes they are competing for the same business, so that is the reason we use open architecture as opposed to one single agency per say. So I believe the healthcare is going to continue to perform well in the marketplace and our offerings are best-in-class as reflected by our wins in this sector.","The synergies on Acxiom, what I was referring to on the creative side is just think of how powerful it is, our creative people right now have their own data analytics to reach consumers to get it with the right creative that is relevant and trustworthy to that consumer.","When you overlay first-party data or data analytics that Acxiom can bring to the table it just makes that offering that much more powerful and if you couple it with media planning and execution you have the holy Grail of our business, but you can\u2019t all of a sudden just do this at one time.","So we been very thoughtful about this, which is why we're using our media business as the first blush here, because that is where the biggest opportunities are initially. So we will get that structured correctly as we are comfortable with that, then we will start rolling it out to the creative agencies that we have and all our other agencies, but at first the media focus is where the opportunities are.","Dan Salmon","Okay, great. Thank you Michael.","Michael Roth","My pleasure. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Joyce with Evercore. Your line is now open.","David Joyce","Thank you. I was just wondering if you could update us on the trend of your clients in-housing certain functions. What is it that you are doing to help them and then what sort of more complex activities are you still involved in? And how is that impacting your business?","Michael Roth","Yes, thank you. I know there was a recent report that showed there was an increase in housing. I think reference was a lot of the programmatic was there. We have been talking all along, yes, we have seen clients in-house programmatic, but that is easier said than done.","Programmatic is a very complex tool and even when we actually help our clients bringing in house but the relationships with the various providers, the analytics that go with it, the ability to reaching to the marketplace and have the best deals if you will we could help our clients to do that.","And what that enables us to do is continue the relationship between us and our clients and our ability to bring in our expertise. So we haven\u2019t seen huge movement into in-housing on the programmatic side. The slide that is coming in-house is more mechanical part of it. But the relationships and the expertise that we have that we can bring to the table is still relevant to those companies that bring in-house.","And by the way it takes a lot of money to invest and maintain that investment over a period of time and that remains to be seen how many of these clients that are bringing in-house are going to continue to do that. Historically we saw a lot of companies bring creative in-house and then eventually go back out and then come back in.","So that is nothing new to our industry. We know how to deal with that, but the value that we bring both in terms of the industry expertise, creative talent, media talent and experiential and PR just gives us other reasons to be in front of our clients, even if they take in some part of it in-house. But we haven\u2019t seen there is a dramatic increase as everyone is talking about.","David Joyce","Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","That was our final question for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Roth.","Michael Roth","Okay, well, look thank you very much. Obviously we are excited about our results, but we realized we have a big fourth quarter coming up. We got our heads down and we will walk towards. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jerome J. Leshne","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on the website, interpublic.com, and we'll refer to both in the course of this call. This morning, we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 a.m. Eastern.","During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company, which are subject to the uncertainties in the cautionary statement included in our earnings release and the slide presentation and further detailed in our 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. ","At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael I. Roth","Thank you, Jerry, and thank you for joining us this morning as we review our first quarter results. ","As usual, I'll start out by carving the key highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional detail on our quarter. I'll conclude with an update on our agencies and full year outlook to be followed by a Q&A. ","Beginning with revenue. In the first quarter, our organic rate -- growth rate was 2.8%. Our comparison to last year was the most challenging among our peer set because of our industry-leading 9.3% organic revenue growth in Q1 a year ago. ","Given this difficult hurdle, our 2.8% organic growth represents a solid result. Regionally, we were led by double-digit growth in Asia-Pac, fueled by a broad cross-section of our agencies, followed in turn by growth in Lat-Am, the U.S. and U.K. ","Revenue decreased in Continental Europe where macroeconomic conditions, not surprisingly, continued to pose a challenge. ","We saw growth at our IAN sector, which consists of our global advertising networks, our media operations, the U.S. integrated independents and our digital specialty agencies. ","CMG's strong performance reflects the continuing growth of our marketing services specialist agencies and public relations that is Weber and Golin, experiential and sports marketing, as well as branding and identity. ","Once again, digital services made a very strong contribution to our growth. This was true for the embedded capabilities at all of our global advertising networks within Mediabrands, at the U.S. integrated independent agencies and across the marketing services agencies that are part of CMG. It was also the case at our digital specialist agencies which continued to show strong growth and are making good progress in extending the service offerings and broadening the geographic reach. ","Turning to our client sectors. We had double-digit growth in the auto and transportation and retail sectors, as well as growth in financial services and food and beverage. ","The tone of our continuing business remains solid, but we did experience the negative revenue impact related to last year's account activity that we identified on our last call. Those headwinds were mainly felt in our consumer goods and tech and telecom sectors, both domestically and internationally. ","Turning to operating expenses. Results in the quarter reflect continued careful cost management. This type of discipline is something that we trust you've come to expect from this management team. ","Our Q1 seasonal operating loss was $39 million, a 13% improvement compared to a loss of $45 million a year ago. ","On a trailing 12-month basis, our operating margin was 9.8%, maintaining our performance for the full year 2011, a level of profitability that Interpublic had not achieved in over a decade. Other Q1 highlights saw continued progress in decreasing  outstanding shares and reducing our debt. ","During the quarter, we repurchased a further 5 million shares using $53 million along with our quarterly common stock dividend of $26 million. ","Given the seasonality of our cash flows, we chose to moderate the pace of our repurchase activity in the year's first quarter. ","For the 12 months ending March 31, we have returned over $550 million to our shareholders via common dividends and the repurchase of 46 million shares. This is an accomplishment of which we are proud and one that speaks to our confidence that we can continue to build on the strong performance and positive momentum of recent years, another area in which we've taken significant strides in strengthening our balance sheet and overall financial position. In late March, we took another positive step in this regard by retiring our $400 million 4.25% convertible notes, which eliminates 33 million shares from our diluted share count. Concurrently, we issued $250 million of new 10-year senior notes with a 4% coupon, thereby, lowering our total debt by $150 million as a result of these 2 transactions. ","With the first quarter behind us, we remain solidly on track to deliver on our 2012 targets as we continue to drive value for our key stakeholders going forward. ","I'll turn things over to Frank now for some additional color and join you after his remarks.","Frank Mergenthaler","Good morning. As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. ","On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of our results. Organic growth was 2.8% in Q1, which as Michael pointed out, was on top of industry-leading organic growth of 9.3% a year ago. We continue to narrow our Q1 seasonal operating loss, which was $39 million this year. Compared to last year's first quarter, we drove 50 basis point of operating leverage from our ops and general expenses, primarily on occupancy costs. ","Trailing 12-month operating margin was 9.8%. The conversion rate on our constant currency revenue growth to operating profit for the trailing 12 months remains in excess of 30%. ","Our Q1 earnings per share was a seasonal loss of $0.10, the same level as a year ago. We maintained strong liquidity with $1.59 billion of cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet at quarter end compared with $1.85 billion a year ago. ","That comparison includes having used over $700 million to repurchase shares, pay common dividends and pay down long-term debt over the past 12 months. The retirement of our convertible notes in the first quarter dramatically reduces our diluted share count while our deleveraging is the latest step in a series of moves that have seen us lower our debt by $730 million over the past 4 years, significantly strengthening our financial position.","Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail on the slides that follow. ","Our average basic share count for the quarter was 438 million compared with 476 million a year ago, a decrease of 8%. ","During Q1, we repurchased 5 million shares at an average cost of $10.61. We had $298 million remaining on our board authorization as of March 31. ","Turning to operations on Slide 4, beginning with revenue. Revenue in the quarter was $1.51 billion, an increase of 2.2%. Compared to Q1 2011, the impact of change in exchange rates was a negative 110 basis point while net acquisitions and dispositions added 50 basis points. The resulting organic revenue increase was 2.8%. ","The tone of business was solid across most of our businesses and regions of the world, although, our growth rate also reflects the revenue headwinds that Michael mentioned earlier. ","As you can see on the bottom half of this slide, our Integrated Agency Networks segment grew 1.7% on top of 9.7% a year ago. ","Organic growth at our CMG segment was 8.6%, with solid performance across the marketing services portfolio led by strong regional growth in Asia-Pac, the U.K. and Latin America. ","Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., we had 2.7% organic growth. Our independent agencies Lowe & Partners, Worldgroup and our specialty digital agencies all had a strong quarter. ","Turning to international markets; again, focusing on organic growth. U.K. increased 2.5% on top of 9.2% growth in Q1 2011. Growth was fairly broad-based across our agencies and disciplines, as well as client sectors.  ","Continental Europe decreased 5.5% in Q1. Macro conditions continued to weigh on client spending while last year's account losses also weighed on performance. ","Asia-Pac organic revenue growth was 16.9% in Q1, which is a terrific result on top of double-digit growth a year ago. We saw strong growth in media, marketing services and at McCann. We had double-digit increases in Australia, China and Japan. Reported growth was 21.7%, which includes revenue of our recent acquisitions in that region. ","In Lat-Am, Q1 organic revenue growth was 4.4% on top of double-digit growth in Q1 2011. We were led by strong regional offerings of McCann, Lowe and CMG. R\/GA offices in Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires also contributed. Our other markets group decreased 2.8% due to decreases in Middle East and Canada, partially offset by growth in South Africa. ","On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. Most -- the most recent data point is 4.7%, which is updated to include Q1 2012. ","Moving on to Slide 7 on our operating expenses. Total operating expenses increased 2.2% organically compared to last year. Our operators continue their effective focus on expense management. For the trailing 12 months, operating expenses increased only 3.1% organically, well below organic revenue growth of 4.7% during the same period. ","Total salaries and related expenses were 73.3% of revenue in Q1 compared to 73.2% of revenue last year. On a trailing 12-month basis to March 31, total salaries and related expenses were 62.8%, compared to 63.5% from the same period a year ago. Again, we tend to recognize expenses relatively evenly across the 4 quarters while Q1 reflects the seasonality of our revenue. ","Our total headcount at quarter end was 42,500, a year-on-year increase of 1.6%. The increase reflects our investment of growing disciplines such as media and public relations and in digital services throughout our agencies. It also reflects growth in markets such as China, India and Brazil. Offsetting these investments were net reductions in certain markets such as Continental Europe, where our focus has been managing our workforce to the appropriate revenue base. ","Severance expense is 1.4% of Q1 revenue compared with 1.6% a year ago. Incentive expense in the quarter was 4.4% of revenue both this year and the year ago. For the full year, we continue to expect incentive expense to remain in the range of 3.5% to 4% of revenue. ","Turning to office and general expenses on the lower half of the slide, O&G was $441 million, an increase of less than 1% both organically and reported. O&G expense was 29.3% of revenue compared to 29.8% a year ago. Underneath that 50-basis-point improvement, we drove 40 points of leverage in occupancy expense, which is due to both our revenue growth and lower lease expense. ","On Slide 8, we show our operating margin improvement on a trailing 12-month basis with the most recent data point of 9.8% for Q1 2012. ","As we said on our Q4 call, our target level for this year to improve at least 50 basis points on the way to our objective of fully competitive profitability over the next few years. ","Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 9. We ended the quarter with $1.59 billion in cash and short-term marketable securities compared with $1.85 billion a year ago, a decrease of approximately $270 million. ","The comparison includes over $550 million returned to shareholders over the last 12 months in the form of share repurchases and common stock dividends, as well as net debt reduction of $150 million in our long-term debt. We also had cash inflow last year of $134 million from the sale of approximately half our interest on Facebook. ","On Slide 10, we turn to cash flow for the quarter. Cash used in operations was $498 million compared with the use of $801 million a year ago. As a reminder, cash flow in our business is seasonal. Working capital tends to generate cash in the fourth quarter, which is followed by the use of cash in the first quarter. ","In this year's first quarter, cash used in working capital was $445 million compared with the use of $736 million a year ago. We pointed out in our last conference call that we expect to see more moderate cash use in Q1 this year as the follow-on to more moderate cash generation of the proceeding fourth quarter. ","In investing activities, we used $21 million in Q1 primarily for CapEx. Our financing activities used $229 million, which includes net debt reduction of $150 million. We also used the $50 million -- $53 million per share repurchases and $26 million on our quarterly common stock dividend. Net decrease in cash and marketable securities in the quarter was $729 million. ","On Slide 11, you see our total debt outstanding at quarter end and at year end from 2007 through Q1 2012. This depicts a reduction of total debt, which has seen us take total debt from $2.35 billion at the end of 2007 to $1.62 billion at the end of March 2012, a decrease of $730 million. By retiring the convertible notes in Q1, we eliminated 33 million shares from our diluted share count. ","For EPS purposes, since the retirement in the current near the end of the first quarter, you should be aware that we will show a reduction for the full year of approximately 3\/4 of that total with the entire $33 million out for next year. ","It is also worth noting that at the end of February, S&P upgraded our outlook to positive, and just last week, Fitch reaffirmed our investment grade rating with an outlook stable. Looking ahead, over the next 12 to 18 months, we'll have additional opportunities for debt reduction and to further improve our balance sheet and reduce our effective cost of debt. ","In summary on Slide 12. We are pleased with our performance in the quarter. This organic growth that reflects the strength of our offerings and our globally diverse businesses. We continue to effectively manage costs and believe we remain on track to deliver our financial objectives for the year. Now let me turn it back over to Michael.","Michael I. Roth","Thank you, Frank. As you can see our first quarter performance represents a solid beginning for 2012. Organic revenue growth on top of the very strong Q1 last year, demonstrates that our agencies continue to be highly competitive in the marketplace and contributions came from across our portfolio. The companies within CMG continue to win market share and we are leading the industry in areas such as PR, experiential and sports marketing. ","Of the growth -- other growth drivers in the quarter included our U.S. integrated independents, Mediabrands and Lowe. Across the group, digital services were strong. ","During our recent calendar view meetings with our major operators, one of the recurrent themes has been [Audio Gap] continue to adapt our various offerings to meet the demands of marketing in a digital world. Whether it be at Mullen or Deutsche, Weber Shandwick or UM, at least half, and as many 3  and 4 new hires coming on stream, are individuals who bring digital expertise into our agencies. ","We continue to see the benefits of our digital strategy in which the primary pillar is embedding digital talent at all of our agencies. Of course, having best-in-class digital specialists like R\/GA, HUGE and MRM, as well as leading-edge offerings such as Cadreon and the audience platform, further enhances our digital capabilities and our overall performance. ","Since the beginning of the year, we've begun to build new business momentums and we are net new business positive for the first quarter. ","The commonwealth win at McCann will see us add meaningful incremental GM markets and revenue internationally. Worldgroup has also added a number of wins in its healthcare group. Draftfcb made good strides in replacing its SCJ revenue domestically with digital and CRM wins on Cox Communications and Discover Card, and also had significant assignments on the healthcare front. ","Our U.S. independents and Mediabrands had strong new business in the quarter. The new business pipeline is solid. At this time, last year, we had a number of major clients in review. That is not currently the case. Instead of defending, we are involved in a number of new business opportunities in which there is significant upside. It also bears mention that our performance in the emerging economies remains strong. Coming off combined organic revenue growth greater than 25% in Brazil, India and China in Q1 of 2011, we saw additional double-digit growth in this group during the first quarter. ","This result was led by China where our CMG agencies, McCann and Mediabrands led the way. Draftfcb also won a number of important new clients in the market. ","In Brazil, performance was led by Lowe, CMG and R\/GA. McCann also performed well in Lat-Am. ","In India, we've had a very significant market presence overall, with Draftfcb, Lowe and McCann, all having outstanding agencies. ","As you saw last year, we've begun to be more active on the M&A front. We do not see any area of vulnerability in our portfolio, but we are committed to investing in targeted transactions that enhance our agency brands, particularly in high-growth capabilities such as digital and marketing services, as well as high-growth geographic markets. ","There's never been a greater need for informed advice as companies in every industry and all regions of the world seek to navigate an increasingly complex digital, media and consumer ecosystem. We are well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities. ","In summary, we are pleased with the Q1 results. We know that Q1 is our smallest revenue period seasonally and while the headwinds we are facing will be less pronounced in the second half of the year, we have consistently cautioned against putting too much weight on a single quarter's results. ","That said, we remain comfortable with the full year 2012 goals of 3% organic revenue growth and at least 50 basis points of operating margin improvement that we shared with you on our last call. ","We are solidly on track to deliver on those targets. The significant deleveraging we've undergone and the strength of our balance sheet provide additional powerful leverage that should allow us to continue to support the needs of our business, return capital to our owners and drive shareholder value. The challenge for our management teams and for our people is to remain focused on the needs of our clients and building their businesses, which in turn will allow us to build on our success and create sustained value going forward. ","I would now like to open the floor for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Alexia Quadrani of JPMC.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","If you can give us a bit more detail on the impact of the client losses you were dealing within quarter. Was January the first month of the revenue loss from SC Johnson? And do you think we'll be hit with the same sort of magnitude in the second quarter? And then, when do you circle pass through any other notable client losses that are still impacting the quarter?","Michael I. Roth","Yes. Thank you, Alexia. Well, we had indicated they actually -- and we started seeing the loss of SC Johnson in December of last year. So it didn't wait until January before we saw any impact. What we said in our call that we expected about 2% to 3% of headwinds for the full year and while we indicated it was over-weighted, if you will, in the first half of the year. So we will continue to see those headwinds certainly through the first 6 months, but we will continue to see some headwinds through the balance of the year. If you -- what's interesting about the headwinds is that it's somewhat overweighted in the U.S., Lat-Am and Continental Europe, which explains some of the lower organic growth numbers that we're putting out there with respect to those markets. So if we use the first half of the year, if we use anywhere from 3% to say 3.5% in terms of headwinds, that should give you a good idea and that should start trailing off towards the end of the year.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then other -- were there anything else real sizable that's also, I guess, above the normal course of business that also impacted Q1 or is it really the SC Johnson?","Michael I. Roth","Obviously, that was a big factor. Of course, we had the Microsoft media and we did have the Home Depot media flowing through. But again, Alexia, if we look at it from a full-year perspective, when we say we're comfortable with 3% organic, that takes into account the headwinds and basically how we see the flow-through impact of that throughout the year.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So it sounds like if the headwinds are the same and not getting any worse, maybe even getting a little bit better in Q2 and comps get a little bit easier, we should see, I guess, there's -- I know you don't give quarterly guidance, but there's a reason to believe things get a little bit better in the second quarter in terms of...","Michael I. Roth","It only took you a few minutes before you ask already about the second quarter, Alexia. But look, we again -- we don't give quarterly results forecast. We look at it from a full year. Obviously, there's some new -- there's some opportunities into -- new business wins that will factor into our results. So all we can say is that you see the existing headwinds that we have. We are comfortable with our overall objective. I hope to see some good positive announcements on some of the new business opportunities we are seeing and all of that will impact our second quarter results.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right. Well, just one more, but bigger -- big-picture question. On McCann in the U.S., I know you highlighted in some of your prepared remarks about the strength you're seeing outside the U.S. In the U.S. itself, are you seeing -- did you see growth year-over-year at McCann? And I guess, any color on where McCann is versus where you hoped it to be at this point?","Michael I. Roth","McCann, obviously, we've made continuing investments in new talent in McCann. And just recently, I met with the senior management team there. I'm feeling real good about our leadership at McCann and where that's heading. They have terrific plans in terms of opportunities that are out there. Of course, once in a while, you see some losses, and I'll anticipate the question before it comes. We just recently saw movement of some business out of McCann, L.A. Not significant in terms of dollars, but it is with Nestl\u00e9. On the other side, you'll see an announcement recently of McCann U.S. winning a new project with Nestl\u00e9 Waters. So that's the nature of our business. We win some business, we lose some business. When we give you a full year forecast, it factors in all the business opportunities and potential [indiscernible] we see.","Operator","David Bank of RBC Capital.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. The first here is if you look at the growth that you generated in the first quarter and then, I guess, extrapolate it to your guidance for the full year, could you talk about how much of that organic growth or how much growth is sort of a function of new business wins versus existing clients? And has that -- did that surprise you at all in the first quarter? And the second sort of related question is if you think about the agency business, you kind of win some and you lose some. We obsess about these headwinds and stuff, but the reality is sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. If you look at the 200 to 300 basis point headwinds, how much of the 200 to 300 basis point is really kind of above and beyond in your mind that win some, lose some?","Michael I. Roth","Yes, let me talk about the first. This is the first quarter, so it's hard to pinpoint exactly how much is new business versus not, but the fact is in the first quarter, the growth that we're seeing is from our existing clients, okay? The roll off of our losses we know and how that's going to impact us and that's why we give you the numbers that we've given you, but we won't see new business wins impact until later on in the year. We're starting to see some of it in the second quarter but it should be through the rest of the year. The other thing to keep in mind is that if you look at the organic changes in our first quarter last year, we had some -- a very impressive organic growth in the quarter. For example, in the U.S., we had an 8.8% organic growth in the first quarter. So that's a very difficult hurdle with some headwinds to overcome so we're pleased with the changes that we're seeing in the United States facing that kind of organic growth. The same when you go to Lat-Am. Lat-Am, we had almost 14% organic growth in the fourth -- in the first quarter last year, so to show growth on top of that is fairly impressive. So that's exactly why when we give guidance, if you will, we talk about it from a full-year perspective, because we look and anticipate some loss business, we know what our existing client base, we've already stated that our strength is in our existing client base. We win some, we lose some. And the bulk of our organic growth from our existing clients is what drives our business. And that's how we operate our businesses.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","But I guess -- if I could just sort of follow-up, so I think we understand then you guys have been really transparent in pointing out the headwinds. If you look at the year. Is it -- normally, like what is kind of the normal range of headwind? I guess what I'm asking? Where wouldn't you point it out? If it was like 100 basis point in either direction.","Michael I. Roth","Last year, we had about 2% headwinds. So to put one on top of the other, if every year we're going in with 2%, and last year, we had terrific organic performance versus our sector so we were able to, on a full year basis, overcome 2% headwinds. Obviously, we're driving to do the same for this year, it is only the first quarter. We'll be announcing some positive wins. We have a whole year ahead of us and so that is, if you want to keep that in mind, we've been able to overcome those kind of headwinds before. And still show very strong performance.","Operator","John Janedis of UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Frank, can you talk a little bit more on the leverage and the occupancy line? I think you've got a team working on that, but is that a good run rate on an absolute dollar basis going forward or were there some onetime items in there?","Frank Mergenthaler","John, there was no onetime items. We've seen progress on that line for multiple quarters. I think our centralized real estate team does a terrific job. We're constantly trying to co-locate agencies and markets, take advantage of scale, drive competitive pricing in markets on lease terms and we've been seeing that benefit consistently. So there's not a real estate transaction that can get executed anywhere in the globe that doesn't go through that group. And the group's doing a terrific job, and we expect it to continue to do a terrific job.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That wouldn't move very much, I guess, through the next couple of quarters?","Frank Mergenthaler","I don't expect to see. Again, we want to see consistent progress, John, but if you go back and track it, there's a magnitude of the progress over the past 8, 10 quarters, we're starting to hit a ceiling specially as the global real estate markets starts to turn and pick up.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then can you guys talk a little bit about how your multinational clients are thinking about their spending in Continental Europe? Meaning, are they reallocating to other faster growing markets outside of Europe? Or are they just taking the money and pulling back on that budget? And also, do you think we're bottoming in Europe yet?","Michael I. Roth","I wish I knew the answer to the question, whether we -- I hope we bottomed in Europe. Look, we had good results in the U.K. That's a positive sign, but, obviously, the rest of Continental Europe is challenging and there are pockets of light and there are still issues. Our multinational clients are focused on emerging markets, period. That's not news and frankly, they go where the money is and where the opportunities are. So that's why it's so important for us to have very strong offerings in those markets whether it would be Lat-Am, whether it be Asia-Pac and the rest of China and India, but also in markets like Indonesia and Africa and Turkey. These are markets that our clients are looking at to invest money and gain market share, and that's where we're going to see significant growth in the years to come. So it's not a question of just taking money and cutting back here and investing there. They are investing in growth, period. And if there's an opportunity to invest in growth, they will spend those dollars.","Operator","Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to get a little bit more color on CMG, if we could. First of all, any onetime items in there? I know it tends to be more of a project-based business. And secondly, can you give us a sense of the component there? Is this really being driven by predominantly PR? And then, how does this visibility for you, for CMG, kind of compare  to IAN?","Michael I. Roth","Yes, I mean, you're absolutely right. The CMG business tends to be more of a project-based business. We're trying to get that to a model of recurring revenue stream. We're making some success there, but clearly, it's always interesting when we do forecasting for those businesses. Because it's a project-based business, most of their business is to be generated, as we say. But they consistently outperformed, so we're very comfortable with those numbers. We've had a very strong market in particularly in the PR side. Weber Shandwick and GolinHarris continue to be best in class. They win awards that reflect that, but the results -- more importantly, their results reflect that. Our sports marketing group:  Octagon is having a very good year; as well as Jack Morton, which is our experiential marketing. So although Weber Shandwick  and PR and Golin are the biggest piece of CMG, we are seeing good performance across all the businesses within CMG.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. And I'm wondering, you might be reluctant to provide this, but in terms of looking at Europe, if CMG is, call it, 17% of your revenue globally. I mean, are we talking about a distribution in Europe that is radically different? Is CMG 5% of the business over there or?","Frank Mergenthaler","Without getting specific numbers, Peter, it's small. The distribution is smaller in Europe. But they've actually invested in our growing especially in the U.K.","Operator","Matt Chesler of Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So it was a good start to the year. Can you give us a sense as to if you wouldn't mind revealing how this compared to your internal budgets whether it was revenue or profitability or both? Just trying to get a sense whether -- you gave guidance. It's only been a month and a half and this is just the first quarter of the year, but whether you're feeling incrementally positive or in terms of hitting your full year target or whether your confidence is pretty equivalent to what it was when you first offered the guidance a month and a half ago?","Michael I. Roth","Well, I wouldn't say that we're solidly on track to deliver on these targets if I wasn't comfortable with those numbers. I hate to do this because all the accountants are going to look at me funny. But take a look at our incentive comp as an example, okay? We base our incentive comp on a full year basis, okay? And then, we have to amortize it through the year. So that is one line, if you want to look at I don't particularly like looking at it, but I know you're going to ask for example. So I'll use that went. Our incentive comp is in line frankly it's a little higher but it's in line with what we forecast for the full year. In order for us to do that, we have to be comfortable with the full year and we have to show that where our plans are coming out are consistent with that. That's the simplest way I can tell you that we're comfortable with the full year. Look, we want to drive to beat that. That's our objective, all right? We set targets that we think are a bit of a stretch but are attainable and that all our business units put together plans on where they think they can do better. So we're comfortable where we are right now for the first quarter. Certainly, we've got a lot of time left in the year, but the tone of our business all indicates that we should be able to deliver on these results and hopefully we'll do a little better.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Quick question for Frank. Frank, can you sort of lay out your thoughts as to deleveraging further from this point in time? I mean, the way that you handled the transactions in the quarter are somewhat indicative of a current desire to delever a bit so far this year, but really not clear what's your thoughts are beyond that point?","Frank Mergenthaler","I mean, Matt, you can expect to see further deleveraging for us, I don't want to put a number on it, and we've got material opportunity a year from now when we've got some more converts out there, depending on what share price is. And we also have some expensive securities that mature in 2017 with a coupon of 10% that we can buy in or refinance at a slight premium. So those are things you can expect this management team to be aggressive in looking at options and driving the cost of our funding down plus probably deleveraging along with it.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And when you talk about deleveraging, Frank, I mean are you talking about sort of the multiple or are you also referring to absolute pay down of gross debt. And just on those 10%s, when is the first opportunity that you're able to go at them?","Frank Mergenthaler","Second quarter of next year, we can go at them with a locked-in premium, which is manageable, because right now they're trading at a very expensive premium. So we probably won't touch them until that strike price is locked in. And you can expect actual gross debt to come down somewhat.","Michael I. Roth","A good example of our approach to the balance sheet is look at our debt offering. We borrowed 250, we were very pleased with our ability and our reaction in the marketplace. It was oversubscribed many times over. And frankly, we could have loaded up on debt there at a very attractive rate and we chose not to. And so we chose to take that $150 million and reduce our debt. So I think that should give you a good indication, one, of our confidence in our ability to perform in the future, and 2, where we look to see where we put our capital. And so we can -- the Board authorized the new share buyback program of $300 million, which we are now starting to eat into, so we finished the $450 million authorization. And from a balance sheet point of view, we're very comfortable, but as Frank said, we're going to be very opportunistic in terms of the marketplace and where do we use our capital and what are the right objectives. Our objectives are to grow our business and enhance shareholder value. And that's the analysis we go through every time we see an opportunity.","Operator","Michael Nathanson of Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I have a couple. Let me start with China for a second. If you look at your Asia-Pac number for this quarter, how big is China within Asia-Pac? And in terms of the business you're winning, what's the difference there between your CMG offerings and IAN? So what's driving China, and how big is it?","Michael I. Roth","Well, we don't give out specific numbers by country. We do -- Asia-Pac, we do give out numbers. It's -- obviously, Asia-Pac is becoming a bigger piece of our business. Overall, let's assume Asia-Pac is 11% or so. And clearly, China is an important part of that, although, it's certainly not the largest part of Asia-Pac.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of how do you get bigger in China? How do you go about it's now fourth or maybe the third biggest advertising market in the world. So how do you to get into China more aggressively?","Michael I. Roth","Yes. We are -- the first thing you have to do in China is to make sure you have new talent and good talent. And if you look at, for example, we just beefed-up our talent in McCann in China with the addition of Jesse and some other people. CMG has repositioned its offerings in China and so talent is what drives the business in China. It's kind of a illusory to go out and buy businesses in China that frankly a year from now, they're not even going to be there. So we will be strategic if we see some attractive bolt-ons, if you will, to any transactions in China. We will look at them. We'll try to get comfortable with retention of the people and the book of business. But our primary focus in China is to grow organically through getting great talent and working with our multinationals as well as focusing on local clients. For example, some of our businesses, because of our multinationals, have a good core agency and they're growing locally, which is I think, eventually, as we go out beyond the key cities, we have to be able to have talent to focus on that growth locally. And that's how we're going to grow it.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Can I just ask one for Frank. I guess, the deleveraging have been a little bit less aggressively than maybe I would've have thought, given how much cash you have on the balance sheet. So just can you walk me through the thinking for both of you guys of, I know the rates were low -- you took advantage of that -- but why even go to debt market when you have so much cash on your books? Is there just a level of cash you want to always have just in case? So walk me through why you didn't tap into that market to this point?","Frank Mergenthaler","As Michael pointed out in his comments earlier. There are a bunch of cash calls around trying to drive shareholder value. So we're trying to manage our way through where we put our money against M&A, where we put our money with respect to share repurchase, where we put our money in dividends. So we're looking at multiple uses for our cash. When we evaluated our options, the 2 things we concluded on was, one, we wanted to deleverage and we will continue to delever and we wanted to do it in a way that was thoughtful and take advantage of very, very attractive markets. So I think the transactions we did, delevering by $150 million and also tapping a very attractive debt market, I think, was a very well balanced, thought-out strategy. And I think going forward, you'll continue to see us in a similar path. We look at all options that I think will be fairly thoughtful around what we're going to do with respect to delevering further and also tapping a very attractive capital markets.","Michael I. Roth","The same kind of conversation we had on whether we do share buybacks versus dividends. And frankly, one of the issues that we have to address is whether the tax law is going to change and what impact that will be. So we want to make sure we are flexible in terms of our cash and basically to meet the objectives of our shareholders. I mean, certainly, there's an argument, aside from not tapping the debt market at all, there's an argument that giving rates, being so low, we should have borrowed as much as we could and be opportunistic and then figure out what to do with the money in terms of whether it be share buyback or whatever. We don't want to be knee-jerk reaction to that, but we want to make sure we're participating. So I think the message you should take away from what we did in the debt offering is we were opportunistic, we saw some good rates and we took advantage of it. We were conscious of our investment grade rating and we still have one more to go. And we want to make sure by the end of the year, we're positioned, so that we finally get them to move on that, and we're hopeful that they will. And so all of our various constituencies are affected by whatever decision we make and by our dividend policy, by our share buyback policy, by deleveraging. All of that rolls up into how we enhance shareholder value and we will continue to make those calls as they come up and as we see opportunities. I think that's what you want us to do in terms of our management team.","Operator","Tim Nollen of Macquarie.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","Tim Nollen from Macquarie. Two questions, actually, please. First just following up on the cost questions. I think it's nice to see staff cost organically rising just about in line just below a fact, I guess, organic revenue growth, and even better to see the O&G line and remaining very, very low. Could you just let us -- do you have specific targets in mind that gets you to what you're considering a peer level performance a few years out in terms of those 2 lines? I think I know what they are, but I just want to make sure you're on track and what those numbers are. And then secondly, could you please talk about what you're seeing in terms of shifting budgets from TV or the broadcast or cable into online video, industry-wide, what you're seeing and more importantly for you, how that impacts you, if at all?","Michael I. Roth","The shifting is the ongoing question. Every year, everyone says TV is dead. Everything is going online and yet you see organic growth in TV. So here I go, I mean, I'm just going to tell you and I said it in my remarks, advice in terms of way you spend your money right now is critical. Analytics, in terms of where you spend your money are critical, which is why we're investing our money in talent and resources and tools to make that decision. Clearly, online spending and video and the web are all significant growth opportunities and we have the resources and talents to work it, but traditional TV hasn't gone away. Now you can look at the forecast and say that the rate that it's going, eventually, Internet is going to overtake it, who knows. But right now, we have to be able to be responsive to all of that, and in some cases, traditional TV works. In some cases, it doesn't. And we do see a considerable amount of our client dollars focusing on digital and web-based video. And certainly, the issue of the over-the-top and all these things are issues that we have to be able to address. And frankly, that confusion is good for us because that's where we earn our stripes in terms of advising our clients.","Frank Mergenthaler","And, Tim, on the cost profile as we close the difference between where we are and competitive margins, we hope to continue to see progress against the O&G performance although we're starting to bottom out. So the real leverage is going to be around staff costs. And when you look at a fully loaded staff cost ratio, that number has got to be less than 60%. And right now, it's -- we've made significant progress but we need -- there's still room to grow. When we look at the various components, it's getting greater operating leverage out of our base salaries and being very aggressive in things like temporary labor. And it's an area that all of our operating groups have been extremely focused on for years, have invested aggressively against technology and tools to allow them better visibility into things like staff utilization. And it's the metric quite frankly every time Michael and I meet with our operating folks we spend the most time on other than revenue. So that's the area that if we are going to close the gap or when we close the gap, that's the area we need to see the greatest leverage.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","So even staff costs currently rising about the same pace as organic revenue growth, you're looking for efficiencies there that can keep that ratio down.","Frank Mergenthaler","Sure. I mean, and again the real estate discussion or the comments we made earlier is a good case in point.","Michael I. Roth","The reference I made to the people we are hiring have digital expertise goes to that issue. What you have is an employee base that some of whom haven't gotten the experience or really bought onto to the new digital environment. And when you bring in talent that is, it makes it much more efficient. And by the way, our staff cost ratios are going up, but organic is going up more, it's not the same. So that's a good sign when that happens, okay. Because that's where you see the leverage drawn on our people, and to the extent we're able to see talent in the marketplace and bring them onboard, that's how we become more efficient going forward.","Operator","Anthony DiClemente of Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It's clear to me that your clients, your existing clients need the advice on what to do in the environment. I'm wondering if your clients are looking at digital as way to use earned media as opposed to paid media with respect to new projects. So that's okay for you guys, you're still providing the consulting, but I'm just wondering, are they looking to do more with less? And people talk about that in the context of social media understating -- dollars estimated on social media understating the true activity. So I'm wondering -- your thoughts on that and I have a follow-up for Frank.","Michael I. Roth","No, absolutely. I mean, that's the holy grail. I mean, if they can start shifting that and we can provide the tools and resources and content, right, because you need content to be able to do that, then that is certainly a key objective. And frankly, if we're a part of making that happen, that's what our tools and resources are supposed to be able to do.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Making what happen exactly? Making it -- allowing them to do more with less paid media dollars? Making that possible? Is that what you mean?","Michael I. Roth","Yes. I mean and look, that's the game on the social media and -- but you still need content. You still need things that measure it. You still need access to the consumer and that relationship and what else are they looking for, and how do you build that platform. And that's what we do.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Thanks, Michael. Frank, what I'd love to get is a better feel for incremental margin in the model. Not sure if there's a clean way for you to help us with this, but like for example, if after all is said and done for 2012, if you were to print 4% organic revenue growth, how would that flex your 50 basis point improvement in operating margins, for example?","Frank Mergenthaler","Well, we had said going into '11, incremental margin on growth of 30% was a reasonable assumption. We reiterated that on our last call. When you look at trailing 12 months, incremental margin as of 3\/31, it's north of 30%. So if we in fact exceed the 3%, is there an opportunity to expand that 50 basis points margin...","Frank Mergenthaler","Sure. Right? And so 30% assumption is still a good assumption.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But I think that using your current numbers, it's actually more like -- I could be wrong, but it's more like higher than 50% incremental margin as it stands?","Frank Mergenthaler","Well, again, if I look at what my trailing 12 is after 3\/31, it's 38%.","Michael I. Roth","Yes. When we modeled out and we had our Investor Day, when we showed our glide pass, if you will, to achieving competitive margins, if we use a 30% conversion rate, that's how we're going to get there. So if we do better, we'll get there sooner.","Operator","James Dix of Wedbush.","James Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Just 2 questions for you. First, when you last reported the big account review out there was Chevy where you got a win. I'm just curious at this point what are the big account reviews out there for you both where you can pick up business and any significant ones where you might be defending [ph] ? And have do you look at your position on them and the likely timing of when you'll find out? And then second, your severance for the quarter was really dead in line with what I was expecting. I just want to know if you can give a little color as to where you are expecting severance for the year as a percent of revenue, especially given the geographic trends, growth trends, you're seeing in particular the declines in Europe. Although you've been fairly vocal about things, you have not expected a lot of growth in Europe this year.","Michael I. Roth","The 2 biggest pictures out there frankly are opportunities for us. One is Unilever Media. As you may know, right now, the bulk of our Unilever media is in Latin America and we are very comfortable with where we stand on that and we view our opportunities with respect to inroads on the global media pitch. Hopefully, will be positive and we're actively engaged in that discussion as we speak. So the downside on that one is not significant. The upside we think could be very beneficial to us. The other one is the Bank of America. There, Hill Holliday is leading our pitch there. We have an existing relationship with Hill Holliday and Bank of America, which is outstanding. We certainly are comfortable and we believe our existing business is solid and we view that as an opportunity as well. We don't have any other big pitches. We have the post office with respect to Campbell Ewald and Draftfcb that, as you may know, has been extended. So that will play out towards the end of the year. The other 2 pitches we would hope to see in the first half of the year resolved. But we don't have any other big clients up for review, and frankly, which is why my comment was I think our opportunities on the upside in terms of new business.","Frank Mergenthaler","James on severance. For the first quarter, the majority of the severance was in Europe. For the full year, we historically guided people to 1% . We've trended over that for the last few years, probably 1.5% of revenues is a reasonable number and I think that the variable in that discussion again is Europe.","Michael I.

We will begin with prepared remarks to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 Eastern Time.","During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company. These are subject to the uncertainties in the cautionary statement that is included in our earnings release and the slide presentation and further detailed in our 10-K and other filings with the SEC.","We will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP measures, allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance.","At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Jerry, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we review our results for the fourth quarter and 2017. As usual, I'll start out by covering the highlights of our performance, as well as our outlook for the New Year. Frank will then provide additional details, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies to be followed by our Q&A.","We\u2019re pleased to report fourth quarter performance highlighted by stronger organic growth and margin expansion, as well as the full year financial results that deliver on the growth and margin target outlined in our October update.","Among our financial highlights, fourth quarter organic revenue growth was 3.3% which is on top of a very challenging 5.3% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Organic growth was 2.5% excluding the increase in our pass-through revenues.","Growth in the quarter was driven by a wide range of our agencies and services and in both our U.S. and international markets. We were led by the continuing outstanding performance of IPG Mediabrands, which again had strong global growth and they are creatively driven advertising businesses at McCann World Group, FCB and Deutsch.","From the point of view of client sectors, we had notable growth in the areas of auto and transportation, travel, government, and healthcare. Our fourth quarter operating margin was 22.1%, which is an increase of 70 basis points from a year ago, reflecting leverage on a salaries and related expenses. Importantly, 2017 full year operating margin increased 40 basis points to 12.4%.","Our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.81 and with $0.79 as adjusted, which is a 5.3% increase over comparable earnings per share year ago. The adjustments primarily back out the impacts of U.S. tax reform on our tax provision.","For the full year, our diluted earnings per share was a $1.46 and was a $1.41 as adjusted. That strong bottom line performance is attribute to our 50,000 talented and dedicated colleagues around the world, who have maintained their focus on delivering innovation and effectiveness for our clients, all of our people can take pride in their accomplishments.","Alongside our operating gains, we continue to invest over the course of the year and an outstanding talent across our agencies, as well as in the technologies data and analytics that keep us on the leading edge of our industry, especially in our media, digital, creative and marketing services.","At the same time we\u2019ve continued to return capital to our shareholders at significant and increasing levels. During the fourth quarter, we purchased 4.2 million shares using $84 million. For the full year, we utilized $300 million for the repurchase of 13.7 million shares, lowering our year-end total of basic shares and shares eligible for dilution to 391 million, a decrease of 2.7% from the year ago.","Since initiating our capital return programs in 2011, we\u2019ve returned a total of $3.6 billion to shareholders with a combination of common share dividends and repurchases, and we\u2019ve reduced our outstanding shares eligible for dilution by 30%.","This morning we continue that history with our board\u2019s decision to raise IPG\u2019s quarterly dividend by 17% to $0.21 per share. This marks our sixth consecutive year of double-digit percentage increases to the dividend with a cumulative increase per share of 350% since 2011.","We also announced that our board has authorized an additional $300 million for share repurchase. Combined with the remaining authorization as of the beginning of the year of $156 million this brings the total pro forma amount available for share repurchase to $456 million.","Together, these actions reflect our continuing operating success in recent years, IPG\u2019s substantial financial strength and significant confidence in our future prospects. As we return to our outlook for 2018 it\u2019s encouraging to see that our value to marketers continue to drive growth as reflected in our fourth-quarter and that we continue to convert revenue increases to operating profit growth at a high level.","We all know that consumers are changing the way they engage with brands, at the same time, marketers are competing with new business models and working to transform their relationships with consumers while simultaneously contending with a number of short-term pressures.","As we\u2019ve previously discussed, these many changes introduced a note of caution to marketing investment across our industry during 2017, and they continue to entail both risk and opportunity for IPG. Our company remains sanely focused and uniquely resource to help clients navigate this environment and realize their opportunities.","The current global economic picture also provides a very clear potential to be more supportive to our industry. That is my sense of the business climate for recent conversations with clients. While the caution we saw much of last year will not lift overnight, we expect to gradually put the slower revenue growth of 2017 behind us, and post improved growth this year. We continue to believe that we are very well positioned to deliver growth of revenue and profit in 2018, and for the long-term.","Accordingly, we are targeting 2% to 3% organic growth for 2018. Along with this level of growth, we expect to continue to build on our long-standing record of operating margin expansion and are targeting an increase of 20 basis points in 2018 over the results we are reporting today.","As we look ahead, it\u2019s worth taking into account our estimate of positive impact on the financials from recently enacted U.S. tax reform. A year ago we described our normalized effective tax rate of 35% to 36% on our consolidated results, and along with that normalized cash tax rate of approximately 29% of pre-tax income.","The changes to the U.S. tax code mean that going forward our normalized consolidated effective tax rate for the full year should decrease to approximately 28%. Along with that, our normalized cash tax rate should decrease to 24%.","In some, we are focus is always on the drivers of value creation in growth, margin expansion, and capital returns, and are confident that they will continue to work well for the long-term at Interpublic.","At this stage, I\u2019ll turn things over to Frank for additional depth and detail on our performance and I\u2019ll return with an update and highlights of our business. Frank.","Frank Mergenthaler","Thank you, Michael and good morning. As a reminder, I'll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast.","On slide two, you\u2019ll see a summary of our results. Fourth report organic growth was 3.3% and was 2.5% excluding impact on higher pass-through revenue. U.S. organic growth was 3.7% and was 2.5% excluding the impact of higher pass-through revenue on top of 3.3% Q4'16.","International organic growth was 2.9% and that was on top of 7.8% in Q4'16. For the full-year consolidated organic growth was 1.8%. Q4 operating margin in our seasonally largest quarter was 22.1% compared with 21.4% a year ago, an increase of 70 basis points.","For the full-year, operating margin expanded 40 basis points to 12.4% which marks another advance in our record of long-term significant margin expansion IPG. Our success is due to effectively leveraging our growth with disciplined expense management and a paper performance incentive model for which the principal metrics are revenue and margin growth relative to targets at the beginning of each year.","For the quarter, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.79 while full year diluted EPS as adjusted was a $1.41 per share. Cash flow from operations was $882 million for the year compared with $513 million in 2016 reflecting a strongly improved working capital result.","We repurchased 13.7 million shares for $300 million during the year. As Michael mentioned, we announced this morning that our board has again significantly increased our common share dividend to $0.21 per share quarterly and added $300 million to our share repurchase authorization.","Turning to slide three you\u2019ll see our P&L for the quarter. I\u2019ll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail slides that follow.","Turning to revenue on slide four, fourth quarter revenue was $2.34 billion compared Q4'16 the impact of the change in exchange rates was an increase of 1.2% while net dispositions was offsetting negative 1.1%. Resulting organic revenue was 3.3%.","Increase pass-through revenue added 80 basis points to our growth without which the organic growth change was 2.5%. Remind you pass-through revenues are offset dollar for dollar in our O&G expense, an increase in decrease to pass-through revenue do not change our operating profit.","Revenue growth for the full-year was one half of 1%, which reflects organic growth of 1.8% and 1.3% decreased due to our net dispositions. FX for the year was diminimus.","As you can see on the bottom half of the slide, Q4 organic growth at our integrated agency networks was 3.3%. The segment was led by Mediabrands which continues terrific performance and by McCann and FCB. Growth was 2.2% for the full-year.","At our CMG segment, marketing services specialists\u2019 organic growth was 3.3% in the quarter, but was a decrease of 1.9% excluding the benefit of higher pass-through revenue which is disproportionately in our sports marketing and events businesses. CMG revenue was flat organically for the full-year and down 40 basis points as adjusted for pass-through. ","Moving onto slide five, revenue by region, in the U.S. Q4 organic growth was 3.7% and it was 2.5% excluding the increase in pass-through revenues. Growth was broad based led by Mediabrands, McCann, FCB, Deutsche, Carmichael and Jack Morton.","Pass-through revenue increase that we\u2019ve noted in the U.S. is due to higher project spent with Jack Morton. Among client sectors, auto and transportation healthcare and government and travel contributed notably to growth while the CPG sector also increased in the U.S.","Over the full year, our organic growth in U.S. was 2.2% when increases across Mediabrands, McCann, FCB, and Carmichael Lynch. Our top client sectors domestically were healthcare, auto and transportation and government. In our International markets, organic growth was 2.9% in Q4 and was 2.5% excluding increase in pass-through revenues.","Continental Europe, we grew 7.9% organically in the fourth quarter which was 6.6% excluding the pass-through impact which is very strong performance especially against the 11.1% growth in Q4'16.","Among our largest markets in the region, we had double-digit growth in Germany, Italy or France and Spain were approximately flat. Here again, we had strong growth at Mediabrands and also Jack Morton Events and Weber Shandwick and public relations.","Organic growth for the full year was 3.5% on top of 5.7% in 2016. In the U.K. our organic growth in the quarter was slightly negative by 40 basis points, and increased 1% as adjusted for pass-through. You will recall that our U.K. growth was nearly 12% in the fourth quarter 2016.","McCann, Mediabrands and Huge performed very well in the quarter. For the full-year which is at the right of the slide, the U.K. grew 4.1% adjusted for lower pass-throughs, which was against 5% on the same base of 2016.","In Asia-Pac, our revenue decreased organically by 90 basis points or negative 2.7% excluding the pass-through increases. Full year numbers were in a similar range. India continues to be a standout performer in both the quarter and the year, while China, Australia, and Japan were notably slower.","In LatAm we grew 6.5% organically in the quarter compounding 5% growth a year ago. That performance surprisingly flat for the full-year against 12% growth in 2016.","In the fourth quarter, Argentina and Mexico continue to be very strong markets. Brazil increased slightly despite the difficult macro environment. Overall regional performance in the quarter was driven by strong results at Mediabrands, R\/GA and FCB.","In our Other Markets Group, organic revenue growth was 4.5% in the quarter led by our Canada and South African markets. Our growth was 4.5% as well for the full year. On slide six, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue on a trailing 12-month basis; the most recent data point was 1.8% for calendar 2017 on top of 5% in 2016 and 6.1% in 2015.","Moving onto expenses on slide seven, our discipline around operating expenses continue to make a significant contribution to our margin growth. Under 3.4% revenue growth, our total operating expense increased 2.5% in the quarter. For the full year, our ratio of total salaries and related expenses to revenue was 64.3% compared with 64.2% a year ago. Underneath that, we delevered on expense for base payroll benefits and tax due to slower top line growth in 2017.","At the same time, we took the appropriate and significant actions to align expenses with revenue over the course of the year. We had significant leverage for the year on incentive expense, which was 3.3% of revenue compared with 4.0% in 2016.","We also leveraged our category and other salaries and related expenses which include employee performance based contractual bonus payments. Other salaries and related were 2.5% of revenues in 2017 compared with 3% in 2016.","Year-end headcount was approximately 50,200 compared with 49,800 a year ago an increase of less than 1%. Turning to office and general expenses on the bottom half the slide, O&G was 23.4% of full year revenue compared with 23.8% giving us 40 basis points of year-on-year operating leverage.","With O&G we had operating leverage on our category of other O&G expenses which includes lower direct expenses and will be offset to lower pass-through revenues. We also leveraged our expenses for T&E, office supplies and telecom which again is a result of our continued focus on costs.","On slide eight, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis with the most recent data at 12.4% we have made sustained and significant [Indiscernible]. This is still work to be done and we remain highly focused on continued progress.","Turning to slide nine, we present more detail on below the line adjustments to our reported fourth quarter results in order to give you a better picture of comparable performance. We had small loss in the quarter of 3 million in other expense from the sale of small non-strategic businesses which is more than offset by the related tax benefit and resulted in a penny per share in earnings.","Moving from left to right on this slide, as a consequence of tax reform, we reversed a benefit in the amount of $31 million for U.S. federal tax credits. We also recorded a benefit from the net impact of U.S. tax reform to the number $36 million or $0.09 per share. That amount primarily represents the net of revaluing a deferred tax liabilities less the one-time charge for the so-called repatriation tax under The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","The result as shown is fourth quarter adjusted earnings -- $0.79 per share. Slide 10 depicts similar adjustments for the full-year again for comparability. You can see our loss of $0.04 per diluted share for business dispositions and have benefited $0.09 per share for tax reforms. ","Result is adjusted full year diluted EPS with $1.41. Our normalized tax rate for the full-year was 36.1%. Before moving onto cash flow, we should remind everyone that our report today is the last one before we are required to report under the new revenue recognition Accounting Standard, ASC 606.","We are well along with our work on 606 and were not yet fully complete but we can say with certainty that there will be no change to our model for value creation IPG. For that matter, to our priorities to drive organic growth and margin expansion.","As previously disclosed, we have elected to restate prior years for the new standard. We believe it is the transition method that provides the best continuity for our constituencies and the best alignment of our commentary reported results in the year ahead.","We plan to provide the quarterly 2017 restated results in an 8-K filing sometime prior to our first quarter 2018 earnings release in April, along with more color and detail. We foresee two principal impacts of the new standard on our reporting. One is earlier recognition of some revenue and profit mainly for a portion of client performance bonuses. The new standard requires recognizing some revenues as the work is performed rather than deferring recognition until the measurement period is complete. That rephrasing requirement moves a small portion of our revenue and profit earlier between years.","Restating 2017 for the new standard for example, will require that we recognize some client bonuses in 2017 that would have been recognized in 2018 under the old standard. Similarly, we\u2019ll be required to push some revenue and profit from 2017 back to 2016. We estimate that this will results in a decrease to our 2017 operating profit for approximately 3% to 4% when restated. That is due to year-to-year changes to our client contracts, the timing of when bonuses were recognized and changes in our client base.","Importantly, there will be no change to our 2017 cash flow or to our 2018 financial targets in terms of operating profit and earnings-per-share as a result of restating. The second impact of adopting ASC 606 that we will report noticeably more gross revenue and more gross expense with dollar-per-dollar increase to revenue and expense.","The change would have no impact on cash flow, operating profit, net income of earnings per share. Our estimate for 2017 which is still subject to change is that we have approximately $1.2 million more of both revenue and expense under the new standard.","Nearly all this increase relates to events at Jack Morton, Momentum and Octagon, as well as to our PR and Healthcare Specialists. None of the incremental gross revenue relates to our media business.","To enhance the transparency of our results, we\u2019ll add disclosure of our net revenue and income beginning with our first quarter this year, and our key performance metric will track the net organic revenue growth and revenue operating margin. To clarify, that will be an increment $1.1 billion of incremental revenue, again, more to come on this point prior to our Q1 release.","Slide 11 is cash flow for the full year. Cash from operations in 2017 was $882 million compared to $513 million a year ago. The comparison includes a strong improvement in our working capital result which used $28 million compared with $415 million a year ago.","Our investing activities used $196 million in the year including $156 million for CapEx, $31 million for acquisitions. CapEx is majority IT investment and second leasehold improvements office space.","CapEx was decreased from 2016 only a few large office relocations. Financing activities used $1 billion, which is comprised mainly of $325 million of premature and long-term, $300 million to repurchase shares and $280 million for common stock dividend.","In 2017, our net decrease in cash and cash equivalents was $303 million. Slide 12 is a view of our debt over the past 11 years with total debt of $1.37 billion at year-end 2017, a $300 million, 2.25% notes matured in mid-November, which we refinanced with commercial paper.","Q4 is seasonally our strongest operating cash flow quarter which we use to extinguish the outstanding commercial paper by year-end. As a result at year end we have the lower debt balance which you see on this table and also lower cash balance compared two-year ago.","Slide 13 is the current portion of our balance sheet. Total cash and cash equivalents was $791 million at year-end, so net debt was approximately same levels a year ago. Slide 14 depicts the total of our average basic shares plus diluted shares overtime and the far right shows the total as of year-end 2017.","Our average total shares decreased by 160 million shares over this time period, due to share repurchases and the simplification of our capital structure. Our starting position for 2018 is 391 million shares.","In summary on slide 15, we are pleased to conclude the year with solid Q4 performance. Our operating teams deliver significant margin growth in 2017 even as the revenue environment became more challenging.","Our balance sheet continues to be a meaningful source of value creation which is evident in the actions announced by our board today. That leaves us well-positioned to deliver on our objectives for the full year.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Michael.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Frank. As you can tell, we\u2019ve closed the year on a stronger note with respect to both growth and profitability. As I've indicated it's too early to say conclusively that the broader trends that we saw, impact our industry last year are entirely behind us.","But fourth quarter results as well as the conversations with our operators and number of our key clients are encouraging. It seems that as we move forward into 2018 marketers would turn their focus solely from expense reductions to also encompass growth. And that is an area in which our unique expertise and capabilities can play an important role.","While the macro-environment continues to include geopolitical uncertainty as a parent in the daily headlines from around the globe, economic fundamentals remain solid overall and improved clarity with respect to tax reform is a notable positive for business. What is more as you heard me say before Confusion is good and there's still plenty of that, due to the very complex and quickly evolving technology media and communications landscape. This represents a continued opportunity for a company like ours with a range of strategic and creative talent we bring to bear to our clients businesses and challenges.","Our embedded digital offerings throughout the portfolio, as well as special capabilities in emerging areas like programmatic, data and analytics, the name but a few. At IPG we remain committed to the idea that the best talent is the best work for our clients, which is key for us to win in the marketplace.","This is a vision that we put to work in many ways. From our proven commitment to investing in talent over the long haul, to the work we do incubating innovative startups, to our industry-leading programs that promoted more diverse and inclusive workplace. These are fundamental drivers of our success and we will continue to invest behind and live up to our DNI aspirations, build on our accelerator programs and foster our culture that is both entrepreneurial and accountable.","This is what allows us to attract the best people whether they\u2019re traditional craft practitioners, or they represent the most leading-edge technological capabilities. We all know that our industry is changing rapidly.","As you'd expect we regularly monitor activity in adjacent sectors and among potential new entrants into our space. So as to ensure that we continue to develop our integrated model and deliver a fully relevant and contemporary range of services to our clients.","Turning now to performance at the agency level, let me provide a brief progress report on the key developments within a portfolio. Highlighted during the fourth quarter were led by media brands which posted outstanding performance.","UM close the year with big wins with Spotify and Ubisoft, both very sophisticated marketers. To follow-on wins earlier in the year of Accenture and Coach. Initiative won two global pitches, Carlsberg and LEGO, as well as an important incumbent defense of the Amazon account.","The agency's new business performance was just recognized by a top regular ranking and we\u2019re pleased to see the network reaching the same height as UM. Cadreon and Reprise are also first-rate digital partners for our clients.","These will be key as we go into a New Year in which new business activity is accelerating in the media space. We\u2019re excited to enter 2018 with positive market momentum as well as the distinctive market position due to our long-standing commitment to a high level of transparency.","Media brand is also the place where we will continue to focus and invest behind our considerable data and analytic capabilities, in order to develop the next generation data stack that concern all of our agencies including creative as we push for even more accountability in our marketing programs.","McCann had another solid year with strong new business performance that heads them on top of many league tables. The agency wins featured brands for marketing powerhouses such as Reckitt Benckiser, Coca-Cola, MGM, Bombardier, Diageo and BASF. McCann\u2019s performance at creative award shows continues to reach new heights.","Above all 2017 was the year with the Fearless Girl statue, which became a cultural phenomenon, it droves important social conversations and of course fueled great results for that client.","McCann also continue to up its game in digital marketing where its created outstanding campaigns in recent years and upgraded senior-level talent across North America and its headquarters New York office as well as in China.","FCB closed the year strong in terms of financial performance and also launch the new Circles campaign for Levi\u2019s, which was some of the most talked about creative work this year. The agency also introduced both the work for Clorox one of the networks recent signature global wins.","FCB Chicago continues to thrive, supporting clients with the full range of services from consumer advertising to CRM, shopper marketing, digital and state-of-the-art production capabilities.","FCB health also maintained its position as a growth driver and the industry thought leader and a top creative performer in the healthcare marketing space. MullenLowe build momentum and recognition for breakthrough creativity and integrated services which the agency refers to as hyper bundling.","During the year MullenLowe put together an impressive run a new business wins including Eurosport, E*TRADE and Whole Foods which is likely the most competitive AOR pitch of 2017, in terms of the number of agencies involved in the review.","Additional media wins included Chipotle, Nuveen and Staples. Recent acquisitions in London will further enhance the agency's capabilities in terms of advertising creativity and PR.","Despite a challenging environment for project businesses which we called out for you and are calls last year, our outstanding digital specialty agencies, R\/GA and Huge one signature high profile assignments and built out their capabilities.","At Huge and most notable was the McDonald's digital consumer experience account, one of only a handful of cases during 2017 in which we faced off against not only our traditional competitive set but also some of the consultancies.","R\/GA wins included work on Hyundai, Guinness, Nikon and Cody [ph] as well as Digital Innovation Agency of the Year honors from campaign in London. As some of our competitors count the introduction of AI platforms, to boost productivity and talent deployment, it bears noting that R\/GA's internal platform built to perform the same function has been in development for close to a decade and integrate the skills and workflow of over 2000 employees across 17 R\/GA offices.","Weber Shandwick remains a leader in it space with the strong leadership team that regularly garners top honors from its industry press in every world region. The agency bolsters its capabilities in data science, analytics and performance marketing with recent acquisitions.","Weber was recognized by the homes support with the top ranking of the global creative index and the Daughters of Mother India campaign are in top honors as the most awarded PR campaign of the past 12 months.","We were equally pleased that the agencies started out 2018 with the global consolidation win with the major IPG client. Also with CMG wish you a very strong performance from Octagon.","The agency is a leader in sports marketing which is increasingly important sector which taps into deep consumer passion points and is one of the few ways we can still reach large aggregate audiences on behalf of our clients.","Our U.S. independence round out the portfolio, each has a range of services that it can deliver on an integrated standalone basis to major clients. As part of our customized open architecture IPG solution, as Deutsche does on our global J&J Acuvue business or Hill Holiday on the consumer side and number of J&J former engagement.","Both of these agencies as well as Carmichael Lynch had a very successful year and we look forward to including them in more integrated teams on a going forward basis. As you know we\u2019ve been focused on delivering on the vision of open architecture for nearly a decade.","Although this has become something of a talking point for all our competitors, we continue to feel that our approach is a positive differentiator, since we integrate the best of our talent across the organization by means of fully consolidated teams with regular involvement and leadership from senior IPG level corporate executives.","It\u2019s clear that the quality of our strategic and creative offerings is currently at the highest level that\u2019s been many years. Globally at major competitions ranging from Cannes to the Effies, our agencies are recognized with the highest honors and our group performance is outstanding.","Despite a very challenging revenue environment in 2017, we posted solid results and achieve growth that was ahead of the industry average. We also demonstrated our ability to remain focused on and deliver margin improvement.","This is consistent with our long-term record of improving profitability in both higher and more moderate growth environments. This is an achievement we\u2019re proud of, as is the fact that we\u2019ve made such great progress in terms of company balance sheet and overall financial strength.","Our capital return programs continue to be significant drivers of value. Our board decision today to once again meaningfully increase the dividend and also add to our share repurchase program shows a continued commitment to return value to shareholders, as well as confidence in our future prospects.","Looking forward against the backdrop of macro-economic and political uncertainty the tone of the business is good and new business activity seems to be picking up. The breadth and strength of portfolio positions as well to participate in most pitch opportunities and is further organic growth to be had by broadening the scope of our relationships with existing clients.","In light of these factors we believe that we should continue to see competitive organic revenue performance in 2018, which is why we\u2019re targeting growth of 2% to 3% for 2018.","Along with his level of growth we\u2019re targeting operating margin expansion of 20 basis points over the results we\u2019re reporting today. This builds on our strong long-term record in this area.","At the same time we will continue to invest in the outstanding talent and emerging capabilities that required to positions us for the long-term. Combined with the strength of our balance sheet and our consistent commitment and strong delivery when it comes to capital return, that means that they remain significant potential for value creation and enhance shareholder value. As always, we thank our clients, our people who are the foundation of our success.","With that, I\u2019ll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Alexia Quadrani","Hello. Thank you very much. I guess the first question is how much of the better organic growth that you saw in Q4? Do you think this result of sort of budget flush versus more of change in trend or maybe pickup in spending. And along those lines when you look at the \u2013 your commentary and your guides for organic growth to improve in 2018 and improve more importantly as the year progresses, what gives you that visibility? Is it your conversations with clients? And then beginning bit more optimistic about spending levels? Or is more just the easiest comparisons, like any color on that probably super helpful? Thank you.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Alexia. All the above look obviously in the fourth quarter we were pleased to see the result as evidenced by the results we\u2019ve reported. What I liked about the results in the quarter was that and for the year actually, it\u2019s across the board. Frankly the only region that was down was in Asia Pac and had the client losses there and even there we saw some good strength in India.","We saw a return to some projects in the fourth quarter which was helpful particularly in Jack Morton and Octagon, so we saw that flow through. But overall I think the tone that we\u2019re seeing which is gist of your question is more positive. I'm still cautious about it. But I think the fourth quarter and the fact that we're using 2% to 3% goal for 2018 is consistent with our view that what we saw in 2017 was not a secular change in our industry. It was cyclical. It was very client specific particularly we saw it in certain CPG clients and environments and so on.","So, I think what we saw in the fourth quarter was a return to some spending. We\u2019re not raising the flag in terms of taking all caution, while for the perspective, but this is certainly a better feel out there with respect to the environment, but there\u2019s still elements of caution. I\u2019ll also comment that we did see some client losses in 2017 that had an impact on our results and we\u2019ll still see a little flow-through that in the first quarter.","But as I've always said, if we keep the back door close on our existing great client base then I'm even more comfortable with the numbers that we\u2019re showing you or forecasting for 2018.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you. And then, Frank maybe or Michael, just to clarify on the commentary about the new accounting standards, just want to make sure we understand it correctly. On the 2% to 3% organic revenue growth guide for 2018, is that sort of an apples-to-apples number of how you would have previously looked at organic growth or just trying to put a perspective on that?","Frank Mergenthaler","Yes. I mean, that\u2019s one of the reasons we adopted the accounting method that we\u2019re doing. We think that gives greater clarity in terms of the forecast for the number. So in overall terms it certainly gives you the perspective of what we expect our growth to be.","Michael Roth","And the 20 basis points of margin improvement, Alexia, are off the print today.","Frank Mergenthaler","Yes.","Alexia Quadrani","Okay. Thank you very much.","Frank Mergenthaler","Welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Janedis with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","John Janedis","Hi. Good morning. Maybe sticking with the margin, Frank, the margin leverage outlook, I think it\u2019s pretty good given the organic growth range, I think it implies something like 20% or greater or so. Can you talk about the sources of the leverage for the year and along those lines I think based on one of the slides the occupied square footage per employee is off about 25% since 2010, so is there still more of an opportunity to reduce the footprint?","Frank Mergenthaler","On the margin for 2018, John, it\u2019s based on our bottoms up budgeting that we started in November, so it was client by client, office by office, agency by agency. So we would expect to see with the 2% or 3% growth leverage on our -- across our entire spends portfolio, but SRS is still critical.","On the occupancy side, I think we\u2019ve made huge progress over the past 10 years. We\u2019ve got a centralized team here at IPG. They are doing a terrific job in managing occupancy inflation around the globe and we\u2019ve leveraged our scale in core market by consolidating multi-agencies into one office, so we can leverage our scale. So is there opportunity sure, but it gets harder as you see inflation creep into lot of major market.","Michael Roth","And we did see in the past couple years we did have some major moves, R\/GA for example, and frankly Deutsche moved into some other agencies. So we did see some large movements. But I do think as Frank said, when we look at our footprint on a global basis we look to utilize all of our excess space and move into either existing space or double up whenever possible.","John Janedis","Okay. And maybe I\u2019m getting myself [ph] here, Michael, but can you talk about your expectations for the U.K. and continental Europe, because I think -- I mean, given the relatively small but I think it's been more than a decade, since organic growth in say, Europe has perform largely in line or better than the U.K. So is that something you expect to repeat again this year?","Frank Mergenthaler","Well, I\u2019ll tell you, when you come back from Davos, it was the first time that I left Davos where uniformly the tone was positive for Continental Europe and all other regions in the world. And frankly that's what we're seeing. We\u2019re seeing a return if you will to some growth in Continental Europe and in the U.K. which is very encouraging. And again it is client specific and new business wins. We did cycle through however a client loss at \u2013 of Seat in MullenLowe which adversely affected Continental Europe.","But when you see in the three months in the quarter 7.9% organic growth or 6.6% and 3.4% net of pass-throughs for the full year, that's pretty exciting for us, and the tone still seems positive. But again, because of our size, remember if you look at the size of our portfolio in Continental Europe and the U.K. its 9% of each. So it could really be adversely affected or positively affected by changes in specific clients and I think we\u2019re seeing that. So hopefully we keep the back door closed in Continental Europe. We win more than we lose in new pitches and I\u2019m encouraged to see those results.","But you\u2019re right; it\u2019s nice to see that. Frankly it\u2019s nice to see growth in all the regions other than Asia Pac. We did have some client losses in China and Singapore that negatively affected us, but I'm encouraged by the positive results in India.","John Janedis","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Dan Salmon","Good morning everyone. Michael, back in 2015 when we had the big surge of media reviews, IPG agencies performed very well. Could you maybe just compare and contrast a little bit that period versus what you're looking out at this year with another uptick in reviews seemingly underway?","And then related it looks like you're in a pretty good position here relative to some peers in terms of incumbent clients looking at reviews and thus would have some good opportunity. If you're willing perhaps could you shed a little light on where you may be conflicted out with some of them because of those good relationships with your current client? Thanks.","Michael Roth","Look, obviously the Mediapalooza days and we said consistently in all of our calls, the media environment is one that we see the most action in, in terms of whether it would be \u2013 its coming on three years since we had the Mediapalooza and lot of those contracts they\u2019re up for review. And so that\u2019s cycling in there as well. But obviously we\u2019re starting the year with a number of large reviews. And as you pointed out, those fortunately are not defending, so those are opportunities for us. And we\u2019ve invested a lot of money in our media brand offerings. I think the results for 2017 are indicative. I\u2019m very happy to see initiative picking up too global wins.","Obviously UM continues to perform well with the existing clients. So I think we\u2019re really well-positioned in terms of the \u2013 if there was another Mediapalooza if you want to call it that. And right now I see that is opportunities for us. There\u2019s always complex for us particularly on the auto there are complex that are out there. And sometime some of the healthcare, but we don\u2019t see \u2013 we see a pretty clear opportunity for us in terms of existing pitches that are out there that we hope to be able to participate it.","Dan Salmon","And then maybe just one quick follow-up, you mentioned how you highlighted in previous quarters, how you\u2019d had some delays in projects at Huge and R\/GA. It looks like you\u2019re also sounding strength there. I just want to be clear, that those projects largely end up coming through? Are you looking it seeing them coming through in 2018 or is it a broader strength in the business or combination of that?","Michael Roth","Yes. I think it\u2019s a combination. Remember, we do our budget based on the bottoms up, so whether it would be R\/GA, whether it would huge or MRM or any of these agencies that come in, we look at identified opportunities, existing clients, and you\u2019re right, I mean we still are in project based environment, but I couldn\u2019t say yes, these projects are now online and therefore that\u2019s what contributing to growth. Candidly the growth is not coming from that. It\u2019s coming from new business opportunities. And one of the problems had to be with large clients, these large projects if you recall.","And what I\u2019m seeing and I think the whole industry is seeing is that you lose one big project; it takes a number of projects to replace it. And so the good news is that our teams are identifying opportunities that would give rise in total to replace those projects. But it\u2019s not that all of a sudden there was $60 million project that was on the shelf and then all of a sudden they pull the trigger and its back.","So, and that\u2019s part of the reason we cite some caution in our numbers for 2018, because this is a lot of work that goes into developing these projects and making sure they come fruition. So I would say if any area of caution is out there that\u2019s the environment that we have some caution on.","Dan Salmon","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you. Good morning. The couple for Frank on 606 and then I had follow-up for Michael. Frank, just I understand, I think you said that the timing \u2013 I think its timing impact of 606 on when revenue is recognize will reduce OI in 2017 by 3% to 4%, I just want to make sure I heard that right, because there was lot of stuff in there?","Frank Mergenthaler","Correct. Because the way that current accounting works, Ben, it's very prescriptive on when you recognize incentive bonuses. So you need to hit certain milestone, certain documentation. So, what we saw was if you had an annual bonus that usually slip into the first quarter of the following year the new rule you need to use more judgment, you need to do estimate to complete and estimate performance, so you should see incentive bonuses recognize more ratable over the year.","So, when you look at kind of 18 bonuses that would slip back in the 2017, 2017 that would slip back in 2016, 2016 was a much stronger year remember with 5% growth, so we have healthy bonuses in Q1 of 2017 that better going to get push back. So net effect of that is about 3% to 4% of operating income moving to 2016, but the point to remember is our 2018 operation income target are based upon the 2017 print. So those targets are set based upon 20 basis points of a number we just printed. So the restatement number does not impact my 2018 targets.","Ben Swinburne","Yes, that makes sense. And then, IPG compared to its peers is tended to have a lot more seasonality. I think either maybe quarterly volatility on the topline you know your Q4 is a lot greater than your Q1 every year for example, does 606 sort of smooth that out more and the quarters will look a little more consistent in size versus you only think about you guys versus your peer group or am I over extrapolating it?","Frank Mergenthaler","A little bit, but not materially.","Ben Swinburne","Okay, got it.","Michael Roth","I kind of insulted in [Indiscernible] accounting question of \u2013 but that\u2019s okay. What it won\u2019t do is it will do away with this pass-through stuff that we always have to explain. So that part of it is encouraging. And remember, a good portion of our Mediabusiness is paid for performance. So that\u2019s what you are seeing in terms of the shifts from year-to-year. You had the other questions, there.","Ben Swinburne","Yes, Mike and this was for you and it involves taxes. So, you talked about a better tone and maybe you did hit this, but I\u2019m wondering if part of that improved tone had to do with the accounting as the tax reform in the U.S. and that leading to greater investment among your clients who are now seeing always have more money to spend, is that making its way into marketing.","Michael Roth","Yes, I wish I could tell you that when companies see the big savings in taxes, on the top of the list is let\u2019s spend more money on marketing dollars, okay. It doesn\u2019t seem to be there, all I will tell you I did have one conversation with the pretty big client who did indicate to me that it\u2019s nice to have the tax benefit of cash taxes to help their increase spend. I wouldn\u2019t exactly convert that into a major decision for all of our clients. Because, remember we always said that our clients didn\u2019t lack capital to invest in marketing dollars, they were more interested in the P&L effect, right.","And that\u2019s where a lot of these cut backs came through, particularly in the CPG clients and you know where [Indiscernible] activists and so on. But I don\u2019t \u2013 anecdotally I think they are certainly more comfortable with the cash positions that they are in, but again, I think we are still going to have to prove the return on investment that you get by increasing your marketing dollars. As business becomes a little stronger, I think companies will be more aggressive in terms of gaining market share and markets and there you have to spend on marketing dollars to do that. So I think that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to flow through, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just saying here\u2019s a chunk of cash and we\u2019re going to put it into marketing dollars.","But we\u2019re certainly got a lot of projects out there that when they are ready to spend we can prove that what we do works and that\u2019s what our people are doing. We are putting forth very good ideas that are accountable and move the needle. And in this environment when the global economy is in a growth mode you want to continue to invest in your brands and that\u2019s what we do.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you both.","Michael Roth","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Peter Stabler","Good morning, a couple of clarifying questions from me thanks. Sorry -- if this one again. Going back to the organic growth guidance, the two to three so should we be saying about that as a gross organic growth inclusive of pass-throughs.","Frank Mergenthaler","Yes, it\u2019s net and as we mentioned earlier next year we\u2019ll be expanding our P&L to show net organic growth, net organic margin and that will be the focal point of our discussion on future call. So to what Michael mentioned earlier, we\u2019ll eliminate all the noise around pass-throughs.","Peter Stabler","Okay, got it thanks, Frank. And then secondly, Michael you talked about account wins and losses a bit, wondering if you can take a swing at estimating whether this is kind of a net headwind, net tailwind whether you\u2019ll be willing to size that going into 2018 and then finally any thoughts on CMG outlook for 2018, 2017 was a little tough for this segment wondering if you are expecting improvement in 2018? Thank you.","Michael Roth","Yes, let me first of all the \u2013 we were net new business positive for 2017, so we had a bit of a tailwind going into 2018, order of magnitude maybe 20 to 30 basis points, but probably close to the 20 basis points, but it is a tailwind. But I did indicate that the first quarter we\u2019re still going to be cycling through some of those losses, so we\u2019ll see the positive result of that after the first quarter and the next quarter was....","Peter Stabler","CMG.","Michael Roth","Yes, look we \u2013 obviously it was a tougher year for us particularly in the PR side of the business. When we do our bottoms up, of course we have some growth in those businesses. Remember the PR business is that \u2013 so much of it is project based, every year you start the year saying you know what \u2013 where do we see it and how do we get it and other than last year Weber and Golin were able to actually exceed the numbers that we had put out there. So, we believe the PR business will return to growth. It\u2019s built into the number that we gave you in terms of the 2% to 3% and frankly we are starting off with some positive news. So I\u2019m cautious about it, whenever you are dealing with project based businesses such as the PR side of the business you never know where these clients are going to be spending their money, but it\u2019s built into the 2% to 3%.","Peter Stabler","Thank you very much.","Michael Roth","Thank you.","Operator","And our final question comes from David Joyce with Evercore. Your line is now open.","David Joyce","Thank you. And thinking about the ad agency Holdco capabilities versus what the internet platforms are doing on the advertising side, there is some perception that there is an either\/or in terms of the winners. But could you please update us on what you are able to do for your clients versus what the internet companies are doing and like the companies who are going straight to internet, just how things were revolving these days? Thank you.","Michael Roth","Yes, I think that\u2019s a fair question. I mean, I believe one of the issues for 2017 was the question of disintermediation and whether those dollars as you pointed out ago and directly. I have to tell you that our relationship for example with Google and Facebook is probably better now than it\u2019s been historically because I think it\u2019s become fairly clear that working together ends up with a better result for our clients.","And certainly when you see all these issues with respect to safety and transparency, our clients like to see an agnostic perspective of where these dollars go. So, it adds to our value added to our clients to provide that type of perspective. But we are seeing more and more of Facebook and Google being embedded with our people and working on joint projects we see at Amazon obviously is coming into the fold in terms of being a very important player in that world. And I think it adds to the argument that we bring to the table. One is we have great contracts in negotiating ability given our scale and our capabilities and we also provide a truly agnostic view in terms of where that money goes. So I would say the environment for that is actually more positive than negative.","David Joyce","Thank you very much.","Michael Roth","Okay, well thank you very much. Obviously we are pleased with the results and we look forward to reporting on our first quarter and see how close we came. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference.

All parties are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion.","This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jerome J. Leshne - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning. Thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com.","This morning, we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 Eastern.","During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company. These are subject to the uncertainties in the cautionary statement that are included in our earnings release and the slide presentation and further detailed in our 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP measures, allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance.","At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jerry, and thank you for joining us this morning as we review our results for the second quarter and first half of 2016. I'll start out by covering highlights of our performance, Frank will then provide additional detail, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies and the tone of our business, to be followed by the Q&A.","We're pleased to report a quarter of solid revenue and profit increases. Our second quarter organic revenue growth was 3.7%, on top of a very strong 6.7% in Q2 2015. Excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenues, underlying Q2 organic revenue was 4%. Our acquisitions had a positive impact of 30 basis points, while FX was a negative 1.8%. As a result, our total revenue growth was 2.2%.","We continue to see positive momentum from a broad range of our creative, marketing services and media offerings. Our digital capabilities also continue to be significant drivers of growth for us. We grew organically in every world region with the exception of Asia-Pac and we saw growth from nearly every client sector. Our operating profit in the quarter increased to $225 million and operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 11.7%. Diluted EPS was $0.38 a share and was $0.33, adjusting for certain below-the-line items, which is an increase of 14% compared to last year's second quarter.","For the first half of the year, organic revenue growth remained very strong at 5.1% and 5.4% excluding the impact of pass-throughs. Our operating margin increased by 40 basis points, and operating profit was up 10% for the six months in which we also saw a similar 14% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share in Q2.","This performance continues a record of accomplishments in which our people can take great pride. In terms of client sectors, leadership categories were tech and telecom, retail, food and beverage. U.S. organic growth was 4.6% in Q2, a very solid result given that it came on top of 7.7% growth a year ago. We saw growth in most of our agencies, led by R\/GA and HUGE as well as McCann, MullenLowe, Weber Shandwick and Mediabrands.","Internationally, LatAm grew 15.9% organically in Q2, an outstanding result. Organic growth was 1.2% in the U.K., where we did not see an impact from Brexit, while continental Europe was approximately flat. In Asia-Pac our organic decrease was 3.2%, but was actually flat excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenues relating primarily to a major event in Hong Kong. This performance compares to Q2 2015 organic revenue growth of 11.8% in Asia-Pac. In our other markets, regions, organic growth was 7.3%, a result of strong increases in the Middle East and Canada.","Turning to share repurchase. During Q2, we used $59 million to repurchase 2.5 million shares, while over the trailing 12 months we've utilized approximately $296 million for share repurchases. We had $346 million remaining on our authorization at the end of the quarter. Since instituting our return of capital programs in 2011 we've returned over $2.6 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases, as well as reduced our diluted share count by 27%.","To summarize, our performance continues to underscore the strong competitive position of our agencies across the full spectrum of advertising and marketing disciplines, in our digital expertise, and in the world key markets.","At the midway point of the year we believe we're well positioned with respect to our full year 2006 (sic) [2016] financial targets. You may recall that on our last conference call we upgraded our growth target to the high end of our original 3% to 4% organic growth range, along with 50 basis points of more of operating margin expansion. We continue to be comfortable with these targets for the full year.","As expected, organic growth in the second quarter showed some moderation from our very strong first quarter increase. Within the quarter we saw growth in June that was a lower rate than in April and May. It bears noting that this was in part due to the timing of revenue related to a couple of the new business wins that we added in 2015.","Based on client work already underway, we are confident that we will realize this revenue during the second half of the year. As we've always stated, revenue is variable by quarter where total operating expenses are recognized more evenly across our four quarters. As a result, we expect to see higher rates of profit conversion on revenue growth in the second half of the year compared to the first six months. This would be consistent with our performance the last couple of years, and it's why we feel that we are solidly on track with our objective to grow operating margin by 50 basis points or more this year.","At this stage I'll turn things over to Frank for additional details on our results and I'll join you after his remarks.","Frank Mergenthaler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Michael. Good morning. As a reminder I'll be referring to a slide presentation that accompanies our webcast.","On slide two, you'll see an overview of results, a number of which Michael touched upon. Organic growth was 3.7% in the second quarter and was 5.1% for the six months. Q2 operating profit was $225 million with operating margin of 11.7%. For the six months, operating profit grew 9.9% and operating margin expanded 40 basis points. Second quarter diluted EPS was $0.38 and was $0.33 as adjusted, mainly for tax items, which is comparable to $0.29 a year ago. That's an increase of 14% and for the six months adjusted diluted EPS also increased 14%. Q2 average fully diluted shares decreased 1.9% from last year due to our share repurchase program.","Turning to slide three, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow.","Slide four has more detail on our revenue growth. Revenue was $1.92 billion in the quarter, an increase of 2.2%. Compared to Q2 2015, the impact of the changing currency exchange rates was a negative 1.8%. Our net acquisitions added 30 basis points of revenue. Resulting organic revenue increase was 3.7%. Organic growth was higher at 4% when excluding the decrease in our past-through revenues which occurred mainly in our events and direct marketing businesses. As you can see on the bottom half of this slide, at our Integrated Agency Networks, the organic increase was 3.9%. This was led by digital offerings, R\/GA and HUGE and by McCann and Mediabrands. IAN's first half organic growth was 5.6%. At our CMG segment, organic growth was 2.8% but was 5.1% excluding the decrease in pass-throughs that have no profit impact. We again had strong performance in public relations led Weber Shandwick and in sports marketing at Octagon. For the six months, organic growth at CMG was 3% and 5% excluding pass-throughs.","Moving on to slide five, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q2 organic growth was 4.6%, led by a range of agencies and disciplines including R\/GA and HUGE as well as McCann, MullenLowe, Mediabrands and Weber Shandwick. In the U.K., organic growth was 1.2% which reflects growth at McCann, R\/GA and Weber Shandwick, partially offset by client churn in other parts of the portfolio. Our U.K. operators are not citing any specific impact on client spending during the quarter related to the run up to the vote on Brexit.","Turning to continental Europe. Organic growth was one half of 1% in the quarter. We continue to see mixed performance in our largest markets, with organic increases in Italy and Spain offset by decreases in Germany and France. For the six months, organic growth was 1.1%.","In Asia-Pac our organic decrease in Q2 was 3.2% and was flat, excluding a decrease in pass-through revenue. This comes on 11.8% growth a year ago. In our largest regional markets, we had mid-single-digit growth in China and India, while revenue decreased in Australia and Japan. For the six months, our organic revenue decrease in the region was one half of 1%.","In LatAm, Q2 organic growth was 15.9%, with increases in nearly all of our largest national markets, including Brazil, driven by increases in spend by existing clients and by new client wins. We had notably strong performance from McCann, R\/GA and HUGE. For the six month, organic growth was 13.9%. In our other markets group, organic growth continued to be strong in Q2 at 7.3%, driven by Canada and the Middle East. Growth was also 7.3% for the six months.","On slide six, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12month basis. Most recent data point is 5.6%. Moving on to Slide 7, our operating expenses. In the second quarter, total operating expenses increased 2% from a year ago, compared with our reported revenue growth of 2.2%. The FX impact to operating expenses was a negative 1.8%, which was the same impact we saw in our top line.","Underneath our margin improvement in Q2, the ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue was 64.1% this year, compared with 64.2% a year ago. The comparison is driven by leverage on our expenses for incentives and other SRS, partially offset by increase in base payroll and severance as a percentage of revenue. Our total head count at quarter-end was approximately 50,100, an increase of 3.5% year on year. This reflects both organic hiring and acquisitions in support of growth in areas such as digital, creative, media and PR.","Turning to ops and general expenses on the lower half of the slide. O&G expense was 24.2% of Q2 revenue, compared with 24.3% a year ago, an improvement at 10 basis points. There were a couple of moving pieces worth noting in the comparison. Compared to last year, we had a very strong leverage this year on our other O&G category. Recall that a year ago we had a higher reserve expense for certain contingencies, which we took in other O&G. Offsetting that, last year we also had a one-time lease buyout credit in our occupancy line. As a result, we de-lever on occupancy this year. The net result was an operating margin expansion of 20 basis points in the quarter and 40 basis points for the first six months.","Slide eight depicts our operating margin history on a trailing 12-months basis. The most recent data point is 11.6%, which is an improvement of 70 basis points from a year ago.","Slide nine is provided for clarity on our year on year over earnings per share comparison. This is the adjustment to diluted earnings per share of $0.38 we reported in the quarter to $0.33 per share for comparability to last year. Starting on the upper half of this slide, our reported pre-tax results includes a below the line loss of $3.7 million, mostly non-cash, related to the sale small non-strategic agencies. Our tax provision included a benefit of $2.7 million from our adoption earlier this year of the new accounting guidance on share-based compensation. We are presenting this adjustment as long as we are comparing 2016 to 2015 but it falls away next year. The more significant adjustment in the quarter is from the conclusion and settlement of a tax examination of previous tax years. That was $23 million as you can see and benefited our reported EPS by $0.06. Total adjustment in Q2 is $0.05 per share due to rounding.","On the lower half, we show similar items covering the first six months and also include one of the reversal of tax valuation allowances as a consequence of the disposition of certain businesses. For the six months, we are adjusting from $0.40 as reported to $0.33, again, as adjusted for comparability to 2015.","Moving on to slide 10, the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $675 million in cash and short term marketable securities. The comparison to December 31 reflects that our cash level is seasonal and tends to peak at year-end.","Slide 11 is our second quarter cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $94 million compared with $260 million a year ago. The comparison reflects the use of $128 million of working capital this year compared to $42 million generated from working capital a year ago. As we have pointed out previously, working capital can be volatile by quarter. Both this year and last year are within our historical range for Q2. Investing activities used $48 million, mainly from acquisition and capital expenditures. Financing activities used $67 million, chiefly for share repurchase, our common stock dividend and payments related to previous acquisitions somewhat offset by an increase in our short term borrowings. Our net decrease in cash and marketable securities for the quarter was $5 million.","On slide 12, we show our debt de-leveraging from a peak of $2.33 billion in 2007 to $1.82 billion at the most recent quarter-end.","In summary, on slide 13, we're exiting the first half having achieved 5.1% organic growth and 40 basis points of margin expansion, which represents very solid progress to our objectives for the full year. We are seeing growth in areas where we have focused our investment in both people and acquisitions. Our operators are focused on the appropriate cost disciplines and margin expansion, and our balance sheet is an important area that we can continue to deploy for value going forward.","With that, let me turn it back to Michael.","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Frank. Well, our Q2 results contributed to a strong first half that positions us to achieve our financial objectives in 2016. Across the group, our strategic, creative and digital capabilities are highly competitive. This was evident at the recent Cannes festival, which as many of you know is the industry's most prestigious creative awards show. Standards are so high that fewer than 3% of entries even make it to the short list of contenders, yet we won over 200 trophies. Our agencies were responsible for two of the three most awarded campaigns in Cannes, and we won one of only five coveted Titanium Lions. By our count, IPG was the most awarded holding company in terms of honors won per dollar of global revenue.","Our long-standing commitment to integrated services through our open-architecture model continues to be a strong differentiator for us, because it puts the needs of our clients at the center of the solutions that we craft and deliver from across IPG assets. We're also proud that IPG and our agencies remain a destination of choice for so much of the industry's top talent, and that we've been a long-term leader in the industry in terms of diversity and inclusion.","During both the quarter and the first six months, we further demonstrated disciplined cost management. We will stay focused on conversion so as to ensure that we can deliver on our margin-improvement target for the year. We also continue to show that the work we have done over a number of years to bolster the company's financial fundamentals, including a substantially strengthened balance sheet and credit ratings are significant drivers of value creation.","For some time now, our results have shown that investing in talent and focusing on a culture of accountability and performance are key drivers of success. We use strategic acquisitions to supplement the very high level of expertise and service delivery for which our agencies and our holding company have become known. Increasingly, we also invest internal programs that promote innovation such as the very successful accelerators we operate with R\/GA with the trial and partnerships with startups that take place through Mediabrands emerging Media Lab. Of course we also remain committed to substantial return of capital to our shareholders as a way to build value.","Moving on to the tone of the business. We just completed our regular financial revues with all of our operating leadership and the environment remains sound overall. While results in the quarter reflect slower growth in June, there does not appear to be a market change in client sentiment. Instead, a couple of the large wins we posted in 2015 saw some revenue being deferred into the second half, though with full year scopes of work that remain in line with our expectations. Given that the work is already well underway we have a high degree of confidence in this revenue. Certainly there's a high degree of volatility due to Brexit and the geopolitical tensions we are seeing play out in places such as Europe and the Middle East. Brazil is also experiencing some turmoil due to both the political situation and public health concerns. Globally we're keeping a close eye on our event and other project businesses which are often the first to see cancellations. While it seems that the situation in the U.K. will lead to slower decision making and may affect certain client sectors, to date our teams on the ground report limited impact from the referendum.","As you saw, our performance in continental Europe was essentially flat with some markets seeing modest growth. The situation in that part of the world continues to be challenging, which could weigh on consumer sentiment and business activity. As previously indicated, we built our plan for 2016 with very limited growth expectations for Europe, and in this sense we further benefit from our limited exposure to the region.","Turning to the new business pipeline there's a fair bit of overall activity. Media continues to be the most active sector followed by marketing services. These are both areas in which we've had good success in recent years. Our major global advertising-based networks are also seeing opportunities and we're seeing quite a number of integrated RFPs coming into the holding company for which we field cross-agency teams with our open architecture approach. Other than the few situations where a client has decided to limit participation to incumbents we are active in most of the major pitches that are out there. Our performance in new business has been strong the past few years, which is very gratifying. You've all heard me say that I also want our agencies and our people just as focused on providing great service to existing clients and growing with them organically, which we continue to see. At the agency level, highlights in the quarter included very strong performance from R\/GA and HUGE which continue to be among the industry's most innovative agencies, providing the full range of digital marketing services including consulting with clients on digital business transformation, the connected space as well as storytelling across a range of new mediums and platforms.","McCann once again posted strong performance across all disciplines, notably in its Momentum unit which won a major global sponsorship brief from SAP and at MRM which remains one of the leading global digital networks in the industry. The Worldgroup is also growing its relationships with recently-won clients, notably Reckitt Benckiser. McCann saw further strong results in a range of awards competitions including Cannes, where McCann Health was named network of the year and McCann New York had a stellar performance.","MullenLowe showed strength in the quarter. Notably, domestically as its Royal Caribbean campaign earned attention and acclaim and the agency won Jet Blues' Barclay card. MullenLowe also had a very active on a number of integrated open architecture teams, both domestic and international, and we hope to be able to announce some wins connected with those efforts in the near term.","At Mediabrands, results remain strong. The digital and accountable offerings within Mediabrands continue to be best in class and to power much of that unit's success.","The performance of UM and its leadership has also been outstanding in recent years. On that front, we're pleased to confirm today that we've retained the BMW media AOR in the U.S. and Canada, another important win for UM and Mediabrands.","Cannes was also a highlight for the group with a high degree of recognition for our work and the launch of the D100, a new brand assessment metric that has gotten a lot of attention in the marketplace.","Of course, on the media front, during the quarter, we saw the publication of the K2 report commissioned by the ANA. This relates to an issue that we at IPG have consistently handled in a highly proactive and transparent manner. As such, our conversations with clients relating to the report and the practices it alleges have been constructive. We continue to encourage dialogue on these matters and we stand behind our record of transparency in our contracts as well as our dealing with clients and media vendors. IPG's performance in this regard has been consistently validated by a range of third party experts employed by our clients. We're also proud of our long-standing commitment not to take inventory media positions. These practices allow us to bring a highly-informed and wholly objective perspective to our engagements, so that we can consistently represent the best interests of our clients.","Another operating unit that posted strong performance in the quarter was CMG. We benefit from exceptionally deep and experienced leadership teams at all of our units within this group. Furthermore, as capturing consumers' attention becomes more difficult and valuable in a world of fragmented media, disciplines such as public relations, sports marketing, experiential campaigns and brand design will continue to increase in prominence. Notable wins in the quarter at Weber Shandwick included being named as the lead global public relations agency for General Motors', Chevrolet brand, as well as their recent notable win at GSK. FCB also showed further progress during the second quarter. The global Clorox win was an important step for the network. FCB's healthcare and shopper marketing capabilities remain among the industry's best, and for the second consecutive year, the agency posted its strongest-ever performance in terms of awards won at Cannes.","The benefits of investing in talent, embedding digital expertise throughout our portfolio, as well as raising our game strategically and creativity continues to be evident in the strength of our offerings across the portfolio. We're pleased with the high caliber of our people and capabilities. This is what has fueled our strong organic revenue performance during the first half of 2016.","Looking forward, despite increased macro uncertainty and the revenue timing that impacted our second quarter, we continue to believe that we will deliver on the high end of our full-year target of organic revenue of 3% to 4%. In terms of costs, we will stay vigilant as the year progresses, and we remain closely focused on achieving the appropriate levels of conversion. Profit performance during the first half of this year showed meaningful improvement, and we are on track to expand full-year operating margin by 50 basis points or better, consistent with our stated goal.","Combined with our company's financial strength and commitment to capital return, which has been and will continue to be a source of significant value creation, this will allow us to further enhance shareholder value.","As always, we thank you for your support and we look forward to keeping you posted as the year unfolds. With that, I'll open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.","And our first question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much. On the new business front, you guys have highlighted its strength, and we clearly have seen its strength as well in the press in recent months, actually, recent years, I think, as you put it. But there's obviously so much more that you guys see internally that don't make the headlines here. Is there any way, given that, that you can give us a bit more color in terms of what sort of tailwind from the new business we might see in the back half of this year, and then I have a follow-up, please.","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, yes, you're right. It somehow seems that our client wins don't get announced while some of our competitors' do. The answer to your first part of your question is we are \u2013 we continue to be net new business positive, which is an indication of the strength of our offerings. I did indicate a number of our recent wins in my prepared remarks, notably of the recent retention of the BMW work at Mediabrands, which is a very good retention for us, obviously, and the wins at McCann and Weber with respect to Reckitt Benckiser. We do expect to announce a nice win coming up in the next couple of weeks. We hope that'll happen, which will be a global engagement, we hope, using the integrated open-architecture approach. We don't like to give out tailwinds, because \u2013 well, let me just comment here.","It's so hard, in this business \u2013 when we lose clients, it's very easy for us to know the impact of when that revenue is going to be coming off. So when we talk about tailwinds and headwinds, the headwinds are easy. We don't like them, but we can specifically know when that comes off because the contracts provide for that and we know our staffing requirements and so on. Our new business wins coming into 2016, a number of them came at the end of the year, and frankly, we win the business and then we have contract negotiations and scope of work is developed as we go through, and that's one of the contributing factors in the fact that, as we said, we had good tailwinds coming into the first half of the year, and some of that work is slipping over into the second half of the year. So yes, we have some tailwinds now in the second half of the year, and the timing of those tailwinds and when they're recognized is a function of when the work is shown. There are a whole bunch of issues that go into that. So the answer is we have some tailwinds in the second half. All of that gets factored into the overall forecast that when we say our target is 3% to 4% on the high end of 4%, we take into consideration a year of performance. As I said before...","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Our clients don't know when our quarterly requirements are for financial reporting which is why we stick to our notion that given the macro environment, we're comfortable with what we set out as a stated goal which includes the revenue performance and our conversion and the fact that our conversion will be stronger in the second half is consistent with the way our business has rolled out in prior years.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And just one follow up, if I may. Michael, I know you touched upon this a few times in your opening comments but with one of your peers citing cancellations in event businesses hurting their performance, I just want to be clear that you guys are not seeing that kind of wide-spread cancellations at all outside of sort of the normal business where you may see it in your one event like in Hong Kong or something like that adjust in terms of timing. For you, it's more normal course of business, not any sort of trend in terms of cancellations for whatever reason.","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Believe me, that's the first place we look and Frank and I actually met with the leaders of those businesses to make sure that they're comfortable with the pipeline and the events that were canceled we reflected, particularly in Asia Pac, that had a big impact on us. It was in Hong Kong. We saw some other, these are one-time events and they affect us but the pipeline on the event side of the business is very solid and we haven't seen wholesale cancellations. Now that said, we're still unclear what this Brexit is going to do. We challenge, we ask, and obviously everyone's nervous about it but yet when we sit down and look at our plans for the rest of the year, our business operators, with some risk obviously, are comfortable with our plans and consistent with what I said our objectives are.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Alexia.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of John Janedis from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Michael, you talked about your philosophy acting as an agent and not taking inventory so post the ANA report, I was wondering if you think this provides an incremental revenue opportunity for IPG or does the industry move away from the arbitrage model?","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, what they do is their business, our competitors. There's no question in that the ANA report focused on equity positions, inventory positions, particularly on the programmatic side of the business and you correctly point out that we do not do that and therefore we view that as more consistent with an advisory model that is diagnostic. And yeah, I think as we go through, there's no question when we're pitching new business, obviously we distinguish our positions versus our competitors in those pitches. Some frankly, some clients don't care and that's, obviously, our competitors who have very strong performance in those markets reflect that. But I think overall the more there is in terms of scrutiny of these type of positions, I think it will have an impact on the business, and that's been our strategy. And I've said this before, if in the end clients really don't care and it doesn't turn out to be a competitive advantage to us then we'll continue to look at whether we should be doing it. But right now we view it as a differentiator in the market place and if you look at our net wins and losses on the media side of the business, although I can't point to it as being a specific reason, I think the transparency and the reputation we have on treating our clients fairly on an advisory basis is reflected in those wins.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks, Michael. And maybe Frank, I just wanted to clarify: was the uptick in base and medivitch (35:21) related to staffing the new business wins and that we'll see the improvement later this year as revenue kicks in? And maybe also, is the pullback in the incentive comp any read-through to your outlook for the rest of the year?","Frank Mergenthaler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","There's no doubt, John, that the onboarding of these new clients has put pressure on BBT (35:39). And there is a bit of a mismatch between expenses incurred and revenue. So we think over the back half of the year that will self-correct.","On the incentive side, for the six months we're at 3.8% of revenue, it's the exact same number as last year. And our incentives have been tracking between 3.5% and 4% for the last few years. So I think it's, we're not looking at the quarter, we're looking at for the year. Every quarter we forecast what the year's going look like. So I think we're right in line as where we were last year.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","All right. Great. Thank you.","Frank Mergenthaler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You're welcome.","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning, guys. I want to just come back to the U.K., and knowing, I don't think that any of us know how Brexit may or may not impact spending there. But it's been a very good story for IPG for a number of years. So let me just talk about, if you look at the last, 2014 and 2015 were big years for you organically in the U.K. How much of that was agency-driven or market share gains versus sort of market expansion, market strength, just so we can think about IPGs assets in that market and your ability to maybe outperform even if the market slows, which I think we're all sort of trying to figure out if that's going to happen?","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it's a fair question. Yeah, we've been on a good streak particularly on the event side of the business over there as well as our networks. Frankly what you're seeing in the U.K. this quarter is we are cycling through some losses we had both on the media side of the business as well as the creative side of the business and we're seeing impact of that. Absent that we think our offerings in the U.K. are very strong, notably R\/GA, McCann, all of our networks, MullenLowe, and so we believe that we will continue to be strong in terms of our performance in the U.K., absent something weird happening as a result of Brexit.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then just as a follow-up, you mentioned, I think, organically, mid-single-digit growth in some of the sort of key emerging markets in Asia, China and India as you went through your agency reviews. What does the outlook look like there? There's obviously a lot of press, particularly around China and the economy.","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I know your business skews multinational, but maybe just give us a sense for how those markets look for the outlook.","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. China was up mid-single digits. India was a little stronger than that, particularly at MullenLowe in India, and we continue to sense that type of environment. Obviously, China \u2013 we're not as big in China, so variations on client wins and losses and quant specific clients spend in those markets affect those numbers more dramatically. But the overall tone, although it's \u2013 everyone's concerned about it, we see that type of growth in our plan.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon from BMO. Your line is now open.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, everyone. Maybe, Michael, a couple questions on a few specific agencies. You mentioned MRM continues to be a really strong performer as I think we've seen some news reports about some executive-level changes there and I was just hoping you could add some color to that and whether a different trajectory for the agency is trying to be struck. And then secondly, once again R\/GA and HUGE continue to be real leaders for you and I'm just curious if you could shed some light on how you're able to leverage that for broader new business activity through the sort of flatter open architecture more these days.","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's a mouthful. Okay. Well, look, obviously MRM is a very strong component of the Worldgroup and IPG, and we're always looking to add talent and strengthen our offerings. We see it as a big opportunity at MRM at the Worldgroup in terms of cross-disciplines, as well as potentially using that in the open architecture environment. So yes, we're beefing up our expertise in that particular segment and we believe that those opportunities will come as we strengthen their offerings. R\/GA and HUGE are very interesting examples of competency. They started out as pure-play digital agencies, and obviously with the growth of digital, they've expanded dramatically. RG\/A is a great textbook story of growing globally with success in the markets that they've opened in. You know, R\/GA, you can put up a shingle and all of a sudden you have strong businesses. Their reputation is second to none in turns of their space and R\/GA has done a great job at expanding their offerings focusing on the connected environment and they're doing design, they're doing business transformation. So they've expanded their offering well beyond the typical digital play if you will and that's why we're seeing the great growth out of R\/GA.","Similarly, HUGE has expanded. Remember, when we acquired HUGE, we had 80 people in Brooklyn, New York. Now we have some 1,100, 1,200 people on a worldwide basis and they've expanded our offerings as well in terms of different offerings and their go-to-market strategy in terms of business transformation. And frankly, expanding upon just the pure play digital offering. And if you plug those two agencies in our open-architecture model, frankly, there's hardly many companies that can compete with the strength of our global networks plugging in our digital plays to supplement their own expertise. And that's practically the whole concept of open architecture. And it's a challenge for us obviously because those individuals are focused on growing their wonderful businesses but again, they also see opportunities partnering with some of our agencies. In fact, some of the wins that we've seen, we've seen partnering of those digital, whether it be HUGE or R\/GA with, whether it be McCann, FCB or MullenLowe. Although MullenLowe has Profero which is another digital agency that is performing extremely well on a global basis.","So, it's not by accident that we see our digital agencies growing double digit. And of course, the embedded digital expertise we have at Weber Shandwick and experiential marketing and all of our networks themselves have very strong digital offerings. So that's why we don't break out digital, frankly, because digital is really throughout our offering. So the concept of our open architecture is to provide the best talent we have within the expertise and bring the best to our clients. And frankly it's working quite well and hopefully you'll see another win that reflects that in the next couple of weeks.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thanks, Michael.","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. One for Michael and a couple of housekeeping questions for Frank. Michael, going back to the pass-throughs, can you characterize a little bit more what the reductions were? It sounds like this was almost exclusively related to CMG. Wondering if there was any IN (43:20) impact in there and was this entirely event-driven or were there just some kind of some production reductions from existing clients as well, and was this a surprise to you? It sounded like this kind of came in June, or is this kind of mapped more directly to what you were expecting for the quarter? And then, quickly, for Frank, wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on working cap. Understand that this quarter was within range, but was there anything there worth calling out? And then just wanted to quickly check with you on the impending changes to the overtime rules and whether that's fully contemplated at this point by all your agencies and whether that's kind of a de Minimis impact going forward, or any color you could offer on that. Thanks so much, guys.","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well, first of all, on the overtime, we've been doing work on it and we're obviously looking at ways to mitigate it, but to the extent it does affect us, it's not a significant number, and obviously we're working towards reducing it. And we will, in fact, implement whatever we need to do to minimize the effect of it. On the pass-throughs, yes. The answer is, basically all of our pass-throughs have to do with our events. It has nothing to do with media ownership, which obviously is one of the confusing parts of pass-throughs from our competitors and us. And throughout the years, what we've been trying to do is change the contracts on these event engagements, because whether we act as an agent or not affects the accounting. What would happen is we will go out and outsource a lot of the people that are used in that engagement, and it's treated as a straight pass-through, but the accounting has it in our revenue and in our expenses, so we back out the pass-through. So it's not something that's a surprise to us. In fact \u2013 and those pass-through numbers are actually coming down, because when we enter into contracts, we know that it's confusing from an accounting point of view, so we try to structure the contracts to reflect it properly so that we don't find this. So it you look at it on a global basis, we have 30 basis points of pass-throughs, which is why if you looked at our overall organic, we would increase that organic by 30 basis points.","Frank Mergenthaler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Peter, we started this about three years ago, four years ago, to move away from being a principle and become an agent in the events business. So every quarter for the past three years, you've seen our pass-throughs coming down.","On your working capital question, you know how volatile it is around quarter-end with respect \u2013 it's primarily \u2013 it's cash flows around media. So nothing stood out. We had a couple clients where we had some inefficiencies in our payment stream, so it tripped over into the third quarter, but for us it was normal course and there was nothing of surprise.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Frank Mergenthaler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You're welcome.","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser from Pivotal Research. Your line is now","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Thanks for taking the question. I'm curious to hear your thoughts. You know, there's been some speculation that perhaps this year might actually turn out to be a bigger year for media reviews than last year in some ways. I realize it seems kind of late in the year for this to happen, but as everyone's digesting the K2 report and the recommendations, I'm just curious to hear how you think the rest of the year plays out on the new business front industry wide, perhaps...","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Brian. You know, everyone started the year thinking it was. If you remember I didn't think so, and the reason for it is I, we didn't know of any big media reviews at our existing clients. So that's basically why I answered the question the way I did. I still don't see as big, you know, there's two big reviews out there. Obviously AT&T and of course McDonalds on the creative side. But yeah, I suspect, as always, we'll see when it comes probably around September, we'll see some media reviews. But certainly it's, it will be pretty hard to compete with what we had last year, Brian.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Yeah.","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And you know what's happening, some of our clients are just asking to look and as far as the ANA report. Of course we have dialogs with our clients, going over contracts, making sure our language is as tight as it has been. We had all these provisions in our contracts before, whether it be the ability to audit transparency. So clients, they'll ask questions like that, but I don't see any big upheaval in terms of reviews as a result of the ANA. I know there's one particular company out there, not a client of ours, that has brought in their outside auditors to look at this kind of stuff. I'm knocking on wood. We haven't seen any of that.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Brian.","Frank Mergenthaler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Brian.","Jerome J. Leshne - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Nollen from Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Tim?","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Your U.S. growth has been really just quite solid and stable for the past, really, every quarter for the last three years or so. I'm wondering if you might be able to speculate if there is any slowdown in the UK or Europe, if advertisers might simply shift those dollars to a region like the U.S. where you're strong and where the economy is pretty good and where the ad spending has been consistent. Secondly, one of your competitors that reported this morning mentioned receivables were going up because some clients were pushing out payment terms. And it doesn't look like you're reporting that in your Q2 numbers. Another peer that reported earlier also looks like they didn't show that in their numbers. So I'm just kind of wondering where this is coming from. It goes back to this issue of a year or more ago where there's talk about advertisers trying to push out payment terms to their agencies. So I was just curious what your perspective is on that.","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The reason you don't see us talking about it because we don't see it.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yeah.","Frank Mergenthaler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We're in the camp of that one versus the other one.","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Interesting question on the U.S. Look, 62% of our business in the quarter came from the United States and there's no question that's a strength of IPG. We have very competitive offerings across all of our networks plus let's not forget our independent agencies in the U.S. We have Deutsch, we have Hill Holliday. These are very strong, The Martin Agency. We have very strong independent agencies in the U.S. and frankly, if there are UK or European companies looking to break into the U.S. market, we have more than enough competitive offerings to pick up their business and obviously, the digital components in the U.S. is exceptionally strong. So we can really field a great team to get that business.","The other side of it is, the U.S. side of the business is very competitive, particularly on the CPG side. But we did see some of our clients shift some business to us in the U.S. And as they do acquisitions in the U.S., they want to beef up the offering so there is some of that in our growth in the U.S. And I view that as an opportunity. I think the fact that we have 62% of our business in the U.S. is a strong positive for us. I know this goes through waves if you will in terms of if you are better off in other countries, but we've been consistently very strong in the U.S. and frankly, we like that position.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yeah. Great. Thanks.","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Tim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from James Dix of Wedbush Securities. You may proceed.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, guys. I guess two questions. First, kind of following up on Alexia's question about new business lift. I think you said coming into the year you expected around a point and a half or 150 basis points of lift for the first half of this year. Any assessment of how that actually turned out and how that phased in 1Q versus 2Q, especially given what you said about June? Then with BMW under your belt, are there any major pieces of business which you are defending that you would flag? And then I guess secondly, I don't normally ask a lot about awards but with Cannes occurring this quarter, I guess this would be the time to do it. I mean, do you have any expectations every year as to how you want to do at Cannes and, or at awards more generally and if so, did you perform against those expectations and do you see these awards correlating to revenue growth or profitability over time? Thanks.","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","How much time do we have left in this call?","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Seven minutes till the open.","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. First, let me talk about the accounts in review. The most significant item, it's not in review, but it \u2013 well, it is in review, it will be, is the Army. There's a mandatory review every five years. We've been extended through September of 2017 on that one, but there will be a review of the Army coming, and obviously we've done this before and hopefully we will be able to retain. Fiat, a client of MullenLowe, is in the midst of a review. We hope to hear from that in the next couple of months, and TD Bank is in review. And those are the significant items of review from existing clients. And, our existing wins, we \u2013 I think it goes to the offering and the comment that we've always said, that we want to treat our existing clients as if we're pitching them all the time. So the retention of BMW is significant. Obviously it's a good client for Mediabrands, but it's also an indication of verification of the work that we've been doing, and the fact that as the market changes, we're able to field it with talented people, tools and data analytics that are necessary, and we're very competitive in the media space.","And what was the other question?","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Just on the business, how the lift from new business wins actually ended up phasing in, in the first half of the year. I think you talked about 150 basis points, yeah.","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","A good portion of the tailwind is phased in within first quarter and second quarter. Some of it spilled over to the second half of the year, which is what I talked about. Obviously with new wins and so on, we'll have some additional business issues, wins hopefully and tailwinds in the second half, but it's too soon to give \u2013 we're not going to give out a number on that yet, because frankly some of our wins haven't been announced yet. But the answer is yes, we have tailwinds, not as big as in the first half of the year, and it certainly tails off in the second half of the year. Although the timing of these things \u2013 and again, I have to reiterate, the timing of these tailwinds and when they impact, we have \u2013 we really don't have much control over that. It happens to be in the hands of our clients, and so we're very conservative when it comes to whether we answer the question of when is the timing of our tailwinds, and for good reason.","Frank Mergenthaler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","They're all baked into the revenue forecast right here.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. And any sense as to how they came in in the first half? Was it roughly the 150 bps that you were expecting or was it a little bit less based on some of the push to the second half?","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","If we have to give you a number, it was a little bit less, because that's \u2013 obviously we had some of it...","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","...come in the second half of the year.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then any comment on Cannes and awards generally in terms of their impact on your business?","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Cannes, as I said before in my comments, on a revenue basis, we outperformed \u2013 we're not as big as some of our competitors. So if you just through a lot of money in Cannes, you can win more awards than anyone else. So we think a good way of looking at it is comparing awards per revenue and when you do that our agencies perform better. That's the way we look at it. Of course we're going to look at it that way. McCann was very strong this year in Cannes and that's not by accident. McCann had a very strong emphasis on creativity. Rob Reilly and his team working with Harrison, the rest of, part of the McCann World Group, had a very strong effort in Cannes and the results are reflective of that. McCann New York in particular, it was great to see the awards they were winning and of course McCann Health won the Healthcare Agency of the Year. So it is an important factor.","Every year we look at the question of risk\/reward in terms of spending the kind of money we do in Cannes. No one asked for the person who performed the poorest in Cannes when we do reviews. So I believe we're going to continue to see a strong effort in terms of awards and to reflect the creative power of \u2013 creativity and effectiveness is an critical component of what we do which is why FCB, MullenLowe, all of our agencies participate in it. But we pick and choose which the work we want to put in and we're very proud of all the agencies and the awards that we won.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Thanks very much.","Jerome J. Leshne - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line Tom Eagan of Telsey. You may proceed.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Great. Thank you very much. Another agency-holding company this quarter indicated that the ad budget migration from TV to digital, it was slowing, still occurring, but the pace was slowing as a result of client concerns about digital ad fraud and viewability. Curious in what you're seeing or hearing from clients. Thanks.","Michael Isor Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think that was the big talk in Cannes. A lot of it was coming from the media owners, the TV owners and a lot had to do with the up fronts. Remember, last year's scatter, a lot of companies were caught flat in the scatter and had to pay higher pricing. So we saw an uptick in TV in the up fronts. And a lot of people read into that that therefore the money going into digital is slowing and it's going back to TV. In the U.S., in terms of the spend, we see 2016 sort of equal between digital and TV and frankly, in 2017, we believe digital will pass TV.","So the growth of digital is slowing a bit, because, look, it keeps getting bigger and bigger. But TV isn't going away. So our expertise is to help our clients decide where to put it. And some clients are happy with digital and they spend more in digital; other clients are concerned about the ad fraud and visibility, and are they getting the right ROIs in terms of bots and all of the ad blockers and so on, and they're more comfortable with TV. It's a question of what gives the clients the best ROI, and frankly that's what we get paid to do in terms of help our clients understand it. So, and we continue to see that as the opportunity for our business.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Great.

We will begin with prepared remarks to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 eastern.","During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company. These are subject to the uncertainties and the cautionary statement that are included in our earnings release and the slide presentation, and further detailed in our 10-K and other filings with the SEC.","We will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful, supplemental data, that while not a substitute for GAAP measures, allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance.","At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael Roth","Thank you Jerry and good morning, we'd like to thank you for joining us as we review our results for the quarter. I'll start out by covering highlights of our performance, Frank will then provide details and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies to be followed by the Q&A. We're pleased to report another quarter of strong performance, organic revenue grew 5.7% in Q1 on top of 6.6% a year ago. Our growth was driven by increases in all major disciplines in most geographic regions. It's worth noting that in the quarter acquisitions added 1.1% to growth and currency translation was a 4.4% drag on revenue. Given the further strengthening of the dollar during Q1 currency translation would be a full year headwind of 5.1% at recent exchange rates. It's also important to note that because our revenue and expenses are evenly matched at current exchange rates we expect currency would be neutral to our percentage operating margin for the year.","Operating profit was $8 million compared to a loss of $12 million a year ago, as you all know our first quarter is seasonally small in terms of revenue while costs are distributed fairly evenly throughout the year. Our first positive Q1 result in terms of profit in over a decade is therefore yet another milestone that points to the continued progress at Interpublic. ","During the quarter we achieved leverage on both our principal expense categories, driving breakeven earnings per share compared to a loss of $0.05 per share in the same period a year ago. ","Turning to more color on revenue, our growth reflects both increases with existing clients as well as new business wins. We were led by increases in the healthcare, food and beverage, tech and telecom and retail sectors. In the U.S., organic growth was 6.1% with outstanding performance across a broad range of agencies and disciplines. International organic growth was also strong at 5.1% with nearly all major regions contributing. We had increases in Asia-PAC, the UK and the Middle East as well as a welcome return to growth in continental Europe. LatAm decreased less than 1% on an organic basis. ","Turning to expenses and margin, total operating expenses increased 1.2% compared with our reported revenue growth of 2.4%, as a result Q1 operating margin improved by a 120 basis points. Cost discipline and margin enhancement remain a top priority and we were able to execute against that objective again during the quarter. ","Our capital structure also continued to be a source of value creation. Earlier this month S&P raised our credit rating to investment grade, this is the culmination of an extended process and reflects significant positive developments at IPG in recent years. We are now rated investment grade by all three major credit rating agencies, according to us an important recognition of financial strength and fulfilling a long standing management objective. As previously announced in February, our board approved a 26% increase to our quarterly dividend and authorized an additional 300 million share repurchase program. ","During Q1 we repurchased 2.5 million shares using $51 million, since the inception of the repurchase programs in February 2011 we've repurchased a 124 million shares at an average cost of $12.63 per share. We are encouraged that our performance in the quarter continues to reflect the competitiveness of our agencies, the quality of our offerings of course the full spectrum of digital services within our advertising, marketing services as well as media agencies was once again a key contributor to our strong results. ","Our strategic focus remains on delivering outstanding creativity, top tier digital capabilities embedded across the portfolio and on crafting integrated solutions for our clients. This combination will ensure that we continue to be called upon by clients for higher value services thereby allowing us to grow and win in today's world of dynamic technology enabled consumer marketing. Given the strength of our offerings and our first quarter performance, we believe that we remain well positioned to achieve our financial targets for the full year. ","At this stage I'll turn things over to Frank with some additional details on our results, after his remarks I'll be back to provide an update on our agencies and the tone of the business to be followed by the Q&A. ","Frank Mergenthaler","Thank you Michael, good morning. As a reminder I'll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. On Slide 2 you see an overview of our results. Organic growth was 5.7% in the first quarter, 6.1% in the US and 5.1% in our international markets. Q1 operating profit was 8 million in our seasonally small first quarter, an improvement of 20 million compared to last year. Operating margin was 50 basis points compared with negative 70 basis points in Q1 2014. ","Turning to Slide 3 you'll see our P&L for the quarter; I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. Turning to revenue on Slide 4, revenue was 1.68 billion in the quarter, an increase of 2.4%. Compared to Q1 2014 the impact of the change in exchange rates was a negative 4.4% while net acquisitions added 1.1%. The resulting organic revenue increase was 5.7%. ","With the strengthening of the US dollar against most currencies its worth pointing out that revenues and expense of our businesses are very well matched in functional terms. FX change had minimal impact on our change in operating profit and margin in the quarter. It's also worth noting that our pass through revenue decreased slightly compared to Q1 2014 which is offset by a decrease in our O&G expense. ","As you can see on the bottom half of this slide organic growth was 6.7% at our integrated agency network segment with contributions from all major disciplines with notable increases at all three of our global network McCann, FCB and Lowe. CMG grew 1.6% organically with continued solid growth in our PR businesses. On a net basis growth at CMG was in the mid-single digits. Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region, US organic growth of 6.1% was broad based across a number of our agencies, led by McCann, FCB, Deutsch, Mediabrands and CMG. Leading client sectors were healthcare, tech and telecom and food and beverage.","Turning to international markets the UK grew 6.4% organically which is on top of 10.7% a year ago. We had strong growth at all three global integrated networks, McCann, FCB and Lowe, as well as our digital specialist HUGE and R\/GA. Most client sectors grew as well notably retail, consumer goods, and food and beverage. Continental Europe increased 3.5% organically on top of 3.8% a year ago. We were led by Mediabrands, Lowe and R\/GA. Geographically this will result [included] growth in Spain and model decreases in both Germany and France. ","In Asia-PAC our largest international region Q1 organic growth was 6% with increases in many national markets led by China, India and Singapore. Lowe and McCann were very strong across the region as were HUGE and R\/GA. In LatAm we decreased 0.7% organically on top of 18% growth year-ago as well as 16% growth in Q1 2013. The decrease was driven by increase in the challenged economy in Brazil and time and appliance spending partially offset by growth in other markets such as Argentina and Mexico. ","Our other markets increased 10.4% organic in Q1 driven mainly by growth in the Middle East. On slide six, we tried the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12 month basis. The most recent data point is 5.4%. ","Moving to slide seven, our operating expenses. In the first quarter total operating expenses increased 1.2% from the year ago compared to our reported revenue increase of 2.4%. Our Q1 ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue was 72.5% this year compared with 72.6 a year-ago, an improvement of 10 basis points. It is important to note that the decrease in pass-through revenue, which is offset dollar-for-dollar and lower O&G expense resulted in some deleveraging on SRS and some leveraging on O&G by resulting in no impact on operating profit. Adjusted for change in pass-through revenue our SRS leverage is 40 basis points. ","Our base salaries benefit tax was 60.5% of revenue compared with 60.3 a year ago an increase of 20 basis points. Expense for temporary labor was 3.9% of revenue the same level as a year-ago. Incentive expense as a percentage of revenue was also unchanged from year-ago and severance expense improved 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. All other salaries and related expense was 3.2% of revenue compared with 3.3% a year-ago. Total headcount at quarter-end was approximately 48,000. Headcount increased during the quarter by approximately 1% from Q4 of 2014 on higher growth areas in the portfolio and to support new business wins. ","Turning to office and general expenses on the lower half of the slide. O&G expense was 27% of Q1 revenue an improvement of 110 basis points from year-ago that leverage across most major expense components. We had 50 basis points of leverage on occupancy expense, 30 basis points of leverage on telecom, office supplies and travel and 30 basis points on our category of all other O&G expense as pass-through expenses decreased. ","On slide eight, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12 month basis. Most recent data point is 10.7% which reflects solid progress towards our full year target of 80 basis points to 100 basis points.","Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on slide nine, we ended the first quarter with 741 million in cash in short-term marketable securities. It's worth noting that our cash level is seasonal and it tends to peak at year-end. ","On slide 10, we turn to cash flow. Cash used in operations in Q1 was 797 million compared with 726 year-ago. Operating cash flow is also seasonal, as our business generates significant cash and working capital in the fourth quarter and uses cash and working capital in the first quarter. During this year's first quarter, cash used in working capital was 801 million compared with use of 723 million a year-ago. Investing activities in Q1 used 20 million 20 million for capital expenditures. Financing activity used 51 million mainly in capital return to shareholders partially offset by increased short-term borrowings. ","We used 51 million for share repurchases and our common stock dividend was 49 million. Typically the pace of our share repurchases geared to our fourth quarter when our cash flows are strongest. Our net decrease in cash and marketable securities for the quarter was 926 million compared with 866 million a year-ago. On slide 11 we showed debt deleveraging from the peak of 2.35 billion in 2007 to 1.76 billion at the most recent quarter-end. ","In summary on slide 12 we are pleased with our revenue growth and profit performance in the quarter which represents a good start in terms of achieving our financial objectives for the full year. ","With that let me turn it back to Michael. ","Michael Roth","Thanks Frank. We are obviously pleased with the results we\u2019re announcing this morning. Organic revenue performance was not only competitive it looks to have come in at the top-end of our sector. If there is noting that digital services across the Group were significant contributors to organic revenue growth. Other highlights in terms of organic growth includes the fact that we saw contributions from across the portfolio including all three global networks, McCann, FCB and Lowe. Performance at media brands and at our PR agencies continue to be strong. Asia and the UK grew well and we saw a positive growth quarter in Continental Europe. ","The deceleration we experienced in LatAm largely reflects macroeconomic issues in Brazil as well as the fact that we were facing difficult comps in that region. We continue to demonstrate disciplined cost management and we remain focused on converting the appropriate levels so as to deliver on our margin improvement target for the year. Investment and talent supplemented by strategic acquisitions should ensure that we maintain the very high level of our professional offerings. We also remained committed to robust capital return programs that can drive further value creation for our shareholders.","Moving on to the tone of the business. What we are hearing from our operators and in our conversations with major multinational clients is that there is a consistent commitment to investing behind brands as company seeks to drive their business forward. We are seeing areas of macro uncertainty such as Brazil, Russia and certain markets in the Middle East. Of course it\u2019s still early in the year with only three months in the books at this point. But the overall environment is such that we continue to see sufficient opportunities for us to achieve our stated growth objectives for the year.","The marketing mix that is right for each of our clients in order to meet a range of marketing challenges is becoming increasingly complex. We therefore need to be able to customize our approach for each specific situation as we continue to have at our disposal all of the tools required to meet the evolving needs of the marketplace. Our new business pipeline is sound and we are tracking solid activity at most of our agencies. The first quarter saw some notable wins and we\u2019re involved in the full range of major opportunities that are currently being contested, other than those we are conflicted and unable to participate.","Our performance in new business was very strong last year and we want to keep building on that result. Highlights at our agencies include a very strong quarter from McCann with continued new business momentum, increased levels and integration within Worldgroup and in working with a range of IPG agencies, as well as a very strong showing in terms of industry honors including the recent news from the Global Effie Awards that McCann has been named the industry\u2019s second ranked network in terms of marketing effectiveness.","We\u2019re rank number four globally on the Effie Index in terms of marketing effectiveness and one of its campaigns for Unilever was recognized as the best in the world in terms of driving marketplace results. The integration of Profero continues to go well and that\u2019s providing Lowe with a strong digital partner on a range of client engagements. As previously mentioned, our focus with Lowe remains to scale the network more broadly in the U.S. and unlock potential growth in the U.S. based multinationals. Progress as FCB continued to be evident in its results especially domestically and in the UK with a merger with Inferno has been a success. The agency\u2019s flagship Chicago office won significant assignments during the quarter with IN BEC and more recently the New York agency was named AOR for Vonage.","We see further promise at the FCB health operations, especially as we add the ICC Lowe assets to that portfolio. At leading brands the management succession has been quite seamless, Henry Tajer moving from his global COO role to CEO initiatives [and UM] are strong in competitive networks. We continue to be a leader in addressing the change that technology is bringing to the media landscape as evident by Cadreon\u2019s recent announcement that it will be the first in programmatic radio, our investment in Samba TV and Magna\u2019s global creation of our consortium of 15 cable networks to enable targeted automated buying of TV inventory.","It bears noting here that our overall organic growth results do not benefit from taking inventory positions and media particularly the programmatic space where our offering is strong but predicated on a whole consulted model in which our impartiality and expertise are key differnetiators. CMG agencies continue to perform well in the quarter led by public relationships. We were consistently winners in market share new assignments from clients such as Unilever, Mattel, Field Air, the United Nations and most recently the American Cancer Society as well as major awards including Weber Shandwick once again being an agency of the year by PR Group.","Our U.S. integrated independent agencies continue to be a source of strength with Interpublic coming off outstanding overall performance in 2014 Mullen and Deutsche continue to be leaders in the marketplace. Carmichael Lynch added U.S. Bank after a highly competitive review that just concluded in early April. Along with the Martin Agency and Hill Holliday all of our domestic independents provide clients with a breadth of service including full-fledged creative digital experiential, analytics and social capabilities. Huge MRM and RGA of all leaders in the marketplace. MRM is among the leading industry\u2019s top global digital networks with 30 offices in over 20 world markets.","The growth as huge has been significant and the agency continues to be known for its best in class capabilities in the area of marketing utility. RGA remains the leader in innovations that have defined digital marketing since its inception. ","We are also very proud that this year the Cannes Festival recognized Bob Greenberg with his most prestigious owner for and I quote having helped show the way forward for the industry. Some among our peers have approached digital primarily by means of headline grabbing, M&A transactions and a siloed approach to this key competency. We continue to see the benefits of our long term approach from investing in talent and embedding digital expertise and capabilities throughout our portfolio of agencies. ","We believe this is consistent with the changing dynamics of media usage and consumer behavior. This strategy places our integrated marketing solution at the center of a client centric connected world and continues to be evident in our strong organic growth performance. As we look to the balance of the year we see some geographic markets that will require monitoring and we will of course remain vigilant on cost and on the appropriate levels of margin conversion going forward. While first quarter results were quite positive it bears repeating that is our seasonally smallest quarter and there's work ahead for us to deliver the year. ","At this point we believe that we remain well positioned to achieve our organic growth target of 3-4% and to improve operating margins by 80 to a 100 basis points. Combined with our company\u2019s financial strength and commitment to robust return of capital we have been and will continue to be a source of significant value creation. This will allow us to further enhance shareholder value. ","With that I thank you for your time and open up the floor to questions. Operator, can we have the first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Ms. Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan, ma'am your line is now open.","Alexia Quadrani","On new business wins which continue to look very-very strong and just trying to get a sense of how much that contributed to organic growth in the quarter and I guess sort of any further color on how you see the recent new business wins sort of in terms of is it a tailwind for the rest of the year and then I have a quick follow up.","Michael Roth","Alexia, I'm sorry, we missed the first part of your question was it basically about our net new business positive. ","Alexia Quadrani","Yes, the net new business being so strong how much of it contributed to your growth and how do you see it, is it a tailwind for the rest of the year.","Michael Roth","Well, we continue to be net new business positive, and as what we said at the end of last year we have tailwinds going into this year of approximately 1%, and going into the second half we seem to flatten out. But we don't break out our revenue by net new business. I will tell you that we see a good organic growth from our existing top 20 clients.","Alexia Quadrani","And then on the-- what I would qualify as sort of a long overdue upgrade by the last rating agency the S&P, I guess how is -- does that at all change I guess your cost to capital and sort of your outlook in terms of capital returns to shareholders.","Michael Roth","Look as we've always said thank you for recognizing that, this has certainly been one of our key objectives and we're pleased to see S&P move the way they did. Look, now that we're investment grade from all three rating agencies what it does give us is additional flexibility on liquidity. It should open up an opportunity for us to utilize commercial paper. That will add to our existing lines of credit that we have which are almost $1 billion.","So clearly that gives us financial flexibility as we go forward. We can\u2019t tell you when but we are looking at all opportunities on commercial paper and that frees up cash on our balance sheet that will be factored into our needs for the business in terms of acquisitions and certainly dividends and buybacks will be reflective of our balance sheet strength and excess cash we have. So I think that it gives us an additional cushion if you will as we move forward. We still have a significant amount of authorized buyback from our board, 390 some odd million dollars and obviously at this point that's sufficient and we will continue to monitor that as we go forward. We are committed to returning cash to our shareholders in both dividends as well as buyback methodology.","Operator","Our next question will be coming from the line of Mr. John Janedis from Jefferies, sir your line is now open.","John Janedis","Frank, I was hoping you can touch on, the leverage on and the relationship between the SRS and ONG line, I know you talked about the pass through revenue but with the strength in organic and the SRS fund flattish year-over-year do you have to spend for the growth.","Frank Mergenthaler","Yes, John it works real with a 120 basis point of margin improvement and we're fairly disclosive on those key metrics and the pass through [indiscernible] clouded a bit. But we're coming off a very strong fourth quarter growth wise, a very good quarter growth wise in the first quarter and we got to bring those people on to do the work and sometimes the revenue and the hiring doesn\u2019t align in the quarterly timeframe, but we still need to get leverage out of SRS to meet our overall targets, it\u2019s an area of focus for the entire management team.","Michael Roth","Yes, when we put out 80 to a 100 basis point improvement as Frank says the big opportunity for us is in SRS and with the pass throughs how it reflects our ONG. So we\u2019ve got three more quarters to go and within that period we expect to see leverage with respect to the SRS. It's clearly a key priority, it's in our management objectives and that\u2019s how we come up with our forecasted margin expansion. ","John Janedis","Maybe just separately can you wane on the rebase discussion from the IPG point of view and can you also speak to Brazil and to what extent recent headlines may or may not be impacting business?","Michael Roth","Let me talk about the rebate first. Now the total issue of ABBs and rebate is not new to IPG and some 10 years ago you may recall that we made that as an important issue as we became Sarbanes compliant at that point in time you recall we set up the significant amount of liability to pay back to our clients and we embarked on a full transparency program with IPG to make sure that there is transparency and then any rebate will be properly reflected in our contracts and given to our clients. ","So consistent with that in those markets first of all in the U.S. we have no rebate and therefore it's not an issue for us in the U.S. And in those markets where there are rebates were in fact encouraged by our clients to get as much volume rebates as possible, and our contracts are clear that those rebates belong to our clients or how they instruct us to treat those rebates. So we\u2019re extremely comfortable with the notion that we don't have any issues with respect to that. And in fact all of our contracts are fully transparent and consistent with that notion that we established 10 years-ago. So we\u2019re comfortable there. ","On issue of Brazil of course we\u2019re disappointed in what happened in Brazil. I might point out that we in fact investigated that\u2019s review of prior to what news that you saw in the media and in fact we had an extensive review of what was going on in Brazil we took action internally in the fact that we dismissed one or two employees within that organization and based on the review that we seen this is been an isolated case of those one or two individuals. We have cooperating with all the authorities with respect to that. We do not see a systemic issue here with respect to that this is the action of one or two individuals from a financial point of view. The numbers that are involved are not material to both IPG and our revenue numbers and our profitability. And we are following up on this very carefully and cooperating. We do not believe that this is a systemic issue for us in Brazil and we\u2019re cooperating as best we can. ","By the way part of your question might be that we did see a decline in Brazil in this year, that had nothing to do with this particular issue. This was a -- with a decline in two fold, one is we had a very strong company versus last year well in double-digits, and two the macroeconomic environment in Brazil is difficult at the current time. ","Operator","The next question will be coming from the line of Mr. David Bank of RBC Capital. Sir, your line is now open. ","David Bank","Michael I know you are always concerned about what you call the backdoor they need to continually improve service for clients make sure you keep them and win new ones. Frank I know the S&P rating is a lifetime appointment; you don't want to take it for granted. But it seems like for the first time in both your guys administration together the near-term business is operating about a smoothly as it can knock wood. So I guess my question is as you settle into that we\u2019re in a period of unprecedented change in an unprecedented short period of time in marketing and media. Can you take your focus or do you take your focus and shift it a little longer-term, and whatever can you talk a little bit about like in five years how does IPG need to be different, what are you working toward over the longer-term now that I would imagine get a little bit more flexibility now that the business is sort of taking care of itself. ","Michael Roth","We can spend an hour talking about that, David and we probably will. It's interesting I just addressed [Harris] had a global meeting of McCann grow well group of 500 people down in Florida. It was a great meeting. And I was addressing the very issues that you are talking about. ","First of all we don't settle in. This business as you know is very difficult and if you settle in anything you lose. So we are continually focusing on as you pointed out keeping the backdoor closed. And if you look at as I answered the question before of our top-20 clients we had very nice organic revenue growth from [indiscernible], and clearly the fact that we were keeping the backdoor closed is one of those reasons and we do not take clients for granted. ","We frankly -- the mantra around here is that we treat existing client as if we are pitching them for new business because that\u2019s the way we should treat existing clients. And settling in is hardly a thing to do when we had this large fragmented media environment, very competitive from our clients in terms of prices and so on. And what our main mantra is going to be we have to be client centric. And that means we have to continue to focus on the needs of our clients and in order to do that we have to invest in talent, we have to invest in all the technology that\u2019s out there, we have to provide integrated offerings that clients are looking for one place or places that give them the edge of on the competitive situation and clearly media, digital talent, creative all come together finally in this business. For years it\u2019s always been solid and now as we don\u2019t provide an integrated offering clients will look for it elsewhere so we are not taking anything for granted. Obviously we\u2019re very pleased with both the last year\u2019s results and the first quarter but we are constantly focusing on how to be better. We don\u2019t have to bigger but we have to be best in class in terms of meeting the needs of our clients and that is what our operators are focused on and the results of that you\u2019re seeing in the organic growth that we\u2019re having and the margin improvement because we are still focused on narrowing that gap.","So I think the key to the future of IPG is not being the biggest we have to be client centric, we have to be the place where talent wants to go. One of the things that I really am pleased about is the fact that we\u2019ve been able to recruit high caliber talent across all of our networks and frankly we like the fact that IPG is viewed as a good place to be within our peers groups because of the fact that we are client centric and we are focused on meeting the needs of the clients directly. Other than that we don\u2019t pay attention to it David. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mr. Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo Securities. Sir, your line is now open.","Peter Stabler","Good morning, and thanks for taking the question, I\u2019ve got two. First of all Michael thanks for your comments on digital and lack of benefit to organic growth. So, just wanted to get a little more color here and ask you is it really your stated policy not to pass media through your income statement today and\/or in the future do you -- can you give us that assurance or is that something that could change? ","And then secondly and trying to find areas of weakness here, just on the CMG side, you called out TR is performing well. Is there anything in there that you can or color you could offer on what didn\u2019t go so well this quarter? And it seems like some marketing services kind of across the group appear a little weaker over the last couple of quarters. I am just wondering if there is anything there to be concerned about at that marketing supports or anything. Thanks very much.","Michael Roth","Let me talk about your comment about media. We have historically been different than our competitors certainly more recently on the issue of taking inventory the reason that there is gross versus net with respect to some of our competitors is that they take inventory on their own behalf and then in essence sell that inventory to their clients. We act as in essence agents for our clients we do not take inventory. And as a result when you see our gross versus net the only item that affects our gross versus net is our experiential and pass through type expenses. And by the way those expenses do not carry margin along with it.","So we do not have a gross up in our organic revenue that reflects media owned and it is our stated policy and frankly we believe that being agnostic in the marketplace is a competitive advantage to us versus our competitors because it\u2019s hard to be an advisor when on one hand you\u2019re giving them advices to where they should place their media dollars and on the other hand you have an inventory component that you are -- equity interest in getting rid of it at a profit so we believe that is a distinction that we will maintain in the marketplace.","Now if as some of our competitors say it makes no differences as long as the net of buying and effectiveness is there if we see the marketplace develop over a period of time where in fact that is recognized and not giving us advantage in terms of meeting the needs of our clients then we will rethink it but right now as recently as this month we looked at that again and we believe as you will see in some of the pitches that taking that inventory position is not consistent with our overall model on as being agnostic in the marketplace. And frankly if I were a consumer that\u2019s the way I would look at it, so that\u2019s our strategy. And the accounting follows your business practice and therefore our accounting does not require us to gross anything other than the pass-throughs that we have. As far as CMG, I\u2019ll let Frank talk about.","Frank Mergenthaler","On the CMG side Peter the PR firms grew high single digits. The overall segment was relatively flat because we had a fairly large project in the UK from our experiential business that didn\u2019t repeat this year, it happens every three years. And that\u2019s a good example as Mike pointed out a lot of that was pass through revenue so when you look at the overall segment on a net basis growth was in the mid-single digits so it did very well in \u201914 and we\u2019re very confident that it did very well in \u201915.","Michael Roth","There is one other point and I think I have to bring up we have stated we do have a business called ORION which is the [barter] business. Frankly all of our competitors or most of them have [a barter] business. In that particular niche we do take inventory position, but it's not an inventory position, it\u2019s acting on behalf of our client with respect to that inventory which is why we don\u2019t gross that up either. So, yes, there is a part of our business that does have some -- it\u2019s not an equity but we do take inventory but it\u2019s on behalf of our client for a specific reason, so our [barter] business is a little bit different than the rest of our business and in fact it's a separate and distinct business, so I have to clarify that point.","Peter Stabler","And that's small, Michael.","Michael Roth","Yes, well it\u2019s -- when you say small, it\u2019s a profitable part of our business but its small compared to the overall media business.","Thank for the clarification both of you.","Operator","Thank you, our next question will be coming from the line of Mr. Tim Nolan from Macquarie Group, sir, your line is now open.","Tim Nolan","I'd like to continue on this topic of programmatic. You guys set out a number a year or two ago which I never really took as a realistic but more like a reach figure of doing somewhere toward half of totally buying on a programmatic basis in a few years' time. Your acquisition or your partnership with Samba TV seems to be a step in that direction, wonder if you could talk a little bit more about how you're moving toward programmatic buying in online video and then in more traditional media like TV and radio. Thanks.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Tim. We never said that 50% was going to be programmatic, it may be over a period of time but when we said 50% was going to be automation, and that's a little bit different than putting everything under the programmatic. ","Frankly our media business we're using cables and faxes so our main objective was moving towards automation. We do see a significant rise in programmatic but it is not at the levels of 50%. And we have been rolling that out on a global basis, because we think it is a very efficient and effective way to handle video certainly on the digital side of the business. ","So we are committed to it, Cadreon was one of the leaders in the business, we keep investing in Cadreon and talent and tools and as you point out we enter into all these agreements with various cable operators in fact radio now and our investment in Samba TV all of these things are related about having the right data to place the media dollars in the right place to reach the right people at an efficient way. And we believe that it should be -- automation should play an important part of it and programmatic falls within that automation.","Tim Nolan","Do you think traditional media owners will be willing to open up more of their inventory to programmatic buys?","Michael Roth","Well you know, what I did say and you're correct in remembering this I did say it's going to be difficult for TV, premium content on TV to be put into that fold because of you know the control of it and maybe arguably is not there and therefore it's hard for them to negotiate premiums. You know what the marketplace will determine whether that happens. And as it grows and as it becomes more efficient and as clients and media owners become more comfortable with it we may see it but we're not seeing it right now.","Tim Nolan","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you, our next question will be coming from the line of Mr. Dan Solomon from BMO Capital Market, sir your line is now open.","Dan Solomon","Frank, maybe could we start by just returning to the balance sheet with Publicis having acquired Sapient with Omnicom having used up their balance sheet capacity. If we look at your leverage you're back down to sort of the low end of where the group is, if you could maybe just update us on your thoughts on where you'd like to see target leverage head to you eventually. ","And then Michael just quickly on Brazil and Russia, could you cite the issue we were talking about earlier with Lowe, not an IPG specific issue, but those markets appear to be going through a little bit more than just a little economic blip right now. How are you thinking about them, how are clients thinking about them? Is there may be easing off the M&A pipeline in those markets, but I\u2019d be interested in your updated thoughts on the sort of the geopolitical macro issues there.","Michael Roth","I wish I can solve all of those problems. Let me take Brazil and Russia and comment a little bit about our balance sheet. First of all Russia, obviously the Russian markets are not the strongest right now, but recently -- I've actually had some direct conversations with our clients because frankly for years now we've been talking to our partner in Russia and in fact we've got some approval in Russia for us to do a transaction with respect to our partner on some of their properties there -- enabling us to have better control over the quality of the product with respect to our multinational clients in Russia and we\u2019re planning on going forward with that, that transaction. ","So you might say, gee in this environment why are you doing that in Russia, and the answer is our client still believes that Russia is an important market and consistent with that it's important for us to have the top talent and resources servicing those clients in Russia, so we're going forward with our transaction with ADV, I have to say it, it's at a cheaper price obviously in terms of both the movement of the currency as well as the economics in Russia and we took advantage of that but we are still moving forward and believe Russia is an important market and frankly it\u2019s a place that we still believe we have to be there to service our multinational clients. ","Brazil everyone knows is going to a difficult time right and there was a pullback and we saw it in our multinational larger global agencies down there. It was partially offset by other areas in Latin America that were positive, Mexico for example. But Brazil we\u2019re watching very carefully, we hope to return to growth in Brazil throughout the year but the benefit of being a multinational and global service provider that we are where one region becomes little difficult fortunately there are other regions that are strong, when I am particularly pleased to see the growth in India. We went through a period in India where the growth wasn't there during the elections and now that Modi is in place and things are happening we had double-digit growth almost double-digit growth in India. So I think that\u2019s a positive sign. And obviously China continues to grow for us at a double-digit rate. And of course we\u2019re very strong in U.S. ","So we\u2019re watching Brazil carefully, we still have top tier talent and our agencies down there are best-in-class, and as Brazil we will get through this. Look the growth of the middle-class in Brazil is a real and I think eventually and with all the event the Olympics and so on I think will see a snapback in Brazil once this all happens. ","On our balance sheet we've always said we wanted to be strong, have a strong balance sheet maybe that\u2019s part of the DNA of our company given the difficulties we had many years ago. And there might be a little room in our leverage right now and frankly [we were that] way to make sure that we get we finally get F&B over the finish line. And we will take a hard look in terms of our leverage and use as I said at the commercial paper market. And then maybe some opportunity for us in terms of buybacks, but if we make a business decision in terms of what we do with our cash, and that cash is decided either it goes to a reinvesting in our business whether it would be strategic acquisitions investments in talent or just overall investment in our businesses versus returning it to our shareholders and if we return it to our shareholders we will take a look at the mix between dividends and buybacks. And obviously we\u2019re very sensitive to the needs of our investors and in fact every investor meeting we have we ask them what their preference versus dividend versus buybacks and we listen to our investors and we respond accordingly. ","The good news is we will have the financial flexibility to do both, and what that mix is will be decided by the marketplace and the needs of our businesses. ","Operator","The next question will be coming from the line of Mr. James Dix from Wedbush Securities. Sir your line is now open. ","James Dix","Two questions, just first if you\u2019ve been hearing from some competitors that the level of pitch activity seems to be ticking up industry wide there is some [trade press] on some potentially big reviews coming up. Just any color you could give on the puts and takes where you see relative net opportunities versus where you might be defending maybe a little bit more business might be helpful. ","And then just second you\u2019ve given good color in terms of the margins in terms of where the leverage is coming from especially adjusting for things like pass-throughs. I guess just from a business perspective as you look across your agencies, are there certain things which you are seeing that's driving the leverage growth in terms of greater share of wallet from existing clients or just better utilization of personal or individual basis or just hitting more performance incentives across your contract. Just anything from a business perspective that you are seeing as you look across your agencies which is starting to kick in for you?","Michael Roth","All of the above. This is a very competitive environment right now. Now you did see the announcement of PNG for example they are anticipating cutting an agency fees if you will by a significant amount, clients overall and it's not new to the industry our clients are always looking for more for less and what we have to be able to do is twofold, one the most important thing is we have to show that we\u2019re adding value to what we are delivering, and therefore we have to be responsive to the effectiveness -- the creativity and effectiveness of the work we do. And then we have to be able to measure it and be accountable for it. ","So I think the pressure is much greater now given that these tools are out there for measurement to prove the return on investment with respect to marketing dollars. And we\u2019re in a position to be able to do that, and clients appropriately are asking to see that return on investment. And at the same time they are looking to have savings and be able to show that the effectiveness of what they are spending is greater and spending less also gives them a similar response rate. And frankly that\u2019s where we add value. ","If we can show that if you spend dollars in one place versus another and the one that\u2019s cheaper is as effective if not better then it's a win-win. We add value, we get paid for the value that we\u2019re adding, clients show effectiveness and market share and they spend less and that is going to be a dialog between us and our clients forever. And as these tools become sharper, as media plays more and more an important in terms of the integrated offering we have to have the best talent tools and resources and scale in order to be able to make that happen. And that\u2019s the dialog that\u2019s going on every day with our clients and frankly when I was a client that\u2019s what I would do and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. And we\u2019re being responsive for it and if you look at our organic growth that\u2019s a good indication that we\u2019re able to overcome and be able to have those conversations.","As far as pitches I think the big pitches that are out there are principally media. In every couple of years every multinational client looks at their media agencies and puts it through a pitch and a lot of these pitches are focusing on efficiencies which is exactly what I just said. And so you see Coca-Cola having a media pitch. You have Unilever having a media pitch. These are global clients L'Oreal is having a media pitch. These are global clients that not necessarily unhappy with the services that they\u2019re getting but they want to make sure they\u2019re optimizing the use of their media dollars in an efficient way and moving the needle and we\u2019re responsive, we have a good track record in those pitches and we expect to see that continue.","On the creative side, we do have a couple of big pitches coming up particularly contractual pitches, for example the army which is a mandatory review and the navy has a mandatory review both of which we\u2019ve been successful in retaining and obviously we hope to do the same moving forward. And on the other side, there are pitches out there of what we call opportunities because we aren\u2019t in those pitches, we aren\u2019t existing client relationships and this is an opportunity. For example Chrysler has a digital pitch out there and we\u2019re participating in that one.","So yes the marketplace is -- and by the way there are fair amount of pitches out there that aren\u2019t public and those are the ones where we have existing relationships where we\u2019re looking for a larger share of the wallet. So I think that bodes well for us frankly in the industry in that there are these opportunities where we can get to go head to head with our competitors and show where we add value. So it\u2019s a pretty exciting time.","Frank Mergenthaler","On the margin question the key thing around that is growth and converting that growth at an efficient rate. And that\u2019s the challenge for us because as Michael pointed out the growth has been driven by investment talent. We all focus on SRS so we need to invest and this is aligned with John\u2019s earlier question, we need to invest and that drives the growth and then we\u2019ve got to convert that at efficient rate and that\u2019ll improve the margin.","James Dix","Great, thanks very much.","Michael Roth","The key to our existing client relationships being important here because if you do look at our top 20 clients we do have a nice organic growth within those 20 clients and that tells us that the relationships are good, the products and services we\u2019re providing to those clients are working and they are viewed as partners to those clients.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will be coming from the line of Mr. Brian Wieser from Pivotal Research. Sir, your line is now open.","Brian Wieser","Two quick ones, just question at the quarter\u2019s working capital figure, I was wondering how much of the expansion of that number is due to business growth versus somewhat pressure on payments terms? ","And separately just a question on Europe, we\u2019re hearing I guess a lot of relatively positive comments on the region in general. I was wondering what your thoughts around whether or not it\u2019s turned the corner for the [indiscernible]?","Michael Roth","I\u2019ll let Frank talk about working capital. No one is raising a flag on Europe. We have -- obviously it\u2019s nice to have positive growth in Continental Europe. Certainly the number seems to indicate that from a growth perspective there seems to be some light at the end of the tunnel here and anecdotally seems to be stronger. I love what\u2019s happening in the UK is very strong market for us now and hopefully that will still over to the rest of Continental Europe. But for our planning purposes for the rest of the year, we haven\u2019t built into it a big recovery in Continental Europe. So to the extent that we continue to be successful in growth in Continental Europe that will bode well for us for the full year, but we\u2019re basically counting on to being flat up or down 1% and we\u2019ll see how that develops.","Frank Mergenthaler","And Brian on the working capital it\u2019s normal to seasonal flows you look at we have significant working capital cash generation in the fourth quarter and then we have outflows in the first quarter. And you look at the outflows this first quarter and take a look at Q4 \u201914 that correlation is pretty consistent with prior years, none of it relates to changing in terms, terms have been pretty consistent.","Brian Wieser","I just mean the Q1 this year versus the prior year\u2019s Q1s but it\u2019s nothing unusual.","Frank Mergenthaler","No if you look at Q1 versus the previous Q4 and they trade pretty much in a band if you look back over the past five or six years.","Michael Roth","At this point, I\u2019d like to thank you all for participating. As we said, we\u2019re very pleased with the quarter but we have three more quarters to go. Look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes this conference.

All parties are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion. This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jerome J. Leshne - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning. Thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com. This morning, we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 Eastern.","During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company. These are subject to the uncertainties in the cautionary statement that are included in our earnings release and the slide presentation, and further detailed in our 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.","We will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP measures, allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance.","At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jerry, and thank you for joining us this morning as we review our results for the third quarter and nine months of 2015. I'll start out by covering highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional detail, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies and the tone of our business, to be followed by Q&A.","We're pleased to report another quarter of strong organic revenue and profit growth. Organic revenue growth in our third quarter was 7.1%, on top of the very strong comps from the year ago. Net acquisitions had a positive impact of 10 basis points, while FX was a negative 5.9%. However, FX had very little impact on our operating margin. Total revenue growth was 1.3%.","We continue to see positive contributions to our top line performance from a broad range of our creative, media, and marketing services offerings.","Across the group, our digital capabilities were again significant drivers of growth. We also continue to drive strong growth in our largest regional markets with the U.S., Asia-Pac, and UK all showing very good advances. Organic growth in LatAm was also very strong in the quarter.","From the standpoint of client sectors, we saw growth across all client verticals. The best performance came in tech and telecom, financial services, food and beverage, and healthcare.","Our operating profit in the quarter was $192 million, an increase of 12% from the year ago. Q3 operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 10.3%. We had leverage on both our salaries and related, and office and general expenses.","Worth noting that below operating profit, other expenses in the quarter includes charges totaling $38 million to dispose of certain smaller business units, which were underperforming and which we deemed as non-strategic, all of which were outside the U.S. Most of the expense was non-cash. Frank will have more color in his comments.","The after tax expense was $0.09 per diluted share in the quarter and $0.08 for the nine months. Excluding the charge of the disposition, diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.27, an increase of 29% compared to the prior period.","Looking at the first nine months, organic revenue growth was 6.5%, on top of 5.9% a year ago. We posted a 17% increase to operating profit and a 34% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. This represents industry-leading organic revenue growth and profit growth. That's an accomplishment which all our people across the company can be proud of.","Turning back to a bit more detail on the quarter. U.S. organic growth was 7.1%, on top of 7.9% a year ago, which is an outstanding result. We had growth at most of our agencies, notably McCann, Mediabrands, FCB, Deutsche, R\/GA, Weber Shandwick and Golin.","International growth was 7.1%, once again driven by our full range of services. By regions, we were led by 14.4% growth in LatAm, where we saw increases in most national markets. Asia-Pac increased 7.2% organically, and was highlighted by our continuing strong trends in India and China.","In the UK, organic growth was 5.2%, on top of last year's 12% growth. We were led by the growth of R\/GA and our marketing services specialist at CMG. In Continental Europe, Q3 organic growth was essentially flat, and we continue to stay focused on improving our talent and capabilities in this region.","The first nine months, 6.5% organic growth reflected growth in every region of the world, and contributions across all major disciplines. Nine months operating margin growth was 100 basis points, with leverage on our base payroll, benefits and tax and on office and general expenses.","As we said previously, supporting our best-in-class offerings, as well as cost discipline and margin enhancement continue to be our top priorities, and we are successfully executing against those objectives.","With respect to share repurchase, during Q3, we used $70 million to repurchase 3.6 million shares. Through nine months, we've utilized approximately $172 million of share repurchases, and we have $271 million remaining on our authorization as of September 30.","Since instituting our return of capital programs in 2011, we have returned $2.3 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases, as well as reduced our dilutive share count by 26%.","In sum, our performance in the quarter and year-to-date continues to demonstrate industry leadership in the strong position of our offerings. Heading into our important fourth quarter, economic conditions in some areas of the world will present macro headwinds and uncertainties. While those have been incorporated into our outlook, the overall tone of business nonetheless remains solid and we continue to effectively manage expenses.","Previously, we increased our full year 2015 organic growth target to 4% to 5%. Our strong performance through nine months has us on track to exceed 5%. We also remain well positioned to achieve 100 basis points of margin expansion this year, the high-end of our targeted range.","With that overview, I'll turn it to Frank for additional detail on our results, and I'll join you after his remarks for an update on our operating units, to be followed by Q&A.","Frank Mergenthaler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Michael. Good morning. As a reminder, I'll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast.","On slide 2, you see a summary of our results. Organic growth was 7.1% in the third quarter, evenly balanced between the U.S. and International. In our first nine months, organic revenue growth was 6.5%.","Q3 operating profit was $192 million, an increase of 12%. For the first nine months, operating profit grew 17%. Q3 margin of 10.3% improved 100 basis points, and our margin for the nine months also improved 100 basis points.","We had a below-the-line charge of $38 million for the disposition of selected non-U.S. business units. Most of the charge is the balance sheet write-off of currency translation adjustments built up over the years with the balance representing the net assets of the disposed businesses. This pertains to a handful of business for which revenue was small, with non-cash translation adjustments magnified by large FX changes over the years.","The impact of this charge to reported diluted EPS was $0.09 for the quarter. Excluding the charge, diluted EPS was $0.27, which compares to Q3 2014 at $0.21, a 29% increase. Q3 fully diluted shares decreased 3% from last year due to our share repurchase program.","Turning to slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. I've already covered the disposition-related charges and other expenses.","Slide 4 has more detail on our revenue growth. Revenue was $1.87 billion in the quarter, an increase of 1.3%. Compared to Q3 2014, the impact of the changing currency exchange rates was a negative 5.9%, with the dollar significantly stronger in all regions of the world. Acquisitions added 10 basis points to revenue. The resulting organic revenue increase was 7.1%.","As you can see on the bottom half of this slide, at our Integrated Agency Networks the organic increase was 8%. This was led by our global integrated offerings at McCann and FCB, by Mediabrands, Deutsch and by R\/GA. IAN's growth was 7.5% over the first nine months.","At our CMG segment, Q3 organic growth was 3.7%. We continue to have very strong growth at our PR agencies, notably Weber Shandwick and Golin which grew at double-digit rates. Organic growth was 2.5% at CMG for the first nine months but was mid-single digit increase excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenues.","Moving on to slide five, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q3 organic growth was outstanding at 7.1% with contributions coming from a very broad cross-section of agencies, disciplines, and client sectors. For the nine months organic growth was 7%.","In the UK, Q3 organic growth was 5.2% on top of 12.2% last year. We had notably strong performance at R\/GA, McCann, Octagon and Weber Shandwick. For the nine months organic growth was 6.5%.","Continental Europe was essentially flat organically in Q3. Our largest markets in the continent were mixed, with Spain up organically, Italy and France flat, and Germany down.","In Asia-Pac, our largest international region, Q3 organic growth was 7.2%, propelled by strong growth in China and India. Growth for the nine months was 8.4%, a performance that speaks to the strength of our positioning across our global integrated agencies, our media business, our digital specialists, and our public relations offerings.","In LatAm, our organic increase was 14.4% in the quarter. We continue to see very strong performance in most national markets such as Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia, which is consistent with the first half of the year. We also had improved quarter in Brazil, although business conditions generally remain challenging there. In the quarter, we had leading contributions to growth in the region by McCann, Mediabrands, R\/GA, and Huge.","Our Other Markets group, which is made up of Canada and the Middle East and Africa, grew 13.5% organically in the quarter due chiefly to strong performance in the Middle East as well as growth in Canada.","On slide six, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 6%.","Moving on to slide seven, our operating expenses. In the third quarter, total operating expenses increased 20 basis points from a year ago compared with our reported revenue growth of 1.3%. As a result, margin expanded 100 basis points.","Underneath that performance, our ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue in the quarter was 64.4% this year, an improvement of 50 basis points from a year ago. We had 50 basis points of leverage in our base payroll, benefits and tax expense, as well as 20 basis points on temporary labor. Our accrual for incentives increased by 40 basis points as a percent of revenue, driven by our strong operating performance.","Total head count at quarter end was approximately 48,700, an increase of 3.2% year-on-year. The increase chiefly reflects organic hiring in support of growth in areas such as digital, creative, healthcare and PR, as well as regionally in the U.S., UK and Asia-Pac.","Turning to office and general expenses on the lower half of this slide, O&G expense was 25.3% of Q3 revenue compared with 25.8% a year ago, an improvement of 50 basis points. Our improvement was driven by leverage on expenses for occupancy, travel, office supplies and telecom and all other O&G expense.","On slide eight, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 11.1%.","Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on slide nine, we ended the third quarter with $881 million cash and short-term marketable securities. Comparison to December 31 reflects our cash level is seasonal and tends to peak at year-end.","On slide 10, we turn to our third quarter cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $281 million compared with $176 million a year ago. Working capital was a source of $154 million this year compared with the use of $11 million in Q3 2014. Investing activities used $41 million in the quarter primarily for CapEx. Financing activities used $151 million mainly in capital return to shareholders, $70 million for share repurchases, and $48 million for common stock dividends. Our net increase in cash and cash equivalents for the quarter was $26 million.","On slide 11, we showed debt deleveraging from a peak of $2.35 billion in 2007 to $1.75 billion at the most recent quarter end.","In summary, on slide 12, the quarter and the year-to-date represents very solid performance and progress for meeting our financial objectives for the full year. We are seeing growth in areas where we have focused our investment on both people and acquisitions. Our operators are focused on the appropriate cost discipline and margin expansion, and our balance sheet is an important area that we continue to deploy for value, going forward.","With that said, let me turn it back to Michael.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Frank. It's worth repeating that we're pleased to continue reporting strong results. In terms of organic revenue growth and margin progress, Q3 continues to make us a leader in our peer group. Contributions came from across the portfolio in terms of agencies, geography, client categories, all fueled by the outstanding creativity, insights and digital capabilities that we have throughout Interpublic.","Our success is a reflection of the strength of our offerings and our client-centric focus. Ultimately, it is driven by the caliber of our people. Across the group, we continue to see evidence that Interpublic and our agencies are consistently a first choice for the industry's best talent.","For some time, talent has been a top strategic priority for us, one that has fueled our return to levels of organic growth that are fully competitive or better. We are proud that our culture has become a differentiator for us, and has our longstanding commitment to diversity and inclusion, where we have a strong and established track record as the leader in our space.","On our call last quarter, we drilled down and provided greater focus on the role digital expertise is playing in all of our work we do for our clients from advertising to media and marketing services. We pointed out that unlike others in our space, IPG digital capabilities have been largely grown organically and are embedded within every one of our disciplines. This commitment to incubating new skills, developing new products and services and investing in new technology has allowed us to stay highly relevant in today's digital world. It gives us confidence that our offerings are forward facing, competitive and increasingly vital to clients as they seek to navigate the complexity of media and marketing landscape.","Operationally, it's clear that we continue to be disciplined in terms of cost management. We remain focused on converting at the appropriate levels to deliver 100 basis points of margin improvement for the year. We also remain committed to robust capital return programs that have been driving further value creation for our shareholders.","As we look to the fourth quarter, the tone of the business is solid. Clients are being measured in their approach but the year-end period will be key to delivering for all marketers and they are relying on partners that have the tools, insights and capabilities to connect with the consumers across channels and drive desired business outcomes.","We remain cautious on Europe, although our plans did not factor in growth in that region. The Brazilian and Chinese economies have been challenged although our operations in those regions continue to deliver results.","The new business pipeline is solid. Year-to-date, we continue to be net new business positive and in fact, near the top of the new business league tables. The significant number of media pitches continue, and it bears noting that we've been performing well to-date with a number of headline wins, notably UM's win of the Coca-Cola media review, J&J's U.S. media buying and planning accounts, as well as CVS and McCormick, which was won in collaboration with R\/GA.","Those are a reflection of the cutting-edge offerings we have within Mediabrands in terms of strategic media thinkers, outstanding digital and data platforms and the scale and expertise to deliver buying efficiency to some of the world's largest and most demanding clients.","An additional point that is worth repeating when it comes to emerging media is that we do not take ownership of digital media for resale to clients. So our strong organic growth does not reflect the growth of digital media arbitrage revenue that you're seeing among some of our peers. We take principal positions and resell owned inventory to clients at a margin.","We continue to believe that our role as an agnostic consultant is key and allows us to provide clients with the recommendations and services that are best for their business. We also remain committed to the highest standard of transparency, an area in which we've been a leader for some time. This continues to gain in importance as the world of digital media is beset by challenges surrounding viewability and other issues that make it imperative that we serve as wholly objective partners to our clients.","McCann continues to post strong performance, with outstanding creative work on its major multinationals and notable local market wins in the UK, Australia and India. We're seeing great collaboration within Worldgroup, and this cross-selling and integration is helping them win new accounts as well as increase their share of wallet with existing clients.","The digital and healthcare units within McCann had strong performance. In the healthcare space, it was good to see that McCann Health and FCB Health led us to outstanding performance at the Medical Marketing and Media competition, where we bested the other holding companies in terms of awards won.","Progress at FCB continues. The agency is consistently appearing on pitch lists with notable recent wins with Lincoln Financial by the New York office, BMO Harris Bank by the Toronto Office, new work from Coke at FCB in South Africa, and strong momentum at Inferno FCB in London. FCB Health remains a powerhouse in its field; and the agency's shopper marketing operation, FCB\/RED is also a very strong resource.","At CMG, our award-wining public relations Weber Shandwick and Golin continue to gain market share. Beyond digital, where both firms have been in the forefront of their discipline, they are also moving into content marketing and upstream to more strategic and integrated opportunities. We are well-positioned here and we are also seeing good progress from our sports and entertainment and experiential businesses, as well as continuing improvement in the branding sector.","Focus on Mullen Lowe during the quarter was squarely on merger integration and setting the stage for a successful 2016 and beyond. The agency's senior global leadership recently met to decide on and articulate the network's market position, strategy, and brand identity. This will include both agencies' long-standing commitment to creative excellence, Mullen's contemporary hyperbundled approach and Lowe's deep knowledge of dynamic international markets. It's a combination that's working for many leading clients, including Unilever, and we look forward to seeing it build positive momentum in the marketplace.","Our U.S. independents continue to be a source of strength for Interpublic. Deutsch is an example of the benefits of combining big, creative ideas, with a fully-integrated suite of digital capabilities. The Markham Agency, Hill Holliday and Carmichael Lynch are other agencies that deliver with this model and provide us with a range of options that can meet the needs of domestic clients.","In terms of digital, our offerings are consistently outstanding, whether it be our social media capabilities at Weber and Golin, Cadreon and AMP within Mediabrands, or the integrated digital capabilities at all of our brand agencies. MRM is a top-tier digital network, and the close collaboration we have seen between them and McCann is elevating the overall Worldgroup offering, just as the integration of Profero and Mediahub are significantly strengthening Mullen Lowe's go-to-market positioning.","We're also fortunate to have R\/GA, the undisputed leader in digital and technology-enabled marketing. They continue to win business and awards, as well as innovate with programs, such as the R\/GA Accelerators, that give us a line of sight into terrific startups with ideas and technology that will play a role in shaping the future of communications and consumer experience.","Our current Accelerator is taking place in Los Angeles, in collaboration with the LA Dodgers, and the participating companies span every aspect of connected sport, from athlete training to venue management to new social channels on which consumers can share their passion for sports.","Huge is another digital specialist that has performed exceptionally well for us. Beyond its industry-leading strategic consulting, design and UX practices, the agency recently made news when it opened a coffee shop in its Atlanta office to serve as a real-time lab in which we will develop and test digital retail innovations for both current and prospective clients.","For us at Interpublic, the new business of advertising means that we encourage ambitious change across the entire organization. By providing access to emerging and transformative technologies, we develop programs that help us attract talent and create work that puts the user experience first, all in the service of our clients.","Looking to the balance of this year, we stay vigilant on cost so as to ensure that we can deliver on our margin commitment. There are geographic markets that we will need to monitor, but performance for the first nine months has been very strong and positions us well for a strong close to the full year.","As mentioned in my initial remarks, we believe that, given our performance to-date, the appropriate organic revenue growth targets in the new year is in excess of 5%, and that we are on track to deliver 100 basis points of operating margin improvement at the end of our initial target for the year \u2013 at the high end of our initial target.","Moving forward, we're therefore closer to achieving our previously stated goal of 13%. Combined with our company's financial strength and robust return of capital, which have been and will continue to be a source of significant value creation, this will allow us to further enhance shareholder value.","With that, I'd like to thank you for your time and continued support, and open the call up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. My first question, I guess, for Michael. You continue to show such impressive organic revenue growth with some of the highest organic growth this quarter I think I can remember maybe in several years now, I guess, and even on difficult comps. I guess can you provide a bit more color on what's causing this incremental change? Is it that more of your agencies are doing very well? Is it that you've got tailwind from one of the new businesses you've won? Is it the overall macro environment? Is it client budgets? I guess, any color that can sort of point to what's getting you even incrementally stronger in organic growth.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Alexia. All of the above. Look, none of this is by accident. We started on this journey by clearly investing in talent. And I think what you're seeing right now is the fact that the talent that we've embedded within all our organizations is really shining in terms of what clients are looking for in terms of moving the needle with their business. But creative talent and overall talent needs tools and resources within the organization to make sure we can deliver on that. So we've invested in all these tools and resources throughout the company.","And finally, we really are a client-centric environment. And so everyone is focusing on the needs of the clients. And therefore, we're focusing on what we can bring to the resources within IPG to the client to meet those needs. We're seeing success in our open architecture model, where if you look at the business wins, all of our agencies are aware of the fact that if their particular disciplines need other resources from IPG, they raise their hand and we bring the additional IPG resources to the table. And frankly, we're getting a reputation in the marketplace appropriately that we do this very well, and we really focus on the needs of the clients versus our own silos. And I think the new business wins that we're seeing, as well as the embedded growth we're seeing in our existing client base, really is indicative of the fact that all the IPG resources are available to move the needle with our client and we're executing against that. But in the end, it takes people and belief by those people that they have a huge resource base behind them.","And the other thing which I particularly like is when I participate in a lot of these pitches, what we see in the room are cross disciplines either from within the agencies or outside IPG and it's not uncommon for the client to come up to me and say I didn't even realize which individuals were from which discipline, and that's really what clients are looking for in their resources. So I'm particularly proud of all our agencies, whether it be our traditional agencies, our digital agencies, our marketing services, PR, I mean, across the board we're all doing quite well.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And just a follow-up if I can on profitability. I know you don't discuss margins necessarily by region but maybe you can talk just generally. You've seen a long period now where you've seen a lot more stability in your European operations. Are you seeing maybe better profitability in that area now that you've seen stability for a while, or markets such as Germany, which are still weak, really pulling it down for you?","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, clearly, we're seeing better profitability. That doesn't mean better is where we want to be. I mean, it's always been a challenge for profitability in Europe for us. We've taken a lot of actions. We've repositioned assets. We brought in new management. We've reduced layers of people and it's a very competitive market, and it's great to see us on the positive side for the nine months. As I said in my remarks, we are not counting on a big recovery. But the profitability side of it is moving forward but it's still not at the levels we want it to be. So we've got more work to do in Continental Europe, but we've made great strides towards that.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of John Janedis of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. Michael, there's been a lot of talk in the market recently about the viability of the agency model and offerings. And with all the recent pitches, have you seen a change in the groups you're competing against? And for the business you've won, are there pieces of the business that you would typically work on that went to maybe non-traditional players?","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, yeah. The viability of the models, you know, it's funny. I gave a talk at IAB and I put up my favorite slide, which is a quote that says the agency business is going to be disintermediated and is basically doomed and then I go to the next slide and it's a quote in 1975.","So, I mean, there are always people out there saying that the competitors and there are other disciplines, whether it be ad tech or smaller agencies. In the end, we have the resources and capabilities that can compete with any resource out there.","And, frankly, when we don't have it, yes, we use outside parties. We work well with them. It's incumbent upon us to know what we do well and what we don't do well. And that's what this whole concept of open architecture is all about, John, and that is we're looking at the client first and if we don't have a resource internally, and when I say internally I mean within IPG, it's not uncommon for us to use outside resources to help us.","And frankly, that's what shows clients that we're thinking of them versus ourselves. And, yeah, we end up dealing with non-traditional people, whether it be on the ad tech side. Even in some of the production, we don't like it, but even some of the production facilities that clients request us to use, we have to be in a world now where collaboration works and the collaboration starts with us. And if it's not within our organization, we have to be able to collaborate with other parties that clients are happy with.","So, we're able to do all of that and sometimes working with the third parties turns out to be a lot smoother than sometimes working with ourselves, which is shame on us, but that's the reality of the world out there.","So, the world is changing, and our model has to change with this. And I think that's one of the things you're seeing why we're being successful in that we're not wedded to the silo mentality of the past. We have to collaborate. We have to collaborate within IPG and we have to collaborate outside of IPG with other parties.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just separately, as you mentioned, you picked up some good wins since your last call and also year-to-date. Can you update us on any potential tailwinds on organic as they roll in, maybe for either the balance of the year or into next year?","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I said we're net new business positive. So, by definition, if we're net new business positive, we're going to move into the year with tailwinds. But we still have the fourth quarter to go. The fourth quarter is our biggest quarter. It's project based, so we're waiting to see how that comes in. We have a number of reviews still out there. It's unlikely that those reviews will impact 2015. So, it will affect 2016 numbers, and we're cautiously optimistic on those reviews that we had. The fact that we've been successful on the media reviews, in particular, obviously we're feeling comfortable going into the finals of some of the media pitches that are out there but you never know with these pitches, but we're very comfortable with how we're positioned in them. So, if we're successful with those or at least some of those, we'll certainly go into 2016 with tailwinds.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Thanks so much.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of David Bank of the RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks. First off, Michael, whatever is in the Kool-Aid over there, you can feel free to sprinkle it on the rest of S&P 500 and we'll be as much happier than we're currently feeling.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're beginning to feel a little bit like Dan Murphy but...","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes, you are seeing the ball really well right now.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Exactly, David. Thank you.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets LLC","But on a more serious note, I guess, so I think \u2013 as a bit of a follow-up to a couple of other questions before, but it's early days, lots of headlines but early days on some longer-term changes that I think we, as outsiders, are trying to understand about how the business is changing, programmatically, for instance, right? And we look at these things and we see things that appear to be able to be done mechanically more efficiently and we kind of worry that maybe that takes some value out of the chain that you'll be paid for.","And I think on the flip side, we can see \u2013 so we see headlines about that. What we don't often see headlines about are what is the traction that you're getting on your skill set in helping clients leverage off these mechanical solutions, right? Like, what is the counterbalance to growing fees, on integrating these third party and your own-party products, and frankly, just helping clients navigate how to use these mechanical solutions? Can you talk about how you're seeing that so far? Is there a financial impact yet? How do you help us understand it?","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think the key to making a success out of that, there's no question that there's a trend there, and we can discuss all sorts of reasons why that trend is there. But our job is to work with our clients, okay? It's interesting. I was just talking to our folks on a pitch that we just had this week. And there, we had a presentation on Cadreon and programmatic. Obviously, that's a very strong asset of IPG. It's growing tremendously both in the marketplace and competitively and yet the client is considering taking that inside. So, as part of the pitch, we present ideas, and our people from Cadreon present what we're doing, and you see the client sitting there saying, oh my goodness. How come we didn't think of that? How come we didn't think of this? So, yeah, we work with our clients who are intending to bring some of it inside.","In the end, we act as integrators, okay? I mean, our job \u2013 and I've always said this, confusion is good for us and the reason it's good for us is we get paid to help make sense out of all of this. And if clients are looking to us to help them do this, we have to be able to respond and if it means helping them bring it inside, that's okay but they're still going to need the current thinking and the investments that we make in these tools that clients just aren't in a position to make. And, frankly, the talent that we're able to recruit in that environment is so different than to the talent that you can recruit internally on a siloed basis.","So, yeah, clients are bringing it in. It's not a threat, it's just another tool that clients have that they want us to work with in the overall integrated offering, and we have to be able to do that. The history of our industry is when clients bring things internally, a lot of times it comes back. And the reason for it is the ability to recruit talent as well as to keep investing in the tools and resources that you need to be current.","So, yeah, it's a phenomenon. There's no question about it and clients are trying to do it internally but I think they'll find in the long-term that we still have a role to play here in helping them accomplish what they're looking for, but at the same time, using the tools and resources that we have that they're not capable of developing. So we don't fight it; we actually help them do it.","Again, that's one piece of the puzzle. I mean, again, if there's a relationship with the client, it has to be broad and it has to be seen as that we're in a partnership with the client. And we have all these different resources that we bring to the table. And if the client feels comfortable asking us to help them, we don't view it as them taking business away from us; it's part of what our role is, and we have to build it into our model. But it's a reality \u2013 but it's been a reality for years in this industry and it just changes different forms.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, David.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Actually, I want to follow on yet again on John and David questions here, Michael. So, with regard to the reviews, we see headlines out there sometimes from large clients suggesting that they are going to use the review process to drive down their aggregate fees, right? Just wondering if you could comment on that, the idea that coming out of this process as the dust settles, that the total fee envelope available to all of you, guys, is smaller.","And, I guess, the other piece of this that doesn't get talked about as much is the situations where the scope of work actually expands. So wondering if you could talk a little bit about the first part, and then what kind of expansion might you see as you get into these reviews where, who knows, fees could actually go up? Thanks very much.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, yeah, no. I mean, look, any review that takes place clearly has a view towards what they call efficiency. Efficiencies, obviously, means fee reductions. And clients, for generations, have been looking for more for less. So it's something we're very much used to, and it puts the burden on us to be more efficient, but yet we have to be able to meet the needs of the clients.","And yeah, that presents problems in terms of us maintaining margin. But, again, remember, this is only one piece of the puzzle. When we talk about margins, it's aggregate margins in all the different disciplines and resources. And, sure, on some basic contract work that we have in scope, margins may be a little bit less than they may have been before.","But in the end, it's our opportunity, and clients expect it for us to be able to bring in new ideas that help them move the needle, and that's what is called \u2013 known as out-of-scope work. And out-of-scope work is something that typically we get higher margins on. That's the way our business works. And clients know that. But first, they have to start with a line in the sand. So these reviews establish a line in the sand in terms of scope of work and fees that'll be available. And we have to work within that model. And it's incumbent upon us to make sure that the additional work that we do and clients understand that if it's out-of-scope, they have to pay for it, and we typically make better margins on the out-of-scope work. That's not a secret in our industry. And clients know it.","And the other part of it is this is a value-based environment. And if we can show that we're moving the needle and clients value the type of the ideas that we're bringing to them and the fact that it's in fact proving the results that we believe it can do, clients have incentive fees with us, there are performance-based contracts that we have on \u2013 particularly on the media side of the business. So there are vehicles that we have to develop opportunities for us to enhance margins. And that's the way the business is.","And so we don't view procurement as a bad word. We don't view these reviews as necessarily being only with a view towards fee reductions. The other reason these reviews are taking place is because they want to see if they're getting best-in-class offerings. And frankly, if I was a client, I'd be asking the same thing. So we approach these reviews, even when we're incumbents as an opportunity to show clients and future clients what we can bring to the table, what resources we have, and how we can work differently with them to move the needle.","What's interesting is the incumbents usually start out as why haven't you brought this to us before? So, therefore, if you look at the history of reviews, incumbents generally don't do well. But when you really drill down on it, incumbents have been dealing within a certain playbook both with the client and ourselves. These reviews open up a different playbook. And that means there's got to be change both on the client's side as well as our side. And I see that's what's happening in a number of these reviews. Clients are recognizing that their approach isn't necessarily the right approach and they're willing to think of a different approach that we can bring to the table, and that means opportunity. Every time we get to work with our clients and show what we can do, it presents opportunities for us across the board. So that's how we approach it.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. I guess I have to be the guy, Michael, to ask about the ANA stuff. So...","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Oh shucks. I thought I was going through a call without you, Ben.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I'll take the bullet. But...","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","It was announced yesterday and generally what we thought was going to happen from where you sit when you look at who they've hired and everything you know about the process, do you expect any impact on Interpublic Group or what, from your perspective, should we be looking for from this process, if anything?","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's not a surprise to anybody. So I don't know why people all of a sudden are shocked and so on. The ANA has been talking about this. The 4A's has been talking about it. Everybody's been talking about it. So the fact that the ANA hired two firms to do it to help them with it is not a surprise to us at all. Obviously, we've dealt with these firms before, not so much to call as much as the other one.","But we've been talking about transparency. It started with us frankly 10 years ago, maybe it's 11 years now, time flies when you're having a good time, on this whole issue of rebates and so this is nothing that we're afraid of. We've been very clear on rebate issues for 10 years now. It's in all our contracts. We welcome \u2013 in fact, in all these reviews, we have audit capabilities from our clients to come in and review this. So this isn't new for us. And as part of the verification and audit that we have within our own systems, clients are welcome to come in and, in fact, we do share with them results from that and one of the firms that's doing this actually we worked with in the past. So this isn't really nothing new for our industry.","Any type of review like this, everyone raises questions of what they're going to find. It's unfortunate that the headlines particularly in Europe have made it look like this is a criminal investigation. Last I looked ANA doesn't have the ability to subpoena. If you read these headlines, you would think that that's what was going on. That's not what's going on. It's a look into the practices within an industry. That's nothing new. This is an industry organization making sure that their constituents are comfortable what's going on in the practice, and we've been dealing with this all along.","So from an IPG perspective, we're very comfortable on rebate transparency. We're very comfortable on contractual transparency. We have it in all our contracts, and verification and review was part of our process. So there's nothing in any of that that concerns us.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on the digital buying front, which I know is a part of your business, not all of your business, but one that gets a lot of focus. What you've done with Cadreon, can you talk about how much you've been able to get all your different agencies to leverage that platform when they buy media?","Or do you still have certain pockets of your organization that are doing it on their own? It seems like a pretty complex organizational challenge to have sort of this centralized platform. But I'm imagining, as you go through these reviews, it's just a huge part of the conversation. So maybe if you could just talk about from a management perspective how you guys are set up and how it's working?","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, look, the key to this is obviously our multinational clients that go through Mediabrands, they're clearly using Cadreon. And that's part of their business model.","We have a number of agencies that do their own buying, that have their own capabilities, and that's fine. But, frankly, from a business management point of view, we always argue. Whenever we have the operating reviews of our businesses, and they talk about it, they all think they have a better model. And if their better model is working, that's terrific. But it seems that the efficiencies that can be gotten by dealing with a Mediabrands platform in terms of current thinking and resources just is compelling. And, frankly, I wish some of our agencies would use it more, but certainly the bulk of our media buying is going through that.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then I just \u2013 go ahead.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","There's always opportunities for more, but clearly the bulk of it is going through Cadreon.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just one last one for Frank, totally different topic. I think you guys had in the last year about $1.3 billion of NOLs. And I think a lot of that stuff is overseas. As you guys create more profitability, particularly in Europe, can you access those more rapidly which, of course, increases the value of those NOLs? Just any color on kind of how we think about cash taxes as the business continues to do so well.","Frank Mergenthaler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You're right, Ben. Most of the NOLs are in Europe for the most part. So, the increased profitability in Europe is helpful in accessing those NOLs. Our cash tax rate this year, we're seeing to meet 27%, 28%. It was high teens to low 20s% for the last three years, but we've burned through all of our U.S. NOLs where a lot of our profitability is.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'll weigh in a little bit on that, Frank.","Frank Mergenthaler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I am a tax guy. Some of these...","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Apologize for not directing it to the right guy.","Frank Mergenthaler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","He's on a roll, Ben. Keep going.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Some of these NOLs in these countries are country-centric. It's not just Europe, okay.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, the additional challenge is generating profitability within those countries. And obviously we get involved in tax planning in terms of where revenue is being generated. So that's why we have a great tax department who's responsible for making sure that our contracts are reflecting that. And we are what we call optimizing using our NOLs and we are very focused on doing that.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Dan Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Michael, could you talk a little bit about the hiring of Simon Bond? I know he was the big new business champion over at BBDO. I'm just curious about the role being at the holding company level. Is it largely still focused on new business? Or is there a little bit more responsibility around coordinating amongst the agencies a little bit? Thinking of your comments earlier about the success of sort of an open architecture. Is it to help facilitate that a little bit as well, too?","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, absolutely. Look, we already have some very talented people within IPG who work on these multinational open-architecture client situations where they're working with the units themselves, whether it be FCB, whether it be McCann, whether it be Lowe. And it's their responsibility to work with the people within these agencies to make sure that the needs of the clients are being met with all the resources of IPG.","We were fortunate to have an opportunity to recruit Simon to our organization. And clearly his responsibility will be both on the new business side but also on these open-architecture pitches. More and more, these RFPs are coming into the holding company.","They're coming directly to me actually, which is why I have to look at my emails every day, but it really comes in to the holding company. And they are saying you tell us which is the best way you want to approach this RFP. So someone like Simon with his vast experience in new business and client focus and frankly his knowledge of the consulting industry and the relationships he has is a tremendous asset for us. And frankly Simon has already been involved with a number of our agencies' pitches that are going on right now. And he's a resource, and we're from the home office and we're here to help.","And some of our agencies have already tapped in to Simon to help them in terms of their pitch. You know he is fantastic in terms of new business pitches, and he has actually gone in and helped these agencies. And frankly, we had a couple of wins that he helped in terms of the presentations.","So, the fact that we were able to recruit Simon is an indication to me that this whole notion of open architecture is one that is resonating in the industry and our reputation for being a holding company that collaborates with all the agencies within the holding company is real and I think his presence along with the other individuals within IPG, whether it be Peter or Terry, they all work very closely with our agencies and they know that they are there to be helpful to our agencies. The pitches themselves are coming in different forms and we have to be able to respond and the needs of the clients.","Dan Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Did Simon ask you to raise that question?","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Tim Nollen from Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Tim W. Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just taking a very high level view, IPG has come a long, long, long way since you've both been there. And it seems to me, if I may be so bold, you're probably in what I would say the eighth inning of your recovery or maybe in the top of the ninth. Correct me if you think that's too optimistic. You do have some margin to recover yet.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Tim W. Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","You've seen still some relatively high salary and service numbers. You mentioned Europe requiring some work to get back to more, better profitability. I just wonder with all this put together, what do you think are the last steps that need to be taken to really get you to that 13% target or just how do you think about really getting through that final hurdle, if that's the right way to think about it?","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we're constantly thinking about how to get through that hurdle because that's obviously a main objective for all of us. We are well on our way and you're right. I call it the eighth, ninth inning, whatever you want, we're making great progress, and it's clearly within our sights to accomplish that. So, we're feeling pretty positive about that. Look, we are a variable cost model. Our biggest variable cost is SRS. It's not a secret. We said, what we have to do is focus on that, and you can focus on that by generating revenue, which is what we've been doing and keeping an eye on the cost pressures in the SRS.","So, we've done a great job on O&G and that's showing the improvement even in the third quarter and we see an improvement there. We've seen leverage. We've seen at least 50 basis points. And if it worked through the pass-throughs, it's really 80 basis points this quarter in terms of leverage on SRS. So, we're very focused on it, and we just have to continue to do that. And we see that there's still opportunity to do it and that's how we're going to get there.","Frank Mergenthaler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Tim, it's probably more agency-specific now than it is IPG specific. So, as we look to the last inning or inning and a half, it's getting those certain agencies that aren't where they need to be profitability-wise to cross the goal line.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And let's face it, we use incentives within \u2013 our agency goals are focused on margin improvement and they know that the best way to get margin improvement is to keep an eye on their SRS ratio. So, it's both monitored, as Frank said, from the agency as well as from our reviews at the holding company.","So, this isn't rocket sciences business, and we're very comfortable in our ability to manage that. I think we've proven that we know how to manage that. We can do this, and I've said this before, we can get there tomorrow. But a part of this is making sure we have the talents and resources to generate growth.","So, on a longer-term basis, had we not had the talents and resources that we had within all our different agencies, we wouldn't be delivering the results that you're seeing right now. So, if we starve the pipeline of people and got our SRS ratios in line quicker, yeah, we may achieve our goal, but our long-term viability would be adversely affected. I kind of like the way we're doing it now. If you're looking at 80 basis point to 100 basis point margin improvement, that clips along the way we're going to get there. We just don't \u2013 we're not going to get there tomorrow. And it would be silly for us to shoot ourselves in the foot and do something dramatic that would get us there.","Just look at the write-off that we're having. We're focusing on unprofitable businesses that are in geographic locations that aren't necessary, that are a drag on our P&L and so this time, the $38 million, it's four to five locations, in areas that we don't have to be. They were dilutive. And we either sold them or closed them. And that's how we get there. We're constantly looking at those types of opportunities.","Tim W. Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","No, I wasn't at all suggesting you should accelerate the process and get to 13% tomorrow. It's more to say, a 100 basis points margin improvement this year is great. If the market holds and you do well, and you have new account wins, maybe that's a similar target for next year and then you're getting there already. I just wonder \u2013 and I think you've answered you've done a lot of work with your individual agencies over the years. Is it really just a matter of, like, finding some last bits to clear out, win some business having the scale and just letting the operating leverage take over, is that the way to think of it?","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I mean, that's it. It's like everything else's execution. And we \u2013 with the changes we've made across all the networks in both people and structure, we put them all in and Lowe together, this past year, I'm very comfortable with our leadership across the board.","We've brought Henry in to run Mediabrands; Alex to run Lowe Mullen. And, obviously, Harris and Carter are doing great jobs. So, I'm very comfortable with our leadership and very confident that we'll get to our objectives.","Tim W. Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yes. Great job. Thanks very much.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We do not have further questions on queue. Speakers, you may proceed.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I thank you all for participating. I look forward to our next call, which will report our year-end results. Have a great holidays. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time."],"11824":["Interpublic Group of Cos., Inc.

All parties are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion. This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jerome J. Leshne - Interpublic Group of Cos., Inc.","Good morning. Thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com. This morning, we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 AM Eastern.","During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company. These are subject to the uncertainties in the cautionary statement that is included in our earnings release and the slide presentation and further detailed in our 10-K and other filings with the SEC. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP measures, allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance.","At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael Isor Roth - Interpublic Group of Cos., Inc.","Thank you, Jerry, and thank you for joining us this morning as we review our results for the fourth quarter and 2016. As usual, I'll start out by covering the highlights of our performance as well as our outlook for the new year. Frank will then provide additional details and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies to be followed by our Q&A.","We're once again pleased to report strong performance for both the fourth quarter and full year. Among our financial highlights, organic revenue growth was 5.3% in the quarter, bringing full year organic growth to 5%, the top of range to which we had raised our growth target. In the fourth quarter, U.S. organic growth was 3.3% and was a very strong 4.7% excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenues.","We grew organically in every region of the world during the quarter as well as the full year with very broad participation across all our agencies, disciplines and client sectors. It's worth highlighting that excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenues, worldwide organic growth was 6.4% in the quarter and outstanding results.","Fourth quarter operating margin was 21.4%, an increase of 60 basis points from a year ago. Full year operating margin was 12%, an increase of 50 basis points from 2015, achieving our margin target for the year.","2016 full year diluted earnings per share were $1.49 and were $1.37 is adjusted for certain items, a 13% increase over comparable 2015 diluted earnings per share. The adjustments exclude certain gains and losses below operations in both years which are reflected in other expense due to the disposition of small, non-strategic businesses and certain discrete tax items.","This morning, we're reporting on 2016, but it's worth noting that these accomplishments build on our company's strong record of organic growth and margin improvement over a number of years. In fact, over just the last three years in our very fast changing and competitive industry, we have achieved total organic revenue growth of 17%, which surpasses the performance of our principal peers. During that three-year span, we've increased the operating margin by 270 basis points, operating profit by $279 million or 42% and comparable diluted earnings per share by 76%. That's great performance and all of our people can take pride in these accomplishments. Their talent and the great work they do every day on behalf of our clients is what drives such terrific results in the marketplace and for our shareholders. We thank them for their hard work and dedication.","It's important to note that concurrent with this very strong performance, we have sustained our investments in outstanding talent across our agencies as well as in the tools and capabilities that keep us on the leading edge of our businesses, especially, in the digital space and in key growth areas like data analytics, programmatic, creative and consulting services. At the same time, we've continued to return capital to our shareholders at significant and increasing levels.","Returning to the fourth quarter, organic revenue growth was 5.3%, currency had a negative 2% impact on revenue, while net business disposition were negative 20 basis point. Regionally, as I mentioned, U.S. organic growth was 4.7% excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenues. International growth in the quarter was 7.8%, reflecting strong Q4 performance in every major international region. Q4 growth also reflects contributions from all major disciplines, including advertising, media and public relations.","As we've seen all year long, we again had especially strong performance at digital specialist R\/GA and Huge. And from our digital services embedded across the portfolio, whether in our media operations, public relations, at our integrated ad agencies and another specialty areas such as healthcare and shopper marketing.","In addition to our digital specialists, a wide range of our agencies contributed to growth, led by Mediabrands, McCann, and Weber Shandwick, while the top performing client sectors in Q4 were healthcare, retail and food and beverage.","Operating expenses in Q4 were again well-managed. Under our reported revenue growth of 3.1% in the quarter, our operating expenses increased 2.3%. The result was Q4 operating margin expansion of 60 basis points. For the full year, margin expansion of 50 basis points reflects strong leverage on our office and general expense, and on expenses for base payroll benefits and tax.","Turning to share repurchase. During Q4, we've repurchased 5 million shares using $110 million. For the full year, we utilized $303 million for the repurchase of 13 million shares, which compares with $285 million in 2015. Our total share count eligible for dilution at year-end, decreased 2% compared to 2015. This activity builds on a program of consistent capital return that we initiated in 2011. Since that time, we've returned total of $3 billion to shareholders through a combination of common share dividends and repurchases and we have reduced our outstanding shares eligible for dilution by 28%.","In addition, on the strength of our operating results, we're pleased to announce this morning, our board's decision to raise IPG's quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.18 per share. This marks our fifth consecutive year of higher dividends with annual increase of 20% or more, tripling our quarterly dividend per share over the last five years.","We also announced that our board has authorized an additional $300 million for repurchase, combined with the $155 million remaining on our existing authorization as of the beginning of the year, this brings the total amount available for share repurchase to $455 million. These actions based on our operating success in recent years and IPG's substantial financial strength as well as the confidence in our future prospects.","Turning to our outlook for 2017. It's encouraging to see our agencies competing so successfully in the marketplace. We continue to convert growth to operating profit at high levels and we remain committed to disciplined use of capital that can further drive shareholder value.","As you can see in our results today, the tone of our business remains solid through year-end especially in the U.S., which is a key market for us.","We all know that marketing is becoming increasingly complex and that our industry is undergoing transformation, which brings with it both risk and opportunity. And those of you who've been following us, know, we have for some time been transforming our company with the singular goal of helping clients navigate this increased complexity. Of course, our industry leading results over the past three years sets the bar that's much higher for comparable performance in 2017. But given the opportunities for our industry and the overall strength of our offerings, we are well-positioned to continue to deliver solid growth.","From a macro standpoint, as we all know 2016 was a year of profound geopolitical change in key world markets, which has the potential to bring new uncertainties to the business world as we head into the new year. With respect to the U.S. and the UK, while these uncertainties bear watching, we have not to-date seen significant underlying changes to the solid demand for our services that has characterized the last few years.","Beyond that, generally slow growth macro conditions in markets such as Brazil, Continental Europe and the Middle East continue to present challenges which we nonetheless overcame last year. On balance, for 2017, we are therefore targeting 3% to 4% organic growth. On a reported basis, our net business dispositions to-date will be a negative 90 basis points to our top line. It's worth noting, however, that our dispositions were either unprofitable or non-strategic, and that we will be stronger in the long run on account of these actions.","Our estimates are that FX at current rates, should impact our top line as well as our operating expenses by approximately a negative 1% for the full year. Along with this level of growth, we expect to continue to build on a longstanding record of operating margin expansion. We are targeting an additional 50 basis points of margin improvement in 2017, which would bring us to 12.5%, closing in on our objective of 13% operating margin. As always, as the year unfolds, we will regularly review our perspective with you during our quarterly calls.","In sum, we believe that the drivers of shareholder value, creation and growth, margin expansion, and capital returns remain in place and we'll continue to work well at Interpublic as we enter a new year.","At this stage, I'll turn things over to Frank for additional detail on our performance and then I'll return on an update and highlights of our business. Frank?","Frank Mergenthaler - Interpublic Group of Cos., Inc.","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. As a reminder, I'll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. On slide 2, you'll see a summary of our results. Fourth quarter organic growth was 5.3%, U.S. organic growth was 3.3% and was 4.7% excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenue. International organic growth was 7.8% with increases across all regions. For the full year organic growth was 5% and all regions increased organically. Q4 operating margin was 21.4% compared with 20.8% a year ago. For the full year operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 12% and operating profit increased 8%.","For the quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.78 and was $0.75 excluding expense of $0.06 per share for business dispositions, which is reflected pre-tax in our other expense line and also excluding the impact of certain discrete items that benefited our tax provision and totaled $0.09 per share.","Full-year diluted EPS was $1.49 per share and would have been $1.37 per share excluding losses on dispositions and the benefit of certain discrete items in our tax provision. We repurchased 13 million shares for $303 million during the year. As Michael mentioned, we announced this morning that our board has once again significantly increased our common share dividend by 20% to $0.18 per share quarterly and added $300 million to our share repurchase authorization.","Turning to slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. Here it's worth noting a few below line items. First, the $25 million of net expense from business dispositions is reflected in our other expense line below operating income and it's primarily non-cash.","Second, our effective tax rate as reported in the quarter was low at 24.1%, adjusted for the dispositions and for discrete tax items, our adjusted effective tax rate was 31.2%. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 33.4%.","As you can see our tax rate continues to be volatile from year-to-year. This is due to the utilization of loss carry-forwards and adjusting valuation allowances based on sustained operating performance. As our profitability continues to improve around the world, our underlying trend is toward a lower effective consolidated tax rate. Accordingly, we expect our normalized effective rate will be in the range of 35% to 36% in 2017, which is a couple of percentage points better than we've targeted in recent years. It's also worth noting here that our cash tax rate 2016 was 29% of pre-tax income, which is also our expected 2017 tax rate.","Turning to revenue on slide 4. Fourth quarter revenues $2.26 billion compared to Q4 2015, the impact of changes in exchange rates was a negative 2%, while net dispositions were negative 20 basis points, the resulting organic revenue increase was 5.3%. Revenue growth for the full-year was 3.1%, consisting a 5% organic growth and a positive 20 basis points from net acquisitions, while currency was a negative 2.1%.","Our organic pass-through revenue decreased $24 million in Q4. Excluding that impact, organic growth would have been 6.4%. For the full year, our organic pass-through revenue decreased $17 million organically and reduced organic growth by 20 basis points. These pass-through revenues are in our events, sports and direct marketing businesses and changes in pass-through revenues are offset dollar-for-dollar by changes in our O&G expense.","As you can see on the bottom half of this slide, Q4 organic growth at our Integrated Agency Network segment was 6.7%, led by Mediabrands, McCann, R\/GA and Huge.","At our CMG segment, our marketing services specialists, a decrease in pass-through revenue weighed on organic growth in the quarter. Excluding that effect, CMG's organic growth was a solid 4.7% in the quarter, led by mid single-digit performance by our public relations agencies. For the full year, you see that organic growth rates were 5.3% IAN, and 3.6% at CMG.","Moving onto slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q4 organic growth was 3.3% and was 4.7% excluding the change in pass-through revenues on top of 6.2% a year ago. These are led by IPG Mediabrands as well as Huge, R\/GA and MullenLowe. Pass-through revenues decreased due to the timing, projects and our events business.","Among client sectors, healthcare was our growth leader and food and beverage was also strong. For the full year, U.S. organic growth was 4.4% with increases across all of our principal disciplines in most client sectors, including food and beverage, tech and telecom, healthcare, retail, and government services.","Turning to the international markets, the UK grew 11.7% organically in Q4. It's our notably strong performance at a number of our agencies, notably Mediabrands, R\/GA, Jack Morton and McCann.","For the full year, UK organic growth was 8.5% and was still strong at 5% including the impact of higher pass-through revenue. Total revenue growth was 1.2% which includes both the positive impact of acquisitions in the market, and negative impact of FX when the pound starts depreciation.","In Continental Europe, we had another double-digit quarter with 11.1% organic growth, held by new business wins. Among our largest markets, we had very strong growth in Germany and Spain, while France and Italy decreased. For the full-year, organic growth for Continental Europe was 5.7%.","In Asia-Pacific, organic revenue growth was 7.5% Q4 on top of 7.9% a year ago. We had double-digit increase in three or four largest markets, India, China and Japan. Australia grew in the mid single-digits. We had growth across most of our agencies including Mediabrands, McCann, MullenLowe and Weber Shandwick.","For the year, organic growth in the region is 1.7%, would have been 4% if not regional decrease in the pass-through revenues. In LatAm, we grew 5% organically in the quarter. We continue to see strong performance in Argentina, Mexico, Chile and Colombia, which offset the decrease in Brazil. Our growth in the regions led by Mediabrands, Huge and R\/GA. For the year, organic growth was 12.2%, a strong growth in all of our major country markets.","In our other markets group, organic revenue growth was 90 basis points in the quarter. This group is made up of Canada, the Middle East and Africa. For the year, organic growth was 4.8%, a very strong performance from Canada.","On slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12 month basis. The most recent data point is 5% for calendar year 2016 on top of 6.1% in 2015 and 5.5% in 2014. As Michael mentioned, this is industry leading performance.","Moving on to slide 7, operating expenses, which remained well controlled in the fourth quarter. Total operating expenses increased 2.3% compared with reported revenue growth of 3.1%. For the full year operating expenses grew 2.5% supporting revenue growth of 3.1%.","Our ratio of total salaries and related expenses to revenue for the full year was 64.2% compared with 63.8% a year ago. Underneath that we continue to drive efficiencies on our investment and base payroll, benefits and tax, which is our largest cost catered, 10 basis points of operating leverage for the year and 30 basis points excluding the impact of lower pass-throughs.","Our expense for incentive compensation increased in 2016 to 4% of revenue from 3.7% in 2015. That was mainly driven by the increased expense of our long-term incentive comp programs, a reflection of strong operating performance over the past three years, against both our revenue and operating margin targets. Expense for temporary labor was 3.7% of revenue for the full year 2016 compared with 3.6% a year ago. Severance expense was 0.9% of revenue the same levels a year ago.","Our other salaries and related categories 3% of revenue compared with 2.9% in 2015. Year end head count was approximately 49,800, an increase of 1.3% from a year ago, while average head count over the course of 2016 increased 2.4%. As you'd expect head count increased in growth areas of our portfolio including digital services, media, P&R and a support of new business wins.","Turning to ops and general expense, O&G was 23.8% of full-year revenue compared with 24.7% a year ago giving us 90 basis points of operating leverage. For the year, we continue to drive leverage across our O&G categories. The exception was occupancy expense where it benefited from a one-time credit 2015, as we have previously described. We had 20 basis points of leverage on our expense for T&E, office supply and telecom as well as 10 basis points on professional fees. In addition, we had 80 basis points of leverage on our category of all other O&G expense, as pass-through expenses decreased from a year ago along with the related revenue. As I mentioned in connection with revenues, pass-through expenses are primarily in our events, sports, direct marketing disciplines.","On slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12 month basis with most recent data point at 12%. We have made sustained and significant gains. There is still work to be done and we remain highly focused on attaining our long-term goal.","Turning to slide 9, we present more detail on below the line adjustments to our reported fourth quarter results, in order to give you a better picture of comparable performance, with a loss in the quarter of $25 million in other expense related to disposition of a few small non-strategic businesses. The after tax impact was $0.06 per share. As you can see, the impact of the new accounting standard for share-based compensations was de minimis in the quarter.","Moving to the right hand on the slide, we recorded benefit in the amount of $37 million for U.S. federal tax credits, which benefited from our diluted earnings per share by $0.09. Result this fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS $0.75 per share.","Slide 10 depicts similar adjustments for the full year 2016, again for comparability. You can see our loss of $0.10 per share, diluted share for business dispositions are benefited $0.03 per share for the new accounting standard, a share-based compensation with a benefit of $0.11 per share for U.S. federal tax credits.","In addition, valuation allowance reversals related to business sales were a benefit of $0.03 per share. We also released tax reserves upon the conclusion of previous year's tax examinations, which is a benefit of $0.06 per share, result is an adjusted full year diluted EPS of $1.37.","Turning to slide 11, the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the year with $1.1 billion of cash and short-term marketable securities, which compared to $1.51 billion a year ago. We returned $542 million to shareholders during the year, through share repurchase and common stock dividends.","Under current liabilities, the increase to the current portion of long-term debt reflects the upcoming maturity of our $300 million, 2.25% notes due in November of this year.","On slide 12, return on cash flow for the full year. Cash from operations in 2016 was $513 million compared to $689 million a year ago. The comparison includes $414 million used in working capital compared with the use of $99 million a year ago. It is not unusual for working capital to be volatile from year-to-year due to the timing of collections and payments in our media business. Investing activities used $268 million in the year including $201 million for CapEx and $52 million for acquisitions. CapEx was above the level of the prior year in our recent run rate due to a number of large agency moves during 2016.","Financing activities used $666 million, mainly $303 million for the repurchase of our common stock, $238 million for common stock dividends. 2016, our net decrease in cash and marketable securities was $409 million.","Slide 13 is the long view of our debt decreasing from $2.3 million in 2007 to our current debt total of $1.69 billion at the end of 2016. Slide 14, shows the total of our average basic plus diluted shares over time, that the far rights of the total as of year-end 2016. Our average total shares decreased by $156 million shares over this period, well our starting position for 2017 is $402 million on the right.","In summary, on slide 15, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and the year. Our teams executed very well, achieving strong revenue growth while maintaining expense discipline. And our balance sheet continues to be a meaningful source of value creation as evident in the actions announced by our board today. That leaves us well positioned entering 2017.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Michael.","Michael Isor Roth - Interpublic Group of Cos., Inc.","Thank you, Frank. Well, obviously we're pleased to have achieved very strong results across the board for 2016. Digital activity across all of the agencies continues to be a significant driver of our success. And we continue to see the benefits of the major strategic decision we made some time ago to embed digital expertise with all of our agencies.","The other strategic priority that has fueled us is a longstanding commitment to investing in people and creating a differentiated culture that draws so many of the industry's best and most entrepreneurial talent to our group.","Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is an integral part of our culture and we remain focused on diversity as a key ingredient to success in a global ideas business. We all know that our industry is changing at a rapid pace. As you'd expect, we regularly monitor activity in adjacent sectors and among potential new entrants into our space, so as to ensure that we continue to develop our integrated model and deliver a range of emerging services to our clients. As mentioned briefly in my opening remarks, we've led the industry in organic growth from 2014 to 2016. During that time, we have organically added $1.2 billion of revenue at Interpublic, although some of that has not been reflected in our reported results on account of the negative effects of currency.","Amplifying this organic revenue growth as a standalone entity, $1.2 billion company would be among the 15 largest marketing services providers in the world. It would rank close to the size of the marketing operations of the leading consultancies and we've accomplished that in just the past three years. This doesn't mean we should feel any less driven to keep evolving the IPG offerings. But, it does demonstrate how well positioned we are to continue innovating and remain highly relevant to marketers in today's competitive and complex media environment. What's more, unlike some of the new competition, we could increasingly be facing, we enjoy the significant added benefit of a full portfolio of best-in-class offerings that we can integrate and add to our digital services including creative, media and high growth specialty capabilities such as PR, healthcare marketing and CRM shopper marketing.","Consistent with recent years during 2016, we also demonstrated our ability to remain focused on and deliver against our stated financial targets.","Our record of sustained long-term margin improvement is something we're very proud of, as is the fact that we've made such great progress in terms of the company's balance sheet and its overall financial strength. Our capital return programs continue to be significant drivers of value. And, last year, we surpassed the $3 billion threshold in total returns to our owners since reinstituting these programs in 2011.","Our board's decision today to increase the dividend and add to our share repurchase program shows a continued commitment to return value to our shareholders as well as confidence in our future prospects.","I'd like to turn now to the performance at our agency levels in order to provide a progress report on the key developments within our portfolio.","At Mediabrands, UM closed the year with an impressive wins as Fitbit and Hulu, which was an integrated effort with other IPG agencies as well as Tim Hortons, a major win in Canada to start the new year.","We saw new leaders join to head up the EMEA and Asia-PAC regions, as well as new global leaders for Initiative and Reprise. As indicated previously, Mediabrands is the place where we will continue to further focus and invest behind our already considerable data and analytic capabilities, which we believe will become the data stack and platform that would serve all of our agencies and their clients, as we push for even more accountability in our marketing programs.","R\/GA saw major award wins in significant new business such as Mercedes-Benz and Siemens, as well as further expansion in terms of its service offerings, notably in capabilities like business transformation consultancy and the connected office space. The agency launched at its first UK based accelerator program and more recently we're pleased to announce that the first R\/GA Venture Studio program cosponsored by Snap and IPG to focus on marketing tech and the rapidly growing mobile advertising.","Huge posted another year of very strong growth with leading edge capabilities in user experience design as well as strong tech development teams that are key to building the platforms for many of their clients' digital and e-commerce businesses.","McCann Worldgroup posted strong results, fueled by growth with existing clients and continued improvements that have made them a standout in global multi-disciplined marketing solutions.","The agency's global creative is surging as well. They had the single most awarded campaign at Cannes, and two out of the Festival's five biggest winners. Their amazing work for Lockheed Martin implementing a group VR experience for a virtual field trip to Mars, shows how much can be done when you connect great marketing ideas and technology expertise on behalf of the brand.","CMG also continued to deliver strong results and outstanding creative work as well as taking further share in the PR space. Weber Shandwick's acquisition of Flipside, a specialized mobile and social agency out of London, with strong development capabilities will ensure that they increase the lead they already enjoy over most of their competitors in the digital space.","All across the agencies in CMG play important roles in an integrated IPG engagements on our top 20 clients. MullenLowe posted improving results including very positive trajectory at its core U.S. business and played a lead role in our open architecture model in our wins at Harley-Davidson and Western Union. Profero continued to perform well and their same senior team stepped up into new leadership roles within core MullenLowe operations, which will help to drive further digitization of the agency's hyper bundled model going forward.","At FCB, there were notable new additions of key talents across the network. The agency prevailed in the highly competitive Clorox consolidation pitch, and performance at its headquarter Chicago agency was strong, in terms of both business results and a significantly enhanced creative reputation.","FCB Health also continues to be a standout agency, which features prominently in the agency's overall success. Our U.S. independents round out our portfolio, each has a range of services that it can deliver on an integrated standalone basis to major clients or as part of a customized, open architecture IPG solution.","As Deutsche does on our Global J&J ACUVUE business. The Martin Agency on the global OREO account or Hill Holliday on the consumer side of the number of J&J former engagements. Carmichael Lynch also had a very successful year, and we look forward to including them in more integrated teams on a go forward basis.","As you know, we focused on delivering on the vision of open architecture for nearly a decade. Although this is become something that all of our competitors are talking about, we continue to feel that our approach seeks to integrate the best of our talent across the organization by means of fully customized and seamless teams is a differentiate for us.","We look forward to additional opportunities to develop this model for existing clients and utilize it in the pursuit of new business. It's clear from our overall results that the quality of our offerings is at the highest level in many years. Globally at major competitions ranging from the Cannes to the EPPYs our agencies are recognized with the highest honest and our group performance is outstanding.","This includes regional award shows, as well as those for specialties ranging from sports marketing to promotional and shopper marketing, PR, healthcare marketing and more.","In the recently released Ad Age A-List, we were the only holding company with multiple agencies in the top 10, and also at the top end of the industry in terms of the range of marketing services honored and recognized.","Looking forward, despite macroeconomic and political uncertainty, the tone of the business remains sound. New business activity is solid. The breadth and strength of our portfolio positions us well to participate in most all pitch opportunities, and there is growth to be had by addressing the emerging needs of our existing clients.","In light of these factors, we believe that we should continue to see competitive organic revenue performance and we are therefore targeting the 3% to 4% for 2017. Along with this level of growth, we expect to further improve operating margin by an additional 50 basis points, which will result in 2017 operating margin of 12.5%.","Combined with the strength of our balance sheet and our consistent commitment and proven record, when it comes to capital return, that means that they remain significant potential value creation and enhance shareholder value. As always, we thank our clients, our people who've been the foundation for our long-term success, and we look forward to updating you on our progress at our first quarter's call.","With that, I'll open it up to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from the line of Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan. You may now ask your question.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. Just two questions if I may. First is, Michael, if you could provide a bit more color on what you're seeing in the U.S. ad market, it's been a big area of focus given the big swings from Q3 to Q4 and then of course, your standout performance versus some of your peers that have already reported. I guess with Q3 an anomaly and would you sort of expect we'll resume to more normalized organic growth for this year kind of in line with your overall guidance for 2017?","Michael Isor Roth - Interpublic Group of Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Well, thank you, Alexia. Yeah. I think our standout performance is obvious in our results. We consistently say this, we look at it on a full year basis. I know we try to meet your objectives in terms of modeling on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but clients don't operate that way. So as we said in the third quarter when we were a little softer in the third quarter, what we said was we saw some softening in our healthcare business and we had some deferrals if you will going into the fourth quarter due to some of the accounting rules on new business.","So we believe if you look at on a full year basis, our performance in the U.S. after pass-throughs of 4.8% is pretty impressive and that's indicative of the fact that the tone of the business in the fourth quarter was pretty solid.","The one area in the fourth quarter that we did see some pullback was on some project based businesses, particularly in the events. But we did see a recovery in the U.S. in the fourth quarter and it's really not a recovery, what we saw, what we expected to see for the full year. And so, as a result, we did not see the softening that some of our competitors see in the U.S. market.","The U.S. market continues to be 61% of our business overall, that will fluctuate from 60% to 62%, but obviously it's important. All of our businesses in the U.S. are very strong, particularly our digital agencies, our media agencies, our independent agencies as well as obviously, McCann, FCB, and MullenLowe had a good result in New York and U.S.","So overall we're confident in the U.S. And, as the U.S. economy continues to grow, hopefully, we will see the benefits of that. So the tone continues to be solid.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. And then, Michael, I also noticed in your opening comments or in your comments earlier, you mentioned consultants and sort of the new competition or competition from consultants.","Michael Isor Roth - Interpublic Group of Cos., Inc.","Right.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can you give us a sense on I guess how much more you're bumping into them or competing with them? And, is it a different kind of competition or is there just one of another group of competitors that you always deal with?","Michael Isor Roth - Interpublic Group of Cos., Inc.","Actually we have not seen head-to-head competition with them in most of our businesses. So, a lot of the stories are more anecdotal. But a lot of these consultants are already at our clients, and they're doing system integration. And so, while they're doing the system integration, they've added digital capabilities and some of them have bought creative agencies to try to encroach on our space, if you will.","But, what they cannot do is circling on the creative side. They're not going to have the firepower that we have across all of our agencies. Just look at the awards at McCann, at FCB, at MullenLowe, on the creative side of our businesses. And on a head-to-head basis, they're not going to be able to compete on the creative side.","And, the other key aspect of the integrated offering, which we bring to the table. That includes media, PR, digital, experiential. So I don't see these system integrators being capable of competing with us if we deliver that integrated offering, which is why our open architecture model is so important in the competitive environment, because head-to-head they just can't possibly bring in all of these resources.","So I view it as some way down the road that consultancy more in the business transformation side of the equation is where they're going to be making some in roads. And as a result, we are \u2013 we have frankly beefing up our areas on business transformation, R\/GA has gotten a lead on that in terms of their practice and we see it in the strong results and frankly if you look at the right up of why they will pick this among the Ad Age A agencies. The fact that they moved into that space was a good indication of their vision and frankly, we believe that's a space that all of our agencies are going to have capabilities in.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Michael Isor Roth - Interpublic Group of Cos., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jaime Morris of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Yeah, hi. It's actually John Janedis. Two questions for you guys. One is, I know it's small piece of the business, Michael, but the two quarters in Europe were I think the best in at least 10 years. And so I wanted to ask, was the driver a couple of large account wins and how do you feel about your market share going forward? And then separately, as you know, a few weeks ago there was the news on the DoJ investigation. I don't think you speak to that directly, but I was wondering if as a result, you changed any of your practices as it relates to the bidding process or production broadly? Thanks.","Michael Isor Roth - Interpublic Group of Cos., Inc.","All right. Thank you. John. Well first of all, as I said, look we're very pleased with the results in Continental Europe. It represents 9% of our overall business and I've said in the past when our results were not that good in Continental Europe, we are not as big compared to the rest of our portfolio. So client wins and losses have an impact on our performance, and fortunately between Mediabrands and McCann, we've had some good wins in Continental Europe including all the \u2013 at McCann, and we're seeing the positive results of that.","That said, I don't believe given the economic environment in Continental Europe, that we can continue to deliver high single digit results in that marketplace, especially our comps get a little harder as we go forward.","But the good news about it is, A, with positive results in Continental Europe, we get to use some of our NOLs, which is reflected in our effective cash tax rate, which is a good thing and our effective rate. It also \u2013 we're expanding some margin in Continental Europe, so all of that is positive. But I wouldn't say that we should continue to have, I hope it's true, but we should continue to have the kind of the growth that we've seen in Continental Europe. We still think Continental Europe is going to be facing some issues.","And therefore we're not counting on a full recovery in Continental Europe, but it's great to have some great clients in Continental Europe as a base for our business there. As far as the Department of Justice, as you know, we were the first ones to come out and publicly announced the receipt of the subpoenas, if you will. We had at one local agency in the United States.","And after that, all of our competitors in the holding companies have received similar request. As I said before, we're certainly giving them whatever material we're collaborating as best we can. We have a \u2013 first of all it's not a big part of our business. In this case, it has to do with video production. Production is in the low single digits of our entire business. And in this case, it's video production, and we do have a process of triple bidding if you will, we stick to that. At this point, we haven't changed significantly our internal policies, because we already have internal policies that we believe are very strong. And we'll cooperate and see where this leads us, but we haven't seen any much action on that other than what you've read.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","All right. Thank you.","Michael Isor Roth - Interpublic Group of Cos., Inc.","Thank you, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo. You may now ask your question.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for the questions. A couple if I could. Michael, going back to the dispositions, I think you mentioned 90 bps, and just want to confirm that that's based on \u2013 that impact is based on actions to-date. Looking ahead through the remainder of the year, would you anticipate further dispositions and then wondering if you could give us a little more color on \u2013 you said non-strategic or unprofitable, but is there any sort of theme to the types of companies in terms of the services they provide that you are disposing of. And then secondly, wondering if you could just, Frank, briefly touch on the source of leverage, I might have missed it in 2017 that you're expecting and whether that is dependent upon the level of growth in IAN or CMG or kind of a irrespective of how those two segments perform that you feel comfortable with the margin targets. Thanks so much.","Michael Isor Roth - Interpublic Group of Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Look, it's a good question. Every year, we look at unproductive assets if you will, that aren't delivering margin and are non-strategic. This is not us exiting a business within IPG. They are discrete businesses, and frankly some of them were losing money, as they didn't fit in our overall portfolio. So, if you look back at the history of our company, we've had this before and as I indicated it will impact our revenue for 2017 by 90 basis points, but it should improve margin. And there is no theme to it other than, we look at our businesses, we see if they are adding value. We look if they're going to need capital, whether they're adding to our margins and are they consistent with our overall future direction of the company. But it's not like we're exiting a particular business.","One example, as you've read, the one that's public is daily (47:43). We sold it back to management. They have some good client relationships which we continue to support and we think that this was a good transaction both for the clients to which they serve internal management. And frankly from a management perspective of IPG, we'd rather be spending a lot of our time managing our existing portfolio. So that's the type of transactions that are in there. But we're not exiting a major business plan or anything like that.","Frank will answer on the conversion. But I think it's a subtle way of asking why our conversion in 2016 was not as high as it historically has been, and what are we assuming conversion in 2017? Let me just say that, we continue to convert at very high levels, if you will. As we get to our famous 13% target, which I'll say again is not the ceiling. It's just a number we drew in the sand, gets a little more difficult to convert at the 30% which you have seen historically.","That said, for 2016, we did convert at a healthy rate. 50 basis points is not something that we're hanging our head down on. And one of the reasons that conversion wasn't quite where it should be is we did have some charges, if you will for the year, on some of our acquisitions. The way this accounting goes in terms of valuations, if the business you've acquired is doing better than you thought when you did it, the accounting rules require us to have a charge which affects our margin.","For 2016, if you compared it to the same charge \u2013 a similar charge we had in 2015, which was not as large, it affected our margins by about 15 basis points. So, that was a drag on our margin for 2016. If you look at it from that perspective, our conversion rate was closer to 24%, 25% \u2013 24% than the 30%. Going into 2017 at a 3% to 4% organic growth and the conversion rates that we believe we can realize, the 50 basis point margin expansion reflects a higher conversion than we experienced in 2016. But it's in a range, this isn't exact science and we're very comfortable with the number we've put out for 2017. Frank, you want to...","Frank Mergenthaler - Interpublic Group of Cos., Inc.","Yes. The only thing I'd add, Peter, is, we're looking for 50 basis points of margin for 2017. I like to think we're going to get leverage across all of our respective cost buckets. So to point to a specific area of leverage I think that's not the point. The point is, our guidance is 50 basis points of margin. The second point with respect to is the growth \u2013 is the margin target predicated on growth at one of our specific segments, the answer is no, both \u2013 well I'll take growth from anywhere.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you, guys.","Michael Isor Roth - Interpublic Group of Cos., Inc.","Thank you, Peter.","Frank Mergenthaler - Interpublic Group of Cos., Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Cahall of Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is now open.","Steven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. First question maybe to follow-up on Alexia's question, I think you mentioned that the U.S. market was solid, your peer earlier in the week mentioned that some of their U.S. clients were hopeful and bullish and economists and the S&P are telling us that the U.S. economy is going to look awesome by the end of the year. So I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of sort of where the rubber meets the road with your clients. Are they as bullish as the market or the economists are, are they still really sort of waiting and seeing what's going to happen in Washington, and how consumers are going to act this year, before increasing scopes of work or committing new funds into their marketing budgets? And then I have a quick follow-up.","Michael Isor Roth - Interpublic Group of Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Fine. Look, as I've said before, everyone is hopeful that we'll see tax reform and what we've said before, if there is tax reform certainly in the corporate tax environment. That would benefit IPG, it would benefit our clients. If there is a better environment and consumer sentiment is up, that's going to benefit us and it will benefit our clients. So yeah, I mean we're all keeping our fingers crossed, and hope something like that will happen in the marketplace.","But we do our forecasting and we do our numbers based on a bottoms up. Our clients, when you talk to our clients, they're wishing too, but they're not counting on it. And I think at this point the expenditures that we're seeing are based on a business as normal. Looking at markets where they can gain market share, looking at where we can add value in terms of increasing their goals if you will in terms of sales.","And so I think potentially it's on the upside, if we do see that and we do see consumer sentiment and the opportunity to bring foreign cash over into the United States. Whenever clients have more money to spend, they're going to look to grow their business. And if they look to grow their business, I can't think of a better place for them to put their money than in advertising. So it's \u2013 we move the needle and we're ready, willing and able to help them do that. So I think the numbers that you're seeing that we've put out reflect more or less a business as usual, which isn't bad. If you look at our performance in the U.S., I'll take it if we have business as usual for 2017. I think those are results that we can be proud of. And if we expand our margin at the 50 basis points that we're forecasting, I would say that's a good solid result.","Steven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. And then on the media side, I think you talked about some of the recent wins like Fitbit, Hulu, and Tim Hortons. I think it's been reported, you may have also had couple of recent losses on the media side. So, number one, what can we expect for maybe the next few months from an agency review perspective? And how do you think you come out in that? And are you still net new business positive for the year based on where you sit today?","Michael Isor Roth - Interpublic Group of Cos., Inc.","Well, yes, and the biggest one actually you're referring to was MillerCoors. If you recall on the last quarter, we said that was in review. They had a business consolidation and unfortunately we didn't prevail on that one. Whenever you have a new CMO and a consolidation, it's hard for the incumbents to prevail.","Yes, we were net new business positive for 2016. We continue to be so in 2017, we've had a number of wins. Some of our wins if you recall are not publicly announced wins. Our strongest growth \u2013 it's an important point, our strongest growth is from our existing clients and you don't see big announcements as we increase our businesses and it's historically always been a strength of IPG, particularly at McCann for example where they have longstanding multinational clients. And they don't make a big deal about picking up brands or reassigning brands and growing their existing portfolio, but that's inherent in our portfolio here.","So, the media business, we have a strong pipeline in new business. We had some wins already on the media side for 2017 and we're confident that the numbers we put forth in terms of our forecast, that reflects wins and losses we anticipate for 2017.","Steven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Michael Isor Roth - Interpublic Group of Cos., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Omar Sheikh of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Omar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I've got a couple of questions, one for Michael and one for Frank. Michael, first of all, you talked a little bit about dispositions, I wonder whether you could talk about potential pipeline for acquiring companies. You mentioned you're thinking about perhaps building (55:46) Mediabrands, for example. So, I wonder whether you could maybe just talk generally about how you think about the pipeline and whether M&A might play a part for that.","And then secondly for Frank, I just want to make sure I understand the tax rate point that you made. Were you saying the sort of increased utilization of NOLs was driving the tax rate down this year. And I just wonder if you could clarify whether that's in the U.S. or in Europe and if so kind of what sort of scope do you see for a tax rate to come down further, obviously the absent any tax reform. Thanks.","Michael Isor Roth - Interpublic Group of Cos., Inc.","Okay. I'm insulted that you're asking a tax question to Frank, so giving the fact that my history as a tax lawyer, but aside from that, I'll go to the actual...","Omar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","(56:32) Michael.","Michael Isor Roth - Interpublic Group of Cos., Inc.","Our acquisition pipeline is consistent. Our whole strategy has always been to do strategic bolt-ons or strategic transactions in markets, or expertise that we would like to be thought. We set aside around $200 million in terms of acquisition money and which is pretty consistent with where we were in 2016. And we see the same for 2017. We don't see any big transactions out there. We are always looking at transformational type transactions. For example, many years ago, we looked at (57:12) along with everyone else. And we choose not to do that unless as I said we see a transformational transaction out there.","But it doesn't seem to be one out there at the current environmental moment, that would have a big call on our capital. But if there is one, obviously, we'll be opportunistic and it will be consistent with our overall strategy of gaining market share.","I'll answer the tax rate question, if you don't mind.","Frank Mergenthaler - Interpublic Group of Cos., Inc.","I don't mind.","Michael Isor Roth - Interpublic Group of Cos., Inc.","The NOLs that we have principally in Europe, and the only way for us to use them are to generate income. And so, that's why I say it's encouraging for us to see positive growth in both the UK, and in Continental Europe. And we did in fact, use some of our NOLs.","And that's consistently, we have a $1 billion of NOL and that's an opportunity. So if we can really turn the corner in Continental Europe and build up consistent growth and cash taxable income, then we \u2013 that's an opportunity for us to continue a low tax rate, if you will, both on the reported side because we do get a benefit.","The reason sometimes we talk about, if we have losses in those markets, we don't get a benefit with it \u2013 for it in our effective tax rate. So that's one of the reasons our tax rate was slightly higher because we had losses without corresponding tax benefits.","If we have gains, it's a double whammy there because we can, in essence, we no longer have a drain from a lost point of view and we can use the NOLs. I might add that, on top of that we do a lot of work on the international tax planning side of our business.","And obviously, that's not something we've raised flags about, but what you're seeing in the effect of our tax rate or some utilization if you will of credits and structures that we have, there we believe our good tax planning on an overall basis from a financial and tax point of view.","Omar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","See that is very clear. Thank you very much.","Michael Isor Roth - Interpublic Group of Cos., Inc.","Sorry, Frank.","Frank Mergenthaler - Interpublic Group of Cos., Inc.","That's okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Tim Nollen of Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Oh, great, thanks for fitting me in. I'll leave it to one since we're at right, here it's just about 9:30. And it's for Frank and it's about the operating margin guidance. Looking at the appendices in your slides, it looks like you brought down your real estate occupancy by somewhere in the neighborhood of 20% in the last few years. It also looks like you have raised your incentives in 2016 which makes sense when you have a nice profitable year.","So just wondering where does the extra squeeze out come from. How do you get that margin up by the 50 basis points? And I heard your comments some, Michael, lot of conversion, but just wondering where else can you squeeze cost out if you're getting closer and closer to (1:00:12) level? Thanks.","Frank Mergenthaler - Interpublic Group of Cos., Inc.","It does get harder. And as I mentioned on one of the earlier calls, we're targeting 50 basis points. We're not going to guide to specific leverage points in our cost structure. Every dollar we spend, we're looking for to gain incremental efficiency. The biggest cost that we have is around our people. And we did see some leverage in our base benefit tax this year and that's nearly we'll continue to be disciplined around.","And to your point earlier, in synopsis is variable and based performance, it can go up or down. And that's based on performance as well.","Michael Isor Roth - Interpublic Group of Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Let me just add to add on \u2013 leveraging on that. A part of the increase in our incentive is the effect of our long-term incentives. We have long-term incentives over a period of time two years or three years. So what you're seeing is at these come through and we've had good years, that's where you see the incremental cost if you will on incentive expense. Frankly, that's a pretty good bid, because that shows that our incentive plans are working and that's what we want them to do.","Michael Isor Roth - Interpublic Group of Cos., Inc.","So with that, I thank you all for your participation. As you can tell, we're very pleased with our results and we look forward to next year and hopefully having similar conversation.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jerome J. Leshne","Good morning. Thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com, and we'll refer to both in the course of this call.","This morning, we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks, to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 a.m. Eastern.","During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company, which are subject to uncertainties in the cautionary statement included in our earnings release and the slide presentation and further detailed in our 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.","At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael Isor Roth","Thank you, Jerry, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we review our second quarter and first half results. As usual, I'll start out by covering the key highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional details on the quarter, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies, the tone of the business, to be followed by the Q&A.","We're pleased to report a quarter that saw solid growth in many key world markets. In the U.S., which is our largest market, growth accelerated during Q2 from recent levels. In LatAm, we again had an outstanding performance. And in Asia Pac, we posted solid growth on the top of challenging year ago comparisons.","Overall, our second quarter organic growth was 2.2%. Underneath that number, U.S. growth improved to 3.3% with contributions from a wide range of our agencies. And let's not forget we were cycling through the last of our headwinds in the market of approximately 2%.","We were led by our marketing service specialists at CMG, Mediabrands, McCann, Huge, Deutsch and several of our integrated agencies. Leading domestic client sectors were auto and transportation, consumer goods, food and beverage and health care.","In the Latin American region, organic growth was 16.1%, which was on top of 27% a year ago, very strong performance.","In Asia Pac, our growth was 4.5%, which also was on top of double-digit growth in Q2 2012.","Our results also reflect the continued challenging business conditions across Continental Europe, where our Q2 organic revenue change was a decrease of 8%, due largely to decreased spend across the region by multinational and local clients, particularly in June, which had weaker-than-expected performance.","Revenue from acquisitions added over 1% to our consolidated organic growth. This is a result of further investments in high-growth marketing disciplines, such as digital, shopper marketing and certain areas of health care, as well as acquisitions in high-growth and strategic international markets.","Another highlight of our second quarter was the continued momentum we saw on the new business front.","To our already strong record of account wins for the year, which in Q1 included Chevrolet in the U.S., Acura and SABIC, we added headline wins with Cadillac, Amazon Media and Zurich Financial.","These developments speak to the high quality of our offerings. Increasingly, they also reflect our ability to deliver open architecture solutions that pull together the best customized teams to meet client need and solve for specific marketing or business problems.","Our first half has been very strong in terms of new business. However, only a limited portion of the revenue from these new wins was a factor in our second quarter. This reflects the unusual lag in our industry between the announcement of a new assignment and the point at which revenue kicks in.","Turning to operating expenses and profitability in the quarter. Operating margin was 10% and operating profit $175 million compared to 10.3% and $176 million in Q2 last year. The comparisons reflect the investment required this year to secure, as well as to service our strong new business pipeline. This means we incurred some expenses in Q2 ahead of related revenue on some of our recent wins. But these are significant new assignments, accretive to our results, and that investment will pay off going forward.","The other key factor that weighed on profitability in the quarter was the impact of challenging business conditions in Continental Europe. We will be very focused on converting revenue growth to profit at high rates in the second half of 2013 as we have done in recent years. We'll also be vigilant in managing the impact of declining revenue in Europe. These will be the critical factors in delivering on our margin objective for the full year.","Earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.18 compared to $0.22 a year ago, which benefit from a lower effective tax rate.","Other items of note in Q2 involve additional progress in our programs to return capital to shareholders and further strengthen the balance sheet. During the quarter, we bought another 7.5 million shares using $105 million. Since initiating our return of capital program in 2011, we have returned a total of $1.2 billion to our owners through a combination of dividends and the repurchase of 88 million shares, and we've retired an additional 33 million dilutive share equivalents through the redemption of convertible debt. In addition, earlier this week, we completed the redemption of our $600 million 10% notes, which we had refinanced at some of the lowest rates in our company's history. We will begin to see significant interest savings from this transaction beginning in this year's third quarter.","Year-to-date, our performance in the new business arena has been noteworthy, and our results at major industry award competitions have been very strong this year. This is a reflection of our strong talent base across all our marketing disciplines, particularly in terms of creativity and our digital expertise. We also continue to see the benefits of our successful deleveraging and the financial strength of our company. A combination of competitive top line growth and expense discipline will allow us to deliver on our full year objective of 2% to 3% organic revenue growth and 50 basis point improvement in operating margin.","I'll now turn things over to Frank for some additional details, and will rejoin you after his remarks.","Frank Mergenthaler","Thank you, Michael. Good morning. As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast.","On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of results. Organic growth was 2.2%, which includes 3.3% in the U.S. and 0.8% internationally. Growth in LatAm and Asia Pac was strong. Our decrease in Continental Europe was steeper in the quarter than recent trend as was our U.K. result.","Q2 operating profit was $175 million, and margin was 10%. Margin pressure was attributable to 2 primary factors: first, the high rate of new business additions; second, the revenue decrease in Europe.","We had $1.62 billion of cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet at quarter end. As Michael mentioned earlier, we had just completed the very accretive call at 105% of our 10% notes.","Pro forma for that transaction, our cash balance will be reduced by $630 million.","Diluted EPS was $0.18 compared with $0.22 last year, when our tax rate was significantly lower.","Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow.","It's worth noting here that our Q2 tax rate was 41.9%, which is high for us due to greater losses in certain foreign jurisdictions, particularly in Europe, where we received no related tax benefit.","In contrast, last year's Q2 included a low tax rate of 32.3%, having benefit from discrete items in the period. We still believe our normalized rate for the full year will be in the 37% to 39% range as we said on our Q4 call.","Also, near the bottom of this slide, average diluted shares were 448 million, which is a decrease of 6.2% from last year as a result of our share repurchase program. At quarter end, there was 420 million remaining under our current repurchase authorization.","Turning to operations on Slide 4. Revenue in the quarter was $1.76 billion, an increase of 2.4% compared to Q2 2012. The impact of a change in exchange rates was a negative 100 basis points, while net acquisitions and dispositions added 120 basis points. The results in organic revenue increase was 2.2%.","Worldwide, by client sector, we were led by strong growth in auto and transportation, followed by health care, financial services and consumer goods. We had decreases in retail and in tech and telecom sector.","As you can see on the bottom half of the slide, the organic increase to our Integrated Agency Network segment was 0.8%. The IAN segment grew both in the U.S. and internationally. However, this is the part of the portfolio which saw most of the decrease in Continental Europe.","At our CMG segment, we again saw strong performance with 9.3% organic growth in the quarter and 11.5% in the first half. We had very strong growth across public relations, sports, marketing and events.","Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., organic growth was 3.3%. This is well above the level we had been tracking for several quarters and reflects strong growth across many of our agencies and client sectors. It's also important to note that our total growth in the U.S. was 4.8%, which includes 150 basis points from net acquisitions over the trailing 12 months.","Turning to international markets, the U.K. decreased 1.3% organically in Q2, where it remains up 4.4% year-to-date. Performance in Q2 was primarily due to lower spend by existing clients.","Continental Europe decreased 8% organically. It's clear that macro conditions continue to weigh on clients willingness to invest in the region.","Revenue in the month of June was under notable -- notably more pressure than we had seen earlier in the quarter. Germany, which is our largest market in the continent and which had been stable last year, decreased in Q2. France, Italy and Spain were each negative as well.","The continent was 11% of our Q2 revenue. We have done extensive work to lower our expense base in Europe, and we'll continue to manage expenses to the revenue reality we face.","In Asia Pac, our largest market outside the U.S., organic revenue growth was 4.45% (sic) [4.5%] in Q2 on top of 14.3% a year ago. Our growth was led by the Australian market followed by India. We continue to expect solid regional growth for the full year.","In LatAm, Q2 organic revenue growth was 16.1%, an outstanding performance. We had contribution from McCann, Lowe, Media and CMG across all of the largest markets. Our Other Markets group decreased 1.8% organically.","Moving on to Slide 6. We chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 0.9%, which was updated to include Q2 '13 and the roll off [ph] of Q2 '12.","Moving on to Slide 7, operating expenses. Total salaries and related expenses were 63.8% of revenue in Q2 compared to 63.5% last year. More than 6 months, our SRS ratio was 68.3 compared with 68.1 last year. Severance expense in the first half was higher this year by 20 basis points. As a reminder, the first half will be a seasonally lighter revenue for us, which impacts our sale -- our salaries ratios.","Our total headcount at quarter end was 44,800, which is an increase of 2.7% over the course of the quarter. Over 40% of our additions were due to acquisitions closed in Q2, mainly in India. We also added talent to support our growth in LatAm, Asia Pac and new business wins in the U.S., as well as our high-growth digital, marketing services and media disciplines. Offsetting these recent investments were reductions in areas of the portfolio where our revenue decreased.","Incentive expense in the quarter was 2.8% of revenue compared to 3.3% in Q2 2012. Through 6 months, expenses for our long-term incentive programs decreased from last year due to shortfall in our 2012 performance compared with target. Through 6 months, our expense for annual incentives in 2013 is at the same level as it was a year ago.","Our expense for temporary labor was 3.6% compared with 3.7% a year ago.","Turning to office & general expense in the lower half of the slide. O&G was 26.3% of revenue in Q2, the same level as a year ago. It was $461 million compared to $450 million a year ago. Most of the increase was due to higher pass-through expenses, which are offset in revenue and are profit neutral.","As you can see on the slide, occupancy increased $3 million, which resulted in higher lease costs under renewal in New York and a double carry rent expense during agency relocations.","On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 9.6%.","Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 9, we ended the quarter with $1.62 billion of cash and short-term marketable securities, which compares to $1.5 million a year ago, an increase of approximately $110 million. The comparison reflects that we returned over $528 million to shareholders over the last 12 months in share repurchase and common stock dividends. As we've already mentioned, our June 30 cash balance includes $630 million, which was subsequently used to redeem debt.","On Slide 10, we turn to cash flow for the quarter. Cash provided by operations was $184 million compared with $157 million a year ago. Working capital was a source of $17 million compared with a use of $16 million in Q2 2012. Our investing activities used $43 million, chiefly for CapEx and acquisitions. Our financing activities used $122 million, which includes $105 million for the repurchase of 7.5 million common shares at an average price of $14.09 per share. Our common stock dividend used $32 million.","Slide 11 charts our debt reduction over the past few years. We had a short period of double carry following our debt raise last November, which is reflected here on 12\/31\/2012 and 6\/30\/13. Pro forma for the redemption completed on Monday, total debt of $2.3 billion on June 30 would be reduced by $600 million to $1.7 billion.","You'll recall that in November, we prefunded the redemption at a blended rate of 3.2%, which means the annualized reduction to our interest expense will be approximately $40 million.","We will record a charge in Q3 for the $30 million cash premium paid to redeem the 10% notes plus the write-off of unamortized costs. The total charge of approximately $45 million will be below the line and will not impact Q3 operating profit.","In summary on Slide 12, we are pleased with our growth in certain key markets in Q2. As we move to the second half of the year, we are focused on profit conversion under our revenue growth as well as managing through the challenges in Europe.","At this point, I'll turn it back over to Michael.","Michael Isor Roth","Thank you, Frank. Well, at the midpoint of the year, there are significant accomplishments that demonstrate the underlying strength of our agency brands and our long-standing commitment to organically developing digital talent and embedding it throughout our organization. These are the factors that are driving solid organic revenue growth and a strong record of new business wins, which continued in the third quarter. We remain new business positive for the year-to-date and trailing 12 months, and we continue to see a solid pipeline of opportunities across our organization.","The quality of our product is also highly competitive and trending positively. At Cannes, the industry top award competition, which recognizes the most outstanding work from the full range of marketing disciplines and across all media channels, IPG agencies took top honors. We won 30% of the Grand Prix awarded, more than any other holding company, including in the cyber, direct, film, integrated and PR categories. Draftfcb and McCann both enjoyed their best performance in many years, and McCann Australia's Dumb Ways to Die was the most awarded campaign in the 60-year history of the festival.","Whether in PR, in health care, communications or sports and entertainment and interactive marketing, our agencies consistently distinguish themselves in terms of industry recognition. This clearly shows that we have the people and the expertise to help our clients generate the kind of big ideas they need to win in the marketplace.","At CMG, we continue to see our agencies win market share, invest in digital talent and capabilities, as well as partner effectively to deliver an integrated offering. Weber Shandwick and GolinHarris are best-in-class in the PR sector, just as Octagon and Jack Morton lead the way in this respective areas of expertise.","Mediabrands once again delivered strong results with a progressive and client-centric operating structure that combines traditional media clout and leading-edge offerings across all digital platforms, as well as the industry's most developed pay-for-performance model.","McCann continues to show progress. New business has been positive, senior talent is being added and the organization is building momentum. It also benefits from a global network that is second to none and ideally suited to helping multinational clients succeed in the world's high-growth markets.","Draftfcb has faced revenue challenges this year to its 2012 client losses, but its holistic and highly accountable marketing approach remains right for today's clients' needs. The agency has made progress in raising the bar on its creative product, and we believe it'll attract talent and new business once the new leadership is in place.","Performance at our U.S. integrated agencies was solid in the quarter and for the first half. This group is particularly strong in key areas such as digital, strategic planning and creative. We've also been pleased to see successful management transactions at a number of these agencies that will ensure continuity and continued success.","Late last year, the Martin Agency named Matt Williams as its new CEO. And during the second quarter at Hill Holliday, Karen Kaplan became only the third CEO in the agency's 45-year history.","More recently, we announced a management succession at Campbell Ewald, where Jim Palmer assumes the CEO role. After an intensive 3-month collaboration that was instrumental in our Cadillac win, we also announced that Campbell Ewald would become part of Lowe, representing the network in the U.S. and providing it with a base from which to grow in this key market. Both the Lowe and Campbell Ewald leadership teams are very enthusiastic about this new partnership, as are we.","In conclusion, our second quarter results showed good revenue growth as we built on new business momentum that's been apparent since the beginning of the year. With growth, we have a proven track record of controlling costs and managing to the margin. This will be a primary focus for us and our operating teams during the balance of this year.","The significant deleveraging we've undergone and the strength of our balance sheet provide additional powerful leverage that allow us to support the strategic needs of our business and also return capital to our owners.","We have outstanding agency brands that are well positioned to help clients succeed in an increasingly complex media and consumer landscape.","Our long-standing strategy of embedding digital at the core of all of our offerings and agencies continues to prove itself, and our capabilities in high-growth BRIC and other emerging markets are strong across our major networks.","This combination of factors, plus the strong financial foundation and a focus on cost management, will allow us to deliver on our full year targets of organic revenue between 2% and 3% and a 50 basis point improvement in operating margin.","This in turn will drive continued shareholder value this year and in the years to come.","With that, I thank you for your support. And at that, we open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani of JPMC.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. First, you mentioned that the headwinds of, I guess, 2% is still hitting the second quarter from losses last year. Were there any -- was there any incremental benefit, I guess, in the third -- in the second quarter that was a bit of an offset from your sort of bigger headline wins like Chevy? Or is that really going to impact starting in Q3?","Michael Isor Roth","Thank you, Alexia. And boy, thanks for joining us this morning, Alexia. I don't know what time it is, but thank you. Well, first of all, obviously, we do have revenue in the second quarter from the new wins. But as we indicated, we're ramping up on the employee base and costs associated with that win. So we don't see a lot of incremental margin in the second quarter. Frankly, that's one of the reasons we have a drag on margin in the second quarter, because we've added to our employee base. Just to give you a perspective, our employee base and headcount exceeded by -- we added in this quarter a couple of hundred employees, so we won't see that impact until the third and fourth quarters. So there were some revenue, but not big margin improvements.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But if you're going to take a look at the third quarter -- and Michael, I have to ask about the third quarter.","Michael Isor Roth","What took you so long, Alexia?","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Taking a look at that, I mean, would you expect, with the headwinds coming off, maybe more of a benefit to the top line with some of the bigger account wins maybe coming on board? Would you expect a pick-up? And then I guess more specifically, on the weakness you saw in Europe in the month of June, I guess any color you can give us on that? Any onetime issue nature? Do you think it'll continue to be a bigger drag for the full quarter in Q3?","Michael Isor Roth","Well, if you do the math, obviously with our first half year results, we're expecting improvement in our margin in the second half as well as an increase in revenue because of our new business wins and, frankly, some new business wins we hope to announce in the third quarter. So that's how -- and the reason we were able to affirm what we said in terms of our objective of 2% to 3% organic and an increase of 50 margin points, if you will. So yes, we think the second half -- and traditionally, our second half is stronger on the revenue side, and we convert in the second half of the year. So that is the reason we're affirming, if you will. As far as Europe, as we indicated, June came in as a surprise to us in terms of its impact, particularly in Germany. Germany was positive last year, so there was a harder comp in June, if you will, for Germany. But that's still was an area that we have some concern about in terms of watching. And obviously, whenever we see a decline in revenue, we look at expense rightsizing, if you will. We don't have a lot of -- we never counted on a big recovery in Europe, as we've said in the prior calls, but this one particular impact in June was a little bit more dramatic than we were expecting. Hopefully, we'll see better recovery, but at this point, we can't comment on that.","Operator","Our next question is from John Janedis of UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Sticking with Europe, Michael, your results were a little bit weaker than some of your peers. Can you attribute that at all to maybe your market or category exposure? And do you need to see any kind of improvements to deliver the margin target?","Michael Isor Roth","Well, clearly, if you look at auto and transportation, which obviously was a very strong sector for us, most of the growth was in the United States. So that could account for some of it. If our competitors are stronger in Europe on the auto sector, that the answer to that would be yes, okay? The other thing is this business, we all have different clients in different sectors. In some quarters, we outperform our competitors. In other quarters, it's the reverse. And a lot of it has to do with where our clients come out. We have large multinational clients all over the globe, if you will. And in some cases, our clients spend differently. Unfortunately, our clients don't focus on our quarterly earnings. So therefore, how they spend is a different function. But I think you raise an interesting point on the auto sector because we are overweighted, if you will, on U.S. auto, and that actually bodes well for us for the rest of the year.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then can you just give us an update on McCann? And at this point, is Paris' full leadership team still in place?","Michael Isor Roth","Yes. McCann is, -- first of all, we were very pleased with its performance in Cannes. I mean, everyone -- historically, everyone looked at McCann as this strong global agency, and everyone looked to these smaller shops on the creative side. I think the performance of McCann and Draftfcb in Cannes was an indication that you could be a global network and really succeed on the creative side. So we're very pleased with the changes and the impact that both Harris and Gustavo and Luca are having in the marketplace, particularly with our multinational clients. One of the issues I've always said is we want to make sure that we keep the back door closed. And I think the entire team, they've been out there, Harris, I know, and Gustavo and Luca are all traveling and they're meeting with our clients, and I think they've done a tremendous job in settling down our multinational clients as well as focusing on new business. And I think that bodes well for us in terms of our achieving our objectives. And certainly, McCann is in a stronger position now that it's been in, and we expect it to continue. We're always looking to add talent. We just announced Chris Macdonald coming into the United States. That's a great addition to the McCann team. But we're always looking at it, but we're very pleased with our ability to recruit and the people we have right now.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So one final question for McCann then, Michael. Is it fair to say then any kind of incremental severance is now behind it?","Michael Isor Roth","We always -- it's an interesting question because we always say our severance number is around 1%, and we never -- we're always exceeding it. I think what that does is it shows that we are very strong in terms of matching our expense profile with our revenue. So if we're at 1% to 2 % -- 1.2% or 1.3% going forward. I think that seems to be more consistent as we go forward. And then again in Europe, it take -- the impact on Europe, it takes us a little more on severance because of the social rules out there. And if actions have to take place in Europe, those severance numbers are a little bit higher. But that's something we're going to look into as we go forward. But I think we view it -- whenever we take severance actions, we look for the payback on those actions. And obviously, we take them with a view towards improving our margin on a longer-term basis.","Operator","Our next question is from David Bank of RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So somebody had to ask about 3Q. I guess I'll push it a little bit further than that. No good deed goes unpunished, right?","Michael Isor Roth","Right.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So when you guys entered the year and you kind of set the guidance hurdles, obviously you knew there were some business coming in. But it sounds like there has been some additional momentum gains that have probably pleasantly surprised you. And you're not going to benefit from the full efficiencies and revenues of all that business, especially as you kind of onboard people and costs associated with rolling it out. So my question is clearly, you head into 2014 with the cost baked in and the momentum like really formed. So if we think about you being able to do 50 basis points on 2% to 3% in '13, can you give us some context for why it shouldn't be better in 2014?","Michael Isor Roth","Well, with -- I'd like to get through 2013 before I give you guidance on 2014. But if we keep the back door shut and we continue to improve on the revenue side and the macro economics continue to be growth, if you will, as opposed to entering into a recession, I think 2014 should be fine. And -- but at this point, we're focused on getting through 2013. But we're very focused on keeping the back door shut and looking at our costs because what you don't want to do is get ahead of it and anticipate a lot of things that until they happen, you don't want to have a cost profile. It's not you kind of build it and they will come. And I think that's one of the fundamental differences in our business these days. And that is, even when we pitch new business, we have to ramp up. And clients are understanding that -- you don't have 100 people waiting in a room to jump on new business as soon as it comes in the door. So whenever we have a pitch and it's a big one -- take, for example, the Acura win at Mullen. We've added a significant size of a headcount to support that business, and it was well understood in the beginning that we have to ramp up to do that. And that's the way our business model operates. So that said, if we keep our back door closed, we continue to focus on our existing clients, and when new business pitches come up, hopefully we'll win our -- more of our fair share or our fair share of new business wins, then 2014 should be okay, subject to macro economics. That's not forecast for 2014, but it's a mechanical calculation.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Can I just ask one quick follow-up?","Michael Isor Roth","Sure.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I think in your commentary, you had mentioned something about June being a bit of a surprise, kind of turned down in different places. And I was wondering if there's any more color on what drove it. And did you see a continuation of the -- do you see a continuation of the trend, like what happened?","Michael Isor Roth","Well, in June, what I said was in Europe, we saw a spike down, if you will, particularly in Germany and France actually. But that's -- I didn't say that was true for the rest of the company, I was focusing on why our European numbers were down. And July isn't over yet, so it's hard for me to comment on what impact it has on the rest of the year. But again, it's 11% of our total revenue. Not that, that's insignificant, but we didn't build in big recoveries for Europe. So that's why we're comfortable stating where we are in terms of our ability to achieve our goals.","Frank Mergenthaler","And we saw, David, softness in both global accounts and local accounts, in both of those markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Dix of Wedbush.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Just a couple questions. I guess just looking at the first half, how did margins come in versus your internal expectations? Obviously, as you had to adjust them for new business wins? And also, just within that, are incentives through the first half of the year kind of running kind of in line with or above or below kind of your original plan for the year? And then I just have 2 follow-ups from that, but I'll just stop there.","Michael Isor Roth","Well, first of all, I think Frank answered the question on incentives. It's -- because of our long-term incentives and we have to true it up and last year we were a little bit off, that accounted for some of the diminution in our incentive expense. And we manage this business on a full year basis. And whether we were on target or not, clearly whenever you have new business and you have to ramp up, the ramp-up isn't built into your objectives for the year for the -- so if you want to look at it that way, you don't build in. Unless you know the business wins are there, you don't build it into your plan. So that's why we look at this business on a full year basis, and there'll be spikes up and down on a quarterly basis. That said, what we're saying is that our incentives are in the range of 3.5% for the full year. That's a reasonable number to use based on us achieving our goal of the 50 basis point improvement. And it's clearly one of our levers so that if we fall short, then you can expect to see our incentives reflect that we fall short. We have a pay-for-performance model in terms of our networks as well as in corporate, and -- but we don't really see that until frankly the fourth quarter.","Frank Mergenthaler","James, on the margin expectation, it's probably tracking below where we thought for a very good reason because we've been very heavy on the new business. And for the softness in Europe, if you just take the second quarter, there's probably a 50 basis point impact on the second quarter margins for those 2 events. Just the onboarding of people behind the new business wins, which is, again, we'll see the return on it in the back half of the year. And then there's softness in Europe, where -- when you see June weaken, you can't adjust your cost base that quick so that had a negative impact.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Right. Of those 50 basis points, would you say still a majority of that was due to just the ramping on -- for the new business?","Michael Isor Roth","Between the 2 events I called out, it was 50 basis points. I don't want to be any more granular than that.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, no more granular than that. Okay.","Michael Isor Roth","Yes.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. And then I guess just intangibly then, I mean, are you feeling more or less confident in your full year outlook than 3 months ago or kind of about the same given all of the moving parts with the new business in Europe?","Michael Isor Roth","What we always do is we have our agencies and our network come in and talk about pipeline. I like our pipeline where it is now. We know we have some potential wins in the third quarter, hopefully, will be announced. And a lot of our forecasting is based on to -- what we call \"to be generated,\" which is business that we expect to win and so on. So right now, we're sticking to our -- what we said our objectives were. Obviously, the new business wins will help us in achieving our goals. And like I said, we're going to focus on revenue generation, cost containment in terms of getting our margins in line and keeping the back door closed. I mean -- and this business is just about that. Make sure you have the right talent, make sure you have the right offerings and service offerings that are competitive in the marketplace, don't let your expenses get out of line and win new business as it comes up. And right now, we're on track to do that.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Great. And then my last one is, just given the huge growth you've been seeing in some quarters, specifically Latin America, I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit on the growth of the overall market there and whether you're seeing any changes in competitive structure, which are helping you on a more recurring basis. Are certain competitors just falling by the wayside? Or -- I was just kind of curious as to your color on what's going on in that market there.","Michael Isor Roth","Well, we've -- in Latin America, we've always -- all of our networks, our global networks and our media offerings always -- and our marketing services business in -- are very strong in Latin America. We've done transactions in Latin America to bolster it. For example, with McCann, the W acquisition, CUBOCC on the Mediabrand side. So we're very comfortable with our positioning in Latin America, and I think our performance reflects the fact that we are competitive across-the-board and that kind of improvement just basically proves that fact. We have a lot of exciting things going on in Latin America, particularly in Brazil with the World Cup and with the Olympics coming down. So there's nothing to indicate that Latin America is going to have a dramatic reversal. Obviously, some of the social issues that have happened in Brazil raises some concern. But frankly, right now, we're very excited about what's happening down there, and we continue to invest in our people down there. And frankly, our clients are investing there, which is why we're seeing the improvement that we're seeing. So we're very comfortable with that market. India is another area where we've invested very strongly. In fact the last quarter, we had 3 transactions pretty much close in India, whether it be in the PR side of it, on the media side of it, and on the advertising side. So India performed high single digits in the quarter, and we see India as being a strong market for us going forward. So I think on the emerging markets, I believe we're very well positioned in terms of our global offerings, and we continue to invest behind our brands in those locations.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","I was wondering, can you talk about the costs that you tend to incur when you're actually launching a pitch or when you're choosing to participate in a pitch? Generally speaking, how do you think about benchmarking? So I think that most investors are unaware just how expensive some of these participating in pitches are let alone winning them. So that was my first question, and then I have a follow-up.","Michael Isor Roth","Yes. I mean, you're absolutely right. I mean, you've been on the other side, so you know. It's not unusual to see -- incur $1 million of expenses on a pitch. You want to put your best foot forward, and these days, it's very competitive. What's interesting is that we're chasing businesses that historically some of our global networks would have been too small for them. But right now, given the competitive nature of the landscape, we're all chasing businesses. And fortunately, the benefit as the holding company model is we have a number of offerings compete -- competing for the same business. So one of those -- take, for example, if we have 2 or 3 agencies competing on a particular client and one of them wins, the other 2 has incurred expenses that they're not going to recover. So we have to be very careful in terms of picking our battles. But yes, it's not cheap to chase these expenses -- these new businesses, and they run into millions of dollars. And that's why we say if you're going to do it, you got to win it. And so we take it very seriously. And you're right. And that certainly accounts for part of the expense profile that we build in to our forecast.","Frank Mergenthaler","And Brian, we see it in a temp labor line. The agencies that are more active pitching, their temp labor spikes.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Got it. And then clearly, so you really incur the costs at the time of the pitching and it's not being deferred?","Frank Mergenthaler","Sure, sure. Never -- nothing's deferred.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Right.","Michael Isor Roth","Yes, clients are great. They say \"Put your best foot forward.\" We go out and we incur production costs. I mean, if you look at some of the major pitches, we're actually running commercials to show our capabilities and our strategic thinking. And the economics of this is such that if you win and the strategic thinking and the creative that went into the pitch is the one that's adopted, then obviously you recoup it faster. You don't have to reshoot a lot of it. But there's a lot of mechanics here. And you're absolutely right, it costs money to win business. And I think you're seeing that in our results in the first half. But the good news is we won.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","That's true. So -- and just one. One other question then on Draft. Can you update us on the timing around the arrival of the new management team? And is it safe to say that any strategic changes or reorientation or any other changes are going to be waiting until then? Or is it like status quo for the agency until then?","Michael Isor Roth","Yes, we were thinking of a -- certainly, we've been looking at strategic changes. Carter will join us sometime in September, and we're excited about that. In the meantime, we're managing our business. And Neil Miller and the team at Draftfcb are doing a tremendous job. And in fact, we just had some positive news on some clients. And so, it's not that we're sitting around waiting, and we are doing recruiting. We are doing some recruiting along the way. Whether the timing of the recruiting will take place at the exact time Carter comes in at, we're running out of time, so it probably looks that way. But we're excited about what's on the horizon. Some of the people we've been talking to are really excited about potentially joining Draftfcb or, frankly have already signed on to join. And so I'm real excited about the team that when Carter finally arrives he'll be joining in terms of what the future of Draftfcb will hold. In the mean time, we're taking a -- over here in corporate, we're taking a close role, if you will, in the future of Draftfcb and managing it through this interim period.","Operator","Our next question is from Craig Huber of Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","Maybe a housekeeping question first, please, on currency. Frank, if the currency rates held flat, like they are, say, now, for the rest of the year, what would the currency impact, you think, be for the third quarter and fourth quarter on your overall revenues, please?","Frank Mergenthaler","Probably, for the third and fourth quarter, somewhere between 1.5% and 2%. And for the full year, about 1.5% negative.","Craig Huber","And then my other question is, is there any client reviews of significance here in the U.S. or overseas that investors should be aware of?","Michael Isor Roth","There are no significant reviews. We do have Pizza Hut up for review. It's a high-profile client. We've had it for a number of years, and a number of IPG agencies are pitching that business. But absent that, we don't have any big clients in review. Every time I say that, I worry when I get back to the office. I get a phone call saying we have a big one in review. But right now, I'm knocking on wood here, we don't have any big clients in review.","Craig Huber","And then my final question, Mike. On your 2015 operating margin goal of 13%, at the peer level of goals, margins out there, what is your thought on what sort of average organic revenue growth you would need here for the next 2.5 years in order to get to that full year of 13% margin goal for 2015?","Michael Isor Roth","Well, right now, obviously, we've used -- historically, our business has been 3% to 5% -- we're not quite there yet. Our forecast on -- from Magna is certainly for this year is 2% to 3%, maybe a little higher there. I think between 3% and 5% in terms of organic growth is something that you could use in terms of overall macro impact.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones for me. Could you please remind us of the geographic distribution of your first half headwinds this year? And then secondly, you alluded to a fairly sizable contribution in the U.S. from acquisitions. Could you just help us remember what those assets were?","Michael Isor Roth","The bulk of the headwinds were in the U.S. And on the U.S. acquisition front, we had a shopper marketing company that we bought. We had a health care company that we purchased. And those 2 are the largest.","Frank Mergenthaler","Right. The Chase Design and...","Michael Isor Roth","Hudson.","Frank Mergenthaler","Hudson Global.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt Chesler of Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of questions to help think about how the year plays out from here. One is focused on the U.S. So there were 200 basis points of remaining headwinds in the second quarter that you just finished. Do you have any that are worth calling out in the third quarter? Or should we be thinking that those are pretty much behind you? And then just related to the Olympics, clearly you benefited in the third quarter of last year in the U.K. I presume a lot of that was events related.","Michael Isor Roth","Yes.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","What was the distribution of the work that you can call out as globally? And to what extent did you have some of that in the third quarter in the U.S. last year or anywhere else?","Michael Isor Roth","No, I think the bulk of it was in Europe, and it was Olympic-related. So that is a headwind, if you will, in terms of comparisons. We don't have another Olympic in the third quarter.","Frank Mergenthaler","And I think last year we disclosed it was $20 million to $25 million.","Michael Isor Roth","$25 million, yes. But on other side of it, there wasn't a lot of margin associated with that business.","Frank Mergenthaler","No.","Michael Isor Roth","You want to do something about that at CMG, right?.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. But did you have any significant Olympics-related work that was serviced out of the U.S. as well?","Michael Isor Roth","Yes, no.","Frank Mergenthaler","No.","Michael Isor Roth","No, we don't have any, particularly in the U.S.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then I'm just interested in a little more color about some of the potential new business that you hope to announce in the third quarter that you referenced a couple of times on this call. So are these situations where you pretty much won the thing, but you're waiting approval from the clients? Or you're just really close and you're feeling good about that? And then just can you scale some of those? Are they on the level of the few that you announced for the second quarter?","Michael Isor Roth","Well, no, you don't get a -- there aren't big pitches like Cadillac lying around out there. There are a couple of media clients that are of size, and I'm fairly superstitious. So until it's signed and we can announce it, I don't like to count it as a win. But we're feeling positive about some of these on the media side and some traditional pitches as well. So again, there aren't any really big pitches out there right now. And as I said, you never know. But right now, we have some big, say, some media pitches out there. I'm reluctant to tell -- to name them because frankly, some of them may not have been announced and I don't want to jump in. But I think our pipeline is solid. Let me put it to you that way.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then in Europe, it sounds like the weakness that you saw in Germany, France and IAN that maybe wasn't in auto and transports, can you talk to the categories that drove some of that? Or CPG was a broad [ph] ...","Michael Isor Roth","What's interesting, it was across-the-board. We were looking to see if it was one particular area so that we can call it out and say it was an anomaly. But frankly -- again, remember the size of our business there is not significant. So therefore, small impacts add up, and that's what you're seeing. So you're not seeing a $10 million reduction falling to the bottom line. It's a lot of small stuff across these different markets that have affected us. And again, that's a -- hopefully, that will be a rub of the green in terms of our clients in terms of how they look at their spend, but we can't comment on that here.","Operator","Our next question is from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of questions. Frank, you gave some really good color on the quarterly impact from some of the moving pieces. But one was pass-through you mentioned up front in your prepared remarks. Can you just remind us sort of regionally where that shows up. And on the expense side, I believe that's other O&G, but just a little color on...","Frank Mergenthaler","Yes, it's in the O&G line. It makes up almost all of the year -- the quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year increase.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it.","Frank Mergenthaler","So the -- it's profit neutral. When I look at my actual cost base with O&G, they're effectively flat.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And is that mostly U.S. or just basically in line with your broader regional mix?","Frank Mergenthaler","It's somewhat consistent with our regional mix.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. Perfect. And then I wanted to ask on the balance sheet side and working capital as it relates sort of to the new IPG with your current ratings and balance sheet strength, but also then in terms of the ask from some big clients about turning the agencies into financing partners. Maybe you could put those 2 variables into the -- into your answer. But you -- I think you ended the quarter if you pro forma for the redemption, at like $1 billion -- one of your lower cash balances in a long time. Are you -- how should we think about your kind of net debt and gross debt plans going forward? And do you have any comment on how these payment term requests may or may not impact working capital particularly as we move into the back half of the year?","Michael Isor Roth","On the balance sheet, we -- if you recall, we had intentionally built up our cash on our balance sheet to get through the rating agencies and through the \"turnaround.\" And we always said we had excess cash on our balance sheet. And the fact that we returned $1.2 billion to our shareholders is a pretty good indication that we felt that and it was time for us not to -- there was no need for us to carry that excess cash on our balance sheet. So right now, we have -- after we pay off -- you take out the $600 million, assume we have $1 billion or so of cash on our balance sheet, we also have $1 billion credit facility available to us and other resources, so we're very comfortable with our liquidity position. And frankly, you don't want to carry all that cash on your balance sheet. It costs you money to do that. And frankly, we'd rather give it to our shareholders. So I think what you're seeing now is a good indication of what our balance sheet should look like. And the fact that we had onetime items, for example the sale of Facebook, and we just took all of that cash and returned it to our shareholders. So we're very comfortable with our liquidity, our cash available to us to meet our needs with our balance sheet. And hopefully, the final rating agency will realize the strength of our business and our balance sheet to give us that final upgrade so that we'd have investment grade across-the-board. On the issue of terms, procurement has been around forever. They're always arguing about fees. That's the nature of the business. And on one side, our clients are correct in asking us to be more efficient in terms of how we do the work. And we do that, and we work very closely with our clients in terms of the FTE model that's developed. And we have to be more efficient. And in this environment, given the pressures of margins, both for our clients as well as us, it's incumbent upon us to be able to do that. And in terms of terms, particularly on the media side, which is the one that you're probably referring to, everyone says we're not a bank. And we're not a bank. And I think we've taken the position, as well as some of our competitors, that those type of terms historically in our industry, this is the way we pay our vendors when we get paid, and that's the way it should be. And frankly, they shouldn't be looking to us to do their financing. And frankly -- and that's the way the model should work. And we have not seen a major impact on our business model, if you will, that would affect our business going forward right now. And frankly, hopefully -- a number of the multinational clients have come out and said, \"We're a partnership, and this is the way we should operate.\" And frankly, I agree with that. Most of our clients look at us and say, \"You're entitled to make a return on your business and we're prepared.\" And we're prepared to say, you know what, particularly on the media side, our pay-for-performance model reflects the fact that it's a partnership. And if we do it well, we should get paid for it, and that's how we get nice margins on the media side of business. So a lot's been talked about it, but I think on that particular aspect, I think we've all been fairly consistent that this is the way -- the historical way of doing it is the way it should be.","Well, I thank you all for participating. I hope you have a good rest of the summer and stay cool. And we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call.

All parties are in a listen-only mode, until the question-and-answer portion. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I\u2019d now like to introduce Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jerry Leshne","Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com. This morning, we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 A.M. Eastern.","During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company. These are subject to the uncertainties in the cautionary statement that is included in our earnings release and the slide presentation and further detailed in our 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.","We will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP measures, allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operating performance.","At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Jerry, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we review our second quarter and first half results. I\u2019ll start by covering the highlights of our performance, Frank will then provide additional detail, and I\u2019ll conclude with an update on our agencies to be followed by our Q&A.","We are extremely pleased to report strong second quarter financial performance. Our organic net revenue growth was 5.6%. Operating income increased 10.4% and our operating margin expanded 50 basis points from a year ago. U.S. growth continue to be strong at 4.6% in the quarter, while international organic growth accelerated to 7.2% paced by double-digit increases in the UK and Continental Europe and by growth in every world region.","The quarter reflects revenue increases across all disciplines led by exceptional growth in media and at our creatively led integrated agencies, our digital services, public relations, events and sports marketing. And the list of contributing agencies is long, most notably Mediabrands, McCann Worldgroup, FCB, MullenLowe, Huge, Weber Shandwick, Golin, Octagon and Jack Morton. This breadth highlights the distinctive competitiveness of our offerings based on the talents of our people, the expanding value of our data and analytics practices and our ability to bring collaborative open architecture solutions to market. Together, these strengths continue to drive outlook for our clients while furthering our leadership position in the contemporary marketing and media landscape.","In terms of client sectors in the quarter, we were led by increases in healthcare, financial services, government, consumer goods and auto and transportation. We saw increases from both net new business wins and existing client spend.","Q2 operating profit was $249 million and our net revenue operating margin was 12.8% compared with 12.3% a year ago. Our ongoing expense discipline drove operating leverage on our investment, in base payroll and our expenses for occupancy. Increased expense for incentive comp and SG&A in the quarter reflect our outperformance of operating targets through six months, along with our outlook for continued solid performance.","Through the first six months of the year, organic growth was 4.7%. Operating profit increased 10.6% and our operating margin on net revenue has expanded 30 basis points. Second quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.37 as reported and it was $0.43 as adjusted for non-operating impact of our disposition of certain small non-strategic agencies in the quarter. For the six months, diluted EPS was $0.34 and was $0.45 as adjusted. During the quarter, we used $60 million to repurchase 2.6 million shares.","Turning to our outlook for the year, you will recall that we came into the year with financial targets of 2% to 3% organic growth and 60 to 70 basis points of operating margin expansion. In April, following our first quarter, we raised our sights to the high end of the revenue growth range. At mid-year, we\u2019re confident that performance to-date and the current tone of business have us on track to deliver net revenue organic growth of 4% to 4.5% this year. We also remain well positioned to deliver on 60 to 70 basis points of net revenue operating margin expansion, excluding one-time deal expenses for our acquisition of AMS, which we expect in this year\u2019s second half and we\u2019ll call out accordingly.","This is an exciting time for our company. We continue to drive growth that leads our industry from a foundation of outstanding consumer insights, grounded in data analytics, standout creativity and precisely targeted communications. Further, our announcement earlier this month to acquire Acxiom Marketing Solutions means that as we work towards closing, we continue to have the pleasure of getting to know more of their people even better.","Together, we look forward to mapping the many shared opportunities ahead of us with unrivaled industry resources and data management that are poised to be further leveraged in the media and marketing world. The reception of our announcement by our people and the people of AMS and the support and enthusiasm of clients has been highly encouraging. Current thinking remains that the transaction will close early in the fourth quarter.","At this stage, I\u2019d like to turn things over to Frank for additional details, and after his remarks, I\u2019ll be back to provide an update on our agencies and our outlook, which includes AMS to be followed by the Q&A.","Frank Mergenthaler","Thank you, Michael. Good morning. As usual, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. A reminder, that earlier this year we initiated our reporting with the new accounting standard for revenue recognition, ASC 606. You will recall that we elected to restate 2017. This means we are directly comparing our second quarter and first six months of 2018 to 2017 results on the same revenue accounting standard.","On Slide 2, you\u2019ll see an overview of our results. Organic growth of our net revenue was 5.6% in the second quarter. That reflects strong worldwide performance with U.S. growth of 4.6% and 7.2% growth in our international markets.","First half organic growth was 7.4% with the U.S. up 4.5% and international growth of 5.1%. Q2 operating profit was $249 million, an increase of 10.4% compared to last year. First half operating profit increased 10.6%. Diluted EPS in the quarter was $0.37, but was $0.43 as adjusted for the impact of our dispositions of certain small agencies. $0.43 compares to adjusted diluted EPS of $0.30 a year ago, an increase of 43%.","For the six months, adjusted diluted EPS was $0.45 this year compared with $0.36 a year ago, an increase of 25%. Purchased 2.6 million shares in Q2. As a reminder, our repurchase program has been suspended effective with our third quarter due to the AMS transaction.","Turning to Slide 3, you\u2019ll see our P&L for the quarter. I\u2019ll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. Here, it\u2019s worth reminding everyone that the increase in billable expenses revenue is not included in our calculation of net revenue organic growth. Higher billable expenses and revenue were chiefly driven by the growth in our events and sports marketing offerings, but as we pointed out previously, are offset dollar for dollar in the billable expense line in operating expenses that have no impact on our operating income.","Turning to more detail on net revenue in the quarter on Slide 4; net revenue was $1.95 billion, which was an increase of 6.2% from Q2 2017. The impact of the change in exchange rates was a positive 1.4%, while net dispositions were negative 80 basis points. Resulting organic increase was 5.6%. On the bottom half of this slide, net revenue organic growth was 6% at our Integrated Agency Network segment, with contributions to growth from all IAN disciplines and across all our largest agencies.","CMG grew 3.7% organically. Again, all disciplines and all of our largest agencies contributed to our growth and CMG grew in every world region. It\u2019s worth pointing out that CMG\u2019s total growth, 6.2%, includes recent acquisitions in our digital and analytics services.","Moving on to Slide 5, net revenue change by region, U.S. organic growth was 4.6% in Q2. Increases were broadly shared across disciplines and agencies, most notably at Mediabrands, FCB, McCann, MullenLowe, Huge and our CMG marketing services specialists. In terms of client sectors, we are led in the U.S. by healthcare, auto and transportation, consumer goods, government and financial services.","Turning to international markets, we posted another strong quarter in the UK, which grew 14.7% organically, which was again led by our creatively driven integrated offerings at MullenLowe and McCann, along with growth at Mediabrands, R\/GA, Huge, Weber Shandwick, Golin, Jack Morton and Octagon.","In Continental Europe, organic growth was 11.7%, marking acceleration on the strength of new business wins and increases with existing clients. We grew in each of our largest national markets; Spain, France, Italy and Germany as well in many of the smaller markets. Asia-Pac grew 1.9% organically, highlighted by contributions from R\/GA, Weber Shandwick, McCann, Octagon and Jack Morton. Among our largest national markets, we had increases in China, Japan and India, while Australia decreased.","LatAm grew 4.6% organically. We continue to have very strong growth in Mexico, Argentina and Colombia, which more than offset ongoing macro headwinds in Brazil. Our reported revenue decreased in LatAm mainly due to the impact of currency translation.","In our other markets group, net revenue increased 3.8% organically, which reflects growth in all three regions; Canada, South Africa and the Middle East. We\u2019re led by FCB, McCann and Huge. Regional growth for the year-to-date period is also a strong picture. On the right-hand side of the slide, organic growth was 4.7%, with the U.S. up 4.5% and our international increasing 5.1%.","Moving on to Slide 6 on operating expenses, we are pleased with the expense discipline in the quarter. Net operating expenses increased 5.6% under net revenue growth of 6.2%. Our ratio of salaries and related expenses to net revenue improved by 60 basis points from a year ago to 66.4% net quarter. Underneath that, we had strong operating leverage on our expenses for base payroll benefits and tax. That was partially offset by higher expenses for temporary labor and for performance-based incentive compensation.","Our total headcount at quarter-end was approximately 50,600, an increase of less than 1% from a year ago. Office and other direct expenses were 17.1% of net revenue in the quarter compared with 17.4% a year ago, with the improvement driven due to operating leverage on our expenses for occupancy.","Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $29 million from $20 million in Q2 2017. The increase reflects higher accruals under our performance based incentive compensation programs and resulted in outperforming targets this year compared to underperformance in 2017. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $44 million from a year ago and was flat at 2.3% of net revenue compared to last year.","Slide 7 is the bridge from our reported diluted earnings per share of $0.37 to the adjusted $0.43 per diluted share. We had $19.8 million non-operating losses from sales of small non-strategic agencies which was $0.05 per share. The loss is reflected in our other expense line below operating income. For the six-month period, the adjustment is similar with losses on sales of businesses of $44 million and adjustment of $0.11 diluted share from $0.34 to $0.45.","On Slide 8, we turn to cash flow. Cash from operations in Q2 was $172 million compared with $219 million a year ago. Working capital used $63 million, a seasonally normal level, compared to $5 million generated from working capital in Q2 2017. And our investing activities use $35 million in the quarter mainly from CapEx.","Financing activities use $270 million chiefly for our common stock dividend, share repurchases and to pay down short-term borrowings. Our net debt decrease in cash for the quarter was $104 million.","Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 9, we ended the second quarter with $493 million of cash and equivalents. Our cash level is seasonal, as you\u2019ve seen over the years, and as shown here, tends to peak at year-end.","On Slide 10, we showed total debt levels at year-end over the past 11 years, and at the far right, we showed June 30th this year and last year. We\u2019re utilizing more short-term commercial paper and less term debt. As a result, our total debt as well as cash has been more variable over recent quarters than it has been previously.","In summary, on Slide 11, it has been a strong quarter in first half. We are pleased with our performance, and having increased our revenue target for the year, we remain on our front foot with respect to our financial and strategic objectives.","With that, let me please turn it back to Michael.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Frank. Appropriately, we\u2019re proud of our industry-leading results this quarter. Our organic revenue growth is an encouraging signal that certain marketers have, in fact, return to growth mode in their engagements with us. In addition, our strong performance in the U.S. shows that we can leverage opportunity in today\u2019s strong economy and in our largest market.","We continue to feel that our decision to embed native digital expertise across the portfolio, coupled with our decision to make media neutrality a differentiator for our company, has led to results like these. In addition, we are known as the employer of choice for diverse talent, which has helped us attract and retain the industry\u2019s most creative and innovative individuals.","Taken together, these actions have made IPG a more compelling and effective marketing partner for clients. In fact, during the quarter, IPG was named the Most Effective Holding Company in North America at the Effie Awards. Creatively, our agencies performed very well at the Cannes Festival. For the third consecutive year, an IPG agency took home the festival\u2019s most prestigious network honor in healthcare marketing. IPG agencies also won the Grand Prix in innovation as well as the Grand Prix in e-commerce. These are the two newest prizes at the festival, recognizing transformational work for clients at high-growth disciplines, the work our agencies did for Google and Microsoft, respectively.","Also worth mentioning is IPG\u2019s leadership status at the festival for our ongoing commitment to diversity and inclusion. We selected eight female-founded companies from around the world to participate in the R\/GA Cannes Startup Academy. We were the only official event to address MeToo and Time\u2019s Up Advertising at the festival. We brought Gloria Steinem and Tarana Burke to help surface important issues on this global stage, once again providing thought leadership to the entire industry.","Outside of Cannes, IPG has been recognized by a top industry publication for leading the way in training our global talent on GDPR. As you\u2019ve heard us say, our commitment to transparency and data governance will be significantly enhanced by Acxiom, which is the acknowledged industry leader in data ethics.","This sense of momentum continued at our recent mid-year business reviews where our operators indicated that the tone of the business is strong and that they have a range of opportunities in the second half of the year.","As a result, we\u2019ve raised our growth targets for the year. We now expect to post net revenue organic growth of 4% to 4.5% for the full year and are on track to hit our margin target, expanding 60 to 70 basis points before deal expenses. I will now move on to performance at the agency level and then provide additional detail on the Acxiom acquisition.","Highlights in the quarter were led by Mediabrands, which posted another very strong performance. Initiatives turnaround continued with two significant global wins, Converse and Revlon. The agency has also brought in a number of key regional accounts, notably the Western Australia Government, UM expanded business with Nestl\u00e9 in a number of key global markets. Reprise having recently consolidated Mediabrands mobile and social marketing under its banner grew its relationship with key clients like Estee Lauder.","The network to data tech offering including Cadreon is increasingly an area of competitive advantage for us and one that will benefit from integration with Acxiom data and capabilities. At McCann Worldgroup, the quarter saw continued solid performance as well as very high levels of industry recognition. McCann was named the Most Creatively Effective Agency Network at the global 2018 Effie Effectiveness Index. And its North American operations were named the Most Effective Agency network, Most Effective Individual Agency Office and won the Grand Effie for best in show.","At Cannes, as mentioned, McCann took home the creative e-commerce Grand Prix and was recognized once again as a top five network. In new business, McCann won the Godiva account and continues to expand its relationship with L\u2019Oreal. FCB posted strong performance and had a highly competitive showing in Cannes as well, which was led by FCB Health, which was named Healthcare Network of the Year. Overall, FCB had a strong showing with 11 of the global networks offices receiving creative accolades for 16 different campaigns.","On the new business front, FCB Healthcare network continues to win significant new business. In Chicago, FCB won a highly contested pitch for a global branding assignment for Kimberly-Clark. FCB Canada continued momentum by winning the largest agency consolidation pitch in Canada this year with BMO Harris Bank. And FCB Inferno in the UK recently retained one of the highest profile government accounts to promote women\u2019s fitness in a highly competitive pitch.","MullenLowe Group had a strong quarter across several fronts. The network won significant new accounts including the international business to the leading sweet biscuit manufacturer, Bahlsen. Appointed agency of record for advertising, digital marketing and media planning and buying for the UnionPay across 10 Asian markets and was named creative AOR for Cabify, the largest taxi app in Latin America.","Network also continued to accumulate awards. On the global front, they had their most successful year ever at the Cannes International Festival, winning 32 lines including the coveted Grand Prix in innovation, and ranking among the 10 most creative networks in the world.","You\u2019ll note, all three of our global creative networks; McCann, FCB and MullenLowe have been doing well, which is a proof point that shows the value of our strategy to invest in our brands. At Huge, new leadership in creative, design, strategy and technology was introduced and is positioning the agency for its next stage of development. The agency partnered with Amazon, an international advocacy group global citizen to host a two-day hackathon to raise awareness for international issues and create a platform for teams to develop ideas on the ground at Cannes.","R\/GA also shined at Cannes with its fourth annual startup academy. As I mentioned earlier, this year, eight female-founded companies from around the world to participated. During the quarter, R\/GA won prominent new business with Allied Financial and continued to make a number of major new appointments in areas including technology and design.","At CMG, we\u2019re also seeing increased momentum. As we have previously called out, Weber Shandwick and Golin are among the most highly awarded PR agencies in the business. Weber Shandwick continues to be ahead of the game in building digital expertise especially in social, data science and analytics. The agency was awarded global Agency of the Year at the PR Week Global awards for the fourth year running, and as senior leaders, we\u2019re honored on PR Week\u2019s annual power list.","Notable new business wins include IBM and Sony Electronics. Weber Shandwick expanded offerings in Latin America with the opening of its Bogota office and acquisition of Brazilian digital agency, Cappuccino. The agency is also in the process of launching its own management consulting offering to help clients build cultures that will further their business goals.","Golin had a particularly exciting quarter welcoming new female creative talent and the agency\u2019s first Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer. Golin also had a number of new executives recognized on PR Week\u2019s 2018 power list. The agency continues to take a progressive stance and welcome female creators back to the industry through the Have Her Back movement.","At CMG, Octagon was recognized as a founding partner in the Global Sports Venture Studio, the combined initiative by the Los Angeles Dodgers and R\/GA ventures. Jack Morton had a strong quarter and has seen continued interest in their experiential marketing services. Rogers and Cowan had a notable quarter with an acquisition of entertainment marketing agency, ITB Worldwide.","Our U.S. independents round out our portfolio. These agencies deliver a range of integrated services to our clients and also combined with the rest of the IPG offering on the collaborative open architecture solution. During the quarter, highlights within this group include Deutsch\u2019s win of H&R Block, Hill Holiday\u2019s win with Frontier, and EP and Companies win with John Deere. While the above highlights are significant in and of themselves, equally important news for IPG took place after the close of the quarter when we announced on July 2 our intent to acquire Acxiom Marketing Solutions.","This is a transformational step for our company that will ultimately impact every part of our organization. While our results this quarter are very strong, those of you who have been dialing in on these calls for any amount of time have heard us talk about the changes impacting our industry.","Business disruption from marketing clients, as well as seismic shifts in media and consumer habits, these changes represent challenges of course, but they\u2019re matched by significant opportunities to create high-value audiences for our clients by leveraging technology and the ability to demonstrate the effectiveness of our work through measurement. The Acxiom transaction directly addresses this changed marketing and media world in which the capabilities required a win and grow have evolved.","We feel that once it is completed, this transaction will position our company for the next decade of data-driven marketing solutions ahead of our peers as well as new entrants into our space. For decades, marketers have look to us as value-added partners to optimize the growing complexity of consumer interaction. In the contemporary environment, managing data at scale has become an essential part of that proposition.","With that opportunity, Acxiom Marketing Solutions bring decades of expertise and the best reputation in the industry for ethical standards and how they gather data as well as standards for respecting consumer privacy. This reputation means the company we are buying has relationships with many of the world\u2019s largest and most sophisticated marketers who trust Acxiom to manage their first-party data. Together, IPG and Acxiom can go to market as a trusted high-value partner that can successfully make good on the promise of convergence of data management and marketing.","The services we are acquiring touch all moments that a consumer interacts with the brand and it does so at scale. A company like Acxiom holds its data from 20,000 sources and then cleanses and organizes that data to provide a 360-degree view of each individual consumer and the preferences and behaviors that drive purchase decisions. This service makes us smart and more neutral, if anything, in how we advise clients, conduct planning and fit strategy.","Owning data is different from owning media inventory and then reselling that media inventory declines. Taking inventory and media positions rightly impacts trust. We, however, remain agnostic to media and to data. Instead, by owning a technology company that is known for helping highly regulated industries manage their personal information of millions of customers in a safe and secure way, we will be able to provide a unique and high-value service to our client that unifies information security, first-party data management with marketing solutions.","First-party data management is close to 70% of Acxiom Marketing Solutions\u2019 business. In our view, we can own that capability as well as an important data asset, but still plug into and use a wide range of additional independent data sources. That\u2019s what we plan to do, using AMS as a very strong core and enhancing it when and as required to meet specific client needs on a customized basis.","The area where neutrality does matter is the data reselling portion, which is staying with LiveRamp after the transaction closes. We will continue to have a long-term contractual relationship with LiveRamp and have access to their offerings as well other agencies. But we are buying is the ability to clean, manage and organize data so that it provides actionable insights. That intellectual property can become game-changing when you combine that skill with its assets of IPG portfolio.","For now of course, we cannot go to market together until regulatory and shareholder approvals take place and the transaction closes, which we expect to occur by the start of the fourth quarter. However, we already know that there\u2019s much opportunity for our combined offering based on inbound calls on both sides.","One additional thought before we go to questions. The Acxiom business we are buying is strong and healthy and we want to keep it that way. Our plan post integration is therefore to triage opportunities, starting with business synergies at a programmatic and media operations and moving out deeper into the organization from there. This rollout will be a key part of our planning with the management team in Acxiom as well as our own agencies over the coming months.","Now in closing, we are proud of our industry-leading performance in the quarter and our ambitious plan for the future. As always, we remain committed to strong financials and significant reduction in debt over the next few years as well as continuing to grow our dividend. We also expect to return to share repurchases after a period of time.","We\u2019re pleased that we are able to increase our target for organic growth for the year and expect to deliver revenue growth of 4% to 4.5%. We will also continue our long-term record of margin expansion and remain committed to the 60 to 70 basis point improvement we targeted coming into the year. We view our current performance and long-term strategy as significant factors that will continue to enhance shareholder value.","With that, I will open up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now being the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Alexia Quadrani","Hi, thank you. My first question is really on the impressive organic growth that we saw in the quarter. I mean, not is it only an improvement over the last few quarters you keep seeing, but also it\u2019s a big divergence, a real notable divergence between your results and your competitors. I know you mentioned that it\u2019s come from both \u2013 some new client wins as well as spending from your existing clients. But is there any more color you can provide, like what\u2019s really changed? I mean, if you look at your performance today versus maybe 6, 12 months ago, I guess what is the biggest sort of most notable change that\u2019s causing this improvement?","Michael Roth","I was wondering when I would say this. You don\u2019t accept the fact that we\u2019re just better than everyone else, right. Look, we\u2019ve been \u2013 if anything, we\u2019ve been consistent. We believe in investing in our brands and our people, and we continue to focus on that as a key go-to-market strategy, utilizing the open architecture platform where we keep our brands, we recognize the culture of each of our brands, but yet we respect all the offerings at IPG and we bring them in on a collaborative basis to be very client-centric.","That is the mantra of all of us at IPG, and frankly, it\u2019s working in the marketplace. We didn\u2019t have to restructure our entire company and we\u2019ve been doing this now for 12 to 13 years. And it\u2019s that culture and coupled it with talent that really resonates with our clients. They feel the commitment on all of our people with respect to the client-centric aspect of what they do and the ability to raise your hand and bring in other offerings within IPG.","And frankly, our clients, we have relationships with clients for 75 years and we have new business. And what\u2019s attractive about our results in this quarter, we did see a return to growth in our top 20 clients. As you know, that was a challenge going through the difficult period our sector was seeing. So we saw growth in our top 20 clients, but we also saw growth in the next level of clients that we have and we continue to see growth in the project-based business.","If you recall, we\u2019ve been talking about how our industry has been changing more and more to project-based performance. So we see that particularly in the digital offerings that we have where we see project-based businesses continue to grow. And in the CMG, whether it would be the PR, experiential, sports marketing, those businesses are performing well on a project basis.","So since we have the full offering, coupled with our outperforming media business, we really have the integrated offering that has resonated in the marketplace. So frankly, when you put that all together, I think that accounts for what we\u2019re seeing. We saw an improvement actually in CPG, which is \u2013 it\u2019s not a huge improvement. But for quarters now, we\u2019ve been seeing negative. So it\u2019s great to see that stabilize and actually be positive. Actually CPG was positive for us in the quarter both worldwide and in the U.S. We continue to see healthcare as a driving force. I mean, healthcare is 24% of our business and we\u2019re seeing double-digit growth and we have very powerful offerings between McCann Health and FCB Health. We have two of the best in the business and that\u2019s resonating.","And what\u2019s great about the healthcare business, it relies on very powerful data analytics and we have very strong data analytics already existing within IPG, particularly in healthcare side of the business. And if you couple that with the open architecture where we bring in our PR businesses which are performing on a global basis, you see the kind of results we have. So I\u2019m really proud of the way all of our strategies are coming together, and I think you\u2019re seeing that in our results.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you, that\u2019s great color. And just one sort of follow-up on improvement on Continental Europe where I think you did see a notable step-up in the quarter. Do you think that\u2019s sort of the same thing in terms of broad-based improvement from your clients, existing clients? Or do you see also some notable share gains there just because there is a particular divergence there with one of your peers?","Michael Roth","Well, in particular, we saw Mediabrands and McCann grow in Continental Europe, and there we did have some new businesses coming on board both at McCann as well as Mediabrands. So we saw that as a key driver. For example, in Spain, in France, obviously, some wins at McCann with a new business win at L\u2019Oreal. And we\u2019ve seen \u2013 that\u2019s where we saw consumer goods coming back a bit, in particular, Unilever and some of our auto. So it\u2019s a combination of new business and some existing clients returning to solid spend.","Alexia Quadrani","Perfect. Thank you so much, really impressive growth. Thank you.","Michael Roth","Thank you so much, Alexia.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Janedis with Jefferies. Your line is open.","John Janedis","Thank you. Michael, you touched a little bit on this in your remarks. But can you maybe give a little bit more in terms of organic growth at the top 20 or 25 clients relative to the overall portfolio? My sense is that you\u2019re gaining share wallet at some of the key accounts. And then separately for Frank; really nice margin expansion in the base and benefits line. Anything to call out there in terms of drivers? Thanks.","Michael Roth","Yes. Our top 20 clients, as you know, makes up a nice portion of our portfolio, and for a while there, it was level. Now we haven\u2019t seen a return in our top 20 of the growth rates that we\u2019re seeing in some of our new business and particularly in the healthcare and some of our tech and telecom clients. So that\u2019s accounting for the actual growth. But the solid spend on our top 20 clients on a global basis is sort of the bread and butter of our business, so we\u2019re pleased to see it.","But it hasn\u2019t come back to a point where it was like a year or two ago where those \u2013 the top 20 clients, their growth was, frankly, outpacing the rest of the company. So to be honest, it was great to see the growth coming back, but I think we have more opportunity now to gain, as you say, market share from those existing clients as we introduce the open architecture and pick up new business from those existing top 20 clients.","Frank Mergenthaler","And on the expense side, John, the only thing I would say is how well the team has controlled full-time headcount in the growth environment we saw in the quarter. This is the way the model should work. We saw some variable cost pressure around incentive compensation and temporary labor, but that\u2019s what you want to see with growth levels like this as opposed to bringing on significant amount of full-time employees.","John Janedis","Thank you.","Michael Roth","Thank you, John.","Frank Mergenthaler","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Peter Stabler","Good morning. Just a couple of quick ones for me. Michael, I\u2019m wondering if you could comment on the new business pipeline activity levels out there in the market right now and whether you think there\u2019s going to be sizable decisions in the remainder of the year. And then to what extent does your optimism for the second half, is that really a continuation of the current client spending trends and increases? Or does it imply or embed any ramping of new business activities from clients you won earlier this year? And that\u2019s it for me. Thank you.","Michael Roth","Let me take the second one first. There\u2019s no question, as a result, we\u2019re net new business positive that we will see some tailwinds coming into the second half, which is a nice position to have. So we have a combination of new business wins driving organic growth in the second half as well as continued spend both with our existing clients and the project-based businesses, which is what I alluded to in the first half. So I guess the answer is it\u2019s both and it\u2019s nice to not have headwinds going into the second half which we all have experienced in the past.","Our pipeline is solid. We have two major reviews on the way. One is one we\u2019ve been talking about for a while, and that continues to be the U.S. Army. I think we\u2019re heading close to a decision on the U.S. Army. A lot of things being written about that. Basically, what I\u2019ll say is we continue to do great work, the results of the work that McCann in particular is doing at U.S. Army is positive. I think the clients view it that way. And as you know, it\u2019s a retention pitch and a lot of our competitors are in this one. So we\u2019re anxiously awaiting the results of that. But with respect to 2018, we won\u2019t see any impact of any decision with respect to the Army. Obviously, the Army also covers other disciplines within IPG. So it would be a great retention if \u2013 as we\u2019ve done in the past, but that one, we\u2019ll just wait and see what\u2019s happening.","The other one is FCA on the media side of the business. That\u2019s been a great client and it continues to be a great client for Mediabrands and UM, and we\u2019re in the process of the finals on that pitch. I know there\u2019s been some changes in leadership in that organization and \u2013 but we think we\u2019re very well positioned. The team \u2013 we just saw the team yesterday, some of them, and they\u2019re feeling pretty good about it. So those are the biggest two in terms of risk and we have a number of clients and potential clients in the pipeline.","What\u2019s interesting, a lot of these new pitches now are under the radar. So we can\u2019t really talk about it because they haven\u2019t been put out there or if they\u2019re out there, the list of who\u2019s contending isn\u2019t listed. So you could assume if there\u2019s a major pitch out there that we\u2019re not precluded to from as a result of conflicts, we\u2019re participating. And usually it was creative, which we\u2019re participating with more than one agency, although the tendency these days is to see more media pitches than creative pitches out there.","Peter Stabler","Thank you, Michael.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Peter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.","Dan Salmon","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Michael, in your comments you mentioned that you\u2019re already getting the inbound calls on both sides regarding potential work together with AMS upon closing. Are those largely coming in, in the media area where you expect to start? Or are those proliferating across the holding company and the range of businesses that you could eventually see AMS working together with? That\u2019s the first one.","And then the second one for either you or Frank, we see the higher organic revenue guidance, but holding the margin at the same level. I was just curious, is that incentive comp catching up? Is it investment in some other areas lower-margins top line growth? We\u2019ll just be interested a little color on holding the margin in light of the raised top line. Thank you.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Dan. We thought that was going to be the first question actually. Look, it\u2019s a combination of both. Obviously, as our performance is stronger, we see incentive comp kicking in, which is the way it\u2019s supposed to work. If our business units perform, that\u2019s how our incentive comp works. So we see that. And we also \u2013 as we onboard new business wins and as organic growth is there, we tend to invest more in people and in our brands. And so I think part of that reason is why we held the margin expansion. And candidly, 50 to 60 basis point margin improvement is a pretty strong improvement. So we felt it\u2019s best to be cautionary in terms of margin expansion, although we do see line of sight into the organic growth number that we put out there.","Fascinating question about the \u2013 where the calls are coming. Most of the calls and discussions are around media, of course. In fact, Philip, myself and the rest of the team were down in Conway Arkansas meeting with the team, and it was really amazing because they have teams servicing these really large multinational clients that they have. Remember, AMS, they represent 50 of the top 100 Dow Jones \u2013 S&P companies and they have teams.","And all of these teams, just want \u2013 they were chomping it a bit to see how they could work together with us. So it was really exciting to see. They have an aggressive culture of how they expand their businesses and they see this as a tremendous opportunity to add value to these clients. Remember these clients are sticky clients. They\u2019ve been there for years. We did extensive due diligence on how these clients view AMS, and uniformly, the feedback we got on the due diligence was they were \u2013 they obviously, they\u2019re very able. They are great in terms of responsiveness and their relationships couldn\u2019t be better. So that was really exciting for us when we met these teams down there. And on the other side, our existing clients are anxious to see what we can bring to the table and how it works.","And in fact, frankly, it is on the media side, but on the IPG side, we actually have to hold back the rest of our agencies, which is why I put the comment in the opening remarks. We don\u2019t want to inundate AMS all at one time and overload them. But all of our agencies are calling in to see how they can work with AMS to enhance their opportunities. And frankly, on some new business pitches, we see opportunities where we can pitch together and add value. So this is really very exciting for us. And as we dig deeper into this AMS, we get more excited about the opportunities.","Dan Salmon","Okay, great. Thank you.","Michael Roth","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Tim Nollen","Hi, guys. Thanks. Hard to find things to complain about here \u2013 I shouldn\u2019t complain. Two points of clarification please. One is on the operating margin. I think I\u2019ll ask the question the other way around from the previous version. Your year-over-year organic growth comp gets a little bit difficult in the second half versus first half, not a little bit more difficult. I think your operating margin expansion is up 30-basis points in the first half.","I guess your answer is going to be you saw operating leverage at scale. But the question is why would you have an acceleration in the operating margin expansion in the second half given those starting points? And then secondly, working capital. I know it swings usually out in Q1 and back in, in Q2. It looks like maybe it couldn\u2019t \u2013 back in Q2. Your receivables balance did go up a bit again I think in Q2. Could you please just talk about that? Thanks.","Michael Roth","Well, our business is seasonal, and as you know, the fourth quarter, for example, accounts for, a lot of our revenue growth as well as our margins. So that accounts for the back end \u2013 back half of the year being better expansion than the first half of the year. I\u2019m sorry, your other question had to do with working capital. Working capital has always been very volatile, Tim. And we saw significant inflows of cash in the fourth quarter 2017. That generates significant outflows first quarter of 2018. Go back and look over time the amount of outflows first half of the year is kind of in the realm of consistency. So there\u2019s nothing abnormal going on there, and primarily it\u2019s driven by the volatility in media.","Tim Nollen","Okay, thanks.","Michael Roth","You\u2019re welcome, sir.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Wieser from Pivotal Research. Your line is open.","Brian Wieser","Pivotal Capital Research. You simplified some of your Mediabrands business, as you mentioned. You combined Ansible Society to Reprise. Curious if \u2013 when you consolidate business units, just simplify the branding in that context if you have seen or expected to see incremental revenues or you see reduced cost or if you see other financial impacts. And a second question also I guess inside of Mediabrands. I was curious about Cadreon and the degree that\u2019s contributing to growth.","It\u2019s become unique and that it\u2019s now \u2013 it\u2019s really the only \u2013 you\u2019re the only holding company that only has a centralized trading desk option rather than a brand trading desk or an agency level trading desk. I get the sense that centralized ones more profitable than the agency level ones. So just curious about your thoughts about how durable and maybe the direction to continuing to keep the centralized trading desk versus the agency trading desk content.","Michael Roth","Sure. Look, the consolidation under the Reprise had two aspects to it but the main driver was the revenue growth. The synergies among those businesses are compelling, having one leadership over the Mediabrands as a business unit. It\u2019s compelling, and frankly, we\u2019ve seen positive results. Rerpise has performed very well in terms of their growth. And so we\u2019re pleased with that move and we think that\u2019s the way it should go as we go forward. Cadreon also is performing very well, and yes, it was intentional. Remember Cadreon was an organic growth vehicle for us. It started locally.","It\u2019s now expanded globally, and candidly, we see Cadreon as a key beneficiary of the AMS transaction because there are a number of clients within AMS that we currently don\u2019t perform services at IPG and programmatic buying on a centralized global basis that Cadreon brings to the table with its expertise is something that we see is a huge opportunity for us. And it\u2019s not inconsistent for many of these companies to use separate providers for programmatic buying. So that was a key component of some of the revenue synergies we see going forward. So we\u2019re very pleased in terms of what Cadreon is doing and the way it\u2019s structured. And I don\u2019t know what other companies are doing in terms of putting them within brands but I think I\u2019ll let the Cadreon performance speak for itself in terms of how we operate.","Brian Wieser","Thank you very much.","Michael Roth","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Cahall with RBC. Your line is open.","Steve Cahall","Yes. Thank you. So a few weeks ago, I think you talked about Acxiom as being accretive to your organic growth rate and now your organic growth rate expectations are a little higher. So I guess my question is, do you still expect Acxiom once you close that to be accretive to your new slightly last year organic growth rate? And then I have a follow-up on Mediabrands.","Michael Roth","Well, first of all, we don\u2019t have anything built into 2018 for AMS. So that\u2019s a pure organic growth. And yes, once we close on the transaction, we view it as positive to our overall organic growth and, frankly, accretive to us from a financial point of view. So yes, nothing that you \u2013 anything that we\u2019ve been talking about 2018 excludes any impact other than the expenses. One of the reasons that we called out expenses not counting against the margin is when we close in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll be booking the expenses for the transaction. Candidly, the accountants don\u2019t let us capitalize those expenditures as they used to. So we\u2019ll have a P&L hit for those expenses, a onetime nonrecurring expense with every quarter that we close the transaction.","Steve Cahall","Okay. And then maybe just another one on Mediabrands. That seemed like a business that\u2019s growing well. I was wondering if you\u2019d be willing to give us what the growth rate of Mediabrands is or at least maybe give us what you think it is as a percentage of the portfolio. It just seemed like it\u2019s been a big driver and you\u2019re taking share and it\u2019d be great for us to sort of size the headroom if we understood maybe what percentage of the portfolio the media business is at this point. Thanks very much.","Michael Roth","Yes. I know. Our competitors would like to know that too. So I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to give you that, but I can assure you that one of the reasons for our growth certainly is the growth in Mediabrands and it\u2019s not just Mediabrands. It\u2019s our \u2013 it\u2019s the business units within Mediabrands that are growing very nicely. We saw our initiative with their global wins. UM continues to perform well and Cadreon and Reprise are all growing. So Mediabrands is a great performer and it\u2019s consistent, and obviously, we like the margins coming out of that business as well, but we don\u2019t call that out.","Jerry Leshne","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","Yes. Hi, good morning. Could you just give a little bit more color, if you would, on some of the categories \u2013 sector categories that did not perform well? You\u2019re very good about the ones who did really well. I\u2019d like to hear that, please. And then also GDPR, could you maybe just talk a little bit about that? Any potential changes on digital spend? Are you seeing much changes out there with your clients, please? Thank you.","Michael Roth","Sure. Thank you, Craig. Well, GDPR, we did see a little bit of a confusion in May when the whole thing was kicking in but it\u2019s pretty much settled down. Now we\u2019ve spent a long time getting ready for GDPR, and so we were very pleased. We actually have a presentation to our board on how we\u2019re positioned with GDPR. And I think the transition and the issues have gone very smoothly for us. So we saw a little bit of a slowdown in May but it seems to have come back to normal. I think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening in the industry. I think I read a piece this morning that said that. So yes, GDPR.","And we view this as an opportunity again for Acxiom. The privacy issues are clearly not going away and we know there\u2019s been an initiative in California. I would expect to see that expand throughout the United States. And good trustworthy first-party data that\u2019s cleansed and clean, if you will, is going to be a valuable asset of both the clients and working with us. So it\u2019s another reason why we think the Acxiom transaction is a plus.","The sectors that quite aren\u2019t performing as well, we see some strain on the food and beverage side of the business. Some of that had to do with some existing client cutbacks. Retail was not doing as well as it has in the past. There too, we saw \u2013 some of that was some client losses and some pullbacks in major companies.","Second, tech and telecom is interesting. Our new business on tech and telecom, we\u2019re doing quite well and it\u2019s growing. Some existing clients in the tech and telecom sector had some major cutbacks. So that, frankly, was outweighing some of the new business wins and growth. But I\u2019d say the tech and telecom on a global basis is doing a little better than in the U.S. and we hope to see some of those clients begin to start spending again because, frankly, they\u2019re in very competitive markets and they have to spend in order to compete. So we hope to see that spend coming back but it was really one or two major companies that had a drag on tech and telecom.","Craig Huber","And then also, Mike, if I could just quickly ask, the contribution in the quarter from net new wins, I thought that was roughly 200 basis points of added growth organic. Is that too high? What\u2019s your general sense? What\u2019s the outlook for the back half of the year for net new wins? How much will that help you think?","Frank Mergenthaler","Craig, we had a terrific organic quarter and we just upped our guidance for the full year. We\u2019re not going to get in that much granularity.","Michael Roth","Well, we do have tailwinds in the second half, which obviously accounts for our comfort level in the revised organic growth.","Craig Huber","Okay. Thank you.","Frank Mergenthaler","Thank you.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Craig.","Operator","Our final question comes from Richard Eary with UBS. Your line is open.","Richard Eary","Thank you. Just a couple of questions from my side. Obviously, on the call, you mentioned, obviously, a very good strong performance from Mediabrands. If you just look at the creative agencies, I think in the first quarter, you called out that you had seen a recovery in some of the creative agency signs, ex new wins. I\u2019m just wondering whether you could sort of like talk a little bit more about how that performed in the second quarter, whether creative had come back. That\u2019s the first question.","Michael Roth","Yes, I think I called them out. Actually, all three of our global networks performed quite well in the quarter as well as our \u2013 some of our independents in terms of net new business wins. I mean that\u2019s what I\u2019m excited about in our results. It\u2019s Mediabrands and it\u2019s the creative-driven agencies and some of it is through the open architecture. So, yes, you see the McCann, the FCB and the MullenLowe is performing well. It\u2019s nice to see them in the growth mode that they\u2019re in. And frankly, the tone of the business from those business reviews was positive, which is why we\u2019re feeling comfortable about the numbers that we put out.","Richard Eary","Is the growth rate similar to the organic growth rate for the group as a whole? Or it still creates a bit of a lag relatively overall growth?","Michael Roth","Yes. I mean, it\u2019s a blended growth rate that we use. Some of our agencies are doing better than others. And one of the benefits of a holding company is exactly that. It\u2019s a holding company. We have multiple assets in multiple regions, in multiple disciplines. And if everything\u2019s going well in those markets, where it\u2019s maybe a challenge in other markets, it\u2019s going well. And that\u2019s what accounts for, in this case, a positive organic growth. So it\u2019s a blended organic growth as well as margin. And in one quarter, it may be more creative, but Mediabrands has been doing quite well consistently over the number of quarters and we\u2019re excited about it.","Media is \u2013 just look at the reviews that are out there. It\u2019s where a lot of the action is right now in terms of reviews and value-added in terms of the tools and resources that we bring to the table. So it\u2019s not unrealistic to think that a lot of the growth that we see going forward still comes from Mediabrands but it\u2019s nice to have the blended organic growth that we\u2019re getting throughout the organization.","Richard Eary","Just as a second question. Just looking at the guide, you obviously said, you expect there\u2019s going to be some tailwinds into the second half with account wins. You did 4.5% or 4.7% in the first half and now guiding 4.5%. Are there sort of headwinds in the second half that we think about outside of the big two account reviews underway?","Michael Roth","No, we think \u2013 in fact, we have tailwinds going into the second half. That takes into consideration. That\u2019s a net number. When we say tailwinds, that\u2019s net of headwinds. So we have more good news and bad news so far.","Okay. Well, thank you very much. Obviously, we\u2019re excited about the results. We\u2019re very proud of our organization and the people and we look forward to our next call. Thank you so much.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect at this time."],"11888":["The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.

All lines are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jerry Leshne","Good morning. Thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website interpublic.com. This morning we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 Eastern.","During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company. These are subject to the uncertainties in the cautionary statement that is included in our earnings release and the slide presentation and further detailed in our 10-Q and our other filings with the SEC.","We will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful supplemental data that while not a substitute for GAAP measures allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial performance and operational performance.","At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Jerry, and thank you all for joining us, this morning, as we review our results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019. As usual I'll start out by covering the highlights of our performance, Frank will then provide additional details, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies to be followed by our Q&A.","We're pleased to report another quarter of solid financial performance. Organic growth of our net revenue was 1.4% in the quarter, that's on top of 5.4% a year ago, as well as revenue headwinds, which brings organic growth over the first nine months of this year to 3.5%. The organic growth of our international markets continues to be strong at 4.5% in the quarter driven by our performance in LatAm, Continental Europe and Canada. Growth slowed in the UK and Asia PAC continue to be challenging with varied performance by national markets.","In the US our organic change with a negative 60 basis points against 5% growth in Q3 last year. This result includes underlying growth across many of our US agencies and disciplines, but as expected, also reflects headwinds from the account activity towards the end of last year, which we've talked about on previous calls. These losses year-over-year resulted in the US headwind of 4.8% in the quarter. Overall our performance, taking into account the headwinds and industry leading comes from last year, along with positive net new business this year, demonstrates that our business remains highly competitive and on the right track.","Looking at our operating segments, our Integrated Agency Networks grew 1.2% organically in the third quarter led by Mediabrands and FCB Health. The impact of the headwinds is felt primarily in the IAN segments. Organic growth at our CMG segment was 2.1% based by Weber Shandwick, Octagon and FutureBrand. In terms of clients sectors, we saw continued global increases across a very broad range of verticals. That includes healthcare, financial services, retail, tech and telecom and consumer goods. The auto and transportation sector decreased mainly due to last headwinds.","The total growth of our net revenue in the quarter was 8.7%. That includes organic growth, as well as the impact of year-over-year currency changes, plus acquisitions and dispositions. Within that we continue to be pleased with the growth of Acxiom which remains on track with our expectations with accretive growth and margin performance. It's worth noting that we made a handful of new debt dispositions in Q3 as we continue our actions with respect to small, non-strategic business units around the world.","Turning to EBITDA and operating income in the quarter, EBITDA was 302 million, an increase of 8.7% from last year's third quarter adjusted EBITDA. Operating income was 280.3 million. Diluted earnings per share was $0.49 as adjusted for amortization of acquired intangibles and business disposition expenses and was $0.42 as reported.","Looking at the first nine months of 2019, our organic growth was 3.5%, with contributions for both our IAN and CMG segments, driving adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 90 basis points. Our growth is CMG was led by Weber Shandwick, Octagon and FutureBrand. IAN was led by IPG Mediabrands, and also highlighted by the growth of our global creatively led agency networks FCB McCann and MullenLowe.","It continues to be clear that our strategic decisions and the execution by our operators continue to serve our clients distinctively well and set us apart in our industry. These include our open architecture structure, our sustained investment in strong agency brands, a foundation of digital competencies in all of our agencies, our commitment to transparency, and to best industry talent, and unique enterprise level data management capabilities.","Therefore, heading into our important fourth quarter, we remain confident that the strength of our offerings, our performance to date, and the current tone of business have us well positioned to achieve our financial targets for the year. That is the high end of two to 3% organic growth, which is inclusive of headwinds and 40 to 50 basis points of margin expansion over last year's margin bringing us to 13.9% to 14%.","At this point is my pleasure to turn things over to Frank for additional detail on our performance, and then I'll return with an update and highlight of our business.","Frank Mergenthaler","Thank you, Michael and good morning. As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast.","On Slide 2, you'll see a summary of our results. Third quarter net revenue growth was 8.7%. Organic growth was 1.4% with international growth of 4.5%, while the US decreased 60 basis points to the impact of headwinds. As we have described previously, the headwinds are the results of the connectivity in the fourth quarter of last year namely FCA media, US Army and Volkswagen US, which together weighed on US growth by negative 4.8% in Q3.","Q3 EBITDA was 302 million compared to the adjusted EBITDA of 277.8 million a year ago, an increase of 8.7%. For the quarter adjusted diluting earnings per share was $0.49. The adjustments exclude the amortization of acquired intangibles and exclude non-operating losses due to the disposition of certain small non-strategic agencies.","Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. On Slide 4 for Q3 and nine months net revenue, net revenue in the quarter was 2.06 billion compared to Q3 '18, the impact of the change and exchange rates was a negative 1.3% with the dollar stronger at all of our International regions. Net acquisitions and divestitures added 8.6%, which includes the impact of Acxiom and smaller acquisitions less our dispositions. The resulting organic increase was 1.4%.","As a reminder beginning in the fourth quarter Acxiom's revenue growth will become a component of our organic revenue change. At the bottom of the slide, we break out our operating segments. As you can see, our IAN segment grew 1.2% organically. Underneath that result was growth in media led by IPG Mediabrands, and our global creatively led integrated offerings, notably FCB health and McCann World Group.","Total Revenue Growth at IAN was 10.3%, which reflects acquisitions including Acxiom, dispositions concurrency changes. At our CMG segment organic growth was 2.1% in the quarter driven by our branding specialist FutureBrand, Octagon and sports entertainment marketing and Weber Shandwick and public relations.","Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region, in the US our third quarter organic change was a decrease of 60 basis points against last year's 5% and weighed down by the impact of headwinds that we're working through. In our IAN segment, we continue to see solid growth from our global creatively led integrated offerings at FCB and MullenLowe and from Carmichael Lynch. It's worth noting that total US growth was 13.1% due to the net impact of acquisitions, including Acxiom less dispositions.","In our international markets, we had another strong quarter with organic growth of 4.5%. In the UK, organic growth was 0.5%, which is on top of 6.8% a year ago. Mediabrands and Weber Shandwick lead our growth in the quarter. While our growth slowed or the first three months period due to normal variability in projects, it follows three years of very strong growth in the third quarter in the UK. In Continental Europe organic growth continued strong at 6.6% on top of 5.8% a year ago. This was highlighted by increases in Germany, France and Italy.","In Asia PAC net organic revenue decreased 50 basis points in Q3. Among our largest markets, we again had solid growth in Japan and India. But that was all set by soft results in China and Australia. In LatAm we grew 23% organically, with strong organic growth across the region led by Brazil. Organic growth in the region was 24% over the first nine months. In our other markets group organic growth was 3.5% led by Canada.","Moving on to Slide 6 and operating expenses, which were again well controlled in the quarter? A ratio of total salaries and related expense to revenue was 64.7%, an improvement 130 basis points from a year ago. The improvement reflects our discipline in the organic growth of expenses and the benefit from the consolidation of Acxiom. Underneath that with solid operating leverage on our base payroll benefits and tax and our expense for incentive comp, temporary labor, and all of the salaries related expenses.","At quarter end total headcount was approximately 54,300, an increase of 5.7% from a year ago, mainly due to the addition of Acxiom. Our office and other direct expenses was 17.8% of third quarter net revenue compared with 16.7% a year ago. Within Office and other, we leverage our expenses for occupancy by 50 basis points from a year ago. That was more than offset by the addition of Acxiom, which is accretive to our overall margins, while consolidating relatively more investment in data and technical.","Our SG&A expense was 50 basis points of Q3 net revenue, which is the same as a year ago after adjustments for deal expenses in Q3 '18. Our expense for depreciation and amortization increased due to the consolidation of Acxiom this year.","On Slide 7, we present detail on our adjustments to reported results on the quarter in order to provide better transparency and a picture of comparable performance. This begins on the left hand side with a reported results and steps through from an operating income to EBITDA and our adjusted diluted EPS.","Our amortization expense acquired and intangibles was 21.7 million resulting in either of 302 million. Below operating expense we lost in the quarter of 7.7 million in other expense related the disposition of a few small non-strategic agencies. At the foot of this slide, you can see the after tax impact for diluted share of these two adjustments. They net to $0.07 per share. The difference between the reported diluted EPS $0.42 and adjusted of $0.49.","On Slide 8, we show similar adjustments to results for the first nine months. This also brings in the impact of the restructuring charge from Q1 and the tax elements from our second quarter. As you can see on the last line, this is a bridge between $0.84 per diluted share and $1.05 which compares to $0.97 per share in 2018.","On Slide 9, we turn the cash flow in the third quarter. Cash from operations was 225 million compared with 231 million a year ago. Within that working capital used 47 million a typical level given the seasonality of our business, compared to a use of 30 million in Q3 '18. Investing activities used a net 43 million in the quarter primarily related to CapEx.","Our financing activities used a net 253 million in the quarter including another 200 million toward repayment of our term note and 90.8 million for our common stock dividend, offset by 41 million and increase in our short term borrowings. Financing cash flow a year ago reflects the issuance of long term debt during the quarter in anticipation of closing our acquisition of Acxiom. Our net decrease in cash for the quarter was 93 million.","Slide 10 is the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with 520 million cash and cash equivalents. Our cash balance a year ago, which is on the far right of a slide includes proceeds of debt issued to finance the Acxiom acquisition. Slide 11 depicts the maturities of our outstanding debt, with total debt at quarter end of 3.6 billion, a decrease of 200 million during the quarter.","In summary on Slide 12, our growth and margin expansion over the first nine months of the year have us well positioned to deliver on our financial targets as we head into our very important fourth quarter. Our teams continue to execute very well. Our balance sheet continues to be a strong and meaningful source of value creation.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Michael.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Frank. Our results reflect a quarter of solid financial performance and position us to achieve our 2019 financial targets. The organic revenue growth we've posted despite headwinds and challenging comps is a clear signal that our existing clients remain in an investment mode when it comes to our services. And that our agencies continue to add value and are sought out by new clients, which is why we're net new business positive this year.","Growth in the quarter came from a range of IPG agencies, regions and clients sectors, demonstrating the depth of a strong agency brands, our innovative offerings and our talented people. Our continued strength in the market is due to a series of strategic steps we have taken over many years at IPG. We recognized early on that consistent investment in top industry talent and in IPG agency brands and the vibrant individual cultures would be essential for long term success. We brought top strategic, digital and creative leadership to IPG. And have deployed this talent to build great teams, and customized programs that add value and win market share for clients.","We also invested in embedding modern digital offerings and expertise into all of our agency brands. We pioneered the open architecture model, which brings the best agnostic solutions to global clients in a way that moves their brands across the consumer landscape. This client centric approach is currently deployed across many of our largest clients worldwide. Open architecture is enabling clients to reap the benefits of all of IPG's assets; customized offerings that help them address the demands of a fragmented consumer and media environment.","To note Acxiom now has a prominent seat at the table with our top open architecture clients. That is because clients increasingly recognize that the future of marketing is data driven. Marketers are looking to leverage their own first party data, coupled with other strategic data sets to create more seamless and connected consumer experiences at scale. What that means is that expertise in managing first party data and PII at scale is indispensable for a high value media and marketing services partner. Ultimately, we are seeking to achieve people based marketing.","As such, we will be held accountable to meet an elevated set of demands and responsibilities for ethical sourcing, collection, curation and compliant deployment of data from all sources, including third parties. That is why we feel very strongly that what is worth owning is the highest level of capability and expertise in data management. That is a significant and increasingly necessary differentiator in today's world. It makes the company like ours a more strategic business partner for our clients.","Looking forward, there are many ways more data use cases that we are increasingly getting involved with ranging from powering ecommerce to the execution of true omni channel media, which is why we launched Kinesso this quarter, which brings together top data and technology talent with addressable media experts and will allow us to further leverage Acxiom's assets, as well as other Mediabrands ad tech and martech capabilities.","This new technology layer within our offerings will build software products to help all of our agencies deliver precision marketing for their clients, combined with the capabilities of our media companies, along with our creative and marketing service agencies. Kinesso will enable our clients to drive better outcomes through marketing that is faster, more efficient, and informed by a conscious commitment to data ethics.","Turning to the highlights from the quarter of how our agencies are delivering ideas and results for our clients, you get a sense of the powerful opportunity that we feel lies ahead for our organization. In our Integrated Agency Network, Mediabrands led our growth in the quarter, posting a very strong performance. The groups saw exciting leadership changes as we elevated the CEO of Mediabrands to be the new Chief Operating Officer of IPG and elevated to other long term executives to fill in the CEO roles at Mediabrands and UM. These changes highlight the strong and orderly internal succession planning we have in place at our company.","Speaking of UM, the media agency continued to grow in the third quarter. They've retained this relationship with CVS and Aetna health as part of that review. The agency also won the Levi's America media account, supported by FCB West, the clients existing creative agency. Acxiom talent and expertise played an important role in both of these significant wins, particularly the CVS Aetna win.","AdWeek recently named UM Canada and UM New York media plan of the year winners. Initiative also posted a very good quarter. If LEGO Avengers work and FDA One leaves were both awarded media plan of the year and the agency picked up global media duties for delivery in most all world markets. All in, four IPG agencies were recognized with eight media plans of the Year awards, far surpassing any other holding company.","FCB also grew in the third quarter with several new assignments in North America and strong organic and new business growth from its health operations. The agency network had its best year at the Clio Awards, winning several grand Clios and 12 gold's. FCB health had a dominant showing at the Medical Marketing and Media Awards, taking home gold and silver in the large agency of the year category, and titanium for Best in Show. Recently, the network announced the new North American structure that unlocks new capabilities for clients with the expansion of its FCB\/SIX creative data offering and will promote greater interagency collaboration.","McCann World Groups saw continued growth globally, especially in LatAm where it was named network of the year at the Latin American Effie Awards during the quarter. And just last week, McCann World Group was named European agency network of the year at 2019 European Effie Awards. On the new business front McCann brought on Fujifilm globally and the UK saw a number of new business wins, including Lloyds Pharmacy. At the Clio awards, McCann, New York was named agency of the year taking home a number of grand Clios.","MullenLowe Group saw particularly strength in the US from a number of new business wins. MullenLowe won Humana and Tax Act. MullenLowe and Mediahub collaborated to bring in the Navy Federal Credit Union. The agency's integrated media arm was also selected for the twitch business and its new balance work was named media plan of the year in the best use of streaming media OTT category.","Celebrating its first year with our company Acxiom continues to expand its role with clients and our agencies. Acxiom designs and runs the data infrastructure for many of the world's most sophisticated marketers. The scale at which they operate handling billions of client records safely and getting the most value from them in ways that are respectful of the consumer gives clients comfort that they are working with a company that has deep expertise in data management, ethics and privacy.","Brooklyn based Huge unveiled a new operating model as the agency elevated key leadership roles and streamlined its US offering. The agency also saw a number of new business wins in the third quarter, including AccuWeather and ecommerce car buying platform RumbleOn. The agency continues to strengthen and grow its business and product innovation capabilities as well.","Highlights at R\/GA in the quarter included growth with new clients including Airbnb and Flex, as well as growth with existing clients. Additionally, R\/GA Ventures announced its Oregon Enterprise Blockchain Venture Studio during the quarter. The six participating companies presented a demo day this month, aimed at building a scalable blockchain based ecosystem.","Our US integrated independent agencies round out the portfolio. They deliver the full suite of marketing services to their clients, and also combined with the rest of our offerings on the collaborative open architecture solutions. Highlighted within this group came from Carmichael Lynch, which delivered strong growth in the quarter of such notable clients at Subaru and XL Energy.","At Deutsch we recently announced that both the New York and LA offices will be led by women CEOs from within that agency. In recent months, the Deutsch LA office was awarded Behr Paint, Mattel and global dot com redesign responsibilities for the Almond Board of California, while New York secured Reebok, Michelob Ultra, Budweiser and J&J\u2019s Attune. The Martin Agency continues to show good progress with existing clients and was recently awarded media plan of the year and the best use of social category. The agency also one DoorDash and just released its first creative work for the brand.","Turning to CMG, Weber Shandwick recently added Best Buy Canada and US AAA to its client roster. The agency was named the most admired PR agency among leading in house communications and brand marketing released by the homes report. Jack Morton our experiential agency debuted new work for brands including MillerCoors, HSBC, Facebook, Google and Peet's Coffee. For the current NFL season, the agency created the broadcast environments for five major networks.","Octagon also had a strong quarter adding new corporate clients LinkedIn and the National Women's Soccer League and also celebrated major victories from athletes it represents, including Bianca Andreescu's win in the US Open Women's Championship, as well as Simone Biles historic performance at the Gymnastics World Championship.","In total we're pleased that through nine months, IPG continues to perform a head of industry norms. It shows that our investment in people and in modern digital and data fueled offering is succeeding and that our focus on a client centric open architecture model is the right formula.","Turning to our outlook, we're confident that our performance to date, assets and track to deliver growth at the high end of our 2% to 3% organic growth range. In addition, we continue to be comfortable with our target for adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 40 to 50 basis points over the last year's 13.5%. We view our current performance and long term strategy as significant factors that will continue to enhance shareholder value. As always, we remain committed to a strong balance sheet, significant reduction in debt as well as continuing to grow our dividend and in time returning to share repurchases.","With that I'll open up the call to your question. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin our formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question is coming from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia Quadrani","Thanks so much. Just a couple of questions, I guess the first one is there's always been a bit of a disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street and I'm wondering if you can kind of give us a color of how your clients are viewing the world from an advertising perspective. Are they incrementally nervous about the economy? I know it's a little early, but I think in a few weeks or so you start talking a bit about budgets for next year, just curious of any color on that?","Michael Roth","Thank you, Alexia. You didn't ask me what our performance was last week and now you're [indiscernible]. Yeah, look, there's definitely a disconnect between business and what's happening in the stock market and in the global world, if you will, in terms of what's happening there. The uncertainty obviously is not helpful. And clients \u2013 as everyone just continues to look to see what's going to come of it. That said, I think if you look at our performance, they continue to invest in their brands, and they need partners such as the offerings that we have to help them move the needle. I think it proves that what we do actually works. And the conversations are really focused on how can we help them move the needle? And as long as we have the offerings, which is what we were building here at IPG to help them move the needle. They have the money and they're willing to spend. The difference I would say between now and \u2013 in a stronger environment is the process that we go through is very project oriented, we're seeing that. They're very focused on return on investment, which is why it's so important that we have the appropriate data analytics to reach the right consumers with the right message. But that said, they're very willing and ready to spend money on offerings that help move the needle. So like everyone else, they're concerned, but they realize that what we do actually works and they have to spend dollars to build their brands. It's a very competitive world out there. As I've said before, there are a lot of offerings out there chasing the same revenue. And it's very important for us to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace, which is exactly what we do by using open architecture, by bringing in Acxiom, by focusing on our creative capabilities, our digital and our experiential and PR work all sitting at the same table. So I think the answer is if we have a strong offering that we can prove works, clients if they're still willing to spend those dollars to move the needle.","Alexia Quadrani","Just looking at I guess that your full your guidance and given what you just had added some more project based work, your full your guide does suggest some softening in Q4 and I'm just wondering if you're building in some conservatism just given the higher level of uncertainty, some more project work at your end or is there some incremental headwinds that you can pinpoint?","Michael Roth","Well, we're still going to have headwinds in the fourth quarter as we had in this quarter and it'll be of similar magnitude, right? And, and frankly, it'll roll a little bit into first quarter and second quarter of next year. That said, when we set our guidance, we do it from the bottoms up. We do it on a full year basis. We start at the beginning of the year, and we adjust it as we go through the year. So our guidance is on the high end of the 3%, takes into consideration what our operators are seeing in the marketplace. What our contracts provide? And what projects we have in the pipeline that we think will result in our organic growth for the quarter? Look, you know this, our fourth quarter is very important to us. It's dependent upon projects. It's dependent upon completing a number of proposals we have with existing clients. So I wouldn't say there's conservatism in there, I would say that it's our best shot at looking at what we think we'll be able to deliver for the year.","Alexia Quadrani","And just lastly on the new business, and I know you have some headwinds that you have to still circle through to the beginning of 2020, but you've had some great wins this year. Do you think from a net new business perspective, I guess where you are now looking for the full year next year, are you in a positive position or is it still going to be a bit of a challenge given some of those previous losses?","Michael Roth","Well, I like I said we're going to have headwinds in the first and second quarter, but we are a net new business positive year-to-date and we hope will finish that way for the rest of the year. So, but for our \u2013 you're right [ph] here I go, I was wondering how long it would take me to do this. But for our headwinds we have a very strong organic growth number right now. And I think that's the point that our existing clients and our new wins reflect a solid economy out there where clients are willing to spend. So I think we're well positioned given our new business performance. And as we cycle through these headwinds, we'll be posting good, decent, leading industry organic growth, I hope.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question is coming from Dan Salmon, BMO Capital Markets.","Dan Salmon","Good morning, everybody. Mike, I just wanted to follow up on your comments and Frank mentioned it as well about a couple of divestitures in the quarter and I guess not so much the ones that you made specifically, but just taking it up to a high level. Is this sort of the new normal for the holding companies right here? If we go back over the past decade, generally the group was consistently adding assets over time. And it was a little different for IPG in the early days, but over the past few years, obviously, we're still seeing some bigger deals yourselves included. But we've also seen this sort of consistent trimming. Do you think that's the new normal for the for the industry or yourselves in particular? And then maybe either one of you, I'd love to hear just a little bit about as Acxiom does go into the organic number \u2013 it has been in the organic number since October 1. I know you won't comment on how it's been so far this quarter, but just maybe, what was it sort of glide path I guess, as it headed from September 30 into October 1? Was it in line with your expectations, anything sort of performing better or worse? And maybe in particular, if you can give a little color on it is, it has traditionally been a little bit more of a US oriented business. And having seen that number of negative this quarter on the organic side is there a potential that it can be a boost there? So thank you.","Michael Roth","All of that okay. First let me comment on Acxiom, Acxiom continuous to deliver, as I said in my remarks, consistent with what we expected in terms of our acquisition. And when I say that I say, anticipating the same for the rest of the year, that's built into our numbers. We knew that was going to be in our numbers in the fourth quarter. So that number is all inclusive. I think the important part of Acxiom, one is that the data management business continues to perform well, they're best in class and that's two thirds of their business. They've added some new logos. We don't talk about specific clients of Acxiom for various reasons, but they've added some new logos, which is great. But I think the real important point is that Acxiom has been part of a number of our new business wins. And frankly, working with existing clients and adding value to our existing clients, which I hope will lead to retention particularly on the media side. So we're very pleased the way \u2013 first of all that Acxiom has been integrated into our business. Basically, the integration of Acxiom into IPG is done. And frankly, I know that was one of the questions in our industry, whether we can absorb companies like this. So I think we've proven that we can and they continue to add value to us.","The question of dispositions is an interesting one, if you go back to the history of the holding companies, they're a bunch of series of roll ups. MullenLowe was a great example. They had global clients, particularly Unilever, which we had locations all over the world and we had agencies supporting that business all over the world. And there were partnerships. There were joint ventures. There were stand alone. We had agreements with them, but the world doesn't operate that way anymore. And the need for us to have all these standalone agencies in countries that, frankly, take up a lot of management time, some are actually losing money. So it's diluted to our margin. To maximize our returns and maximize our margin expansion, we have to look at whether there's other ways of doing business in those markets without having standalone agencies. So that's what this reflects. And I suspect you're seeing that for all the holding companies. It's interesting to ask, when you ask these global clients do you need an agency in this market, the answer is no. And when that's true, then we look at the local markets excels and whether the return on investment makes sense in the local markets. And if we can have a contractual relationship with those agencies, to provide the services that are necessary for our global clients. That's fine for us. And we can focus on management to growth in the bigger markets. So I think it's something you're going to see throughout the industry.","And I think what you've seen us taking a hard look at are we in the right markets with the right offerings and how should we position with respect to those markets. And that's why you see us adding to the disposition. It's not that we're cutting back on acquisition. It's we're focusing on the efficiencies of how we do business in the world today. In the US, we continue to \u2013 but for the headwinds in the US, most of the headwinds, the 4.8% that we've referenced are in the US. So it's the first time we've had a negative organic growth in the quarter that I can remember, actually and it's all due to the headwinds that we're going through. Again, if you pull out the headwinds, we're doing pretty well in the US. So we have to go find a new client to replace those headwinds. And again, the other reality of our business these days is that you don't have these big clients. It's more \u2013 it's a bunch of doubles and singles as opposed to home run. But we're doing a pretty good job at that, which is why we're net new business positive and a fair amount of that is in the US. And remember 64% of our business is in the US and it's a healthy market in the United States.","Dan Salmon","Very thorough. Thank you, Michael.","Michael Roth","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is coming from Ben Swinburne, Morgan Stanley.","Ben Swinburne","Thanks, guys. Good morning. I don't know if you're able to help us on the account loss headwinds as we move into Q4, Q1, but is this the sort of peak quarter you gave us that I think was a 4.8%? I think that's the number headwind this quarter. Does that number \u2013 is this sort of the peak headwind given you've got some nice wins that start to offset that and if you want to be that specific? And then just on Acxiom Michael, just from an organization perspective, would you say that the sort of the team is in place integrated into the organization to the point that you're sort of satisfied? There's not a lot more in the way of reorganizations. And how does Kinesso fit into how Acxiom goes to market? Or is that more of an internally facing organization, just maybe flesh out that announcement, which I think is something you guys think is, is pretty meaningful?","Michael Roth","Yeah, well, that. Look, the headwinds. I said \u2013 I just said in the fourth quarter, they're similar to what we had in the third quarter. And they do spill into the first and second quarter, but not certainly of that magnitude. Okay. But we are net new business positive and we're working our way through that. As far as Acxiom, yeah, I think when we say - our board was very specific when we proposed the acquisition of Acxiom. We had to have an integration plan in place. We have teams and I think they've done a tremendous job. One of the reasons we've been able to do this is the cultures of Acxiom and IPG are so similar. So the hard parts were the legacy systems were \u2013 even incentive comps and things like that. And we're in good shape in terms of integrating Acxiom. So I would say that we're pretty much 100% there, maybe we're 90% there, there's still bits and pieces. But the integration of Acxiom has gone better than planned actually and we're actually moving people within IPG. We've moved some people into Kinesso which I'll talk about to help that. So we're very pleased with how Acxiom has been integrated and the added value that we see. Remember Acxiom is data management, all right and Kinesso has not changed its core business at Acxiom of managing first party data. So a lot of the questions are why didn't we just put this in Acxiom? Why don't we take Acxiom and put them in Kinesso?","Acxiom is a standalone business. It's a great business. Two thirds of their business is data management and that's the way it's going to stay as an independent company. What we've done in Kinesso, if you think of it, think of Acxiom is providing the data information and capabilities to Kinesso and the technology is itself in the Kinesso base. So the company itself \u2013 think of it as a technology arm. And then on top of that, you add the services part of it, which is like the Cadreon and other creative assets that are available to Kinesso through integration with our creative agencies. So there are three legs, the data, the technology and the services. And Cadreon is the one piece of Mediabrands that actually was put into Kinesso. So that is a standalone company, we're really excited about it, we're going to start rolling that out. We already have in terms of working with Mediabrands in particular because of the value added in that environment. And in fact, we mentioned that Acxiom has been very helpful in terms of new media wins. The value proposition of Kinesso was a good part of that in terms of the wins. So we're very happy with the opportunities in Kinesso and I would look to 2020 before we really start seeing the impact of this, but we're pretty excited about it.","Ben Swinburne","Thanks, Michael.","Michael Roth","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is coming from Steven Cahall, Wells Fargo.","Steven Cahall","Thanks, maybe first follow up on Acxiom. I think you said it's on track and its growth is accretive. I think you've previously talked about it growing around mid-single digits. So I was just wondering if you can speak to maybe what the organic growth to that has been. And also maybe any connections that you're seeing with the rest of IPG to kind of get one plus one equals three in terms of new business for either Acxiom or IPG?","Michael Roth","Yeah, great, what we said is we will look into about a 5% growth for Acxiom. We said that in our business plan, and when I say Acxiom continues to deliver consistent with its business plan, you can assume that's where it's coming from. So we don't break out the growth of Acxiom separately, but you can use that as a number. And yeah, the integration of Acxiom in terms of the rest of IPG, obviously, as I said, on the media side of the business it's been very active in terms of the value propositions that the media teams are using both UM and Initiatives. So they've been very helpful and we haven't yet \u2013 although on some unique cases used the strength of Acxiom and Kinesso yet with respect to some of our other global networks, but that's on the horizon. And we have them lining up asking for assistance. In fact, one of our agencies is involved in a pitch right now. And I think today, they're going to have a conversation with the Acxiom team and Kinesso to see how they can help in the pitch. And this is a creative pitch. So we're very happy to see that happening. And it's all part of our open architecture model. It's a core part of what we do in the marketplace. And it resonates exceptionally well with our global clients.","I've had a number of meetings with our global clients that are actually calling out open architecture to me and the team which is great. And sitting, sitting at the table you have McCann you have FCB, you have Weber Shandwick, you have R\/GA, you have Mediabrands and you have Acxiom. You put all of those people together on the room focusing on a single client. And that's exactly what market demands and what clients want to see. And to the extent we can show that we can work together on a client basis, bringing all these resources together, there's no need for them to use anyone else. And the relationship we develop as a business partner to our clients is indestructible when that works correctly. So that's the whole premise. And that's the differentiator between IPG and the other agencies. Open architecture is at our core, collaboration is at our core. We didn't have to break up all of our agencies and put them together in one silo. We build our brands. Our brands are \u2013 we're very proud of each of our brands. The retention of the talent, the creative capability within those brands is world class.","And why would we break those up. All of it is accounting and all you have to do is put these people in a room and work together and magic comes out of it. So that's our whole go to market strategy. And frankly, that's why we've been performing the way we have and clients know that. And they're asking us for the rest of IPG coming to the table. And on the question Acxiom, we still have the opportunity of Acxiom clients bringing IPG into the Acxiom clients. It takes a little bit longer in terms of that kind of relationship, but we're already starting doing that as well. So I think the opportunities that are in front of us are good and we're positioned as a company to meet those demands. We have the talent, we have the tools, we have the resources and we have the will to make it happen. So I'm kind of encouraged and optimistic in terms of what we bring to the marketplace and how we can differentiate ourselves in the marketplace","Steven Cahall","And then I had two quick follow ups. Maybe first you talked about the 2.5 times leverage, can you just remind us what your commitment is to the debt markets before you might think about buying back stock again. And then lastly, you've had some recent promotions in the C-suite that you mentioned, maybe you can just speak a little bit to the transition there. And I'd love to know, Michael, any thoughts on maybe your time left at IPG? Because the Wall Street Journal says your successor might now be in line. So if you can comment on that, that'd be great? Thanks.","Michael Roth","What was your first question? The leverage, I know. Look, we don't have any leverage guidelines. We've already \u2013 as you saw in the quarter, we paid down 200 million. Our commitment to our rating agencies is we'll maintain a strong balance sheet, we want to retain our investment grade rating, but it's on the horizon. Frankly, we meet regularly to figure out how far we have to bring that down before we can get back into share buybacks, though it's on the horizon, we won't commit to a date. We want to make sure our balance sheet is as strong as it could be. No one's asked yet about the potential of a recession. But everyone talks about it. And we want to make sure we have a balance sheet that continues to be strong in the event, something like that that should happen, so all these factors go into place when we make that determination. That said, we're still paying dividends, we still increase dividends. We believe we've had no need to do any large transactions. I think what you'll see on the acquisition side are very strategic and smaller transactions that are either geographic or discipline or just talent. So there's no need for our excess capital internally. So obviously, returning that to our shareholders is a paramount objective to us. And we'll continue to look at the dividend to accomplish that until we get our levels at a reasonable rate \u2013 place and so that we can go be back in the market buying shares.","On the promotions, obviously, with Philippe coming on board as Chief Operating Officer, that's a recognition of his contributions throughout the whole senior management team and his role played in the turnaround of IPG. We're very proud of it. Obviously, when myself and the board made that decision, it positions Philippe in a very strong way in terms of succession. We have a succession plan in place. What I love about the promotions, Daryl and Eileen at Mediabrands, these are all whether it be Kim or Will at Deutsch, these are all internal promotions, and it's the strength of our talents. And we don't need to go outside in most cases for promoting from within. So I think our responsibility as a leadership and as a board is to make sure that there's a succession plan in place, not just for my job, but for everybody's job within the company, which is why we do talent reviews, and we have a pretty clear plan in terms of next steps and so on. So when it comes to making those decisions, we're very well positioned. And that's another factor that I believe distinguishes us from our competition. We don't have to go to the outside. As far as my timing goes, as I said, I'm on the back nine as opposed to the front nine. And obviously I can't keep doing this forever. And my responsibility to the board is make sure that everything's in place at IPG that I committed to and working with our team. And when that happens, that's what will happen.","Steven Cahall","Great, thank you.","Michael Roth","Okay.","Operator","The next question is coming from Tim Nollen, Macquarie. Your line is open.","Tim Nollen","Thanks. I'd like to touch back on not so much Acxiom itself, but I guess the role of data and a lot of discussions on privacy are continuing to go on here. We've got this California CCTP Act coming on I think in short order. Europe is looking at the big internet companies are looking at programmatic buying, perhaps challenging the GDPR precepts, US looking at internet companies. I just wonder what can you tell us about the role of data and some privacy concerns out there with advertising in general and then maybe how Acxiom, you've said before actually can help you with this. Could you maybe elaborate on those two points, please?","Michael Roth","Yeah, sure, well, I don't think it's a secret. With GDPR we see it already in places. I think it's in January, in California and other states have adopted similar requirements and which is why, by the way, we support the Business Roundtable position on our federal GDPR. I mean, it's not easy to do it on a state by state basis, each of the states are going to require different things. And therefore, it's going to cause a great deal of additional work for our clients as well as us. And if we had a federal legislation that covers it, it's an important issue. I think it's pretty clear that it's here to stay. And regulation in this area is important. And the more unified that legislation, the better it is. So we endorse the Business Roundtable statement. One of the things about Acxiom is its expertise in privacy. For us that has this five stars, it's one of the most highly regarded data management companies and privacy is a critical piece of that. So we view our expertise of Acxiom as critical as clients are looking for ways to deal with the GDPR and privacy rules in general. And again, that's another reason we found the acquisition of Acxiom to be an important part of a differentiator for us going forward. So, yes, it's one of the most important issues we have to face. And yes, we have the capabilities to help implement that with our clients.","Tim Nollen","Thanks.","Operator","The next question is coming from David Joyce, Evercore ISI.","David Joyce","Thank you, wanted to ask about the impact of addressable advertising across media platforms on your business model. Are you seeing any change in client budget allocations yet towards addressable? And how does that impact you since some of the promises of addressable are for perhaps less budget and you met less investment by greater ROI, but on the flip side of that it's a very complex environment with a lot of players with the different array of services, just wondering how we think about that evolution in your growth.","Michael Roth","Yeah, I mean, it's a very important factor. Frankly, Kinesso is one of the reasons we have Kinesso and one of the key offerings that there if you couple of Cadreon with the data capabilities of Acxiom that's what's Cadreon uses and addresses addressable markets. And so therefore, that's one of the reasons we created Kinesso to be in a position to work with our clients. And yeah, there's a shift moving from TV to digital. We see that in terms of having TV and linear TV pass digital in terms of total spend. So, all of this is frankly, why we bought Acxiom and why we isolated certain aspects of that in Kinesso so the value proposition that we can bring to our clients in terms of addressable, finding the right individuals and think of it as looking for individuals, not just groups of people and on a cleanse basis. So yeah, I think it's happening in the marketplace. And we add value when those issues come up. So when clients ask about it, that's good for us because if we can be in front of our clients showing our capabilities it enhances to the relationship significantly.","David Joyce","Right, thank you.","Michael Roth","Okay.","Operator","And the last question is coming from Jason Bazinet of Citi. Your line is open?","Jason Bazinet","I just had a macro question. If I look back over the last, whatever, 20 years, there's been sort of two recessions and certainly the most recent one, though, '08, '09 was non-typical. And you could almost argue a one wasn't typical. If we enter the garden variety recession will you guys go through your model to sort of stress test it? Would you say it is reasonable in terms of top line compression and expenses that can come out?","Michael Roth","Yeah. Well, look, we hope. I don't see any signs of a 2008 and '09 recession right now. And even with the talk \u2013 a lot of people are talking about if there's a recession, it's going to be a recession light, whatever that means. But in 2008 and '09 marketing dollars dropped and there was no capital. I mean, it was it was a whole different world. I think we've taken the position already. That's why we're able to expand margins like you're seeing is that we match revenue and expense very carefully. All of our agencies have very strong disciplines that before they add headcount, it has to be associated with revenue. Well, the fact that we're doing the dispositions on those countries that we're not necessary to be in all leads itself to margin expansion, efficiencies and protecting our P&L in the event that a recession comes. So the one thing we've learned since '08 and '09 is how to manage expenses. And it's part of every business review we have, that we take a look at what actions would unnecessary. And because we're a variable cost model, you look at the headcount and SRS. And so we have governors on all of our incentive comp calculations to make sure that all of those are in line with predetermined levels. So we're comfortable that in the event we do get a recession light that we're well positioned. And frankly, we're at a point where we need organic growth to expand margin. So there's no question that if there's no organic growth and it's going to be hard to expand margin, But I think we've been able to show just in this quarter that if there's a lower organic growth we're still able to expand margin by doing the things I just talked about.","Jason Bazinet","Understood. Thank you very much.","Michael Roth","Okay, well, I thank you all for participating and we look forward to our next conversation regarding our final year results. Thank you.","Operator","We conclude today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jerome J. Leshne","Good morning. Thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com, and we'll refer to both in the course of this call. This morning, we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks, to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 a.m. Eastern.","During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company. These are subject to uncertainties in the cautionary statement included in our earnings release and the slide presentation and further details in our 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.","At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael Isor Roth","Thank you, Jerry, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we review our first quarter results. As usual, I'll begin by covering the key highlights of our performance, Frank will then provide additional detail on the quarter, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies, to be followed by a Q&A.","We're pleased to report a first quarter that represents a solid beginning to 2013. This includes revenue growth consistent with targeted range for the full year, continuing discipline on expenses and further return of capital to shareholders, including an additional share repurchase authorization and a higher dividend, as previously reported. On top of that, during the quarter, we won a number of new business assignments in highly competitive circumstances. Year-to-date, we are solidly net new business positive and our pipeline of opportunities is promising.","Beginning with revenue, our organic growth rate in the quarter was 2.3%. This is on top of 2.8% growth a year ago and in line with our full year target range of 2% to 3% organic growth. Regional performance was led by double-digit organic growth in 3 important areas of the world: LatAm, the U.K. and the Middle East. In Asia Pac, our growth was 4.3%, on top of 16.9% a year ago, very strong performance in light of that difficult comparison. In Continental Europe, our organic change was a decrease of 5.8%, which reflects the ongoing challenges of that region's overall economic environment. As we've indicated previously, a recovery in Europe has not been factored into our annual targets. It's also worth noting that the region represents 10% of our total revenue for the quarter. Overall, our international organic growth was 4.9%.","In the U.S., organic revenue growth was 0.5%, reflecting some trailing account losses that are front-loaded in the first half of the year. For the full year, we anticipate competitive domestic organic growth. During the quarter, we had a strong performance at many of our agencies, including our marketing services specialists within CMG, our media business and a number of our domestic integrated agencies.","Turning to operating expenses, results reflect continued capital cost management. Total headcount grew by less than 1% sequentially. It's worth noting that severance expense was elevated in Q1 due to both headcount actions in Europe and the transition of senior leadership at some of our agencies. Office and general expenses was also very well controlled across all major categories, such as occupancy, T&E, travel and offices supplies, while pass-through expenses increased from a year ago. This results from higher business activity and are directly offset by revenue growth.","Heightened activity on the new business front in Q1 meant the level of upfront investment in payroll, temporary labor and general expenses in the quarter. Our account wins during the first 3 months of the year position us to leverage that investment going forward.","Another Q1 highlight was continued share repurchases. During the quarter, we bought back 6.2 million shares using $76 million, and our Board has increased our authorization by $200 million to a total of $500 million. And in February, as reported, our board also increased our quarterly dividend by 25%. Since initiating our return of capital programs 2 years ago, we have returned a total of $1.1 billion to shareholders in dividends and through the repurchase of 81 million shares. We retired an additional 33 million diluted share equivalents through the redemption of a convertible debt.","On Q1, seasonal loss per share was $0.14 compared to a loss of $0.10 a year ago. Our average shares outstanding decreased 5.3%. Over the course of the year, we should continue to see benefits from the reduced outstanding share count in our EPS performance.","A noteworthy trend for us in the quarter was the number of client new business wins that we've begun to see. These were led by our success in securing Chevrolet's branding work in the U.S., adding to our global responsibilities on that iconic brand, as well as the global SABIC assignment won in a holding company shootout and the retention of the U.S. Postal Service, and of course, the highly competitive Acura win. I'll have more on this in agency-specific closing remarks, but it goes without saying that these were very encouraging developments.","Now I'll turn things over to Frank for some additional color on the quarter, and I'll rejoin you after his remarks for an update on the tone of our business.","Frank Mergenthaler","Thank you, Michael. Good morning. As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of results. Organic growth was 2.3%. That includes 4.9% growth internationally, where the standouts were LatAm and the U.K. In the U.S., growth of 0.5% includes some very strong agency performances and also has the impact of accounts loss last year, most of which should cycle through by midyear. Our seasonal operating loss in the quarter was $42 million compared with the loss of $39 million a year ago. We had $1.65 billion of cash and marketable securities in the balance sheet at quarter-end, which includes our pre-funding from last year of this year's debt reduction.","Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. It's worth pointing out that the tax benefit on our seasonal pretax loss was $12 million this year compared with $19 million a year ago due to some volatility in our effective tax rate caused by the jurisdiction of the specific agencies generating the losses. Our average share count for the quarter was $414 million compared with $438 million a year ago, a decrease of 5.3%. We had 429 million basic shares outstanding on March 31, which is higher than the Q1 average because it includes the conversion in mid-March of essentially all the 200 million of our 4.75% convertible debt into 16.9 million common shares, which are already in our diluted share count. With the action of our board to increase our repurchase authorization by $200 million, we intend to address those new basic shares over the balance of this year. The total of our repurchase authorizations remaining at the end of Q1 was $524 million.","Turning to operations on Slide 4. Revenue in the quarter was $1.54 billion, an increase of 2.4%. Compared to Q1 2012, the impact of change in exchange rates was a negative 80 basis points, while net acquisitions and dispositions added 90 basis points, resulting organic revenue increase was 2.3%.","By client sector, our first quarter was led by strong continuing growth in auto and transportation. We had mid-single-digit growth in several sectors, tech and telecom, health care and financial services. Our consumer goods sector was up but only slightly. We had decreases in retail and food and beverage, the latter due in part to client turnover last year.","As you can see on the bottom half of this slide, the organic change in our Integrated Agency Network segment was a negative 0.1%. This reflects the effect of client losses that fall mainly in the first half of 2013. At our CMG segment of marketing services specialists, organic growth was 14%, reflecting increases across our events, branding and public relations disciplines and double-digit growth in both the U.S. and international markets.","Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., organic growth was 0.5%, which reflects strong growth at several of our agencies, offset by the impact of certain account losses last -- loss last year. It's worth noting that the total U.S. growth was 1.7%, which includes our domestic acquisitions over the past year.","Turning to international markets, the U.K. increased 10.1% organically, reflecting strong growth in marketing services at CMG, at our media business and at McCann. Continental Europe decreased 5.8% organically. There was a notable decrease in a number of the smaller national economies across the region. In addition, France decreased somewhat more than recent trend, while Germany was flat. In Asia Pac, our largest market outside the U.S., organic revenue growth was 4.3% in Q1. That is on top of 2 years of double-digit increases in Q1. We continue to expect strong growth for the full year. Among our largest markets in the region, we saw the strongest Q1 growth in Australia and India. In LatAm, Q1 organic revenue growth was 16.1% powered by performances at McCann that includes a number of new client wins. We also had strong growth in our media business. Our Other Markets group increased 9.1% organically, driven by strong performance in the Middle East.","Moving on to Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. Most recent data point is 0.6%, which is updated to include Q1 '13 and the roll off of Q1 '12. We have targeted 2% to 3% for the full year 2013 on our February call. Our growth in the first quarter and net account wins put us in a strong position to achieve this target.","Moving on to Slide 7, operating expenses. Our agency leadership continue to manage expenses effectively while also investing in growth areas of the business around the world. Total salaries and related expense was 73.4% of revenue in Q1 compared to 73.3% last year. Severance expense was higher this year by $5 million or 30 basis points in the comparison. Again, it bears mention that while Q1 is a small-revenue quarter, we recognize expenses relatively evenly across the 4 quarters, and this is reflected in the seasonality of our results.","Our total headcount at quarter-end was 43,600, a year-on-year increase of 2.7%. The increase reflects organic investment in our acquisitions to support growing disciplines, such as media and public relations, as well as digital services throughout our agencies. And it also reflects growth in markets such as China, India and Brazil and some staffing investment as a result of increased new business pitches and wins. Offsetting these investments were net reductions at certain markets, such as Continental Europe. Our focus there has been managing our workforce for efficiency and positioning for growth when it does eventually return.","Severance expense was 1.7% of Q1 revenue compared with 1.4% a year ago. Our incentive expense in the quarter was 4% of revenue compared to 4.4% in Q1 2012. The decrease was due in part to lower long-term incentive accruals for performance periods that include last year, when we underperformed relative to our targets. Again, keep in mind that Q1 is our smallest-revenue quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect total incentive expense in the range of 3.5% to 4% of revenue.","Turning to office and general expense on the lower half of the slide, O&G was $453 million compared to $441 million a year ago. This increase of $12 million is due almost entirely to higher pass-through expenses, which is offset in revenues and are profit-neutral. Compared to a year ago, we drove 20 basis points of operating leverage in each of the 3 areas: our occupancy expense, professional fees, and travel and office supplies. Our teams continue to do a terrific -- do terrific work in maximizing efficiencies. The offset in Q1 was in our other O&G category, which includes the pass-through expenses. In total, O&G expenses were 29.4% of revenue compared with 29.3% a year ago.","On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 9.7%. As we said on our Q4 call, our target level for this year is to improve 50 basis points to 10.3%, on the way to our objective of fully competitive profitability.","Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 9, we ended the quarter with $1.65 billion of cash and short-term marketable securities compared to $1.59 billion a year ago, an increase of approximately $60 million. The comparison includes over $480 million returned to shareholders in the last 12 months in the form of our share repurchases and common stock dividends, as well as $800 million on the balance sheet this year from our November debt issuance.","On Slide 10, we turn to our cash flow for the quarter. Our use of cash in operations was $775 million compared with the use of $498 million a year ago. As a reminder, cash flow on our business is seasonal. Our working capital tends to generate cash in the fourth quarter, which is followed by the cash used in the first quarter. In this year's first quarter, cash used in working capital was $722 million compared with the use of $445 million a year ago. In terms of our investing activities, we used $51 million in Q1 for acquisitions and CapEx. Our financing activities used $104 million, which includes $76 million for the repurchase of 6.2 million shares at an average price of $12.17 per share. Our common stock dividend used $31 million.","Slide 11 charts our debt reduction over the last few years. Our total outstanding at March 31 includes $600 million of double-carry from our debt issued in November 2012. That number had been $800 million on December 31. Our $200 million 4.75% convertible notes were exchanged for equity in March at the election of noteholders, following the exercise of our call. Looking ahead, we plan to call our $600 million 10% notes in July, which will end this short period of double-carry and result in significantly lower interest expense.","In summary, on Slide 12, we are pleased with our operating performance and new business in the quarter. We continue to effectively manage costs and believe we remain on track to deliver our financial objectives for the year.","Now let me turn it back over to Michael.","Michael Isor Roth","Thank you, Frank. Well, the combination of the solid first 3 months, new assignments coming onstream and our proven ability to closely manage the business puts us in a position to achieve our financial targets for 2013 of 2% to 3% organic revenue growth and 50 basis points of improvement in operating margin. Performance from our operations in high-growth markets continues to be very good in terms of revenue growth. We're also seeing the benefits of our longstanding commitment to embedded digital talents and expertise across all agencies and capabilities, whether at our U.S. integrated independents, our global networks or our marketing service specialists. Digital talent accounts for a significant majority of the hiring we are doing throughout the group. For example, with over 500 professionals from a range of disciplines, the social media capabilities that have been developed organically within CMG are among the most powerful in our industry. This is a key reason why during the quarter, we continue to see the group, including Weber Shandwick, GolinHarris, Octagon, Jack Morton and FutureBrand, win market share, lead the industry in terms of creative recognition and add to the deep bench strength of management talent. At McCann, we've begun to see demonstrable progress from the newly configured leadership team. The consolidation of Chevrolet business in Commonwealth for McCann is a testament to the agency's creative and strategic capabilities. The IPG SABIC win was led by Weber Shandwick, Jack Morton and McCann's collaboration. And the recent win of the U.S. Postal Service is another sign that the agency is gaining traction.","Just last week, McCann New York was named Agency of the Year by the Art Directors Club, following on other high profile honors at leading Asian and European creative awards competitions. Similarly, at The Festival of Media Agency, Asia, our Mediabrands unit was also the most awarded group of agencies. The new organizational model that Mediabrands recently introduced is making more of our top talent accessible to clients, and this has been very well received. And we continue to see upside in leading-edge capabilities, such as the audience platform, which spans areas such as mobile and social, as well as the Cadreon automated trading desk. Our recent acquisition of the leading digital media agency in the India, Interactive Avenues, as well as a mobile transaction in Australia will help Mediabrands to further build out these strong capabilities.","Of course, having highly competitive digital specialists like R\/GA, Huge and MRM enhances our overall digital offering. R\/GA recently added offices in Austin and Los Angeles to its growing network, while Huge has expanded into San Francisco and Portland to support client needs. MRM is working closely with McCann on a number of major client initiatives and was recently named a Top Interactive Agency by BtoB Magazine.","Another area in the portfolio in which we have a number of outstanding agencies is among our integrated U.S. independents. Mullen's performance in the marketplace has been outstanding, capped by their Acura win. We're also seeing good results and an evolution of the go-to-market strategy at Hill Holliday, Deutsch and The Martin Agency. A number of these agencies are combining more regularly with Lowe to collaborate on new business requiring global or pan-regional solutions. Lowe's performance in the quarter was solid. Of course, the agency's creative reputation continues to grow, and we're looking forward to strong performance from them again at this year's upcoming Cannes award competition.","At Draftfcb, we've begun to add to the agency's creative talent base, with significant new hires in North and LatAm and the promotion of a long-time top talent to the European chief creative role. This is also ahead of the arrival of Carter Murray, who we named CEO a month back. Despite knowing of the possibility that Carter's starting day could be delayed, we feel strongly that we've recruited the right person for the role, and he will bring vitality, deep understanding of brands and client relationships and new business drive that Draftfcb needs to go forward.","In conclusion, we're pleased with the Q1 results. Of course, we know that this is traditionally our smallest revenue period of the year, and we have consistently cautioned against putting too much weight, whether it'd be positive or negative, on any single quarter's results. But since the beginning of the year, we've begun to build significant new business momentum. We have a proven track record of controlling costs and managing to the margin. Therefore, we remain comfortable with our full year financial goals for 2013. The significant deleveraging that we have accomplished and the strength of our balance sheet provide additional levers that allow us to support the needs of the business by investing in talent and targeted M&A while simultaneously returning capital to our owners. This combination of factors, outstanding agency brands with strong capabilities in high-growth areas such as digital and emerging markets, plus the focus on cost management and strong financial foundation, positions us well to create significant shareholder value this year and beyond.","With that, I'd like to thank you for your support and open the door for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alexia Quadrani, JPMC.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. First, could you give us any color about, I guess, what organic -- domestic organic growth would've looked like if you didn't have those headwinds? I guess even generally, if -- would it look more like the company-wide number you delivered around your target? And then the second question, you mentioned incremental expenses that you are building up in front of the new business wins you recently pulled in. Will we see some of those expenses in front of maybe a lot of the revenues in the second quarter?","Michael Isor Roth","Yes, let me talk about the headwinds. We have previously said last year for the full year, the headwinds would be in the 50 to 100 basis points. However, it was for the year. But we also said it would be front-ended, so you can assume it was up front, since it was more weighted in the U.S., about 2% in the first quarter were the headwinds. So if you take the 2% and add it to the 0.5%, that should give you a reasonable idea in terms of what the U.S. organic would've been. I might add that the similar high headwinds are in the second quarter, Alexia. As far as the expenses go, there's no question that we had pitch expenses in the first quarter, which, fortunately, resulted in new business wins, and some -- as indicated, we had some additional severance in the first quarter. So what we do is we obviously spread out incentives and things like that for the full year, and we've built up some expenses in the first quarter that we expect to see convert to revenue for the balance of the year. Obviously, new business comes on over a period of time. It all doesn't come in at one particular time. But certainly, the expenses that we incurred in the first quarter will give rise to revenue.","Frank Mergenthaler","And you still have -- Alexia, have some pressure in the second quarter because of the timing. People are working against these new business opportunities now, and when the revenue comes onstream, maybe a little bit disjointed with the expenses being incurred.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So the expense will be a little bit front-end loaded in Q2 versus the revenue.","Michael Isor Roth","Yes.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But you do still see some of the revenue from the new business? And I know you -- I know those business coming in and out. I'm talking about more the bigger headline wins. Will you see some of those coming in Q2?","Michael Isor Roth","We'll see some of it in the second quarter, and the rest in the third and fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Janedis, UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Michael, it seems like you got a much broader auto client base versus a couple years ago. And I'm wondering, has the mindset among clients changed in terms of conflicts to compete for the business? And if so, is that a trend across industries?","Michael Isor Roth","Yes, I know it's a fair question, John. In the old days, each of the holding companies were sort of wedded to one of the big majors. We still are, candidly. It's by agency, and I think what it shows is the depth of our talent across all the different agencies that we have. So clearly, McCann is a General Motors agency, and we'd like to think that, that will continue, obviously, by adding the additional Chevy work. But the other strong agencies are out there. And yes, the competitive nature of this and the conflict issues throughout our industry has been dealt with more on a agency basis than a holding company basis, which, frankly, is good for us.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, good. And then, Frank, can you help us think a little bit more about your margin expansion this year, meaning you've obviously done a great job in O&G over the past few years. But over the 50 bps of margin target for this year, is that split fairly evenly between O&G and SRS?","Frank Mergenthaler","I think you'll see more of it, John, in the SRS line as we convert growth.","Michael Isor Roth","Yes, I might add, John, we still have some agencies that are conflict-free on the auto side, so we have room to grow here. But of course, it's on an agency-by-agency basis, and we do have other agencies working on General Motors as well, and we're very cognizant of conflict issues.","Operator","Your next question comes from William Bird, Lazard.","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could just talk about your credit. What has S&P laid out as a requirement to get pushed up to investment grade?","Michael Isor Roth","We think that we're there, and the issue continues to be consistency in terms of our performance. And if you just look at the percentages and debt-to-equity and all the metrics that are typically used, as evidenced by the other rating agencies that do have us as investment grade, we think that they should be there. But again, frankly, last year's results, which had a bit of a hiccup if you look at it from our stated objective, that goes for the issue of consistency. So our goal is to continue to deliver as we promised, show it on a consistency basis, and we would expect to see that reflected.","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Separately, Michael, could you talk a little bit about McCann? Can you talk about whether there's been any tweaks or changes in strategies since the change in leadership?","Michael Isor Roth","Well, I think the fact that we've seen some good traction on business wins indicates a confidence in the marketplace, in new management, as well as the capabilities of McCann. Strategy, I think what we're focusing on is, clearly, retention of our existing clients. One of the great strengths of McCann is its global client portfolio. And I know Harris and the entire team had been focused on servicing those multinational clients and making sure they're getting the best we have to offer. So that strategy has always been there, but it's much more concentrated now. And now McCann is out there in terms of pitching new business and converting to wins, which we've seen. The U.S. Post Office is -- although it was an IPG client at Campbell Ewald, it's nice to see McCann -- it was a competitive pitch among a very -- a number of agencies -- to see McCann win that. And I think they're on the front foot in terms of new business efforts out in the marketplace. They're in a number of finals in terms of new business pitches. So I think the morale there is much higher. The talent is stronger. Just yesterday, we announced some major changes in terms of new people, particularly at McCann Erickson, so I'm very encouraged by what we're seeing at McCann. And the strategy is very simple: Service your existing client, grow from within and win more than your fair share in new business pitches.","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And on severance, do you expect that to be up in the June quarter as well?","Michael Isor Roth","We always state that the severance numbers, we use 1% to model. Of late, we've seen it a little bit higher. We're still sticking to the 1% in terms of the modeling. But as you go through the transition that we've been going through and when you see the economic environment in Europe, we're always looking to rightsize our businesses to match revenue. So I would say, you're going to see severance slightly higher than 1% possibly, but again, I'd continue to drive towards the 1%.","Frank Mergenthaler","Bill, people get compensated on the margin they delivered. So if their severance creeps up, they've got to absorb that through revenue growth, rather than cost reductions.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Bank, RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. Just the first one, I think there's a decent amount of visibility in terms of what's going on, on the domestic side given the new business wins and the comping against the losses, and so I think we see the progression there. Can you give a little more color on the international side, particularly the growth in regions like the U.K., which I think were really surprisingly strong for the quarter? What's the sustainability of that trend? What specific drivers, more on the international side? And then second question, sorry for the long question, but under the \"no good deed goes unpunished\" category, the new business momentum has been really good. The margin discipline has been really solid. What has to go wrong for you not to kind of hit these targets?","Michael Isor Roth","Thanks, David. Well, let me answer that one. The easy part of that is macro environment. We always said, there's no structural reason for us not to continue to expand margins and attain our goal of competitive margin. So what we look at very carefully, obviously, is the macroeconomic environment, and so we're subject to that. We can't do much about it. We can be -- as you indicated, we can be very focused on cost discipline and managing our businesses. But without growth in the overall economic environment, it's tough to expand margins. And frankly, that was proven for us in 2012. We've always said that if we see growth, certainly, in the 2% to 3% range, we should be able to expand our margin, as indicated by our goal to expand by 50 basis points for 2013. So again, I think the real -- the answer here is macroeconomics, that can go wrong. You always worry about losing clients, especially given the size of our multinational clients, but I'm very comfortable right now, certainly, with the changes we've made in McCann and the effort that's being made across all of IPG to keep that backdoor closed. I'll say that now, and tomorrow, we'll find out something. But we're very focused on client retention because I've always said that so much of our new business comes from organic growth, from our existing client base, and that's where we have to continue to be very strong. Your question on international, look, McCann in Latin America is very strong. We've seen strength in Latin America across all of our global networks; Lowe is very strong in Latin America; Draftfcb. So what's great about that is what you get is when you have 3 global networks like we have, and we see recoveries in certain markets. India is another example where we have very strong global disciplines and agencies, and they're performing well. So it's not by accident that when you see one region down and other regions are up, we're participating in that. In the U.K., we certainly have a very strong event business. One was -- last year, we had, of course, the Olympics, and that was reflected in our strong growth in the U.K. But if you were to take the event business out of the U.K. in the first quarter, and again, it's just one quarter, but I believe we had a 6% organic growth without the event -- special event in. So we have McCann, our media business, are all solid in the U.K.; obviously, Lowe. So we have very strong offerings in the U.K. It always been -- has been an important market for us, and I'm pleased to see that kind of result in that very competitive environment.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Chesler, Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The momentum that you're talking about shows that you're making really good progress on improving the performance of a number of your agencies and your networks particularly McCann and McCann Erickson in the U.S. So presuming that you keep the backdoor shut and the progress continues into the back year, when you look across your portfolio, what are the other areas of the business that you would want to catch up and still expect some significant improvement from to take you from where you hope to be at the end of 2013 to where you want to be in 2014? And I ask the question not to focus on the negative but to think about where the opportunity will be after we get to wherever you hope to be at the end of the year.","Michael Isor Roth","Yes, well, we -- Lowe continues to be -- the progress of Lowe, I indicated, we had good solid results from Lowe in the first quarter. We still have room for improvement in terms of the margin expansion at Lowe. So that certainly is one of the things that we've been focusing on very carefully and investing in Lowe to increase. They've done a great job in focusing on their key markets and talent and leveraging their global capabilities where needed. So we're looking for improvement in margin at Lowe. Obviously, Draftfcb is another area. And the fact that we're bringing Carter onboard and the investments we're making at Draftfcb in talent is an indication that we're addressing the issues that we did have some client losses at Draftfcb. And although we're very comfortable with our client base at Draftfcb, we want to make sure it stays that way, and we're backing -- we had some client wins at Draftfcb. We want to continue that momentum. But that's an area that, with Carter coming onboard, we expect to see investments in talent and go-to-market strategies. So I would focus on those 2 global agencies as opportunities for us. Obviously, media continues to be a very good performer for us. There are a lot of media pitches out in the marketplace, and we certainly have the best-in-class media offerings. So I would look to seeing an expansion in terms of client wins on the media side. And I think the other aspect that we're seeing, SABIC is a good example of RFPs coming into IPG from the holding company's perspective. And the marketplace looking for the best of IPG, and that's one area that I think we've proven ourselves that we're very capable of doing that. We have a number of IPG solutions in the marketplace. The SABIC win, it was a head-on competition between us and the other holding companies, and we fared well. We have 1 other going on right now in terms of a holding company pitch, and we're cautiously optimistic on that one. So I think those are the trends we're seeing in the marketplace. And the marketplace -- you have to bring your best solutions to our clients, and we've been using a notion of open architecture for years, and I think I'm very pleased with the fact that we're starting to see real traction on the ability for our agencies, including our independents. When you see independent agencies tapping into Lowe, for example, for multinational pitches, if you will, and responses to their existing clients, that's a good indication of the depth of our resources.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And there was an earlier question that was talking about the on-boarding of clients and the contribution to revenue and the relationship with costs. If you think about it for a fiscal year basis, on a net-net basis, these are great wins for you, and it positions you really well. For the full year, do they contribute incrementally on a net basis to the achievement of the 50 bps margin target?","Michael Isor Roth","Yes, I mean, they all won't be on-boarded for the full year, but certainly, their revenue will contribute to our expansion. But again, the point here is when you onboard new clients, you build up, you have to hire talent, and it's not until they're fully up and running do you really see the margin contributions that you expect to see with the fully serviced client, if you will. So it'll ramp up. It's all not going to happen -- you don't wave a magic wand, and all of a sudden, you ramp up and the margins are delivering. It takes over a period of time to do that, but I certainly rather be in that position than not have them.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Swinburne, Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Two for Frank on the -- on some of the numbers. On the cash flow side, Frank, should we assume the buybacks this year sort of pace with your cash flow generation? I think from a -- certainly, from a working cap perspective, Q1 is usually a low quarter. So any color on that would be helpful. And then maybe another sort of housekeeping one, just on the Olympics. Can you just remind us of the Olympic headwinds this year, the timing, are they all in Q3, or is it more spread out, and any way to sort of size those as we think about the rest of the year?","Frank Mergenthaler","Thank you. It's a good assumption, Ben, to look at buybacks and the phasing in correlating with kind of our cash flows, which are seasonal, as you know, as you pointed out, that the first quarter is usually working capital negative. So they usually track pretty close. With respect to the Olympics and the third quarter, which was a big impact, the actual headwinds, I can't remember what that number is, quite frankly, in the U.K.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. But it's all concentrated in Q3?","Frank Mergenthaler","Yes, Q3, it's the U.K.","Michael Isor Roth","On the share buybacks, if you just take a look at the first quarter, our average price was a little bit over $12, $12.25. So we don't look at it as certain price targets. The way to do this is, over a period of time, do it on a program basis. We do have some flexibility to move on blips of our share price, but the right way to do this is consistent with our cash flow and over a reasonable period of time. Otherwise, it distorts the marketplace, and it's not -- it's consistent with what -- the way we've done it in the past, and it's worked well for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Fishman, Nomura.","Robert Fishman - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So while your European competitors spend a lot of time discussing digital in great detail, we know you don't break out digital revenue specifically. That said, we're wondering if you could try to give us a sense of how much your digital initiatives are contributing to your overall growth. And if you don't want to go there, maybe discuss how quickly some of your more digitally focused agencies, like Huge or R\/GA that you touched on in your prepared remarks, are growing.","Michael Isor Roth","Well, yes, again, you're right, and it's a standard question we get. We don't silo our digital offerings. We happen to have R\/GA, Huge, MRM, which are separate if you want to call them digital agency. I wouldn't call them pure-play digital agencies, but they are viewed that way in the marketplace. But all our agencies, we -- frankly, we just had a board meeting up in Boston. And when we review our capabilities of our agency, you can see all the digital capabilities there. And if you look at, for example, Weber Shandwick, the capabilities of Weber Shandwick, particularly in the social media environment, so it really is across the board. All of our agencies have very strong digital capabilities. That said, R\/GA and Huge are expanding globally. R\/GA is in Latin America, it's in Asia Pac, it's in the U.K., it's in Budapest. So R\/GA is expanding globally, and that's consistent with their growth, if you will. And Huge is expanding globally as well. So we are making investments in the expansion of those, if you want to call them pure-play digital agencies, but all of our agencies have digital capability, and we don't keep track of it. I find it hard to believe that people can really keep track of their digital play. Even in the siloed environment, it's hard to keep track of it, so that's the reason we don't put it out there. But it's a significant part of our growth and our future, which is why we're making the kind of investments in talent that we've been making.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter Stabler, Wells Fargo.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A question on Europe. I realize it's only 10% in the quarter. But I guess, I'm just trying to get a sense of whether you were significantly surprised by the continued weakness here. I guess, to put it another way, what's your visibility in Europe? Is it more difficult in Europe, given all the uncertainties, to look out multiple quarters than it is, let's say, in the U.S. even though you might be dealing with similar multinational clients? And then can you touch on -- I think you said that your expectations for the year don't include any sort of estimate for a recovery in Europe? Recovery is probably not the word any of us would use. I guess...","Michael Isor Roth","Right.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","We're trying to understand if your expectations bake in a level of continued decay or whether you think that there's at least stabilization that might be possible.","Michael Isor Roth","Yes, I think one of the problems you run into in our first quarter is the size of the numbers. It doesn't take much, either in positive or negative, to have a material impact on the organic growth or lack of, all right? And I think we're seeing that in the first quarter. It's certainly -- 5.8% is a higher number than we would've expected, but again, that's not a material number, if you will. I would expect, absent a further deterioration in Europe, that, that number would get more in line with the low single-digit negative number, which was similar to what we had in 2012. So that is more in line. But again, if it varies from that, it's not going to have a significant impact on us because of -- as that number goes negative and the other numbers go positive, it becomes a smaller number in relation to our total revenue and profitability. So we don't like to see it go that way, but of course, that's the benefit of a holding company. The visibility, the issue we have there is local business. And we get better visibility into our global clients in terms of what their budgeting for their spend in those markets. But it's the local clients that are more subject to cutbacks on a short-term basis.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just one quick follow-up there, Michael. Do you think you guys are any more or less exposed to local than your peers, who generally talk about half the business being in these markets being global and half being local.","Michael Isor Roth","Well, frankly, we're not based over there, so certainly, some of our competitors have a greater percentage of their business in those markets, and I think you've seen it in their results. So I would say they're more exposed to it than we are, if you just look at the percentages. And that's all I can comment. I don't know with the rest of their business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Nollen, Macquarie.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","I have another question on margins, please, just to make sure I understand the shape of operating margins this year. You've been saying Q2 might be a little bit on the light side for understandable reasons of account losses and ongoing pitches. But if you have ongoing pitches and the pipeline is still good, might that continue through, and how much impact does that have? And to make it more of a positive tone, if you're going to be flattish on margin, I'm not going to pin in a number on you, but if, let's say, it's flattish, doesn't that imply like 100 basis points of pick-up in the second half? And then if that all pans out as such and you do win some business and you keep driving costs down, aren't we talking about a lot more than 50 basis points of margin pick-up next year?","Michael Isor Roth","Well, the answer to your question is I hope we're that busy in pitches and spending money and converting it later on. Okay? I view that as money well spent. So if the explanation, not that I believe that's, in fact, going to be a truism, but if the explanation is that the ramp-up of expenses is greater because of pitch activity and we convert it to new business, I think you'll accept that explanation. But yes, I know, this is the way we manage our business, and we build up expenses for the pitches and we onboard people. What's interesting about our business, since we have some time, let me talk about it. When you win new business, you actually have to go out and recruit a significant amount of people to service those businesses. And so that's one of the explanations you see in a mismatch, if you will, on bringing new clients onboard, because you want to hire them as quickly as possible so that you're ready to take on and onboard the revenue stream. So that's part of what we're seeing. And yes, it may give some pressure on margin during that period, evidenced in the first quarter, but it should give rise to a greater expansion of margin. And obviously, when that happens, we'll build it into our forecast.","Frank Mergenthaler","And Tim, winning some meaningful accounts earlier in the year is helpful to the margin progression. Okay?","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","Sure. Any -- do you dare or care to make a comment on next year?","Michael Isor Roth","No. I just have to say the first quarter doesn't make a year.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","Yes, sure, but I think you tell from the tone of most of these questions, we're pretty pleased with the way it looks, and if it pans out, it's looking better.","Michael Isor Roth","When you -- I can tell you this much. At this point in the year versus last year, we're in a much better position, so that's encouraging for us. And like I say, if we keep the backdoor closed, then obviously, that's the way we want to operate our business.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","Okay. Can I ask just ask one quick follow-up, please, on the U.K.? I heard your answer before, and you have good businesses and operations there. But the economy in the U.K. isn't really that much different from the Eurozone. Why would you be so strong so consistently in the U.K. versus pretty negative in Europe?","Michael Isor Roth","Again, it's -- the numbers are not that big. So what we need is one particular client to spend in the first quarter, and it somewhat distorts. I'm not putting the U.K. in the category of an emerging market, like Latin America. It's nice to see it positive, but I don't know whether we can continue to show those kinds of organic growth in the U.K.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Salmon, BMO Capital Markets.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Michael, you've -- you always take a lot of pride in Interpublic's role in sports marketing in Octagon. Would you ever have any interest in any of the assets at IMG?","Michael Isor Roth","I think we are well represented by Octagon. They're doing a great job. They are certainly a force in the marketplace, and we're comfortable with the work that they're doing and their size.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Dix, Wedbush Securities.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","With all the new business coming in the door, you might have been excused for forgetting about the macro environment. But just turning back to it, how did your performance by region compared to your internal expectations for the first quarter? And how do you feel about the overall macro environment now versus a couple months ago? And then I just have a follow-up, Mike.","Michael Isor Roth","Yes, this isn't that far from when we did our year-end numbers and we gave out our 2% to 3%. We haven't changed on that. I think that, certainly, the tone of the business is better than it was last year, but I'm not raising any flags in terms of our victory, in terms of turning the corner and getting back to the levels of 4% to 5% growth that we would like to see on an ongoing basis. So we're still cautious about it. And I think 2% to 3% is a fair number to use given the macroeconomic environment that we're in. We still have problems in Europe, and the spillover effect of that is real. The United States, although it's growing, is not growing at the rates I would like to see it growing at. And we still have issues, obviously, in Washington and what impact it has on confidence. I mean, this business is based on confidence. And until we get all these issues behind us, it's going to be hard for us to put out a number that shows any strength in the economy greater than the low-single digits that we're talking about. So the surprises -- Europe was a surprise, but how do you predict small numbers like that and the effect of it? So I think it was pretty consistent with what -- we do our forecasting on a bottoms-up. We're not -- no one is really great on a quarter-by-quarter basis in terms of how you can forecast this business. So that's why we were very careful in saying this is a full-year analysis, and that's how we manage our business. So I'm very comfortable now, with the numbers we've given, and it looks like, given the fact that we have these positive news, in our ability to achieve it.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then one follow-up on expense. Just as we see the new business wins come in and the associated expenses, any particular line items we should be focusing on? I mean, is it all going to be in base salaries, or are there any other of the subcomponents, which you provide all this detail on, that we should be thinking about as well?","Michael Isor Roth","Yes, well, first of all, base salaries is obviously an important factor. As you ramp up people to service the business, your salary levels go up. We use temporary help during the period until we just -- our full-time capabilities within it. And sometimes, you see a little ramp-up in occupancy because we actually have to take some space for these people. For example, Mullen is going to beef up its presence on the West Coast because of the Acura win. So those are the kind of things that we're in a process of addressing.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. So temporary help maybe and maybe some in the O&G line, other than just the base salaries line that we'll be focusing on.","Michael Isor Roth","Right.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Wieser, Pivotal Research.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Quick question on the pass-throughs. I was wondering how much of the organic growth was attributable to that. And secondly, I was just wondering if you could talk about some of the APAC markets. You mentioned that Australia and India were up. By inference, some of the other major markets were not or they were less up. Just curious if you could talk about that region and your expectations for the rest of the year.","Michael Isor Roth","Yes, we had some more difficult comps in China that we had to deal with. We had an event in China, so we've -- the growth in China was not consistent with that because of that comp, if you will. Japan was relatively flat, slightly up, I believe. And Australia, as I said, and India were very solid. And LatAm, we talked about. In terms of pass-throughs, as Frank indicated in his remarks and I indicated in mine, the pass-through costs, well, the growth in our expense line is probably similar to what you see on the growth side.","Frank Mergenthaler","All of the growth, Brian, in the O&G side, as we said in the comments, was primarily pass-through.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","So if we stripped out the 0.7% from the organic growth, would that be a more accurate number, if you stripped out pass-throughs?","Frank Mergenthaler","Almost all of the growth in the O&G line comes from pass-throughs. If we provide an update in there, you can do that.","Operator","At this time, I will turn the call back to Mr. Roth for final comments.","Michael Isor Roth","Okay, well, my final comments are we're excited, we're encouraged by what we see in this first quarter, and we thank you for all your support. And we still have the rest of the year to go, so we're working hard. Thank you very much.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for attending.

All parties are in a listen-only mode, until the question-and-answer portion. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would like to introduce Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Thank you.","Jerome Leshne","Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com. This morning, we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 A.M. Eastern.","During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our Company. These are subject to the uncertainties in the cautionary statement that is included in our earnings release and the slide presentation and further detailed in our 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP measures, allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operating performance.","At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Jerry. And thank you all for joining us this morning as we review our results for the quarter. I'll start by covering highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional detail, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies, to be followed by our Q&A.","We're pleased to report another quarter of solid revenue and operating profit growth. Our net revenue organic growth was 3.6% in Q1, and operating income exceeded 12% from a year-ago. Growth in the U.S. was notably strong at 4.3%, while international growth was 2.6%, paced by strong results in the UK and LatAm.","Our increases were driven by a wide range of disciplines, including media, our digital specialists, our creative-led integrated agencies and our events and sports marketing agencies. This continues to underscore the strength and competitiveness of our offerings across the portfolio and is an encouraging start to the year.","Q1 operating profit was $39 million compared with $35 million last year, which reflects both our topline growth and the effectiveness of our ongoing disciplines around expenses. As you know, our first quarter is seasonally small in terms of revenue, while total costs are distributed fairly evenly through the year. That said, our performance is indicative of solid progress toward our full-year financial targets.","Returning to the topline, our growth reflects contributions from a wide range of our agencies, most notably Mediabrands, Huge, McCann, FCB, MullenLowe Group, Octagon, Jack Morton and Deutsch. We saw our increases from both new business wins and existing client spend. In terms of client sectors, we were led by increases in the financial services, healthcare and auto and transportation.","Our capital structure continued to be a source of value creation. As announced in February, our Board increased our dividend by 17%, marking the sixth consecutive year of double-digit percentage increases. We also announced in February that our Board had authorized another $300 million toward share repurchase. We used $55 million to repurchase 2.4 million shares in the first quarter, and we have 400 million remaining on our outstanding repurchase authorizations.","Earlier this month, Fitch Investor Services upgraded our senior debt credit ratings to BBB+, further recognizing our Company's strong credit profile. We're pleased that our performance continues to reflect the excellence of our people. Outstanding consumer insights grounded in data and analytics, industry-leading creativity and the delivery of efficient and precisely targeted communications have all become hallmarks of IPG and our agencies.","The top-tier media, creative, marketing services, digital and business transformation capabilities we have across the portfolio continue to be differentiators for us. By always keeping the clients' needs front and center, we combine all of these skill sets into customized, integrated, open-architecture solutions. This, in turn, positions us strongly in the evolving world of media and marketing.","We are always highly focused on capitalizing on growth to drive further margin expansion and capital returns as well as continuing to invest in our businesses. The strength of our offerings, coupled with strong operating discipline, is a winning combination for clients and shareholders alike.","As you know, Q1 is seasonally small for us, and there remains macro uncertainty to contend with as we move forward through the year. But we are confident that performance to date and the current tone of business has us on track to deliver on the growth and income targets we have outlined for the full-year, which is in the high end of 2% to 3% organic growth and 60 to 70 basis points of operating margin expansion from our restated 2017 results.","At this stage, I'll turn it over to Frank for additional detail on our results. And after his remarks, I'll be back to provide our update on our agencies and the tone of business, followed by a Q&A.","Frank Mergenthaler","Thank you, Michael. Good morning. I'll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. A reminder that we're reporting with a new accounting standard for revenue recognition, ASC 606. In adopting the new standard, we elected to restate 2017. This means we are directly comparing our first quarter this year to Q1 2017 on the same revenue accounting standard.","With the adoption of 606, there is no change for our management priorities or to value creation. There is no change to cash flow. And our target for operating income in 2018, which we outlined on our last conference call in February, is also unchanged.","Secondly, from 606, our income statement now reflects the functional format. This is strictly a matter of reclassifying expenses to cost of services provided to our clients and SG&A and has no impact on operating results. Expenses recorded to SG&A are less than 2% of our total operating expense in 2017.","We furnished the preliminary 2017 restatement by quarter earlier this week in a Form 8-K, along with an explanatory presentation. We have also included a summary of the impact of 606 in the appendix of today's earnings presentation.","Moving to Slide 2, you'll see an overview of our results in the quarter. Organic growth of our net revenue was 3.6% in the first quarter. Growth was strong in the U.S. at 4.3% and was 2.6% in our international markets. Q1 operating profit was $39 million, an increase of 12% compared to last year. Diluted EPS was a loss of $0.04.","Adjusted for losses on sales of business in the quarter, mainly non-cash, earnings were $0.03 per diluted share. Our high adjusted tax rate in the quarter was due to the mix of our profitability by region. Volatility in our first quarter tax rate is not unusual, given our seasonally small level of pretax income. And we continue to expect a 28% effective tax rate for the full-year.","Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. Here, it is worth noting the breakout of billable expenses and net revenue. Further, under operating expenses, the first three line items comprise our cost of services, salaries and related, office and other, and billable expenses.","Our expense for selling, general and administrative tracks closely to our corporate segment expense. We are also breaking out depreciation and amortization expense on the face of the income statement. Further down the P&L, below operating income, it is also worth noting that we had other expense of $24 million in Q1, which reflects losses on sales of businesses in the quarter, mainly non-cash.","Turning to more detail on net revenue on Slide 4. Net revenue was $1.77 billion in the quarter, which was an increase of 5.9% from Q1 2017. The impact of the change on exchange rates was a positive 3%, while net dispositions were negative 70 basis points. The resulting organic increase was 3.6%.","On the bottom half of this slide, net revenue organic growth was 4.3% at our Integrated Agency Network segment. We had contributions from all the IAN disciplines and across a range of agencies. CMG grew 60 basis points organically, led by Octagon sports marketing and Jack Morton events and experiential as well as FutureBrand.","Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. U.S. organic growth was 4.3%. Again, advances were broadly shared across disciplines and agencies, notably by Mediabrands, Huge and Digital, FCB, McCann, MullenLowe Group and Octagon. In terms of client sectors, we were led in the U.S. by financial services, CPG, healthcare and auto and transportation.","Turning to the international markets, we posted another strong quarter in the UK, which grew 7.8%. Growth was again notably strong at McCann UK, along with Mediabrands, Huge and the MullenLowe Group. In Continental Europe, net revenue decreased 10 basis points organically. Among our largest markets, Spain and Italy increased, while France and Germany decreased in the quarter.","In Asia Pac, we had an organic decrease of 2.2%, reflecting lower spending from a number of our clients across most of the region, along with some account losses, partially offset by growth in Japan.","LatAm grew 10.6% organically. We continue to have very strong growth in Mexico, Argentina and Colombia, while more than offset the ongoing macro headwinds in Brazil. Net revenue in other markets grew - increased 1.9% organically, led by growth in Canada.","Moving on to Slide 6 on operating expenses. Q1 net revenue operating margin grew 10 basis points to 2.2%. Our ratio of salaries and related expenses to net revenue was 75% compared to 74.7% a year-ago. The increase was due to higher severance expense as well as increased expense for temporary labor. Total headcount at quarter-end was approximately 50,000, which is approximately flat from a year-ago.","Our office and other direct expenses was 18.3% of net revenue in the quarter. We generated operating leverage of 40 basis points from last year, including 20 basis points of improvement on our occupancy costs. We leveraged SG&A expenses by 10 basis points, which were 2% compared to 2.1% a year-ago. Our expense for D&A increased $5 million from a year-ago and was 2.6% to net revenue compared with 2.4% a year-ago.","Slide 7 is the bridge from our diluted loss per share of $0.04, as reported, to net income of $0.03 per diluted share, as adjusted. As you can see, our pretax results includes a below-the-line loss of $24 million related to the sale of small non-strategic agencies. There was essentially no tax benefit against that loss. The net impact was a loss of 6p per diluted share, resulting in adjusted earnings of $0.03 per diluted share.","On Slide 8, we turn to cash flow. Cash used in operations in Q1 was $730 million compared with $372 million a year-ago. As you know, our operating cash flow is highly seasonal. Our business typically generates significant cash from working capital in the fourth quarter and uses cash in the first quarter. During this year's first quarter, cash used in working capital was $775 million. This follows our large seasonal cash build in last year's fourth quarter when we generated $678 million.","Investing activities used $23 million in the quarter for CapEx. Financing activities provided $558 million net due to an increase in short-term borrowings, mainly utilized in our commercial paper program. We used $81 million for our common stock dividend and $55 million for share repurchases. Our net decrease in cash for the quarter was $198 million.","Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 9. We ended the first quarter with $597 million in cash and equivalents. Our cash level is seasonal, as you've seen over the years, and tends to peak at year-end and decrease during the first quarter.","On Slide 10, we show our lower total debt levels at year-end over the past 10 years and, at the far right, our position at March 31 this year and last year. We are utilizing more short-term commercial paper and less term debt. As a result, our total debt has been more variable over recent quarters than it had been previously.","In summary, on Slide 11, we are pleased with solid revenue growth and profit performance in the quarter, which represents a good start in terms of achieving our financial objectives for the full-year.","With that, let me turn it back over to Michael.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Frank. And we are certainly pleased with the results in the quarter, with organic revenue growth an encouraging indicator and notably strong domestic performance on that important metric. This came from a very broad range of our clients as well as a cross-section of our agencies.","Building on a solid Q4 of last year, we believe we're seeing evidence of marketers returning to growth mode, which would clearly be positive for us as well as our sector. While there is still macro uncertainty, we continue to believe that economic fundamentals are sound, especially in the U.S. This is vital if we are to see clients further invest behind their brands as well as in business innovation. Those are both key areas in which Interpublic can clearly add significant value.","The way we do this is to ensure that each of the agencies in our portfolio is a leader in their respective discipline. That's why over the past decade, we've consistently invested in organic talent development. Concurrently, we built a culture that makes us an employer of choice as well as one in which collaboration is a core value so that delivering open architecture solutions is a basic part of our DNA.","This long-standing commitment to open architecture recently led to a significant new business win with one of the world's top 10 pharma companies, which incorporates our healthcare agencies as well as digital, advertising and PR. It's gratifying to report that we continue to see significant success in recruiting top talent and nurturing future leaders across a full range of capabilities, from digital to creative, strategy to data and technology. When our agencies post industry-leading performance in awards competitions and we are a leader in recognition from top industry publications, we know that we're on the right track in terms of our talent agenda.","Equally important, when our holding company has the highest representation of women leaders in an initiative such as Time's Up advertising, we also know that we're on the right track as it relates to our culture and values. Diversity and inclusion have been a priority for us for some time now, and we're proud of the work we have done to move the business forward on a number of key dimensions of diversity.","As the world of media and marketing becomes more complex, the importance of consumer insights as well as powerful and engaging content becomes increasingly important. In order to excel in these areas, we need to ensure that our teams represent the widest possible range of backgrounds, perspectives and life experiences.","So we will remain committed to our D&I initiatives, just as we'll keep holding ourselves and our people to the highest standards of personal conduct. And we will also continue to engage with a full range of stakeholders on major issues around sustainability and corporate responsibility.","On the subject of complexity, we still believe that the speed at which technology is impacting media and consumers as well as the challenges that pace of change creates for marketers represent a meaningful opportunity for us. With expertise across the digital value chain and a totally agnostic focus on our clients' business needs, a company like IPG is particularly well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving marketplace.","Let's now move on to the performance at the agency level and review progress on key developments from across the group. Highlights in the quarter were led by Mediabrands, which once again posted very strong performance. We continued to see strength in new business with wins such as Liberty Mutual and The Honest Company ad initiative as well as UM winning the Australian Federal Government and adding markets like India, South Africa and Vietnam with Spotify.","UM also appointed the industry's first chief brand safety officer. This is a key area of focus that demonstrates our leadership and keeping clients' interest first and foremost in the digital ecosystem. It's fully consistent with our long-standing position to not take inventory positions in media so that we can provide unbiased counsel to our clients.","During the quarter, Cadreon, our programmatic platform, made news by naming Erica Schmidt as the Company's global CEO. We also announced the first-of-its-kind strategic data and technology partnership with Nielsen. This will give us the ability to match millions of Mediabrands consumer IDs housed within AMP, our audience management platform, with extensive Nielsen TV viewing as well as purchase behavior insights.","At McCann Worldgroup, the quarter saw a continued solid performance as well as very high levels of industry recognition. MRM\/\/McCann followed its first-ever Grand Prix at Cannes last year by being named Business-to-Business Agency of the Year by AdAge during Q1. In March, the agency was also named the Magic Quadrant leader by Gartner among all global digital marketing agencies. This is an important and coveted designation within MRM, secured by combining compelling, creative with deep technology capabilities.","Another leading agency in the Worldgroup family, McCann Health, also made news earlier this month by launching the industry's first global scientific council. This will tap into the medical community as well as scientists in government and other institutions to further elevate the sharing of evidence-based science in the interest of our pharma and healthcare clients. Innovations such as this are what is helping McCann Health win network of the year on its two years running at Cannes.","Combining best-in-class specialist organizations, such as MRM and McCann Health, with the reach and creative firepower of McCann's global network, results in a very powerful offering that can make a real impact on our clients' businesses.","At FCB, we also have an exceptional group of healthcare agencies, which is important since this is one of the most dynamic growing sectors of our industry. A real standout of late is Area 23, which was just recognized by Med Ad News as the most creative agency and most admired agency in the U.S. as well as the Agency of the Year.","Other bright spots across the network include FCB Chicago's win of the very competitive GE Appliance review, the win of Hotwire by FCB West office in San Francisco and the agency's addition of Mini in Spain, which builds on their recent success with BMW across Europe and in Canada.","During the quarter, the agency also launched a new content marketing division that will serve the global network and will be based in India, where FCB has built one of the markets largest and most respected full-service agencies.","MullenLowe had a strong quarter on a range of fronts. The agency won significant accounts, such as Unilever's PG tips brand in the U.K., Lufthansa in China, Tesco in Malaysia and AkzoNobel's Professional Paints business globally. And earlier this week, the network announced a major global new business win with Edgewell and the Schick brand.","MullenLowe Mediahub, the agency's bundled media offering, is also a standout performer. The agency had been on a winning streak and added a number of significant clients in the quarter, including Global Road Entertainment and Wyndham Hotel Group. And Mediahub was also named Creative Agency of the Year by MediaPost and recently expanded its New York office.","On the digital transformation front, the agency recently launched a data science and analytic center in excellence of the APAC region, which would include decision in cognitive scientists and be based in Tokyo. Last year, we called out the challenging environment for project businesses, particularly as the year progressed.","During this year's first quarter, we saw marked improvement in this area. Results at Huge were much improved, and we transitioned to new leadership that will position the agency for its next stage of development. Huge is reinvesting in consulting and business transformation expertise, capabilities which it helped to pioneer a number of years ago.","R\/GA, which has been a leader at every step in the evolution of digital marketing, further built out its senior team and made a number of major new appointments in areas, including technology and design. R\/GA was named a Magic Quadrant leader by Gartner as well among all global digital marketing agencies.","And the agency also won a significant consulting and implementation assignment from Shiseido in its new Tokyo office. And it launched the new LOT in sports tech accelerators, one in London and the other in Los Angeles. At Cannes, we look forward to introducing a new program devoted to startups with female founders.","At CMG, we're also seeing an increased activity and opportunity. As we previously called out, Weber Shandwick and Golin are among the most highly awarded PR agencies in the business. We are especially proud that Weber Shandwick recently won PR Week's Agency of the Year honor for the fourth consecutive year.","They have consistently been ahead of the game in building digital expertise, especially in social and, more recently, in data science and analytics. And while we are unable to identify the clients here, we're pleased that Weber closed 2017 with a significant consolidation with a global healthcare company.","Golin recently won important assignments from Exxon for corporate sustainability. Also at CMG, Octagon continue to post strong performance, and Jack Morton also had a good quarter. At Octagon, existing clients were up, with contributions coming from the marketing segment domestically and internationally as well as from the entertainment and talent. At Jack Morton, we saw good growth across all regions, and FutureBrand's win of Cisco's brand architecture was a standout in the quarter.","Our U.S. independents round out our portfolio. These agencies deliver a range of integrated services to their clients and also can combine with the rest of the IPG offering on our collaborative open architecture solutions.","During the quarter, highlights within this group included Carmichael Lynch's win with Helzberg Diamonds; Hill Holliday's win with Frontier Communications; and just last week, a partnership between Deutsch and Starco Brands, which will see the agency work to introduce products in a range of consumer categories, including household and personal care; and The Martin Agency's win with Sling TV. Another item of note at Martin was the announcement that the agency had named its first-ever female Chief Creative Officer, Karen Costello.","It's fair to say that the quality of our agencies and our talent base is what makes us competitive in the marketplace. Our ability to consistently deliver organic revenue growth that is ahead of the industry average bears that out. We remain net new business positive for the past 12 months. And as new business activity has begun to pick up this year, we're seeing all of our agencies invited on a range of opportunities.","Of course, we will also remain disciplined in managing our costs, which is what has allowed us to make such great strides when it comes to enhancing the company's profitability over the long-term. One place you can expect us to continue to invest is in further developing our data stack, and the products that sit on top of it remains a priority for us.","This will allow our media agencies to activate the data for highly targeted and accountable planning and buying purposes. In time, it should also become an asset that all of our agencies can plug into to inform both the messaging and the channels we use to connect our clients with the right consumer audiences.","The first quarter is seasonally our smallest quarter, and we have most of 2018 still ahead of us. But the tone of business is solid as you've seen today in our [Q4] results. Our client conversations are constructive with respect to their plans for brand investment and consumer engagement.","These discussions reflect the value that we bring to the table in helping clients navigate the complex media and consumer environment. Our experience in the unique set of resources that we can bring to bear on their behalf gives us confidence that we can continue to play an important role as marketers seek to innovate and grow.","Looking forward, we see the results that we are sharing today as indicative of a solid start to 2018. We believe that we remain well-positioned to deliver the financial targets that we outlined earlier this year, the high end of 2% to 3% organic growth and 60 basis points to 70 basis points of operating margin expansion from our restated 2017 results.","Combined with the strength of our balance sheet and our proven commitment and delivery when it comes to capital return, that means there remains significant potential value, value creation and enhanced shareholder value at IPG. As always, it's appropriate to thank our clients and our people who are the ultimate drivers of our success.","With that, I'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Alexia Quadrani","Hi, thank you so much. Just a couple of questions. The first one, on the impressive improvement in organic growth, particularly in the U.S. that you saw in the quarter. I think I heard that one of the drivers or one of the segments that was doing better was the consumer packaged goods sector. I guess if you could elaborate if that was sort of the existing clients now spending a bit more with you guys or it was influenced by new business wins. And I think you also said that digital picked up notably in the quarter. A same sort of question there, is it - clients I think maybe had pulled back last year, I think, starting in Q2, that maybe you are sort of rereleasing and feel more comfortable with the market. I guess, any color would be hugely helpful.","Michael Roth","Great. Good questions, Alexia, as always. Glad you picked up on the consumer side. What we did see - and by the way, our performance in this quarter is reflective of both additional spend by existing clients and by net new business wins. And we've seen that in the consumer goods, particularly in the U.S. So in the U.S., actually, consumer goods was up 10%, and that was reflective of new business wins and some additional client spend in the U.S. On a global basis, however, consumer goods was basically flat. So we did see some, obviously, cuts continuing in Europe with respect to some of our consumer goods clients, but that was offset by the positive results in the U.S.","On the digital side, when I discuss project-based businesses and I refer to, for example, Huge, last year, as I indicated, we had a lot of these large, project-based businesses that didn't repeat, and that had an adverse effect in our results in 2017. What we did see in the first quarter, particularly at Huge and MRM was a pickup in those types of projects and new business win combination. So that accounts for the increase in our digital businesses in the U.S. We also saw a good positive pickup on the digital side of our businesses at Mediabrands, particularly at Cadreon and Reprise.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you. And then just to clarify because we are getting some e-mails. The guidance that you've given and the target that you've given, really, obviously, for the same exact profit dollars, that, that doesn't get impacted at all by the accounting change in your statement?","Michael Roth","That's correct. When we said - I might as well put this out there because I know this question is there. When I said we expect the target for the year to be on the high end 2% to 3%, when we set our targets for the year of 2% to 3%, we knew, or at least we had a good shot at knowing, what this restatement impact was going to be. So you can properly conclude that a part of that statement, particularly the high end, in other words, closer to the 3%, is as a result of some of the movement as a result of the accounting change. But the fundamental 2% to 3% target remains intact, and that's real growth from our businesses.","Similarly, the change in the margin, if you remember, we set it at 20 basis points, when you compare it to the restated number because of the movement of some of the earnings into another year, that converts to the 60 basis points to 70 basis points of margin expansion. So when I set our target now is 2% to 3% with the high end of 3% and 60 to 70 basis point margin expansion, that's the equivalent of apples-to-apples last year when we set our goal at 2% to 3% and 20 basis points. Did I do that right?","Alexia Quadrani","That's very helpful. That's perfect.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Benjamin Swinburne","Good morning, guys. Michael, I just wanted to pick up a little bit on that comment on the consumer, and I think it's a really interesting trend that you're talking about. When we look at the results, like Colgate reported this morning, and I'm certainly not a consumer analyst, but if you look across P&G and a lot of these - their businesses are really struggling. And I think they've been - there's a debate in the market of whether they should invest more or less to address the struggling top line. I think one of your, I guess, former peers used to call it short-termism.","Do you think there's a change in how they're thinking about defending their brands and we're seeing that pick up in the spending trends? I know it's one quarter. It's always dangerous to react too much to one quarter. But some of these topline numbers are pretty tough when you look at their results on unit growth or pricing. And I think people are wondering what's the right move if you're running one of those companies around marketing. Obviously, I know you have a perspective on that.","Michael Roth","I have an answer to that, Ben.","Benjamin Swinburne","Yes. But I guess, I'm curious if you really think you're seeing a change in how they're managing their brand spend and reacting to this tough topline scenario as Amazon sets to open at an all-time high.","Michael Roth","Look, obviously, my view, and I think it's the correct one, is that in order to grow brands, you have to spend marketing dollars, period. In the last couple of months, I have been meeting with the top CEOs of a number of our global clients. And during those discussions, obviously, I asked those questions. And in fact, one of the CEOs specifically said, don't be bashful to mention the fact that we believe in building our brands and investing marketing dollars.","The same is true as the other CEOs, because how else can you compete on an e-commerce basis if you don't have, first of all, a quality product, or let's assume that product is quality. It's not - you're not in the game, but you have to build brand loyalty. You have to build brand recognition to compete on the e-commerce platform. And the CEOs recognize that that's an imperative for them to gain market share or, in fact, maintain revenue growth. So the answer is yes. The tone from these clients is that we have to spend marketing dollars.","On the other side, they want to make sure that they're not throwing money away on their marketing dollars. So that's where we actually come into the picture. Not only do we come up with a big creative idea to help brand affiliation and brand loyalty, we have to come out with the right platform and allocation of media and insights, combine that with the creative to help them move the needle. And that's where the battle is being fought right now.","So that's why you hear us talking about investing in data analytics. That's how why you hear me talking about our data analytics isn't just applicable to media allocations. It's also applicable to our creative content. So all of this is with a view towards meeting the needs of our clients to provide those insights and brand loyalty buildup. So they're talking about it. In fact, I was listening to the earnings call yesterday on a number of companies, and clearly, they were all talking about increasing marketing spend. And in this environment, you have to do that.","Benjamin Swinburne","Yes. And just a question for Frank on the 606 rabbit hole, I apologize. Actually, I think I got it down for the year. Is the impact on a quarterly basis much different than your impact for the year on what you think 606 timing shifts meant? Or any color on Q1 just to help us think about that?","Frank Mergenthaler","Do you know what, Ben, we made a decision to restate the prior year, right, so it's complete apples-to-apples. So there should be no issue around the accounting as it relates to comparability in each quarter. And that's why we released the 8-K on Monday to show the restated 2017.","Michael Roth","I think the reason our conversation is focusing on our operating income, because that's the relevant number. If you look at our revenue, if you look at our expenses and you have operating income, that's real growth and it's real tone of business reflected in those numbers.","Benjamin Swinburne","Okay. Thank you.","Michael Roth","You are welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Joyce of Evercore. Your line is now open.","David Joyce","Thank you. Given that there appears to be a heightened level of agency reviews underway in the industry, can you help us think about the trends that were starting to emerge in terms of consolidating accounts? It seems like there's been creative agencies on a project at one holdco and media buying on another. Do you see those coming together some more? And with these reviews that are underway, how would they be playing into the revenue trends this year? Thank you.","Michael Roth","Look, the number of the reviews are either as a result of a three-year timeframe when typically these big companies, from a procurement point of view, have a mandatory review. The other way of looking at it is with all the complexity and all the changes in the marketplace, it's healthy for them to look at their offerings and how it comes together. Every one of the RFPs that we're getting are coming into a holding company issue of what resources can you put to work on our needs, and you come back with a solution.","Now each of us in the industry have different ways of approaching that. Our way of approaching it, we've been doing it for 12 years, is open architecture, where we bring together the best that IPG has to offer. And it may be focused more on a medium pitch, bringing in creative and other capabilities to it, or maybe from the creative side where we show the insights from data analytics and how that works.","And that's what's going to win on these pitches that are out there. Clients want to see our capability on an integrated basis to bring in all the resources we have. And the good news on the pitches that you've been reading about is most of them are not our clients. So we view them as opportunities.","That said, your next question is going to be, well, what are your clients, okay? And obviously, we still have the Army, which is a nice account for us that we've had for 12 years. Finally, it was a mandatory review. We're in the final stages of that, and that's both for media and creative. And McCann is a trusted partner of the Army, and we're working that and hope to hear from them, obviously, this year, we hope.","But it's that's one. We have Dunkin' Donuts media review up there. And of course, Volkswagen was just recently announced where we do the creative work in the U.S. at Deutsch. And those are the major reviews that we have that are public out there, and the rest that you see are opportunities for us in which we're participating.","Michael Roth","Thank you and we have the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Janedis from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","John Janedis","Thanks. Michael, maybe a bit of a follow-up, it looks like you're going to lead the peer group on the organic side, and I know you've talked about some of the delayed budget. But any sense of tax reform money flowing in? And based on some of the uncertainty at your peers, are marketers or talent looking at IPG for stability when making decisions? Or who they do business with because I was thinking there's maybe an opportunity to take some share here this year?","Michael Roth","They've always looked to IPG for stability, which is a great statement to make - given those you know the history of IPG. Look, I think the fact that we've been certainly the leaders in the transparency and agnostic view of allocation in media, I think all of that lends itself to our credibility in dealing with our clients.","And I heard that directly in some pitches where the consultants sort of had it as a given that we're wearing a white hat, and the way we approach these things is with the client interest first. And that reputation helps us considerably. And it's how we go to market. And I think if you remember the last time we had Mediapalooza, we did quite well in it. And I don't like to jinx things, but we hope to do well this year on the new pitches, and I said most of those are new opportunities for us.","On the Volkswagen one, they are looking for global consolidation. We do the U.S. Volkswagen with Deutsch. They're very happy with the work that Deutsch has been doing. So obviously, we're going to put our best foot forward on that one, but other than that, these are all opportunities.","And obviously in this marketplace, it's very competitive, and clients are looking for stability and agencies that they can trust. And I'd like to believe that we're that agency and holding company that has those kinds of people and offerings.","John Janedis","Okay. Maybe one for Frank, look I know that you've been investing in people and analytics. But with severance ticking up, I was thinking about the margin outlook. So would it be fair to assume you'll start to see some more leverage and the base in benefits line going forward, given the revenue outlook?","Frank Mergenthaler","Yes, John. The first quarter is our smallest quarter profitability-wise. So the metric of 1.6% severance seems high. We still model 1% for the full year, and there's nothing - that was baked into our guidance. So we should start to see incremental leverage through the salary line.","John Janedis","Great, thanks guys.","Frank Mergenthaler","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Peter Stabler","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Michael, I think we can all agree 2005 is ancient history.","Michael Roth","Thank you.","Peter Stabler","So stop talking about stability. So just a couple, you talked about macro, you referenced macro uncertainty a couple of times. And given the fact that GDP outlook is generally pretty decent, wondering if you can offer a little more color. Are you talking about kind of client sectors? Or are you talking about more on a regional dynamic basis that you still see pockets of macro uncertainty? Where does the U.S. fit into that framework? And then secondly, I know you're allowed to pick up all your guidance. But given the strong start in the U.S., do you think the U.S. could outperform international this year?","Michael Roth","All right, well, let me go back - I didn't answer one of John's questions, but it ties into what you're talking about, and that is his question about tax. And being a former tax guy, I do have clients, whether they're using their tax dollars to increase marketing spend, which ties into the macro economics.","And I have had some conversations where look, none of our clients, frankly, unfortunately, had capital constraints in terms of where they spend their money. But I did for the first time, in Davos, for example, meet with some clients who indicated that the tax law changes were beneficial as it was to us. And therefore, some of those tax dollars will be used in marketing dollars, which is good.","But the real issue for them is the return on investment for the marketing dollars. And if we can prove it, they'll spend the money and they have it. The macroeconomic issues that I raised is both. One is stability and frankly, the global environment. I mean, we can't disregard any issues that might impact the macroeconomic.","Right now, frankly, the tone is very positive, particularly in the U.S., and we hope that continues. But you always have to put the caveat out there that this is subject to macroeconomic impact, which we know we saw at one time years ago, and we always have to put that out there.","But right now, the tone is very positive, and there are sectors that are coming under strain. And yes, the question on consumer goods is relevant to that because we did see significant cutbacks in consumer goods when there were activists, when there were pressures on margin.","But I think our clients are realizing that you can't continue not to spend marketing dollars and drive revenue because it's hard to cut just expenses without revenue to increase margin. So I'm somewhat - I'll put it out there that it feels like some of the bleeding on consumer goods and cuts is slowing down, I'll put it that way.","And in some cases, it stopped. And that's an opportunity for us. And I have to believe that as long as the macroeconomic environment continues to be positive, whether it be in Europe, particularly in the UK, which is obviously, we've shown good performance in the UK again at 7.8% organic growth, net organic growth, that clients will feel more comfortable spending and converting that marketing dollars to revenue and margin.","Peter Stabler","Did U.S. outgrow international?","Michael Roth","Well - look, 62% of our business is in the U.S., right? And therefore, it's kind of important that we continue that. And if you look at the fourth quarter and you look at the first quarter, our U.S. performance is outperforming. And you know what, if that's the way it is, we'll take it.","Peter Stabler","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Nollen of Macquarie. Your line is open.","Timothy Nollen","Thanks. My question is about data privacy and regulation. You guys have said for many, many years now actually that your agencies, like MRM and Huge and R\/GA, are very strong and doing very well. You mentioned today about investing in data and using your data stack to have your - all your agencies draw up on that.","With GDPR right around the corner now in Europe, and obviously, it's a European initiative and that's a relatively small business for you in Europe geographically, but I think it applies across much of the organization still. I wonder if you could talk about, first off, if you're confident in your level of compliance with GDPR. And secondly, if you can talk about any client spending reactions to GDPR, i.e., any fear or potential slowdown there with that really just a few weeks away now? Thanks.","Michael Roth","Yes, - you're correct. Right now, GDPR is a European issue because at the end of the month, it comes into effect. Now this didn't sneak up on us, all right? So we knew it was coming. And frankly, let me - I think it's totally appropriate for transparency and privacy to be in the forefront of what we do.","And we've tackled this in a centralized basis because that's the way to deal with it when you're dealing with a global company and when you have global clients. And we set up appropriate teams and we're very comfortable that when the time comes at the end of May, we will be ready for it, and we will be able to pass whatever issues come to us under that environment.","And we've been working very closely with our third-party providers where a lot of these issues come into play. And frankly, our expertise in this is relevant to both third-party providers as well as our clients.","So we have seen clients working with us to make sure they're compliant as well. So we just recently had calls on this. We've had a presentation to our Board of Directors on this. And we're very comfortable where - how we are positioned to meet the needs of this.","And look, the regulations are coming out. Some haven't come out yet, but - and we're monitoring it very closely, but we have the appropriate structure within IPG to solve any issues that come out of these regulations.","And then look, this is going to evolve. No one is going to get it 100% right. The ethics of our data and relationship with our clients, our consumers and third-parties is a top priority for us and we're comfortable that we'll be able to meet those needs.","Timothy Nollen","And will clients continue to spend, or is there maybe last minute anxieties there?","Michael Roth","Yes, no, I think clients will continue to spend. Look, they realize this was on the horizon as well, and we haven't seen any pullbacks. And let me just add, because that's probably a follow-up question, we haven't seen any major pullbacks in light of the Facebook issues that are out there as well. Look, it's a concern.","We're working with Facebook to make sure that third-party data has the appropriate permissions that are necessary. Client information, as long as clients are using their own data on Facebook, that seems to be okay. So there are ways to deal with this, and Facebook every day is coming out with new solutions to it. So I think that, ultimately, we'll all get this right, but clients are not pulling back to date as a result.","Timothy Nollen","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet of Citi. Your line is open.","Jason Bazinet","Thanks. I just had a quick question on taxes. I think it was asked earlier, but given that 60% of your business is U.S.-based, how do we get such a high GAAP tax rate at that 28%? And is there something unusual that might lead us to believe that it could be a lower GAAP tax rate two, three years down the road? Thanks.","Michael Roth","Funny you should ask that question. Look, obviously, the tax rate - first of all, its small revenue in the first quarter. And the real reason why our tax rate is so high is that, if you recall, when Frank was talking about the disposition of assets, we had $20 some-odd million of write-offs.","We had some losses in foreign countries, if you will, which we don't have the benefit. And we don't get the benefit of the tax losses for the write-offs that we were referring to. So that had an abnormal impact on our tax rate in the first quarter.","That said, we still believe a 27% to 28% effective tax rate for the full-year is what you should use. So there was nothing, other than not getting the benefit of some of the losses in the first quarter that caused that tax rate to be so high.","Jason Bazinet","Oh, no, I'm not focused at all on the first quarter. I was just - if I sort of reverse engineer it, and we obviously don't have the profitability by region. But if 60% is U.S. and you use a low 20s tax rate, then you have to sort of get something in the high 30s for the rest. And so I'm just more worried about if the 2019 to 2021 - go ahead.","Michael Roth","Yes. We said this in the call in February, actually. So if you looked at our cash tax rate, which is different in our book tax rate, our cash tax rate is more like 23% to 24%. And the reason it's higher than the statutory number is we have earnings, under the new tax law, we're going to be taxed on unrepatriated earnings. So that's built into our cash taxes for the full-year.","And the 28% reflects the lower tax rate on our earnings for the full-year in the U.S. So that's why you should use 28% for a book tax rate, we're comfortable in that number, and 23% to 24% on a cash tax basis in the U.S. And I might add, overall, the effect of the new tax law should benefit us net-net in the range of $50 million for the full-year.","Frank Mergenthaler","And Jason, that projected rate is bottoms-up built by market and projected profitability, and it also includes state taxes in the U.S. So it's not a top-down number, it's bottoms-up, and that's the best thinking we have now.","Jason Bazinet","Okay, very good. Thank you.","Frank Mergenthaler","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question will come from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Daniel Salmon","Good morning, everyone. Michael, you're always making changes to the portfolio and evolving it and trying to optimize it. But last year, it felt like a particularly busy one with, especially some divestitures, some notable management changes. What do you think are the most important elements of that for investors to understand?","Sometimes, we'll have conversations where people take it as a sign of weakness. Instead, it seems like you're improving your portfolio. And so I just want to touch on that issue a little bit more. And then as a follow on to it, where - are you happy with the traction of the changes that you've made and how you see that playing out this year? Thanks.","Michael Roth","Yes, I know it's a fair question. You like to see stability. And look, we have over 90 units to 100 units within IPG. So if we're not making changes, something's wrong, okay, because somewhere in the world is something not going right or could be done better. So we're constantly looking. And whenever we make a change, we obviously look to make it positive and an opportunity to reposition either the portfolio company and management to make sure that it's consistent with the standards and the go-to-market strategies that we have.","And the changes that we made this year were in that context. Either there was - unfortunately in one case, we had a difficult fact pattern, in particular at The Martin Agency, which we had to deal with very quickly. And I'm actually delighted with the changes that we put in, in The Martin Agency. They're back on track.","As I indicated, we won some new business. And Kristen has been very well-received at The Martin Agency, and we're pretty excited about what we're going to see there. The changes we made at Huge were also very positive and very well-received. I'm very happy with the results of that. In fact, Huge was one of our top performers in the first quarter.","As far as the businesses that we are removing, every year, we look at underperforming businesses that don't make sense. In the old days, we had to be in every market with every agency. That's not the way to operate efficiently. And candidly, our clients don't operate that way, so why should we?","So every year, we take a look at all of these underperforming assets. When we do quarterly business reviews, we go by regions, and we see which regions are making money and which aren't. And if they're not delivering and they're dilutive, we have to have a good business reason why those businesses are operating the way they are.","And what we came to after our business reviews that these particular businesses were underperforming, and they were not strategic to our portfolio. And if we weren't doing that, you would think we weren't paying attention to our objectives and our operating our business. That's what the holding company does, right, it allocates capital and resources.","So I'm very comfortable with the changes we made. I'm more comfortable, in particular with the additions that we've made in terms of talent and capabilities in the fastest growing parts of our business. And you should continue to see us do that because that's indicative of us recognizing that this market is changing, and we have to be and have the talent to be able to meet those challenges.","Daniel Salmon","Okay, thank you.","Michael Roth","You're welcome.","Frank Mergenthaler","You're welcome.","Operator","This concludes our call. Any final thoughts?","Michael Roth","Well, thank you all very much. Obviously, we're excited about the first quarter, but we got a lot of the years to come, so we look forward to our next call.","Operator","This concludes our call. All participants may disconnect.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jerome Leshne","Good morning. Thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website interpublic.com. This morning, we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 AM Eastern.","During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company. These are subject to the uncertainties in the cautionary statements that are included in our earnings release and the slide presentation and further detailed in our 10-K and other filings with the SEC.","We will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP measures, allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance.","At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Jerry. Thank you for joining us this morning as we review our results for the quarter. I'll start out by covering the highlights of our performance; Frank will then provide additional details; and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies, to be followed by our Q&A.","We\u2019re pleased to report another quarter with very strong performance. Organic revenue growth was 6.7% notably that comes on top of 5.7% a year ago. Our growth was driven by increases in all major disciplines, geographic regions and across most client sectors. This strong growth is consistent with our performance in recent years and a sign of the strength of our offerings across the portfolio. It\u2019s encouraging to see a start to year at a top of the competitive table in terms of growth.","Acquisitions headed another 30 basis points to growth in the quarter, while currency translation was a 3.1% drag on revenue. Reported revenue growth was therefore 3.9%.","Q1 operating profit was $21 million compared with $8 million last year. As you all know, our first quarter is seasonably small in terms of revenue, while total costs are distributed fairly evenly throughout the year. That said positive and sustain Q1 profit increases are yet another market with continued strength and progress.","During the quarter, we continue to combine our growth will effective expense discipline. We achieved leverage on our expenses for base payroll, benefits and tax and our office and general expenses. The result was Q1 operating margin expansion of 70 basis points.","Our growth this quarter continues to reflect contributions from nearly all of our major agencies led my McCann, R\/GA, Huge, FCB, Mediabrands and Weber Shandwick. Our digital offerings continued their strong growth. This includes the range of embedded digital capabilities within our integrated agency networks as well as our standalone digital specialists.","Once again, this result underscores that our partnerships with clients are evolving as they look to transform their businesses in response to increasingly complex marketing landscape. Another contributor to our performance is our open architecture model which we use to deliver solutions that are customize to client needs using the best of IPG solutions notwithstanding silos. This reflects the growing importance of integrated communication services something we\u2019ve been focusing on for some time now.","The quarter reflects strong growth with existing clients as well as new business wins. In terms of client sectors, we will led by increases in the tech and telecom, healthcare, food and beverage and retail sectors.","Regionally, performance was notably strong in the U.S. where we had organic growth of 8.3% on top of 6.1% in Q1 of \u201815 and where we continue to see outstanding contributions across a very broad range of our agencies, disciplines and client sectors.","International organic growth was also strong at 4.3%, with all regions contributing. LatAm was especially notable at 11.6% organic growth.","Turing to expenses in margin, total operating expenses increased 3.2% compared with our reported revenue growth of 3.9%. As a result, Q1 operating margin improved by 70 basis points. Cost discipline and margin enhancement remain a top priority and we continue to execute against that objective during the year. Our capital structure continues to be source of value creation.","As we announced in February, for the fourth consecutive year, our board increased our quarterly dividend by at least 25%. On our full year 2015 call, we also announced that our board had authorized another 300 million towards share repurchases.","During the quarter, we purchased 2.5 million shares at a cost of $54 million. More recently, we replaced on review for upgrade by Moody\u2019s and our outlook was upgraded to positive by S&P.","Of course we are pleased that our performance continues to reflect the excellence of our people and agencies. As mentioned earlier, our ability to put together integrated solutions that are customized as needs of our clients has increasingly become a differentiator for us. As is our focus on delivering outstanding insights and creativity and our commitment to maintaining and developing the top tier digital capabilities we have across our portfolios. We also remained focus on driving further margin expansion and capital returns.","The strength of our offerings coupled with operating discipline is a winning combination that we will ensure that we continue to deliver for clients and shareholders alike.","While Q1 is seasonably small for us and there is still macro uncertainty particularly in certain international markets. Performance to date has us well positioned to deliver on high end of the 3% to 4% organic growth target we set for the full year and to expand operating margin by 50 basis points or better. As the year unfolds we will of course keep you price of our outlook as was the case in 2015.","At this stage, I\u2019d like to turn things over to Frank for some additional detail on results. And after his remarks, I\u2019ll be back to provide an update on our agencies and the tone of our business to be followed by our Q&A.","Frank Mergenthaler","Thank you, Michael. Good morning. As a reminder, I\u2019ll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast.","On Slide 2, you\u2019ll see an overview of our results. Organic revenue growth was 6.7% in the first quarter, 8.3% in the U.S. and 4.3% in our international markets. Q1 operating profit was 40 million and are seasonally small first quarter, an increase of 30 million compared to last year.","Adjusted diluted EPS is breakeven, adjusted for items below our operating income and other income in our tax line. Reported diluted EPS is $0.01 per share.","Turning to Slide 3, you\u2019ll see our P&L for the quarter. I\u2019ll cover revenue and operating expenses as well global line items in detail on the slides that follows.","Turning to revenue on Slide 4, revenue was 1.74 billion in the quarter, an increase of 3.9%. Compared to Q1 \u201815, the impact of the change in exchange rates was a negative 3.1%, while net acquisitions headed 30 basis points. The resulting organic revenue increase was 6.7%. As you can see on the bottom half of this slide, organic growth was 7.6% and our integrated agency network segment very strong performance with contributions from all disciplines led by McCann, R\/GA, Huge, FCB and Mediabrands.","CMG grew 3.2% organically led by Weber Shandwick, Octagon and Golin. CMG growth was approximately 4% excluding the decrease in pass-through revenues.","Moving on to Slide 5 revenue by regions, U.S. organic growth of 8.3% was broad based across our agencies led by R\/GA, FCB, McCann and Huge. Leading clients sectors were tech and telecom, healthcare, food and beverage and retail. Turning to international markets, the UK grew 3.5% organically on top of 6.4% a year ago. There are notably strong growth McCann, Mediabrands and R\/GA. Continental Europe increased 1.7% organically. By country, we\u2019re led by strong results in Germany and modest growth in France and Spain.","In Asia-Pac, Q1 organic growth was 2.7%. We\u2019re led by very strong in China as well as by increases in Australia and India, while Japan decreased. In that region, we saw notable contributions by Mediabrands and R\/GA.","LatAm grew 11.6% organically with strong performance driven by our agencies in Argentina, Colombia and Mexico. Brazil however remains soft due to macro headwinds. Our markets group increased 7.4% organically which includes strong growth in Canada.","On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change in a trailing 12-month basis. Most recent data point is 6.3%.","Moving on to Slide 7, our operating expenses, underneath our reported revenue growth of 3.9%, total operating expenses increases 3.2% in the first quarter. Our ratio salaries and related expenses revenue in Q1 was 73% this year compared with 72.5% a year ago. This comparison includes very strong Q1 operating leverage and expense for base payroll benefits and tax. It also reflects increase long-term incentive expense due to our consistently strong financial performance as well as greater expense for severance this year and increase expense for acquisition due to the strong performance acquired businesses.","Lower pass-through revenue also shifted some operating leverage some SRS to O&G, our lower pass-through are offset by lower O&G expense.","Total headcount at quarter end was approximately 49,700 which is increase of 1% from Q4 \u201815 reflecting investment higher growth areas of the portfolio and to support our business wins.","Turning to office and general expense in the lower half of the slide, O&G expense was 25.8% of Q1 revenue, an improvement of 120 basis points from year ago. With leverage across most major expense components, notably our category of other O&G expense which includes the benefits of lower pass-through expense.","On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis with a most recent data point of 1.5%.","Slide 9 is provided for clarity and our year-on-year comparison with detail on below the line items. Our reported pretax results includes the below the line of 16 million mostly noncash related to the sale of small non-strategic agencies mainly in Continental Europe. As a consequence of the classification of certain of these assets is held for sale, we had a net tax benefit of 12 million due to reversal valuation allowances for differed tax assets.","Our tax provision also included 8 million benefits from the adoption of new guidance on share based compensation. The net effect on reported results of the discrete items and a loss on sale of business was a benefit of $0.01 per diluted share in the quarter.","Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 10, we ended the first quarter with $680 million in cash and short term marketable securities. It\u2019s worth noting that our cash level is seasonal and it tends to peak at year end and decrease during the first quarter.","On Slide 11, we turn to cash flow. Cash use in operations in Q1 was 649 million compared with 781 million a year ago. As you know our operating cash flow was highly seasonal. Our business generates significant cash on working capital in the fourth quarter and uses cash in the first quarter. During this year\u2019s first quarter, cash used in working capital is 690 million compared with 785 million a year ago. Investing activities used 59 million in the quarter including 27 million of CapEx and 27 million for acquisitions.","Financial activities used 158 million mainly for common stock dividend of 60 million and 54 million for share repurchases. Our net decrease in cash and marketable securities for the quarter is 829 million compared with 926 million a year ago.","On Slide 12, we showed debt deleveraging from a peak of 2.3 billion in 2007 to 1.74 billion at the most recent quarter end.","In summary on Slide 13, we are pleased with our revenue growth and profit performance in the quarter which represents a good start in terms of achieving our financial objectives for the year.","With that let me turn it back to Michael.","Michael Roth","Thanks Frank. Understandably we\u2019re very pleased with the results that we\u2019re announcing this morning. The effectiveness of our offerings was evident in our continued strong organic revenue growth across the group whether in advertising, marketing services or media, our strategic creative and digital capabilities are higher competitive.","It\u2019s particularly important in most of our agencies are contributing to our strong results. And that we\u2019re seeing growth in all geographic regions. We continue to demonstrate discipline cost management and we\u2019ll remain focused on conversion, so as to deliver or exceed on our margin improvement target for year. As you saw often heard me saying, we\u2019re proud that IPG is becoming known as a destination of choice the so much of the industry\u2019s top challenge. Our senior corporate team has been together for some time. All of our talented people have brought the company through significant challenges to its current very strong and competitive position. And we\u2019ve done so with the high degree of integrity and humanity.","Along with our focus on getting the best people with the right skills required to succeed in the digital world, we also have shown a long term commitment to improvement as it relates to diversity and inclusion. We were the first company in our sector to name Chief Diversity Officer to establish diversity leaders across our major agencies within the group and interagency D&I business resource group and to directly tie annual incentive compensation for our major agency CEOs and senior executives to progress on diversity and inclusion. Driven by these programs, we\u2019ve seen significant improvements overtime for all minorities with close to 55% of our management positions currently held by women and approximately 20% by people who cover which we believe our industry leading results.","Nonetheless, we know there is still a great deal of work to do in this area. And uniquely we stand by our record of taking swift and the size of action and enforcing accountability around D&I. Particularly in those cases of behavior, my senior executives that run counter the kinds of values for which we should all stand.","For some time now, our investment and talent has been a key driver of IPGs success. On these supplement that which strategic acquisitions this shouldn\u2019t sure that we maintain the very high level of expertise and service delivery that we are seeing from so many of our agencies. We also remain committed to robust capital return programs and we can continue to drive value creation for our shareholders."," Moving on to the tone of our business, we continue to hear from major clients a willingness to invest behind their brands. Our operators will also tell us that the environment for marketers remain sound overall, despite uncertainty in certain important markets such as Brazil and Russia. So there should clearly be sufficient opportunity for us to achieve toward the high end of restated full year growth objectives. But it\u2019s still early, they do need a smallest quarter in the books, so we believe it\u2019s appropriate to stay focused on our goals and measured in terms of expectations. The business pipeline that sound that continues to be a significant number of media pictures and consolidations; they are not quite at the same historically high level of last year.","Elsewhere in the group, our major integrated agencies are seeing solid activity as our marketing service agencies. We are active in all of the major opportunities that are out there other than those on which we are conflicted.","New business has been an area of strength for us in the past two years and in area in which the collaboration has played a key role. We want to build on that performance.","Highlights at the agency level include a strong quarter at McCann, which is winning business and recognition across a range of its companies and around the world. The focus on the part of the management team on creativity, cross utilization of services to major clients and enhancing the specialist digital experiential and healthcare marketing offerings is contributing to strong growth at the Worldgroup.","CMG agencies continued to its strong performance led by public relations. Weber Shandwick and Golin consistently take market share and we added to their capabilities with acquisitions during Q1, provide health, we build on Weber\u2019s outstanding healthcare practice and Brooklyn Brothers will take go individual content production to a new level creativity. Late last week, we announced the acquisition of Spec [ph] to head a leading product design and innovation consultancy to the front head of future brands offerings. At Mediabrands, we have been active on on-boarding much of the new business won during last year is very competitive consolidation and pitch activity.","The New Year began with positive news for UM in the Sony review. As you\u2019ve heard before, the organic investments we\u2019ve made in digital, programmatic and data are playing a key role on Mediabrands success and growth.","During the quarter, we added to their capabilities with a mobile acquisition in the UK and will continue to focus on mobile, social performance marketing and analytics going forward. At FCB, progress continued to be evident in the agency\u2019s results. In Chicago, the agency further built on its [indiscernible], while FCB Inferno won additional BMW business in Europe. And earlier this week prevailed in a highly competitive UK pitch for empower.","FCB Health is a consistently strong contributor and a new management team has been put in place in New York, well a dynamic new leader joined as North American President of the HackerAgency an outstanding CRM agency that\u2019s part of the FCB Group.","MullenLowe Group is increasingly active in new businesses with wins from hired hotels, airways and a number of other opportunities they are public but in which they are among of the finalist in significant reviews. The agency accounted a new leader for its Boston office, who joins us after a long and successful stead at CMO at Congress. MullenLowe is also named the world\u2019s best creative agency at the WARC 100 Awards and top to report for 2015 as campaigns with social responsibility. R\/GA, Huge and MRM posted very strong start to the year. In terms of the highly innovative work they are doing for clients, their financial performance and the recognition they are garnering in the market place is significant.","R\/GA has been pioneering what it means to be a digital marketer since the beginning of the connected age. The company continues to honored as one of the industry\u2019s top agencies. Growth at Huge has been significant and the agency recently names its first Chief Creative Officer.","MRM remains one of the industry\u2019s top global networks powering the digital business for many of the world\u2019s largest brand.","As you know, we\u2019ve been clear for many years that the changing dynamics of media usage and behavior for an integrated strategy when it comes to digital, not to the highly silo approach taken by some of our peers. The benefits of investing and talent and embedding digital expertise throughout our portfolio as we\u2019ve been doing for some time continues to be evident in IPG\u2019s strong organic revenue performance. Of course being able to combine these embedded digital offerings with our specialty agencies is every more powerful. And just another example, how we mix and match the right capabilities and talent on all of our client engagements.","We\u2019re pleased with the strong performance in Q1 with a very high caliber of our people and with the effectiveness of our capabilities. To continue to see some geographic markets where macro concerns will require monitoring. It\u2019s also worth repeating that Q1 is always our lightest quarter. We will of course remain vigilant on cost in an appropriate level of margin convergent.","Looking forward, we believe that we are well positioned to deliver on a high end of our full year target of organic growth of 3% to 4% and to expand operating margin by 50 basis points of better.","Combined with our company\u2019s financial strength and commitment to capital return, which has been and will continue to be a source of significant value creation will allow us to further enhance shareholder value.","And as always I thank you for your time and support and I look forward to keeping you posted on our progress during the course of the year.","With that I will now open it up to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.","Alexia Quadrani","I am impressed of organic revenue growth we saw on the quarter specifically North America. Is there any way you can sort of give us a bit more color in terms of how much of that growth came from sort of the underlying health of the market versus your real strong position in new business wins at the end of last year?","Michael Roth","Thank you, Alexia. Well as you know, you are right in saying last year, we ended net positive with respect to the many of reviews. I think a significant part of our results is an indication that of our top 20 clients, our organic growth was close to 12%. Now that\u2019s a significant number and it\u2019s something that reflects what we\u2019ve been saying now for many years. If we continue to focus on treating our existing clients was a pitch, this opportunity that meet in the market place given the talent and resources that we have and that will be continued focus on all of our organizations to treat our existing clients with that type of opportunity and commitment to meeting their needs.","And if you add on top of that net new business wins from pitches obviously that gives right for our results. Now coming into the year, obviously we had some tailwinds as a result of the net new business. We see that rolling out more on the first half of the year, so let\u2019s assume this about a 150 basis points of tailwinds coming into the first half of the year and in the back of the year that will slow down. So a combination of focusing on our existing clients and keeping the backdoor close, winning when we are involved in pitches and focusing on our work open architecture is what makes us comfortable with our forecast going in through the year.","Alexia Quadrani","And just based on your earlier commentary, it sounds like more of you agencies are contributing to growth and maybe just several years ago, can you find that there are - there is still some with our agencies or regions that are still kind of a work in progress that can still you know be a tailwind are positive contributor down the road or do you see that your - finally you know at a price now we\u2019re really you are kind of operating and also in there?","Michael Roth","Well, you know I\u2019ll let our results speak for the question of how all our agencies are performing. And obviously with these kinds of results we\u2019re not relying on one particular agency. And as you know well we\u2019re there with - from the beginning, this has been a journey in terms ore repositioning our people and our organizations. And I said this publically and privately, I\u2019d never been more comfortable with a leadership of our organizations throughout all of our agencies and I am right now.","Our most recent repositioning involve putting Mullen and low together to form the MullenLowe Group and I am very pleased with how that\u2019s come out of the box in terms of new business wins and servicing at our existing clients. So when you combine three global networks of MullenLowe, McCann and FCB, on top of all the independent agencies we have in the U.S. you know some of them are not performing where we would like them to be and of course MullenLowe has a ways to go before they are achieving levels of McCann or SCV and frankly that\u2019s the opportunity we have at IPG are media offerings to best in class, they are recognize obviously UM in terms of its agencies, the year awards and its positive results of new business.","Weber Shandwick and Golin being the top of the charts in terms of winning and gaining market share and certainly Weber winning all the recognition awards, our sports marketing and our experiential, so I am very pleased with all of our offerings that doesn\u2019t need to say we can\u2019t refine that in terms of adding additional talent and go to market strategies and acquisitions. And given our financial position, we are in a position to do that.","So I am feeling - where we told the team is - you know we are fighting any football, you know this is still a journey, we still have margin improvement that\u2019s available to us and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focusing on, but in the meantime, I have no doubt that if there is an opportunity for us to pitch business, we will put together a world-class opportunity in team in place and we will continue to focus on our existing client base, which is among the best in the world. So other than that I am pretty - I am feeling pretty comfortable about where we stand.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you very much.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Alexia.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne","Thank you. Good morning. I have a - I wanted to ask actually about tax, the tax outlook and also something on headcount, anyway Michael you like to talk about taxes as much as possible. You know if you look at companies with your revenue mix, you know lot of international, you tend to see tax rates sort of in the low 30s, I know you guys are driving margins and trying to drive profitability particularly in your European agencies. I guess if you could just think about the long term, do you an opportunity for IPG to get its blended tax rate down because that would be a pretty meaningful EPS driver if that opportunity was there for you in sort of the investable future?","I\u2019ll just ask my second one, your incentive comp as a percent of revenue, I think was the highest it\u2019s been in a number of years, and I am guessing that reflects your confidents in the year. I don\u2019t maybe you can spend just a minute on how you guys accrue during the year Q1 as you said it\u2019s small but it seems to be an indication of where you see the year coming in versus what your internal budgets might have been? So those are my two questions.","Michael Roth","Yeah, I know both are fair questions. On the incentive comp, it\u2019s a little over 4% in the first quarter and really what that is, is a long term incentive plan. Given the performance that we had in the last couple of years, and since our long term performance is based on performance operations, it\u2019s encouraging to see that that number is higher because it\u2019s reflective over positive results. Over the year, we still using a 3.5% number in terms of total incentive comp. So it does hit us a little stronger in the first quarter.","And then of course when you compared it to light revenue in the first quarter, it magnifies the percentage of its impact. So this is a little part of a plan, this was in the surplice. We know well that we are performing well in our incentive plans. Frankly our incentive plans are working exactly as they should be. We have short term plan that focus on both agencies as well as overall performance and long term incentives that look to what we need to drive continue consistent performance across the organization.","So I think just look at that as a sort of one off in the first quarter, which is actually positive result given the performance that we\u2019ve had.","Tax is a whole complicated situation. As you know we have a billion dollar greater NOL and that\u2019s principally in Europe. In order for us to use that NOL, we have to generate income in those geographic areas. And we focus very - we have a great international tax department that focuses on optimizing utilization of the NOL which gets into of course agreements between countries in terms of allocations and so on and we try to optimize it. But when we do write-offs in foreign jurisdictions, unless there is income then we use those write-offs as against we don\u2019t the benefit that we were looking for, we do release some results which we saw the reversals in the first quarter. So we have a 28% to 30% cash tax rate which were using which frankly is attractive versus our financial tax rate which is 37% to 39% or 40%.","So we still have a difference between cash versus book. We\u2019re very focused on utilization in the cash NOL. In the U.S, we used up our cash NOL, so what we rely on in the U.S. in U.S. tax planning. We have a great tax department that focuses on that.","So I do think that that NOL is not accounted for asset on our balance sheet but we can\u2019t benefit until we generate profitability and since Continental Europe as you know we did have positive results in Continental Europe this quarter which is as the second - at least second or third quarter in a row that we\u2019ve positive not by a lot but at losses we\u2019ve been having. So that\u2019s encouraging, but I do think there are opportunities but we\u2019re not prepared to commit through a significantly lower cash tax as a result of it.","Benjamin Swinburne","Thank you.","Michael Roth","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Stabler","Frank, I wanted to turn back to Slide 22 in the salaries and related. And Frank, I am wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the base benefits and tax, we\u2019re bit surprised at the amount of leverage you got there, any color you can offer on the drivers and outlook going forward?","And then on the severance expense line, also bit richer than we thought, we are assuming you can see some flow through that towards the back half of the year?","And then couple of other quick ones. Could you remind us where - I think you covered this but could you remind us what\u2019s remaining on the buyback also? Thanks very much.","Frank Mergenthaler","On the buyback, it\u2019s roughly 400. And couple of comments on expenses here, it\u2019s clear as we continued it to reduce our principal relationship in our project related businesses and we see our pass-through revenues go down. You\u2019ve seen a shifting of leverage at BB&T and LNG. But I think that the transparence discloser it\u2019s pretty clear what\u2019s happening. But I would say about our SRS is that the base benefit tax which is our - roughly our fixed component of our salary which we service clients with that\u2019s our biggest areas as focus and we\u2019re thrilled to see the amount of leverage we get out of it. And it\u2019s narrow that we\u2019ve been focused on for years and we\u2019ll continue to focus on. How do you talk that fixed component of our employee based plus quite frankly our temporary labor with surface clients and get more leverage out of it, we are seeing it.","With respect to the other components of SRS, Michael just commented on the incentive component. And to your other question, we didn\u2019t adjust our annual incentive accrual at all in the first quarter. So we booked at a budge, so all of that increase is related to the long term.","And on the severance, we had some incremental severance in Europe and we had some severance at a specific agency and you are right, we should get some flow through in the back half of the year.","Peter Stabler","And then I quick follow-on if I could, so on the BB&T -","Frank Mergenthaler","See one moment; we did had some acquisition charges that ended up being reflected in the SRS as well. You know when we had this in the fourth quarter, on certain acquisition if they are performing well, we have to true up the payments and flow through SRS. So that also was a discrete item in the first quarter.","Michael Roth","And again similar to the long term accrual that\u2019s a good think, that means that the acquisitions we\u2019ve done are performing better than what we modeled out when we acquired them. But the great accounting works that flows through operations.","Peter Stabler","Great, one quick follow-up, so on the BB&T because that\u2019s a relatively fixed piece of the equation frank, is there a target you have for full year, either this year or next year and where that line could go?","Michael Roth","We have a target of 50 basis points or better of margin improvement.","Peter Stabler","Thank you.","Michael Roth","Welcome.","Peter Stabler","Happy weekend.","Michael Roth","Yeah, too you.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets.","Dan Salmon","Hi, good morning, everyone. One for Michael and one for Frank. Michael, could you turn back, you had some good comments there about the integration of MullenLowe and I just want to follow-up on that a little bit and maybe if there are some sort of forward milestone that you are looking forward from the agency or maybe is the based terminology and maybe what and then we may be and then sort of the plan you have for it?","And then second for Frank, your review on Moody\u2019s upgrades at S&P, could you just give us an update on the conversations with the rating agencies right now and where your expectations for those maybe?","Michael Roth","Yeah, well look, we\u2019ve at the moment at MullenLowe, but we\u2019ve been repositioning Mullen now. And look Mullen just again this morning won number of awards in the international markets for its creativity and its effectiveness with its clients and it\u2019s always been an issue for us to give in a deeper presence in the United States, so that\u2019s where we think the opportunity lies in terms of utilizing the long network and putting it together with Mullen and in a true merger, this wasn\u2019t a partnership, this is merger and we have Alex heading up the global offering. So we see a tremendous opportunity in utilizing the MullenLowe go to market strategy on a global basis with particular emphasis in the United States and we\u2019re very encouraged in way it\u2019s being received by the consultancy in terms of pitch activity as well as its performance both with existing Mullen clients as well as the formal Lowe clients. And the team is really matched together, they understand it\u2019s a unified organization now and it\u2019s not siloed into Mullen or Lowe and I am very pleased with Alex and his entire team, he headed new people.","So we\u2019re pretty excited about the opportunity. And MullenLowe both have this reputation of creativity and being disrupters if you will in terms of their approach to client servicing and it\u2019s a tremendous combination plus give the digital media capabilities and Lowe has a prefer which is an outstanding digital arm of Lowe that\u2019s performing exceptionally well. So we\u2019re excited about MullenLowe. And as we are with all of our networks, the leadership we have whether Harris at McCann or Carter at FCB and Henry at Mediabrands, I mean that you know - I am not working on my Gulf team yet but I am very pleased with the leadership team that we have in place.","And on rating agency front, both Moody\u2019s and S&P have a positive outlook. We\u2019re in constant dialog, we would hope to get an upgrade from both those institutions at some point, we\u2019re not in position to pinpoint a time but we continue to deliver results like that, we would hope to see those upgrades in the near future.","Dan Salmon","Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Michael Roth","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Tim Nollen from Macquarie.","Tim Nollen","Hi, thanks. Few things, Michael, could you please elaborate a bit more in your comment on the state of the markets, it seemed just you know last quarter it was kind of nervous times and financial markets were volatile and there were a lot of macro issues. And you express some caution at the time and now your comment seem to be that clients are spending steadily and financial markets have picked up and early stage it picked up. And I just wonder what your - if you give bit more color on the state of clients spending, client thinking in terms of investing and marketing, we\u2019ve also seen some pretty good results, their comments this reporting season from the likes of retailers and credit card issuers and so on. So it seems like it feels even better now.","And then just a quick housekeeping I guess, is there anything we need to know in terms of one off below the line that I mean that\u2019s small items but they brought your peers down by a penny in Q1, so anything you know ongoing you know the pass the rate and how should we now about in the coming quarters? Thanks.","Michael Roth","You know I - the one offs items, I think that\u2019s a fair point, inclusively looking - if you are looking at the quality of our earnings in the first quarter, if you take off the one off - take out the one off items, obviously the quality of our earnings is very solid and EPS number is not really reflected of the type of performance we had in the first quarter.","You know you always have risk in the quarter basis going forward, but I don\u2019t believe we have any significant items that we already know about that will hit in that way. The good news is we had the acquisition adjustment in terms of the performance. But the way if we have it going through the rest of the year, that means our acquisitions are even performing better than we thought, so that won\u2019t be a bad thing.","So I think hopefully we won\u2019t have the noise if you will on below the line going forward for the rest of the year.","You know my tone and my language is still its cautionary because there is still a lot of stuff going out there. And - but I did say at the end of the year when we talked about the caution that we didn\u2019t see any specific areas of caution but there were a lot of noise. If you look at Latin America, it\u2019s a great example, obviously Brazil is an issue. And frankly if you look at our organic growth in Latin America was over a 11% that\u2019s not withstanding the factor Brazil was breakeven and there in Latin America we had very strong results from our digital whether it be R\/GA, whether it\u2019s be Huge, whether it be our media offerings and McCann in Latin America. So we had very positive results not withstanding in a fact that Brazil which is a large market for us has significant risk in terms of what\u2019s going on there, obviously the government transitions there are an issue. So that causes us to be some concerns in terms of what\u2019s happening there.","In terms of the good news on the U.S. side is we are now 63% of our business being in the U.S. versus the end of the year we\u2019re at 60%. That should be an indication of the strength of our offerings in the United States across the board, PR, media, advertising, digital, experiential and sports marketing, all of them in the United States are performing well which is one of the reason you see a 63% number and we don\u2019t need if you look at the forecast through for U.S. media and media overall, we\u2019re still in the 3% to 4% ad spend in the U.S. and globally which is another reason why we\u2019re somewhat cautious in terms of what the organic number we\u2019re putting out there.","Asia-Pac continues, China, India, Australia are overall perform. China, we had double digit growth. So we have very solid offerings, India was single digital growth but last year we had very strong comps there, we had to go against. Australia continues to perform. Japan was slightly week. So that causes us, you know it\u2019s a lot of noise going on about China but our results don\u2019t yet reflect there. So we have to be cautious about that. And then you go to Europe and the UK results were slightly offered where we\u2019re before and that is attributable to one some of our onetime items were not as strong as they were particularly in the UK. Continental Europe again is not significant to us, it\u2019s about 8% and so one or two items can affect that and we\u2019re still cautious about Continental Europe. And what\u2019s going to happen with that and we don\u2019t know, so it has to be some levels of caution, but you have to look at our results, say well, wait a minute, obviously our clients are spending and we continue to see that. So that\u2019s the reason we still have some caution out there. And like I said we are not spiking any football but we are just managing our existing clients. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to manage our existing client basis. And that\u2019s our strategy as we go forward.","Tim Nollen","Thanks and Frank, could you please elaborate a little bit more on the cost side, I am interested more on the O&G expense, I now you\u2019ve done a lot of work over the years with shares services in ERP programs and IT consolidation et cetera. And those numbers took another step down in a good way this time. How much more is there to squeeze out or is more of a cost saving still on the salary side?","Frank Mergenthaler","You know Tim, it\u2019s a good question because we have made investments. We have seen progress. We continue to find floor but you are starting to see some pressure in things like real estate. Certain markets around the world are starting to get fairly expensive. We\u2019ve had growth in those markets, so we\u2019ve got some pressure there in markets like New York and London and Shanghai, but we continue try and leverage the investments we\u2019ve made to drive more efficiency. And share services are good example. You know we won\u2019t more and more processing into our shared services center, we are looking at various end market consolidations in countries. So there is more to do, we never touched, Michael covered about spiking football, we\u2019re going to continue to press but I am not sure if there is that much more runway, but we are going to continue try. So I think at salaries and leveraging salaries is critical to us. That\u2019s why we are pleased to see the progress in the BB&T leverage.","Michael Roth","You know and otherwise to look at it, if you look at our marketing services, we\u2019re not at 50-50 and some of you may remember years ago that was one of our objectives to get at a 50-50. And why I was throwing out in our leadership, I have to throughout Andy Polansky at Weber, Coca-Cola, these are tremendous professionals that are just gaining market share in a space that is highly competitive, so I didn\u2019t want to make slides of factors besides Frank is sitting next to me of our CMG business who are performing well.","Tim Nollen","Thanks very much.","Michael Roth","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisory Group.","Tom Eagan","Great, thank you. Last year you made investment in Samba TV, with all the changes we are seeing in analytics and measurement, could you remind us what the strategic rationale behind that investment was? And what role Samba TV could play in the larger ecosystem? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Frank Mergenthaler","You know one of the great challenges in our industry is measurement and using data resource in terms of allocating our client\u2019s money in this complex and varied opportunities to gain insights in the market place. One of the questions is whether a TV even can be included in a real time basis in our programmatic offering and insights in linear TV. And what we like to do is make investments in smaller companies that has some unique capabilities and Samba TV is one of those and our relationship with them in terms of adding that type of insight to our overall data stack is a very important aspect. We have many others as well and we have 100 of different data resources that we use in our analytics and Samba TV was just a unique proposition particularly on the TV side that we felt added some additional credibility and insights for us. And we continue to look at these types of tech and data insight companies to help us provide value to our clients.","Tom Eagan","Great, and then Michael, last quarter call you mentioned that the project business was particularly strong in 2015, but that was unclear that was going to be repeated this year, now that we\u2019re on April, what are you seeing?","Michael Roth","Well first of all, our project business is very solid. The comment actually related to our digital business in addition to our PR business which is obviously doing well and that has a tendency to be more project base as it experiential on sports. What\u2019s happening on the digital side of the business, our goal is obviously have agency record in. What\u2019s encouraging is we do have longer standing relationships with our special digital agencies that\u2019s somewhat different than it used to be in the business which is very encouraging, but still a significant portion of our digital practice is more or less on a project basis. And now I think the definition of product basis is chancing a little bit on the digital side.","We have relationship with clients and there spend is vary based on projects within it. We still have the clients. And so for example, we are seeing return of some clients that we had relationships with that may have that spent is much money last year but we are starting to see the spend come back this year. So I characterize that is sort of project business. And I think we have to deal with that more in the environment today, because digital is such a significant part of both our growth and the offerings we have with our clients. So as long as we deliver the best in class offerings and we have the talents and the people, look we\u2019ve been with a PR business that is more than 50% somewhat on a project basis and we continue to perform. So doesn\u2019t scare us, I think it\u2019s an opportunity but it is a characterization of that business that you have to be sensitive to.","Tom Eagan","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have James Dix from Wedbush Securities.","James Dix","Good morning, gentlemen. I had two questions, first Michael I thought your point you made about the organic growth of 12% for your top 20 clients was quite interesting because I am going to guess that there are ad spending growth organically was not up that much and they are probably their own revenues were not up that much. I don\u2019t have the numbers, I am not sure whether you do, but if that is right, I mean what do you think would be driving their increasing spending with you as a service provider relative to the sizes of their business because I think it might reflect somewhat on the place of the agency in the value chain over the longer term as well as obviously some great near term strength?","And then my follow-up was just, any major pitches that you would call out in the market right now either opportunities or any potential defenses which you would just have us focus on? Thanks.","Michael Roth","Yeah, well, look obviously our clients based are large multinational clients that have significant advertising dollars and marketing dollars. And our goal is always be to give them the best offerings we have and not just one discipline. The health of a client relationship is that we\u2019re bringing multiple services to the table and that\u2019s truly what the integrated offering is all about. And what\u2019s encouraging is that when you look at our top 20 clients, we have multiple disciplines servicing those clients and that\u2019s what gives rise to that type of organic growth.","So you can take a bigger share of wallet from a particular client even though there spend may not be going up. If you are bringing in PR, if you are brining experiential, if you are bringing in media, so that represents the strength of opportunities with our existing client. So - and that\u2019s why I am so pleased with those type of results. And it is so important therefore to keep the backdoor close in terms of servicing clients and that\u2019s what this business is about. We have to add value to our clients and it\u2019s not just one off in terms of that.","We have relationship with our clients that have lasted 50 years and of course those relationships go up and down like everything else. And we have to make sure that we are bringing the best ideas and talent to the table and that\u2019s what our management teams have been doing so well and that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing the results that we\u2019re seeing. And that goes well for frankly not just us but our industry. You know everyone things that we\u2019re being disintermediated with all those ad techs and other services that are out there, but if with properly servicing our clients and bringing in all the talent and insights that we can bring, we are not going to get disintermediated, in fact we see is an opportunity. So I think so far our results have reflective event.","On the pitch side, there are pretty consistent to what we said before, the army which is McCann, they have a statutory of review that we\u2019ve actually extended. The last time we defended army was in I believe 2011 and it\u2019s been extended through 2017. So great work both on the media side as well as the PR side and the advertising side and obviously we continue to group to great work over that client and since this is a normal review, we are not taking it lightly, but we believe we have a good change of they are continuing.","On the media side, BMW is I think the one pitch that sill remaining that commenced last year and it\u2019s running into 2016 on the media side. And UM has serviced the account. We won actually someone walks in the meantime in some foreign locations, so we are encouraged to see that. So again that one is still out there. CR from MullenLowe is a review that is driven by procurement, so there too it\u2019s a mandatory procurement review, it\u2019s not that we are having trouble with the client, it is putting us a risk, it\u2019s a review, but every time there is a review there is risk. So those are the only big three that I believe are out there you know of note. There are number of media reviews out there that are review was upside, that\u2019s means we are not defending but we are participating in that and it\u2019s public so I can mention it, that\u2019s the 21st Century Fox and Volkswagen, those - we have they are participating in those reviews and we hope to see some positive outcome from that. But again it\u2019s all upside. And I think those are the major ones that I\u2019ll call out right now.","James Dix","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. We have Brian Wieser from Pivotal Research.","Brian Wieser","Thanks for taking the question. Hi, good morning. I am sure you all read the article in Champaign a few weeks about regulations and how that might impact the industry. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about that if it plays out, how you would manage the cost that might be incurred associated with it. And more broadly I am curious to hear your thoughts about the potential for more off showing of not just in middle office, but - or the back office but front office operations as well, as we see the industry evolving and business process outsourcing taking a bigger role in what agencies do. I am just curious to hear your kind of long term thoughts on that topic?","Michael Roth","Yeah, first of all as far as the overtime, obviously we looked at it. We don\u2019t see it, first of all, it won\u2019t in fact impact, if it does until next year, we have some impact in \u201815. We did do an analysis of it. We don\u2019t see a material impact to our business as a result of it given obviously some of the temporary labor and some of our employment practices are effected by, but it\u2019s not a material number given where we are right now.","Outsourcing is you have to define outsourcing. We have a number of our agencies that use foreign sites in the low cost environment to do 24\/7 production facilities. And frankly they are doing a tremendous job, we have lower cost excellent talent, very strong results 24\/7 and it would be wrong for us not to take advantage of locating those type of facilities in those type of countries. It\u2019s not outsourcing in that, it\u2019s our people that are doing it. So it\u2019s not that we are using third parties to do but we are locating our people in those geographic regions particularly in Latin America, we are seeing very good results with it. As far as outsourcing the non-production type people, we like New York.","Brian Wieser","Yeah, let me - I just to clarify I mean marketers looking at marketing something that they outsource more and the idea that agencies that role, so that\u2019s -","Michael Roth","What we do is, we - our markets because we are using integrated approach, we use resources from all over the world. So whether FCB calls it a creative rumble or McCann has a creative counsel or any of our agencies, the way we approach a creative responsibilities now, you need to have diverse input and we use all of our locations all over the world to do that and that\u2019s the value of having global footprints, but we don\u2019t see us in particular outsourcing big pools other than the production stuff and gain I don\u2019t view that as outsourcing.","Brian Wieser","Okay, thank you very much.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Brain. Operator?","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect at this time.","Michael Roth","Okay, well thank you all for participating. I look forward to our next quarter and the first half year result. Thank you.",""],"11825":["The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.

All parties are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jerry Leshne","Good morning. Thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com. This morning, we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 Eastern.","During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our Company. These are subject to the uncertainties and the cautionary statement that is included in our earnings release and the slide presentation and further detailed in our 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP measures, allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance.","At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Jerry, and thank you for joining us this morning as we review our results for the quarter. I\u2019ll start by covering highlights of our performance, Frank will then provide additional details, and I\u2019ll conclude with an update on our agencies to be followed by the Q&A.","We\u2019re pleased to report solid first quarter revenue growth which comes on top of outstanding performance a year ago. Organic revenue growth was 2.7% in Q1, against 6.7% a year ago, our steepest quarterly comp. In the US, organic growth was 2.9%, up against industry leading 8.3% growth in 2016. Faced by another strong result in Continental Europe, international markets grew 2.2% in pass-through.","As has been the case in recent years, our growth was broad-based by discipline as well. In Q1, we were led by media, our digital specialist, public relations, advertising and sports market. This continues to underscore the strength of our offerings across the portfolio and is an encouraging start to the New Year.","FX was negative to our reported revenue by 1% in the quarter due to the continuing strength of US dollar and had a similar impact on our operating expenses. Net business dispositions of several small non-strategic units drag on revenue by 1% as well, as we had said would be the case on our February conference call.","Operating profit in Q1 was $30 million, compared with $23 million last year, which reflects both our growth and the effectiveness of our ongoing discipline around expenses. As you know, our first quarter is seasonally small in terms of revenues while total costs are distributed fairly throughout the year. That said Q1, operating profit growth of 29% and operating margin growth of 40 basis points, which leverage both of our principal expense lines are indicative of solid progress towards our full year financial target.","Returning to the top-line, our growth continues to reflect contribution from a range of our major agencies, led in Q1 by Mediabrands, McCann, R\/GA, Hill Holliday, Octagon and Golin. Our digital offerings continued their solid growth. This includes a broad range of embedded digital capabilities within our agency networks, as well as a standalone digital specialist. In terms of client sectors, we were led by increases in the healthcare and retail sectors, as well as by strong growth with diversified industrial and government clients. The quarter also reflects growth with existing clients as well as net new business wins over the trailing 12 months.","Our capital structure continues to be a source of value creation. As we announced in the February, this is the fifth consecutive year that our Board has increased our quarterly dividend by at least 20%. On a full year 2016 call, we announced that our Board had authorized another $300 million of share repurchases. During Q1, we repurchased 2.3 million shares using $55 million, which is consistent with Q1 of 2016. As you know, our share repurchase activity tends to track to the seasonality of our cash flows over the course of the year. Over the trailing 12 months, we utilized $305 million for the repurchase of 13 million. ","Since initiating our dividend and repurchases in 2011, we\u2019ve returned a total of $3.2 billion to shareholders, which has driven a 28% reduction to our diluted share count with an average repurchase cost of $14.32. We\u2019ve also tripled our per share dividend over this period of time.","Just last week S&P announced that it upgraded our debt credit ratings to BBB. This brings us to solid investment grade standing across all major credit rating agencies, which represents another important marker of progress at IPG. By fulfilling a longstanding objective of this management team, we\u2019ve achieved a milestone that will yield benefits in terms of enhanced financial flexibility.","We\u2019re pleased that our performance continues to reflect the excellence of our people. Outstanding consumer insights, industry-leading creativity and the delivery of efficient and precisely targeted communications have all become hallmarks of IPG and our agencies.","The top-tier digital capabilities we have the across the portfolio also continues to be a differentiated for us. By keeping the clients front and center, we can combine all of the skill sets into integrated solutions that are customized to the needs of our clients. This in turn positions us strongly in the evolving world of media and marketing.","We are, as always, highly focused on capitalizing on growth to drive further margin expansion and capital return. The strength of our offerings coupled with the strong record of operating discipline is a winning combination that will ensure that we will continue to deliver for client and shareholders alike. As you know, Q1 is seasonally small for us. There is still continued uncertainty driven by macroeconomics and geopolitical factors including potential tax reforms, healthcare and infrastructure. However, we are confident that performance to date has us fully on track to deliver on the 3% to 4% organic growth target we set for the full year as well as to expand operating margin by an additional 50 basis points relative to 2016.","At this stage, I\u2019d like to turn things over to Frank for additional detail on our results. And after this remarks, I\u2019ll be back to provide the update of our agencies, tone of business to be followed by a Q&A.","Frank Mergenthaler","Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone.","As a reminder, I\u2019ll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. On slide two, you see an overview of our results. Organic revenue growth was 2.7% in the first quarter, 2.9% in the US and 2.2% in our international markets. Excluding a small increase in pass-through revenue and related expense, organic revenue growth was 2.5%. Q1 operating profit was $30 million, an increase of $7 million compared to last year in our seasonally small first quarter. Diluted EPS is $0.05, which compares to $0.01 as reported last year and compares favorably to $0.02 per share as adjusted for items a year ago.","Turning to slide three, you see our P&L for the quarter. I\u2019ll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. It is worth noting here that Q1 2016 includes the reclassification of $2 million of pension expense from salaries and other income, reflecting the adoption of the new pension accounting standard. The impact was approximately $800,000 in Q1 2017. Further down the P&L, it\u2019s also worth noting that we had a tax benefit in the quarter against our seasonally small Q1 pretax earnings. That is a result of our mix of profit and loss by tax jurisdiction around the world and the excess tax benefit of share based compensation in our first quarter. We continue to expect that our effective tax rate will be in the range of 35 to 36% for the full year.","Turning to revenue on slide four. Revenue was $1.75 billion in the quarter. Compared to Q1 2016, the impact of the change in exchange rates was negative 1% while net dispositions were negative1% as well. Resulting revenue increase was 70 basis points as reported and organic increase of 2.7%. As you can see on the bottom half of this slide, organic growth was 2.2% at our integrated agency network segment, which is good performance against 7.6% growth in Q1 2016 with contributions from all the IAN disciplines and across a range of agencies. CNG grew 4.6% organically led by Octagon, Golin and Weber Shandwick.","Moving on to slide five, revenue by region. US organic growth was 2.9% and was 2% excluding increased pass-through revenues in the US. Again, growth was broad based across disciplines in agencies led by R\/GA, Mediabrands, Jack Morton, Hill Holliday and McCann. Leading clients sectors were healthcare, food and beverage, auto and retail. We also had strong growth in our other category paced by energy, and industrial clients.","Turning to international markets, the UK grew slightly on an organic basis but UK organic growth was 4.4% excluding the decrease in pass-through revenue. We had notably strong growth in McCann UK once again, along the growth at Weber Shandwick and Mediabrands. It\u2019s also worth noting that acquisitions contributed another 3% to growth in the UK but the dollar pound relationship decreased our reported UK revenue by about 14%. Continental Europe increased 6.7% organically. Among our largest markets, we were led by strong results in Germany and Italy while France and Spain were flat compared to last year.","In Asia Pac, we had an organic decrease of 2.7%, reflecting lower spending from a number of our clients in China where we were lapping exceptional growth in last year\u2019s first quarter, as well as a decrease from Australia. We continue to see very good growth in India and Japan.","LatAm grew 3.7% organically on top of 11.6% a year ago. We continue to have strong performances by our agencies in Mexico, Argentina and Chile, which offset lower revenue in Brazil. Our other markets group increased 7.8% organically in Q1, which is also notably strong performance on top of the 7.4% a year ago. This reflects growth in South Africa, the Middle East and Canada.","On slide six, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis; most recent data point is 4%.","Moving on to slide seven. Total operating expenses in the first quarter increased 30 basis points from a year ago, compared to reported revenue growth of 70 basis points. As a result, our operating margin expanded 40 basis points. The ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue in Q1 was 72.7% this year compared with 72.8% a year ago. Comparison reflects improved leverage on our other salaries and related expense, mainly due to lower expense or earn-outs offset by base payroll and incentive comp.","The total headcount at quarter end of approximately 50,200, which has increased about 1% from year-end 2016. We continue to invest on growth areas in the portfolio such as digital, media, advertising and PR, and to support our new business wins. On the lower half of the slide, our total O&G expense in the first quarter was essentially flat against last year, generating 20 basis points of operating leverage.","On slide eight, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis with the most recent data point of 12.1%.","On slide nine, we turn to cash flow. Cash used in operations in Q1 was $372 million, compared with $654 million a year ago. As you know, our operating cash flow is highly seasonal. Our business typically generates significant cash and working capital in the fourth quarter and uses cash in the first quarter. During this year\u2019s first quarter, cash used in working capital was $439 million, compared with the use of $695 million in Q1 a year ago. The improvement was due to the timing of our working capital cash flows, which we had also referred to at the time of our fourth quarter call. While we have lower seasonal cash generation in Q4, this is the offset in Q1, lower use of cash in the first quarter.","Investing activities used $33 million in the quarter including $25 million of CapEx. Financing activities generated $64 million, due to an increase in short-term borrowings of $225 million. We used $71 million for our common stock dividend and $55 million for share repurchases. Our net decrease in cash and marketable securities for the quarter was $320 million compared with $831 million a year ago.","Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on slide 10. We ended the first quarter with $778 million in cash and short-term marketable securities compared with $680 million a year ago. It\u2019s worth noting that our cash level seasonal tends to peak at year-end and decrease during the first quarter.","On slide 11, we show debt deleveraging from a peak of $2.33 billion in 2007 to $1.92 billion at the most recent quarter-end.","In summary on the slide 12, we are pleased with solid revenue growth and profit performance in the quarter, which represents a good start in terms of achieving our financial objectives for the full year.","With that, let me turn it back over to Michael.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Frank. As we\u2019ve noted, against very challenging comps, we showed solid growth in the quarter. Digital activity across all of our agencies continues to be a significant driver of the success. And we saw positive contributions to our performance from a range of our offerings including advertising, media and marketing services. Disciplined cost management led to good progress during the quarter in terms of increased operating margin and our balance sheet remains an important factor that will allow us to further enhance shareholder value.","On the talent front, we\u2019re pleased that we remain a differentiated culture that attracts much of the industry\u2019s best talent, not only from our traditional peer sets but also in emerging areas such as digital content creation, social media as well as data and tech-enabled marketing.","We\u2019re also proud of our longstanding record in promoting diversity and inclusion. While we made meaningful strides and leading industry on many fronts, an area on which we are increasingly focusing is our ability to recruit, develop and promote people of color. That\u2019s because in order to keep our place as a leader in D&I and also continue to deliver best-in-class revenue growth, we must incorporate the broadest set of perspectives and skills into the thinking we deliver to clients. This will allow us to best reflect and connect to the markets with which we communicate with in order to be successful.","As we know, our industry is changing at a rapid pace. There is a great deal being written about the convergence that is bringing adjacent industries into others. [Ph] The increased competition that we all read about these days is not as evident to us as the headlines would have you believe. And it\u2019s possible we\u2019re seeing new forms of collaboration as well as competition as a result of the emerging market dynamics. But regardless of how the situation plays out, it bears noting that at IPG, we\u2019ve been preparing for this potential scenario for some time.","Our creative firepower is amongst the best in our peer set and it represents a significant barrier relative to new entrants into the advertising space. Digitally, we\u2019re equally strong, having invested in these capabilities for nearly a decade. As importantly, our ability to integrate a broad spectrum of marketing activity for our clients is a powerful differentiator. Finally, our commitment to accountability driven by a strong and holistic data platform, allows us to answer key questions regarding the efficacy and value of the advice and the work we provide to marketers.","Turning now to the tone of the business. Despite macro events that we are well aware of and which have caused a great degree of economic uncertainty, what we are hearing from clients and from our operators, point to a solid marketing environment and one which remains consistent with our achieving organic growth targets we set earlier this year. The new business pipeline is particularly strong in digital services. For us, this comes across all of our agencies. And we\u2019re seeing opportunities for our digital specialist, integrated ad agencies, as well as our PR, health communications and shopper marketing firms. There is also quite a bit of activity in the media sector, where we\u2019re involved in most of the major pitches. The pipeline for larger, traditional AOR assignments remains lighter. This represents the continuation of a trend we also saw last year.","Highlights at the agency level include another quarter of very strong performance of R\/GA, which continues to expand the breadth of its offerings, its relationships with major marketers and its geographic presence. We recently reviewed the progress of the agencies accelerated progress, which allow us to incubate and get line of sight into some amazing start-ups and cutting edge areas such as VR, artificial intelligence and marketing technologies. R\/GA recently announced a new accelerated program in collaboration with Verizon Ventures, and our Ventures Studio program with Snap will be the first to incorporate clients and mentors for the full range of IPG agencies. Mediabrands also posted a very strong quarter growing with major multinational and domestic clients and on-boarding its new Hulu with Fitbit clients and announcing recently a win of Accenture.","Our transparent and agnostic approach to media ensures that clients are getting not just top level buying power and expertise, but also the best unbiased advice when it comes to optimizing their marketing investments. This is increasingly important in a world that is seeing greater concentration of power among media owners, as well as other challenges that have come to light in areas like digital measurement and brand safety.","CMG continues to deliver strong results and outstanding work across the full range of marketing services. From event and sports marketing to public relations, the work agencies like Octagon, Jack Morton, Golin and Weber Shandwick perform is becoming more strategic than ever.","Given the fragmented media landscape, there is a growing need for activities that engage consumer attention, connect to their passion points and feature a strong digital and social component. These are areas in which CMG shines. And we\u2019re looking forward to more strong performance from that group.","McCann Worldgroup posted strong results. We have consistently called out the great progress that McCann has made in terms of creative product and reputation, which now range at the top among the global advertising networks. The collaboration among McCann, MRM, Momentum and McCann Healthcare has also been tracking very well. And we\u2019re seeing significant integrated cross selling wins from existing Worldgroup clients, which is a kind of organic growth that can be most readily converted into increased profitability.","McCann has been an important driver of our improved performance in Continental Europe. And the network\u2019s progress in Middle East and Africa are also notable, as they position us for longer term growth in these promising regions. MullenLowe remains very active in new business, posting significant wins such as E-Trade, Hyatt Hotels and Chipotle. The agencies hyper bundle model is now up and running in key international markets including London, Shanghai and India where MullenLowe is a top-five agency. Hyper bundling ensures that MullenLowe\u2019s creative excellence is informed and enhanced by integrated digital, media and activation talent, which makes the agency strategies and campaigns more effective in the marketplace.","At FCB, we\u2019re seeing further progress in the Chicago headquarters office, which integrates strong consumer advertising, digital and shopper markets capabilities. FCB in Toronto and London is also a center of excellence, as well the agencies operations in India. FCB Health continues to be a strong driver of growth and a leader in its space. We\u2019re also pleased to see FCB\/SIX, one of the agencies operations in Canada, recently recognized as a digital stand out in Adweek\u2019s Agencies 3.0 list, which called out the shop\u2019s ability to use data, CRM and video storytelling to seamlessly create real time messages, personalized for any audience.","Our integrated US independents made news during the quarter on a new business front with wins like Phillips 66 at Carmichael Lynch and Party City at Hill Holliday. Both of those agencies also announced senior internal management promotions at the president or CEO level, which will ensure top management continuity. Deutsch won 7-Eleven title, [ph] the maker of Bluetooth-enabled location devices. We\u2019re looking for new ways to combine the strong offerings of these agencies with the terrific digital capabilities that Huge, our outstanding digital specialist agency which during the quarter won important new assignments from Verizon and United Technology. This should allow us to deliver even more powerful solutions to domestic clients.","During the quarter, we also made a significant announcement regarding increased investment to further enhance our data and analytics capabilities. Reporting directly into IPG, Mediabrands\u2019 new Chief Data and Marketing Technology Officer will be charged with driving a more centralized data and technology infrastructure that can support all of our agencies, across the holding company.","By combining online and offline data sets and consolidating partnerships with third parties, we can build tools that allow us to better target high-value audiences, refine our strategies and messaging across every communication discipline, and prove the value of all our ideas and marketing programs, which will keep us highly relevant in today\u2019s media environment.","As I mentioned previously, another way in which we can ensure that we stay at top of mind with clients, is our ability to deliver integrated solutions. We were early to identifying this as a strategic priority and have been refining our open architecture model for close to a decade. Unlike our competitors, we don\u2019t disrupt the power of agency brands; instead, we get the best talent from across the group working together in flexible teams that are custom-built for each client situation or challenge. We\u2019re seeing the benefits of this approach on a number of our most important existing global clients, particularly in the pharma and tech industries.","Looking forward, it\u2019s possible to make too much of Q1, given that it\u2019s a smallest quarter and that means percentages can fluctuate even when the absolute numbers are not large. But, we see the results that we are sharing today as indicative of a solid step into 2017. Our offerings are strong and we show vigilance on cost and appropriate margin conversion. As a result, we believe that we remain well-positioned to achieve our full year targets of organic revenue in the 3 to 4% range and to improve operating margin by an additional 50 basis points relative to 2016 levels. Combined with the strength of our balance sheet and our commitment to capital return, that means there is significant potential for value-creation and enhance shareholder value.","As always, we thank you for your time and support, and we look forward to keeping you posted on our progress during the course of the year. With that, I\u2019ll open up the floor to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani from JPMC. Your line is now open.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you. Just a couple of questions; I guess, the first one is on the ongoing robust growth you continue to see in Continental Europe. I just want to drill down a further. You gave some great color by countries. But does it influence by your success in new business wins or are you seeing that sort of just an industry-wide growth? And then, are you able to utilize your NOLs now that you\u2019re seeing very healthy growth in that region now for three quarters, I believe? And then, just a follow-up question, just on your verticals; you highlighted retail being particularly strong. I guess, if you can sort of reconcile that with the weakness we\u2019re seeing in the retail industry. I guess, why is it particularly strong for you when the sector is struggling and any above average sort of pricing pressure on the consumer package with clients? Thanks.","Michael Roth","All of that?","Alexia Quadrani","Sorry.","Michael Roth","That\u2019s okay; that\u2019s fine. By the way, let me just reference that that was not my phone that went off [multiple speakers]. All right. First on Continental Europe. Again, as you know, in Continental Europe, it\u2019s roughly 8% of our revenue and UK is 9%. It\u2019s significant, but not that significant. So, therefore, particular client wins has an impact on those positive results. So, I would say that in answer to the question, we had -- McCann in particular and Mediabrands had some nice wins in those markets, and we\u2019re seeing the effect of those wins. We\u2019re not raising a big flag as a big recovery in Continental Europe, which I think is the just of your question. And as far as the UK goes, that is solid gains across the board including our PR businesses and so on. So, we do draw a distinction between strength in the UK and the positive results we\u2019re seeing in Continental Europe, both obviously contributed to our overall performance.","On your question on the verticals, our biggest vertical continues, both on a worldwide and the U.S. basis is healthcare, it continues to be a very strong discipline for us and we\u2019re seeing very strong growth both out of FCB and McCann Health. So, that\u2019s very encouraging and we see that as a continuing factor in our growth going forward.","As far as retail goes, it\u2019s unique to our client servicing. These are not the retail clients for example. If you see, for example, the retail department stores in the U.S., which you\u2019re reading so much about. Here we\u2019re seeing particularly healthy, [ph] McCann won some business at Staples and of course Amazon we characterize as retail. So, those are the key factors in our growth. We don\u2019t have significant exposure to the retail organizations that you\u2019re reading about every day in the newspapers.","And by the way, obviously our NOLs that you correctly point out are in Europe. And as we see profitability in Europe, we will continue to use those NOLs to offset on a cash tax basis, which is one of the reasons why you\u2019ll see our effective tax rate -- cash tax rate being less than our effective already. So that\u2019s positive for us and that continues to, as you know, go on for many years in terms of the availability.","CPG, that one obviously we are seeing some pressure from clients like everyone else in terms of pricing and cutbacks. I see the opportunity on CPG because a lot of these multi-national clients in particular use hundreds of different agencies and they embarked on significant cost containment. And we are positioned and I think our clients\u2019 position is that consolidation of all these different agencies with a number of key providers will provide a lot of the efficiencies that they are looking for. So we see that -- one obviously there is pressure on fees and it\u2019s important for us to watch our cost profile as associated with that in efficiencies but also as an opportunity for us to pick up some new brands. And hopefully that will mitigate somewhat the pricing pressures that we\u2019re seeing at CPG. That said, food and beverage was slightly positive on a worldwide basis for us whereas the consumer goods was in fact negative.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of John Janedis from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","John Janedis","Thank you. Frank, it sounds like an old landline phone. Two questions. One is, Michael you spoke to the tone of business, your target assumes an organic acceleration this year. And I was wondering to what extent you\u2019re assuming wins to hit that target or do you -- your client conversations give you that comfort? And then, maybe separately bigger picture, as you know, there has been some concern in the market around competition from consultants, the CPG vertical you spoke to and then disintermediation of the agencies. So, with the US organic that you put out today and then I guess your peers in the first quarter and appreciating the comp, can you talk about why that these things may or may not be premature?","Michael Roth","Yes. First of all, 63% of our business is in US, so that helps us. We see -- not a high growth rate in the US but moderate rate, low single digits, which as we said in the past, 3 or 4% organic growth, we should be able to continue to expand our margins. So, in the US, we\u2019re very strong across our media offerings, our independent agencies come in here, as well as our digital and creative capabilities and PR businesses in US. So that gives us a degree of comfort in our forecast at 3 to 4%.","And our wins and losses were net new business positive. We did see in the first quarter, we did have to cycle through two losses, particularly in the US being Sprint on the creative side and USAA. So, we\u2019re seeing somewhat of an impact of that in the first quarter but we do have net new business coming on board. So, I would view the headwinds and tailwinds on a full year basis at this point as relatively neutral which is good because those two losses we want to -- it\u2019s good that we\u2019re able to overcome that. And we have a lot of potential new business in the pipeline. Our pipeline is solid. What you don\u2019t read about our new business wins within existing multi-national clients, particularly on the healthcare side, those we don\u2019t announce but given the strong capabilities we have both at FCB and McCann, we did see nice wins in those organizations and clients where we do have open architecture structures and those are contributing to our net new business. You just don\u2019t see that, for example in the Alexia\u2019s [ph] releases where she puts the scorecard of net wins and losses, our existing client base continues to be primary source for organic growth for us and that\u2019s not reflected in the new business tables.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Cahall from Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is now open.","Steven Cahall","Thank you. Maybe first a few questions just on the media space; you talked about that as being a growth driver in the quarter. And I know there has been both, some wins and losses over the last few and some pipeline. So, I guess, number one do you expect to be net new business positive in media for the year and expect it to continue to be a growth driver? And then, on the traditional side, I was just wondering, if you\u2019re seeing any fee pressure there? Is that something that we\u2019ve heard about around traditional media buying? And maybe you can tie that into the investments that you talked about earlier and to the extent to which media buying and media planning are now increasingly integrated with the clients or whether they\u2019re splitting that business up? And then, as follow-on, I was just wondering if you could comment on the recent announcement by Google to block ads, and do you think that will have any impact on Cadreon as we move through the year? Thank you.","Michael Roth","First of all, John, I didn\u2019t answer one of your questions. So, let me get back to that. The question of competition from other sources. Yes, the convergence is out among all different whether it\u2019d be consultants out there; where it\u2019d be the other digitals; whether it\u2019d be the system integrators that are out there that are providing various services. We have not seen them in a big way. Every once in a while, we will see them on the digital side of the business and normally, frankly we do pretty well against them. So, I think, what I mentioned in my remarks is that our integrated offering and our creative firepower is something at this point gives us a strong advantage over those system integrators, if you will. That said, five years or six years from now, the landscape is going to change, maybe potentially you\u2019ll see us partnering with some of these. These are all, it\u2019s a changing anticipating landscape out there, but what we do bring to the table is the firepower on the creative side of the business.","And what we offer to those type of individuals in terms of the diverse client base, innovative thinking, the ability to reach across all the different agencies at IPG, that\u2019s a pretty compelling case to be made for strong creative talent. And we\u2019ve been very successful bringing some real top notch talent within our organization. That coupled with the media side of the business, which we can bring on an integrated offering is something that these other providers don\u2019t have and we use that. And we do believe that the integration of media and creative talent, for example when MullenLowe is doing on the hyper bundling is really what clients are looking for and which is why on the media side of the business we\u2019re seeing a lot of action out there in terms of clients, not clients, actually a lot of the reviews that are out there are not existing clients. And we see the integration as a key factor both in buying and planning, which is why we think our investments in data analytics across all of IPG really position us well in terms of the response what are clients are looking for on the media side of the business.","Steven Cahall","Are you increasingly seeing those RFPs tied together between planning as well as the buying?","Michael Roth","Yes. And right now -- it used to be -- there are still clients out there that bifurcate buying and planning. And because they view -- media guys, I wanted to say this. They view buying as more of a commodity and they\u2019re just looking for the best price. But I think it\u2019s a pretty compelling argument that buying and planning should be together because we can come up with the best media plan there is. And if it isn\u2019t executed properly on the buying side, the effectiveness is really diminished and really is helpful to have the buying media and the planning, sitting in the same room working together. And there are occasions that we do that. So, it\u2019s not that we can\u2019t do it but I think clients are beginning to realize that there is an added value to putting the two of them together. And then, if you add on top of that the ability to bring in our creative and other offerings across the different disciplines, it\u2019s a compelling argument as to why the model that we use, the open architecture model brings the best value as well as the expertise to the clients.","Fee pressure is something is getting a lot of -- since I\u2019ve been in the business, what we\u2019ve been talking about is fee pressure. Whether you call it zero based budgeting, whether you call it value pricing, whatever you want to call it, there is always pressure. Clients want more for less. And if I was a client, I would be doing exactly that. And it\u2019s incumbent to us to show that the work that we do actually moves the needle and which is why the data analytics part, why we\u2019re making such a big strong effort on the centralized data and analytics across all the disciplines with an IPG because that really makes the case that what we do works and it encourages our clients to invest in what we do to move the needle.","So, even if it\u2019s a difficult competitive environment, these clients have to spend money on advertising. And if we can show the return on investment for the money that they are spending, they are going to spend it. And although they\u2019ll want -- price it most efficiently and get the best deals as they can, if we can prove that what we\u2019re doing is adding value, then they\u2019re going to spend their money and it\u2019s going to be incumbent on us to make our margins. And frankly you\u2019ve seen us do that. We\u2019ve been talking about price pressures now for years and we continue to expand margin at 50 basis points.","So, we still believe the opportunity is there for us to continue to expand margin even with the pressures on the pricing. But there is pressure and it really puts the burden on us to make the case of what we\u2019re doing is effective and efficient for our clients.","Google and ad blocking, I mean that\u2019s -- someone is going to ultimately have to pay for all this stuff. And I know that marketplace like to see everything for nothing but in the end advertisers are going to spend money and they\u2019re going to be -- they want to see the effectiveness. It puts the burden on us to be creative and innovative in storytelling, embedded content, different ways of reaching the consumer, the pop up ad, yes, you\u2019ve got to see that blocked, frankly thank goodness because it gets to be annoying. But we\u2019re much more advanced than that in our business right now. And the embedded content which is why everyone is investing in content and having partnerships on content really makes the case for developing relationship between the clients and the consumers. And that\u2019s really where we shine. We can use our creative capability, our technical capabilities and our distribution to make sure that that content is reaching the consumers with the right message.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of David Joyce from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open","David Joyce","Thank you. I was hoping you could help us think about how much your digital initiatives are helping the growth in the U.S. And then, from a broader perspective, where are your various international operations in rolling out and integrating digital versus where we are?","Michael Roth","Look, our digital capabilities are growing historically and overall at double-digit rate. So, it\u2019s a strong engine for our growth. And we don\u2019t -- it\u2019s hard to characterize them as digital agencies anymore. There\u2019s been a convergence among all of our agencies. Our approach to digital has always been that it\u2019s embedded in all of our activities. So, whether you do experiential, whether you do PR, whether you do traditional advertising, digital capabilities is embedded, which is why we don\u2019t have a separate silo as far as digital capabilities. On top of that, we do have digital -- historical digital capabilities in the R\/GA a Huge, the MRM, the Proferos. These are original digital agencies, but they cover a broad spectrum of services. R\/GA covers creative PR. I mean, they are full service agency candidly, but they have the connected space and the digital capabilities as part of their DNA, which is what makes their offering in Huge and the Proferos and the MRMs compelling, because they bring all of those expertise together. And frankly when they don\u2019t have, they reach out to other assets within IPG to put that all together. So digital is a critical growth. And if you look at where media is being spent, linear TV is not growing as rapidly as digital on the media side. And therefore, if all of our resources aren\u2019t well-versed in digital capabilities, we couldn\u2019t put forth the numbers that we\u2019re seeing. So, digital is going to continue to help grow most of our other businesses. And we make good margin on it. And it\u2019s a great way to develop lasting relationships with clients because that\u2019s where the action is.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. ","Peter Stabler","Good morning. One for Michael and one for Frank. Michael, wondering if you could give us a little more color on the dispositions, you refer to them as non-strategic. I wonder if there is any sort theme in there. And then, Frank, couple of quarters ago, you talked about, how in terms of contract construction you were generally seeking to lower your exposure to pass-through revenues, given the fact that they can distort growth and the end call them out plus or minus every quarter; just wondering, if you cold update us. Have you seen a meaningful reduction in terms of contract construction in the pass-through; is this contributing to a bit of the margin growth? Wondering if you could help us think about that through the rest of the year. Thanks very much.","Michael Roth","Yes. On the dispositions, we did indicate that it had an impact of negative 1% on revenue. If you remember, last year, the ended of year, we announced that we were disposing of not-strategic assets. This isn\u2019t exit of a business line that we\u2019ve seen, one of our competitors has that. This is small agencies and geographic regions that frankly they were either losing money or they were not relevant to the offerings, to the entity in which they were residing. So, it\u2019s just basically cleaning up agencies that were not value-added, losing money and strategically not necessary. So, it\u2019s not that we exited the business line; it was in geographic regions that were not efficient for us.","Frank Mergenthaler","And on a question around contracts, Peter, it primary relates to events business. We are trying to address new clients and move them into an agency relationship as opposed to a principal relationship, existing clients very difficult to shift. So, this will take some time; it\u2019s not having a meaningful impact on margins.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you. Good morning. Michael, couple for you. I was curious programmatic was a big buzz word for us a couple of years ago, it\u2019s still a big part of your business. And I guess as a complement to IPG, a lot of your competitors have shifted their model to look like yours and be more of an agency approach. So, now that that\u2019s happened. The bad news is it is perhaps less differentiated of an offer. Can you talk about what you\u2019re doing on the programmatic digital buying front to sort of stay ahead of competition, now that this kind of moves your way, for lack of a better phrase? And then, I had a follow-up.","Michael Roth","I\u2019d like to say they see the light. Actually more importantly, the clients have seen the light. This was more or less a response to the fact that what we\u2019ve been saying all along is that we should act as an agent, not as a principal. So, there is an inherent conflict when you\u2019re doing the buyings programmatic, if you\u2019re selling inventory that you have an economic interest in it. And we\u2019ve always said that that we do something we wouldn\u2019t do. And obviously, you\u2019re right. We use that as a differentiator in the various pitches. And clients are beginning to see that they shouldn\u2019t be giving away those profits. And therefore our approach which is a more client-centric approach is the right way to go. And so we\u2019re appreciative of that.","But it\u2019s still a very important business for us. Let\u2019s say, we never took inventory. So, therefore it\u2019s still a very high margin business for us. So that means the value service that we\u2019re providing in the programmatic is something that clients appreciate and they\u2019re willing to pay for it. And we\u2019re expanding it on a global basis. Remember, this started out as the US based business and now it\u2019s covering the world. The fact that we pulled out the data analytics and put it into reporting directly into fleet in the US side at the holding company level is indicative that we view this as a very strong component that will differentiate us in the marketplace and will be available, not just to our media businesses but all of our businesses. And when you look at the hyper bundling that we\u2019ve been talking about where media and creative are coming together, this will be viewed as an integral part of the offering that our agencies have. So, I don\u2019t think programmatic dramatic is going away, I think it continues to be a growth vehicle for us. Yes, some clients have been taking it in-house. But this costs a lot of money to continue to evolve; we have to invest in it.","Clients like to have it in-house but when it comes time to looking at efficiencies and investing in it, I think a lot of them will see that some of them may do -- is okay to have in-house but in terms of the changing landscape of programmatic, we offer something that is very difficult to do on an internal basis. So, it would be a combination of the two. So, we still view programmatic as a very important aspect of the business going forward.","Ben Swinburne","Got it. And then, just as a follow-up more on the macro, you look a lot of the I guess call it soft data out there whether it\u2019s consumer confidence or a small business index, or a lot of the PMI data, still quite bullish. And I think a lot of verticals have been expecting some sort of cyclical balance including advertising, but we\u2019re not really seeing it. I\u2019m curious, you\u2019ve made some comments about sort of the political backdrop. And I\u2019d just love your thoughts as to whether you expect to see the spending trends sort of catch-up with the leading indicators or if this mismatch may persist for a while. I realize you\u2019re not an economist per se, but you talk to large advertisers; we\u2019d love to get your thoughts?","Michael Roth","Yes. I think everyone is -- we are experiencing everything that you read about. Everyone is expecting this rash of consumer confidence and spending and a lot of it is a function of what\u2019s going to happen frankly in Washington. And so, everyone is waiting and seeing, everyone is expecting to see some change, because obviously that was an important part of the platform. I think they\u2019re beginning to see that it\u2019s a little more difficult than they originally thought. But nonetheless, the consumers are spending, but I think there is some holdback, if you will, in terms of big companies committing to making big investments until these areas are resolved.","So, there is disconnect between the market, stock market and the spend. I think potentially, if it all comes together, that will be a good pick-up for us as we go forward, as is tax rate change. I mean, forget about the consumers, just look at IPG, I mean, if you -- we are a tax payer in the U.S. and to the extent that there is a reduction in corporate taxes or individual taxes, which will help to consumers that all benefits us. So, we\u2019re looking [ph] for that. And so I think it\u2019s still a little bit of a wait and see. So, I agree, I think we\u2019re going to still see disconnect there until some of this stuff really comes to fruition.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you.","Michael Roth","We still think that the 3% to 4% that we\u2019re putting out for the year, we do this on a bottoms up basis, and we were not anticipating a big hockey stick in terms of consumer confidence to give the rise to that 3% to 4% growth.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon from BMO. Your line is now open.","Dan Salmon","Good morning, everyone. Michael, could we perhaps just return back to parts of your prepared remarks and then earlier questions on competition that the IT companies in particular? And there has been an increasing questions on them specifically. And this isn\u2019t a new trend; we\u2019ve seen a lot of small deals going on for years. It doesn\u2019t seem like there has been a big increase there. But hiring trends are something that we see a little bit less of. So, I was curious if you could go pullback the curtain for us a little bit more, are you hiring more their people; are they hiring more of yours, has that changed whole a lot? And then maybe second, if I could return to the idea of their role in transacting media specifically. Accenture in the past month has been assigned as the sort of the manager of the open AP alliance between the three of other larger sellers of advertising and you also interestingly note that you\u2019ll be their media agency going forward. So, kind of interesting perspective on what they\u2019re doing with a new business on the sales side. But you\u2019re also tied with them shortly on the buy side. I\u2019d be curious about your high level views on how those companies play in media work?","Michael Roth","Yes. It just shows you, we can all get along. Everybody else would operate the same way. I think we\u2019d be in better shape. Yes. Look, as I say, they are -- look, whether it\u2019d be Accenture or any other consulting and as I say system integrators, they\u2019re buying agencies. And I would do -- you already have the client, you\u2019re doing -- you\u2019re involved in their system integration; and to the extent that you\u2019ve been having add-on from revenue, why not. And so, we do see them as continued competitors if you will in the space. But at this stage, they don\u2019t have the capabilities on the integrated offering that we have. And frankly, and I\u2019ve thrown this out that maybe it\u2019s better if we partner with them than directly compete because we do bring unique expertise that they don\u2019t have yet, and why buy it when you can rent it. So, that\u2019s it. Just I throw that out as a potential. But nonetheless, we compete with them. And so far, we\u2019re doing pretty well against it. And it will be interesting, if they are advising, as you say, the publishers, if you will, sellers of space, it\u2019s hard to be on the other side of that.","So, as we say, there is a convergence of everything coming together. And in the end, it\u2019s going to be who has the best capabilities, who has the best insights, and who can bring it all together in a single source. And that\u2019s where I think we have a competitive advantage. We\u2019ve been operating under this open architecture now for 10 years. And frankly we know how to do that. And if you\u2019re sitting on the other side of the table, you can blow your brains out looking at all the different resources that are out there trying to sell you something. And if we can provide a single source capability that\u2019s best in class that puts them all together that\u2019s focused on the client, we don\u2019t have them building the hunt with respect to any of our assets, that\u2019s a pretty compelling case if I was sitting on the other side of the table. So, that\u2019s where we continue to place our bets. And by the way, we are going into the consultancy business. I said this before. But the consultancy part of the business is different.","We are -- for example R\/GA is already in business transformation, design capabilities, even structural type of advice. So yes, I mean, it\u2019s a logical expansion of the fact that we have relationship with the clients, we know their business and we can really bring to the table creative, new, innovative ideas and call it what you will, partnering with these clients and being able to execute in this complicated environment is something that they want to see. And frankly we\u2019re pretty well suited to do it.","So, yes, they\u2019re going to be out there but I think like I said in my prepared remarks, we\u2019ve been expecting it and we\u2019ve been building our assets to compete against it. That said, Accenture is a great client of ours, I\u2019m very happy to have him as a client. I committed to them that we will through the best we have at IPG to helping them achieve their goals and we\u2019re on the same page.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet from Citi. Your line is now open. ","Jason Bazinet","Thanks. Just a question for Mr. Roth. When I think of a company that\u2019s not growing super quickly, you can see working capital go negative, positive, but it usually nets out to zero if you give a firm enough time. And when I look to the sort of late-90s to 2006, that\u2019s indeed what happened at IPG, it\u2019s positive, negative; positive, negative but it netted out to zero. The last ten years sort of 2006 to 2016, it was sort of minus $1 billionish. And over that same period, you generated about $3.7 billion of cash flows, so large as a percentage of your cash generation. Is there something indicative of how the business is changed in the 20-year period where it has become more working capital intensive or am I just looking at sort of the wrong two 10-year periods and drawing erroneous conclusions? Thanks.","Michael Roth","Well, I think the aspect of the media business has changed dramatically. And I think that\u2019s part of what\u2019s driving -- and that\u2019s why you see the seasonality of our own cash flows because a lot of our ins and outs on the cash flows is as a result of media. So, I think that had a big impact. Frankly, I\u2019m not as familiar about it -- I\u2019m new to this business relatively. So, the 10 years that you were talking about, I was a tax lawyer. But, right now, I think it\u2019s a media business that\u2019s driving the cash flows and it\u2019s -- and we\u2019ve done a tremendous job in terms of working with our clients and working with our -- focus on cash flow. We\u2019re not a bank. And it\u2019s a critical component of returns.","So, I think we\u2019re much better at it than we were 10 years ago as well. It wasn\u2019t the kind of focus that was -- in the end though, yes, we are generating a lot of cash flow; it\u2019s a good. The good news about IPG is that that cash flow we\u2019re returning to our shareholders. We didn\u2019t go out and do big transactions; that\u2019s another difference. In the all days, IPG and the other holding companies and there are some still do it, buy everything that\u2019s out there. And frankly, we were not participating in that. So, we took the excess cash flow in our business and we returned it to our shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. So, there aren\u2019t any big transactions out there that we see that when we really have to use all of that cash to do. If there are, we\u2019ll look at it as any other transaction. But I think -- I hope that helps. But that\u2019s the dynamics of our business for example.","Jason Bazinet","Do you think on a go forward basis, if you go out long enough that the working capital on relations will be zero or do you think it sort of\u2026","Michael Roth","Eventually, of course, and unless the dynamics of our industry change dramatically which frankly we\u2019re not going to do. So, that\u2019s the gist of your question. Clients would like us to be a bank but we\u2019re not.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. You may go ahead and proceed.","Michael Roth","Okay. Well, thank you very much. As I said, this is the first quarter. We\u2019ve got a lot of work ahead of us and we are keeping our heads down to deliver on our results. Thank you so much.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you and you may disconnect at this time."],"11887":["The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.

All parties are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jerry Leshne","Good morning. Thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website interpublic.com. This morning we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 A.M. Eastern Time.","During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company. These are subject to the uncertainties in the cautionary statement that is included in our earnings release and the slide presentation and further detailed in our 10-Q and our other filings with the SEC.","We will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful supplemental data that while not a substitute for GAAP measures allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial performance and operational performance.","At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Jerry, and thank you all for joining us, this morning, as we review our results for this quarter and first six months of 2019. As usual I'll start out by covering the highlights of our performance, Frank will then provide additional details, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies to be followed by our Q&A.","Pleased to report another quarter of solid financial performance. Organic growth of net revenue was 3.0% in the quarter. That's on top of 5.6% a year ago and brings organic growth over the first six months of this year to 4.6%.","Regionally, organic growth in our international markets continue to be strong at 6.5% in the quarter, driven by our performance across LatAm, Continental, Europe, and the U.K. In the U.S., organic growth was 0.6% against 4.6% growth last year. This result reflects growth in the quarter across many of our U.S. agencies and disciplines bode by headwinds from the account activity toward the end of last year which we have talked about on previous calls.","These losses year-over-year resulted in a U.S. headwind of 3.8% in the quarter. The growth we saw despite the headwinds and industry-leading comps from last year along with our win rate this year demonstrates that our business remains solid.","In our Integrated Agency Networks or IAN segment, global organic growth was 3.2% in the second quarter led by Mediabrands and FCB Health along with contributions from McCann Worldgroup, R\/GA, MullenLowe, and Huge.","Our CMG segment grew 1.9% organically paced by another advance in public relations with notably strong performance by Weber Shandwick and by Octagon and FutureBrand.","Among client sectors globally, we saw strong growth across healthcare, financial services, industrials, consumer goods, tech and telecom, and retail. The total growth of our net revenue was 9.1% in the second quarter and was 11% in the first half. That includes organic growth, acquisitions and dispositions, as well as the impact of year-over-year currency changes. Within that we continue to be pleased with the growth of Acxiom which remains on track with our expectations and continues to be accretive to growth and margins.","Turning to EBITA and the operating income. Second quarter EBITA was $285.5 million, an increase of 12.2% from last year's second quarter. Operating income was $264.2 million. EBITA margin as a percent of net revenue in the quarter increased 30 basis points to 13.4% from last year's EBITA margin. For the first six months our adjusted EBITA margin increased 140 basis points from a year ago.","Second quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.43 and was $0.46 as adjusted which compares to $0.44 a year ago. Looking at the quarter and the first half, our performance means that the year is off to a solid start. Our client-centric integrated offerings continue to drive highly competitive global growth and the quality of our talent continues to strengthen our offerings. This is further reflected in very high levels of recognition accorded our people and our agencies once again this year in industry awards such as the Cannes Festival of Creativity and in other key industry rankings.","Turning to our outlook, you'll recall that we came into the year with financial targets of 2% to 3% organic growth and 40 to 50 basis points of margin expansion. At mid-year, we're confident that our performance to-date and the current tone of business have us on track to deliver at the high end of that range and that is inclusive of headwinds.","In addition, we continue to be comfortable with our target for EBITA margin expansion of 40 to 50 basis points over last year's 13.5%. As always, we'll update our outlook as the year progresses.","At this point, it's my pleasure to turn things over to Frank for additional detail on our performance and I'll return with an update and highlights of our businesses. Frank?","Frank Mergenthaler","Thank you, Michael and good morning. As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. On Slide 2, you'll see a summary of our results. Second quarter net revenue growth was 9.1%. Organic growth was 3% with the U.S. being 0.6% international at 6.5%. Q2 EBITA of $285 million, which compares with $254.4 million a year ago, an increase of 12.2%.","For the quarter, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.46. The adjustments exclude the amortization of acquired intangibles and exclude non-operating losses due to disposition of certain small non-strategic agencies. We also adjust for the benefit of certain tax settlements in the quarter.","Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. Here it's worth noting a small restructuring charge, $2.1 million to fine-tune the expense of the actions we took in the first quarter. Below operating income, our net interest expense continues to be higher year-over-year due to the financing we added in late September last year due to Acxiom.","Turning to Q2 and first half net revenue on Slide 4, net revenue in the quarter was $2.13 billion. Compared to Q2 2018, the impact of the change in exchange rates was a negative 2.4% with the U.S. dollar stronger against every functional international currency. Net acquisitions and divestitures added 8.5%, which includes the impact of Acxiom, as well as smaller acquisitions less our dispositions. The resulting organic revenue increase was 3%.","At the bottom of the slide, we break our operating segments. As you can see, our IAN segment grew 3.2% organically. Underneath that result was growth in media led by IPG Mediabrands and our global creatively led integrated offerings at FCB, McCann Worldgroup and MullenLowe and our digital specialist agencies R\/GA and Huge.","Total growth at IAN was 10.8%, which reflects acquisitions including Acxiom dispositions and a drag from currency changes. At our CMG segment, organic growth was 1.9% in the quarter driven by another quarter of strong growth from Weber Shandwick along with Octagon in sports and entertainment marketing and FutureBrand. The impact of revenue headwinds from accounts lost in Q4 2018 was felt in both segments.","Moving on to slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S. second quarter organic growth of net revenue was 0.6%. We continue to see solid growth from our global integrated offerings. From a regional standpoint, this was also where we have begun to see the impact of the revenue headwinds from accounts lost last year, namely FCA Media, Army and VW Creative. It's worth noting that total U.S. growth was 14.2%, due to the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, which include Acxiom.","In our international markets, we had another strong quarter with organic growth of 6.5%. In the U.K., organic growth was 4.7%, a very solid increase on top of double-digit growth in Q2 2018. We had terrific contributions from both our IAN and CMG segments, highlighted by Mediabrands, McCann, and Weber Shandwick.","In Continental Europe, organic growth was also strong at 9.2%, on top of 11.7% in Q2 2018. This was highlighted by very strong growth in some of our largest national markets, namely Germany, Italy and Spain. In Asia Pac, net organic revenue decreased 0.3% in Q2. Among our largest markets, we had strong growth in India and Japan, but that was offset by soft results in China and Australia.","Lat Am grew 25.1% organically in Q2. We had strong organic growth across the region led by Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia. Organic growth in the region was 24.5% in the first half of the year. In our Other Markets group, organic growth was 4.8% led by very strong growth in Canada.","Moving on to slide 6 and operating expenses, which were again well controlled in the quarter. Compared to net revenue growth of 9.1%, our net operating expenses increased only 8.7% as adjusted for the amortization of acquired intangibles. Our ratio of total salaries and related expense to revenue was 65%, an improvement of 140 basis points. The improvement reflects disciplined organic growth of expenses and the benefit from the consolidation of Acxiom.","Underneath that, the ratio of base payroll and benefits to net revenue decreased to 54.9% in the quarter an improvement of 90 basis points. We also saw solid operating leverage on temporary labor and our expense for severance in the quarter, while the expense of performance-based employee incentive compensation as a percentage of net revenue was flat with the year ago at 3.2%.","At quarter end, total headcount was approximately 54,200, an increase of 7.1% from a year ago, with most of the increase due to the addition of Acxiom. Our office and other direct expenses was 18.2% of second quarter net revenue compared with 17.1%, a year ago. Within office and other direct, we levered our expenses for occupancy by 10 basis points from a year ago. That was more than offset by the expense profile of Acxiom, which is accretive to our margins overall, while consolidating relatively more investment in data and technology.","Our SG&A expense was 80 points \u2013 80 basis points of Q2 net revenue, which reflects lower professional fees and general expenses at corporate. Our expense for depreciation increased due to the consolidation of Acxiom this year as was the case with our amortization expense, which was $21.3 million in the quarter. We also had a restructuring charge of $2.1 million in the quarter, which represents a small expense adjustment to the actions taken in this year's first quarter.","On slide 7, we present detail in adjustments to report our results in the quarter in order to provide better transparency and a picture of comparable performance. This begins in the left-hand side with our reported results and steps through to EBITA, and our adjusted diluted EPS. Our amortization expense for acquired intangibles was $21.3 million resulting in EBITA of $285.5 million. Below operating expense, we had a loss in the quarter of $6.1 million in other expense related to disposition of a few small non-strategic businesses. Our reported results also include a benefit of $13.9 million from the settlement of certain tax positions in the quarter, which we adjust for as well.","At the foot of the slide, you can see the after-tax impact per diluted share of each of these adjustments and that's at $0.03 per share, a difference between reported EPS of $0.43 and adjusted of $0.46.","On slide 8, we show similar adjustments to the first six months, which bridge to the adjusted earnings of $0.57 per diluted share.","On slide 9, we turn to cash flow in the second quarter. Cash from operations was $293 million compared with $172 million a year ago. Within that, working capital generated $53 million compared to the use of $63 million in Q2 2018. Investing activities used $47 million for CapEx in the quarter. Our financial activities used $278 million, including $100 million towards the repayment of our term note, and $91 million for our common stock dividend. Our net decrease in cash for the quarter was $16 million.","Slide 10 is the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $614 million of cash and equivalents.","Slide 11 depicts the maturity of our outstanding debt with total debt at quarter end of $3.8 billion and diversified term maturities going forward.","In summary on slide 12, first half growth and margin expansion have us well positioned at mid-year to deliver on our financial targets. Our teams continue to execute very well. Our balance sheet continues to be a strong and meaningful source of value creation all of which has us well positioned.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Michael.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Frank. Our results reflect a strong quarter. Organic revenue growth despite the headwinds faced in the U.S. is an encouraging sign that our clients remain in an investment mode, when it comes to their engagements with us. Our performance is also a reflection of the strength of our offerings, our people, and the differentiated strategy.","Specific to the U.S., we're well positioned to both resume market share gains and leverage a growing economy in our largest market. We are net new business positive year-to-date both internationally and in the U.S. As such, we've been able to offset significant domestic headwinds. And once we cycle through those losses, we expect to see a return to solid U.S. growth rates.","Our continued strength is due to a strategic position that differentiates IPG. First, our open architecture model is the most client-centric approach in the market. It integrates marketing channels across creative, media, public relations and data management in a model that continues to resonate with clients.","Open architecture is a solution that consultants cannot deliver, and one our peer set has been trying to emulate. We're seeing it in work with major clients in health care and financial services and other sectors. In addition, we include environmental, social and governance issues as value creators. That means we consistently take public positions on important social issues.","We feel doing so was in line with our values of transparency, ethics, inclusion and community involvement. It makes us a company people can believe in, with values that are backed by actions. Doing so, makes us the company clients want to do business with and people want to work for.","Our hallmarks include having embedded integrated digital capabilities as foundational to our operations, a step we took many years ago, having strong agency brands joined by a collaborative culture and seeing transparency as a core value. Thanks to this differentiated go-to-market strategy IPG received a host of recognition and accolades related to our effectiveness, our creativity and our powerful agency brands during the quarter.","For the third year in a row, IPG was named the Most Creatively Effective Holding Company at the North American Effie Awards. This award recognized all forms of marketing that contribute to a brand's success and IPG had 15 agencies among the top winners across all marketing disciplines. At the Cannes Festival of Creativity, we had a particularly impressive performance.","IPG agencies took home 11 of the festival's highest honor the Grand Prix. This is more than all other global holding companies and consultants combined. Grand Prix won by our agencies were in categories, including brand experience, industry craft, health and wellness, creative data, innovation, mobile and others. These Grand Prixs were won by a variety of our agencies across many clients, again, showcasing the breadth and strength of our agency brands.","In addition, our agencies won more Gold Lions, the festival's next highest honor than any other holding company. Notably in terms of awards per dollar of revenue, IPG topped the rankings among holding companies at the festival. While there, we hosted our Ninth Annual Women's Breakfast. Partnering with the United Nations, we attracted a standing-room-only crowd and featured top marketers from Adobe, Levi Strauss, Mars, Microsoft and Unilever to examine advertising's influence and impact on societal inequalities.","As we've noted on these calls, the future of our industry rests on the ability to combine transformative data capabilities with creativity. IPG's performance throughout the year coupled with adding Acxiom to our existing tools and expertise enables us to provide clients with the industry's most forward-looking and creative marketing solutions. Clients continue to believe in the power of the idea and look to us as their most valued partner to use creativity to drive business results.","We've been able to perform at this level, thanks to our investment in vibrant and differentiated agency brands. In our Integrated Agency Network or IAN reporting segment, which now includes Acxiom as well as our other global networks. Mediabrands, again, led growth in the quarter, posting a very strong performance.","UM was awarded its first-ever Grand Prix for 5B, a documentary created specifically for Johnson & Johnson that chronicles the work done by nurses during the 1980s in one of the country's first HIV hospital wards. This marked the first time that a media agency won the Grand Prix in the entertainment category.","In addition, UM kicked off the third quarter by winning the Mattel business across Europe, the Middle East and Africa and Asia Pac. Initiative picked up a number of new business wins including high-growth TikTok in the U.S.; and in APAC Carnival and Groupon's APAC and EMEA media account. The agency also took home a number of top honors at Cannes, including sharing the Grand Prix with FCB in Canada.","FCB posted very strong performance, especially in its health care operations. Area 23 part of FCB Health, won a Grand Prix this year for a highly innovative connected wellness device. The New York office won three Grand Prixs as well. Recently the network named a new CEO of Canada and New York as well as a new President in New York.","McCann Worldgroup saw continued growth in the quarter driven by increases with existing clients. On the new business front, they added ADT among others. In addition, McCann continues to see very high levels of industry recognition. Following their Effie Index recognition as the Most Creatively Effective Network in the World for the second year in a row, the network continued its momentum by being named Network of the Year at Cannes. McCann Health was also named Healthcare Network of the Year and McCann Health China named Healthcare Agency of the Year.","MullenLowe Group had a strong quarter on several fronts. The network had a number of new business wins including Mediahub adding Fox Sports and Fox Entertainment at the end of the first quarter, and more recently the home automation company ecobee.","The media arm also promoted a leading digital innovator to U.S. President and added a number of senior leaders all as a result of new business growth. You'll note, our three global creative networks McCann, FCB and MullenLowe continue to perform well, which demonstrates the value of our strategy to invest in our brands and the embedded digital services that are a hallmark of our offerings.","As noted, Acxiom is also doing very well. All of the strategic reasons to bring Acxiom into our company have only accelerated since the acquisition, giving us an unrivaled industry position in data management capability. This allows us to help marketers get the best out of all their data assets, driving better and more efficient one-to-one connections with consumers at scale.","We are pleased with how integration is progressing. Performance is in line with our expectations and results continue to be accretive to IPG. We see opportunity to bring new innovative products and services to market, as well as the upside of continuing to grow their existing data management business.","This quarter Acxiom continued expanding its global data offerings, most recently in Japan, Australia, Spain and Canada. The company also expanded its relationship with a major auto distributor in the U.S., with respect to managing its customer data and entered a new multi-year engagement with a financial technology and marketing client, looking to expand audience measurement and reporting capabilities. We continue to be impressed with the team and business. Acxiom has a rich and promising pipeline of opportunities.","Brooklyn based Huge partnered with Amazon during the quarter to create the Earth Challenge 2020 initiative. Together with the Earth Day Network, they designed tech solutions to help citizens solve key environmental challenges facing humanity in the 21st century.","Also in the quarter, Pantone selected the agency to handle global earned-first campaigns and the Toronto office won the Sinai Health business. Highlights at R\/GA in the quarter included growth with their existing clients, plus the partnership between the agency Venture Studio with Kinship, the newly launched innovation arm of Mars Petcare.","Together they created the Innovation Exchange the start-up of academy and mentored eight purpose-led female-founded companies from Pakistan, Kenya, Brazil, Uganda and the U.S. On the new business front, R\/GA was recently selected by GameStop to redesign their cultural gaming experience.","Our U.S. integrated independent agencies continue to round out our portfolio. They deliver the full suite of marketing services to their clients and can also combine with the best of the IPG offering on our collaborative open architecture solutions.","Highlights with this group -- within this group come from the marketing agency, which continues to expand its culture department and recently welcomed it's first-ever talent engagement and inclusion specialist and onboarded new clients CarMax and Buffalo Wild Wings.","At CMG, we're also seeing positive developments. As you saw last week, IPG announced new leadership at CMG and Weber Shandwick, promoting from within our ranks. This leadership team has worked together to keep Weber Shandwick at the forefront of contemporary brand-building during a transformative era of marketing and communications. We're pleased to have them move into these new roles.","As we previously called out, Weber Shandwick and Golin are among the most highly awarded PR agencies in the business. Weber Shandwick received a number of accolades this quarter. The agency was the most awarded at the 2019 North American SABRE Awards and the agency's recently named CEO received Global Professional of the Year at the PR Week Global Awards shortly after she was named Agency Professional of the Year at the PRWeek U.S. Awards last quarter. With her added CEO title, IPG has one of the highest-ranking women leaders in the PR space, a point we take particular pride in.","Golin had an exciting quarter. PRWeek recently named the agency Global Agency of the Year. On the new business front, Golin had a number of wins including Porsche in Asia-Pac, AIA in Hong Kong and IT service management company Verra Mobility. In total, we are happy that through the first half of the year, we continued to perform at the top end of the industry.","It shows that our investment in people and in a modern data-fueled offering is succeeding and that our focus on the client-centric open architecture model is the right formula. We are pleased with our results and we continue to feel confident in our long-term plans and prospects. As always, we remain committed to strong financials and significant reduction in debt over the next few years, as well as continuing to grow our dividend. We also expect to return to share repurchases after a period of time.","Turning to our outlook, we're confident that our performance to-date has us on track to deliver growth at the high end of our 2% to 3% organic growth range. In addition, we continue to be comfortable with our target for adjusted EBITA margin expansion of 40 to 50 basis points over last year's 13.5%. We view our current performance and long-term strategy as significant factors that will continue to enhance shareholder value.","Now, let's open it up -- the call to your questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Alexia Quadrani, your line is open, from JPMorgan.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you so much. Michael, thank you for your color on the U.S. business. I think you mentioned about a 3.8% headwind from losses.","Michael Roth","Right.","Alexia Quadrani","Can you give us a sense of how that trends for the remainder of the year? Does it get worse before it gets better? Or should we assume a similar run rate in the second half? And I know you had some notable wins earlier this year. Does that become an offset at some point?","Michael Roth","Yes. Thank you, Alexia. Well, as I indicated, we're net new business positive through the quarter, through the first half on both U.S. and worldwide. Unfortunately, the headwinds get a little worse in the second half of the year and, frankly, runs a little bit into the first quarter of next year.","But what's important to note here is that, despite these headwinds, when we say we are comfortable with our 2% to 3% organic growth, that's net of the headwinds. So if you -- here I go. If it wasn't for the losses, we would continue to have extremely high organic growth. Unfortunately, we have those losses. But the fact that we're overcoming those losses with net new business wins is indicative of the strength of our offerings and frankly the economic tone that's out there.","Alexia Quadrani","And then, just a follow-up. You continue to outperform a lot of your peers in Europe, Continental Europe, especially. So I think Germany was an area that you highlighted being really good -- really strong half year performance. I guess, can you give us any color, if you think that's mostly share gains? Are you seeing underlying growth in the market? And, I guess, any more color on that would be great.","Michael Roth","Yes. Well, frankly, it's reflective of some new business wins, notably McCann and its Opel win in Germany in Continental Europe. So that's reflected. Again, the size of our businesses in those markets are 8% to 9%, so the wins and losses have a dramatic impact on growth.","We'll take it though that we were net positive and we've been net positive over the last couple of quarters. So I think it's indicative of the competitiveness of our offerings, particularly in McCann in this case, as well as Mediabrands. And we continue to believe there's strength in those markets.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you very much.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Alexia.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Nollen of Macquarie. Your line is open.","Tim Nollen","Hi. Thanks. One other geographic region I'd like to ask about is China. You're not the first to mention that China was negative in the quarter. I wonder if you could elaborate a bit on why that is. I know it's not been the strongest area for some time, but if you could just let or give us a sense of what's going on there? And then another comparison in terms of sector, you highlighted consumer goods as being a strong sector for you amongst many other sectors pretty broad-based growth I guess. Again, peers of yours have talked about attrition and declines in fees and in ad spending. Does this come down to the work you do? Does it come down to the client that you have? I wonder if you could help us understand why you're talking about good consumer growth and others are not? Thanks.","Michael Roth","Yes, it's all of the above. Again, consumer goods is 8% of our business. So there again the notion of we had good client wins in consumer goods with respect to the markets in those environments. We had a little bit of cutback in some of our consumer goods businesses, but it was overtaken by the growth of our new business wins. So that accounts for the strength on consumer goods. I said this before what we're seeing is we're not raising a flag and saying all the consumer goods are back again. I think the entire industry is going to face challenges as the consumer did -- particularly in packaged goods continue to focus on margin and cutbacks.","With respect to our largest CPG clients, we believe we've seen a leveling off of that spend and our goal is to grab more brands if you will from those companies. And if you couple that with the wins that we have in those markets that reflects the strength that we have in consumer goods. I might add that growth is good in both the U.S. and worldwide given where our new business wins fall out. I think there's no question in China that we're starting to see the impact of the economy there. The good news for us that the losses in China are being offset by growth in India, Japan and Singapore. But we don't see a big recovery in China on the horizon. Again, it's not our largest market. We're there to service our multinationals. We continue to invest in China in terms of our people and our brands, but I believe we don't see a big turnaround in that environment anytime soon.","Tim Nollen","Okay. Can I ask a quick follow-up on the consumer goods response?","Michael Roth","Sure.","Tim Nollen","Again, thanks for the explanation there, Michael. I just wonder what is it that you're doing that might be a little different from others? You mentioned your open architecture a couple of times in your remarks. Or is it something with the data you can provide with Acxiom? Maybe it's not a consumer goods question. Just what are you doing that's helping you do better than your peers?","Michael Roth","Well I said this before other than we're just better than they are. I'll take the liberty of saying that. Our open architecture is really a key. And when we -- I've attended a number of the top to tops, particularly in Europe. And I'm sitting in a room and we have FCB. We have McCann. We have Weber Shandwick. We have Acxiom. We have RGA all sitting in the table servicing an existing client. That's a pretty powerful group to have in a room. And when I sit in that room and I look at the leadership of our clients and I say look this is the new go-to-market strategy of IPG.","You're entitled to the best IPG has to offer. You see it coming to light in the room. You probably don't even know which agencies the people who are sitting in this room are from. It's a total collaborative client-centric offering that our sole purpose is to help you move your needle and all the old silo issues that are present in our industry are our problem not yours. And it resonates with clients. I mean -- and in fact, one of our biggest clients actually called their model open architecture, which I got a kick out of.","Of course, I didn't complain to them using our terminology. But it's the wave of the future. And you put Acxiom in that group, you have a very powerful offering in terms of giving clients in one place all that they need to focus on targeting the right consumer, with great creative, with the CRM capabilities, with the expertise in particular in this case health care which we have the best in the business in terms of those offerings.","So I firmly believe -- we launched open architecture early in the stages of our new management team and it really resonates in the marketplace. And I think that's the right way to protect your brands, because they look to our brands as those are the people that are working on their engagement, but they include IPG as a brand. And it's up to us to make sure that our -- the collaboration of all our agencies are working the way they should. And I'll tell you something else. When it doesn't go well, I get the e-mail and says by the way we're having some problems here. Can you make sure you put the teams together and make sure they respond? And that's the way it's supposed to work and it really resonates well with our clients.","Tim Nollen","Sounds great. Thanks.","Michael Roth","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne. Your line is open.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you, good morning. Two questions, one on margins, one on Acxiom. Michael you had a very strong first half in terms of margin expansion and I'm sure you don't want to call the second half or the full year conservative. I'm just wondering if you could talk about the margin outlook for the year, because you're certainly pacing nicely ahead of the 40 to 50. I know you've taken some restructuring activities. You've got the account headwinds. But anything else you'd want to call out on back half margin performance realizing that particularly the fourth quarter is a wildcard?","And then second, on Acxiom, there continues to be the sort of discussion in the market of sort of rent versus own on data. And I'm just wondering if you think that by buying Acxiom, you've made a decision to own or if that's sort of mischaracterization of the strategy. And any early examples of -- you talked about it being accretive to IPG. I know financially it is. But in terms of the strategic focus of the company and net new business, any early even anecdotal data points you'd like to throw at us about how that business is helping would be great?","Michael Roth","Yes. Thank you. Two great questions, Ben. Let me focus on Acxiom. I think it's a mischaracterization of why we bought Acxiom, okay? We continue to say and if you listen to my prepared remarks, Acxiom its core competency is data management, first-party data management. And that's not a question of buying or renting. That's a strong core business that Acxiom has. And you see the new business wins at Acxiom relate to the first-party data management. So that's where we're seeing the growth.","We haven't yet introduced the new products that we talked about in terms of the synergy opportunities on revenue using Mediabrands coupled with the Acxiom capability. So I think when people talk about us buying Acxiom and whether there's conflicts or rent or buy, they're totally misunderstanding the core competency of Acxiom.","When you think of privacy when you think of first-party data management as they're cleansing and organizing data to reach the right consumer that's what Acxiom does. They have one-third of their business is using 22,000 sources so maybe two billon individuals in third-party data management.","But our clients don't have to use that. They have choices in terms of who they work with, with respect to that. It just so happens a number of them use that. But that's one-third of the business. The core competency of Acxiom is being able to target and cleanse and really work with the data that clients have within their own company and the opportunities there are significant.","And what's great about those companies are the long-standing relationship we have with those clients. I mean we're part of their business. So the retention on those businesses, the ability to grow with our clients it really is the key to this. And they are recognized. They're the top-rated from Forrester in terms of the quality and transparency and safety of their offerings. I mean that's a compelling story. So it's not that we bought data and that we're selling data. The core competencies are much bigger than that and that's where we see the opportunities.","In terms of margin, when you have those kinds of headwinds, a number of those clients carry some good margins in with it. So at this point, I'm not going to comment on any upside on the margins. Our goal is the 40 to 50 basis points. We believe we can achieve that and that's what -- and then frankly if you -- if we achieve that or when we achieve that, I think it's another example of how we continue to focus both on top line and cost containment and that's what our goals are.","And if you look at the history of our performance over the last 20 quarters I think you've seen a pretty impressive organic growth and margin expansion, which is what we say we're going to accomplish.","Ben Swinburne","Make sense. Thank you.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Ben.","Operator","Thank you. Dan Salmon of BMO. Your line is open.","Dan Salmon","Hey, good morning everyone. Michael, can I just return back to the guidance? As you noted before, we don't want to get too bogged down in the losses, which were well known before this. And just if we can return basically to the commentary that being more comfortable at the higher end of your organic revenue growth guidance.","Maybe just -- what leads you to that sort of confidence? I know there's always a number of variables that can be in there current clients spending more net new business account record, back door has been nicely closed and we're moving along through the year and you've got more cushion on losses. Are there may be it macro are there one or two things in there that give you that confidence to get towards the -- have that commentary there about being towards the higher end of it?","And then just on Acxiom, I know that working with Mediabrands has been the immediate focus out of the box and sounds like that continues to be the focus. But I know we're not quite to the one-year anniversary yet but any hints on where you can see those capabilities flowing to most effectively beyond Mediabrands within the holding company?","Michael Roth","Sure. Yeah, let me -- we don't make up the numbers. I always tell the team I don't want them to strike, so let's work from the bottom up. We just got through with most of our operating reviews and we really have our units come in and present from the bottoms-up.","We see where the opportunities are. We see where the agency of record fees are coming from, where they see their pipeline. So this number is a number that's developed based on our reviews with each of our business units. And each of the CEOs of the business units sit and talk about the tone of the business. And frankly we go over the good, the bad, the ugly of their pipelines and their existing clients including the health of their clients.","And when we look at the health of their clients, we look at how much of open architecture are they really utilizing, because the more you have an open architecture and collaborative base, the stickier their clients are right? So that's how we do a health test. So when you put all that together, we do a forecast by agency. We do an overlay from corporate and that's where we get the number.","And I know in the past and due -- by the half year we've upped our guidance considerably in the past couple of years. Frankly I was telling -- including the team that in a way we upped our guidance by saying we're in the high end of the range because that's a real number.","And as I answered one of the questions before for the rest of the year the headwinds get a little more difficult. So in order to overcome the more difficult headwinds, we actually have additional client spend.","Let's not lose sight of the fact that our existing client base is the key source of our growth, so the health of our businesses how we're using all the resources within IPG to bring to bear with respect to those clients. So all of that goes into the mix and then we just make up a number and put it up. But that's where it comes from.","On Acxiom, you're correct. I mean, we said that the first wave of integration with IPG was going to be on Mediabrands and that's what we've been focusing on. But in our business plan, we indicated these at the latter part of this year and certainly next year, we're going to be bringing new products to bear, utilizing for example Cadreon and Acxiom and all the data capabilities that we have within Mediabrands as well as Acxiom with respect to new products.","We've already started introducing Acxiom to all of our creative capabilities and all of our agencies, both with respect to their own data analytics capabilities and how they can leverage Acxiom with respect to their own capabilities and more importantly how they can introduce Acxiom to their existing clients and how Acxiom candidly can introduce IPG assets to their existing clients. So we're in the process.","But the one thing I said for this year is, we didn't want to rush out and force everything on everybody because I know a lot of comments are out there that the most difficult thing about these transactions are the ability to integrate. And it was imperative.","Our commitment to our Board was that we were going to integrate these businesses on a smooth basis without breaking an asset that we paid significant dollars for, but we very much view it as the future and transformative asset within IPG. So, we didn't want to rush into it. We're very happy with the integration. We're not having any problems with respect to integration. And I think, frankly next year, it's going to be pretty exciting to see the stuff that's going to come out of this.","Dan Salmon","Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks Michael.","Michael Roth","Thank you, my pleasure.","Operator","Thank you. Adrien de Saint Hilaire of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Adrien de Saint Hilaire","Yes, good morning everyone and thank you very much for taking the questions. I've got three of them please. So, first of all Michael, I'm under the impression that the impact of account losses are bigger than we expected and this is despite the U.S. Army being still -- still being handled by McCann. So, can you just explain what we've missed?","Secondly, back to the margin question. Can you give us a bit more details on what would be margins in the first half excluding the first-time contribution of Acxiom? And then thirdly a bit of a bigger question, there are a number of companies, McDonald's this morning is another one where the CMO title is being eliminated or changed. Just wondering how this is impacting your day-to-day operations and relationships with clients. Thank you very much.","Michael Roth","Okay. Three questions. Let me take your margin question. We don't break out business units and give out margins on that. So, when we give you a number on margin 40 to 50 basis points, it's inclusive of all of our businesses and that's how we manage our businesses. So, I know your question, but we're not -- we just don't disclose that information.","You didn't miss anything on the losses. We didn't -- first of all, there was another client in there that you didn't mention. It was FCA Media which frankly was the bigger of the three. And again, when we started the year, we started the year and we put out as a guidance 2% to 3%. That number reflect. We knew we had these losses going into the year. So, when we forecast the timing of these losses and the magnitude of those losses, it's already reflected in the 2% to 3%. So, maybe some analysts may have missed that number, we didn't.","So far it's exactly where we thought it was going to be. And it -- and by the way McCann is no longer doing business for the Army. So, that's why we're saying in the second half of the year that number gets a little bit harder. But the good news is, as one of the other questions were, we hope the back door is close right now and now we just see opportunities in our pipeline.","The question of the CMO, it's kind of interesting. Business is going waves in terms of centralized versus local. That's why, if you look at our global networks, McCann, FCB, MullenLowe, the distribution, the capabilities on a global basis are very relevant to what global clients are looking for because, if they're going to be using a less centralized basis, you need local presence in the markets that they want to compete in and we have to be in a position to offer the talent to help navigate through the various local markets. So that's what you get when you get -- you come to an IPG and that is the ability to reach all the markets when local markets are important.","And so far we haven't seen any big impact yet on the changes of the structures from centralized to decentralize. But candidly, it pays -- it plays to our strength when they do that. Of course, now you really need a third-party arbiter to help them navigate through either the media side of the business, the local customs of the business and focusing on a centralized business plan and help our clients move the needle.","So, I think the changes our clients are seeing are focusing on the efficiencies that they need in their local markets. And that's frankly what IPG can offer that many of our competitors, not the consultants and so on. They don't have that kind of capability, particularly from a creative point of view. What's creative for example in Latin America is different than what's creative in Europe. And you have to have that kind of capability and expertise that we through our global networks offer.","Adrien de Saint Hilaire","Thank you, very much. If I could just sneak in one quick follow-up, the U.K. has been a very strong area for all agencies in the latest quarter and in recent years. How sustainable is this given the macro uncertainty and the volatility in politics?","Michael Roth","Yes. I'd say it's a good question. We haven't yet seen a big impact and maybe because the financial services in the U.K. are not quite over-weighted for us. And so, we're seeing PR. We're seeing media. We're seeing creative capabilities continue to be strong in the U.K. So -- but all bets are off depending on how the new leadership handles this Brexit and what impact it has. But so far, we have not seen it. And again, it's 9% of our business. So, on the good side, we're doing very well. On the hedge on the downside is its 9% of our business. So, I -- yes, it's all baked into our numbers.","Adrien de Saint Hilaire","Okay. Thank you, very much indeed.","Michael Roth","My pleasure.","Operator","Thank you. David Joyce of Evercore. Your line is open.","David Joyce","Thank you. From where you sit at Acxiom, how do you see targeted advertising developing from here? Are there too many disparate platforms? Or do you see the strategies and technologies perhaps aligning well enough to accelerate targeted advertising going forward? And with that view when and I guess, if you could quantify in some form would that targeted advertising drive incremental spending? And does this open opportunity work with smaller marketers? Thank you.","Michael Roth","Yes. Look I think targeted marketing is the whole purpose of the whole acquisition of Acxiom. Think of the power: instead of just buying audiences, we can buy specific consumers and their likes and dislikes. And in order to be able to do that you have to have the capability and the insights and through first-party data management is how you do that.","By the way, let me just comment that someone has indicated that we're selling that first-party data. That first-party data is first-party data to our clients. What we're talking about is helping clients who have that first-party data maximize the efficiency of that data and use potential other resources to enhance those capabilities.","So that's what we're doing. And yes, I think clients are amenable to us putting forward a value proposition that shows how we can target specific individuals and particularly on the digital side of the business which is why you're seeing a continuation of digital spend to reach those consumers.","So, I view that all as an opportunity for us because of the Acxiom capabilities, but also because we have the creative capabilities to create that messaging that's relevant to that consumer and putting the two together is a pretty powerful voice.","So I see that as growing and I see it continuing. And I think it also -- it adds to the value of our proposition in working with our clients. And frankly that's one of the key reasons we bought Acxiom.","David Joyce","And from the technology and platform perspective is it still are there too many players at this point? Is it too confusing for marketers? Or are things starting to align?","Michael Roth","Well, I always say confusion is good for us because if clients are confused they need someone to figure it out and that's what we do. We -- our strength is in our ability to work with different technologies, all right and cleanse it and put them all together. I mean that's exactly what clients are looking for, the better mousetrap out there and it is confusing. And we have expertise that helps clients solve that. So it plays right into our strength.","That's why I think the notion of putting data management creativity digital PR all together in a room focusing on what clients need, I mean that's the holy grail of our business.","And we built IPG based on that premise. Creativity, talent, tools all helping our clients move the needle. And where we sit right now there isn't an offering out there that we don't have best-in-class capabilities. And frankly, I believe that's why we will continue to outperform because we put together the best talents in the business with the best tools and that's what clients are looking.","David Joyce","Great, thank you.","Jerry Leshne","Operator?","Operator","Yes sir?","Jerry Leshne","We've come to the bottom of the hour. That was our final question. Back to Michael for any closing thoughts.","Michael Roth","Yes. Again we're excited about the opportunities. We had a little hiccup in terms of some of those headwinds, but we're working hard to overcome that. And I look forward to our next call. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time."],"11776":["The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.

All parties are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion. (Operator Instructions). This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jerome Leshne","Good morning. Thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com, and we\u2019ll refer to both in the course of this call. ","This morning we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks, to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 a.m. Eastern.","During this call we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company. These are subject to uncertainties and the cautionary statement that are included in our earnings release and the slide presentation and further details in our 10-K and other filings with the SEC. ","We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful, supplemental data, that while not a substitute for GAAP measures, allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance.","At this point it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Jerry, and thank you all for joining us this morning, as we review our results for the second quarter and first half of 2014. I'll start out by covering highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide the additional details and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies and the tone of the business to be followed by a Q&A.","We're pleased to report a quarter of strong revenue and profit growth. Revenue increased 5.4% compared to Q2 a year ago. Net acquisitions had a positive 1.2% impact, while FX was a negative 0.5%. Organic revenue growth in the second quarter was therefore 4.7%, driven by increases in most world regions and across client sectors and disciplines.","Operating profit in the quarter grew 12% to $196 million, and our operating margin expanded 60 basis points to 10.6%. Diluted EPS was $0.23, an increase of 28% and includes a non-operating charge of $0.02 per share for the early redemption of our debt. Looking at the first half of the year, organic growth was 5.6% and operating margin increased 130 basis points.","Turning to additional color on the second quarter, our growth included increases across a broad range of client sectors; that includes retail, healthcare, financial services, automotive and food and beverage. In the U.S. organic growth was 2.9% in Q2 or 3.5% excluding pass through revenues, led by our digital specialists, Mediabrands, McCann and CMG.","International continued to be strong with 7.1% organic growth in Q2. The increases were solid in all major regions with the exception of Continental Europe. Organic growth was 16.4% in the U.K., 7.4% in LatAm, 4.4% in AsiaPac and 18% in our group of other markets. Continental Europe decreased 1.4% organically. International growth was notably strong in digital, media and marketing services.","For the first half of the year, the 5.6% organic growth reflected positive contributions from advertising, digital, marketing services and media, as well as all regions of the world. Our margin growth of 130 basis points for the first half of the year was driven by an equal contribution of operating leverage on both our salaries and related and office and general expenses. ","As we\u2019ve said previously, in addition to revenue growth, cost discipline and margin enhancement are a top priority for this year and we\u2019re executing against that objective. In the second quarter our capital structure and financial strength continue to be a source of value creation. We had a sharp reduction of interest expense compared to a year ago, which was due to our debt refinancing activities.","With respect to share repurchase, during Q2 we used $52 million to repurchase 3 million shares, while over the trailing 12 months we have utilized approximately $400 million for share repurchases. We have $321 million remaining on our authorization at the end of the quarter.","In sum, we are encouraged that performance in the quarter and the half underscores the competitiveness of our agencies and the quality of our offerings in key growth markets and disciplines. The overall tone of business remains solid and we are effectively managing expenses. We therefore believe that we are well positioned to exceed our organic growth target of 3% to 4% and improve operating margin by at least 100 basis points to 10.3% or better.","At this stage I\u2019ll turn things over to Frank for addition detail on our results and I\u2019ll join you after his remarks for an update on our operating units, to be followed by our Q&A.","Frank Mergenthaler","Thank you, Michael. Good morning. As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast.","On slide two, you'll see an overview of results, a number of which Michael has touch on. Organic growth was 4.7% in the second quarter, with international up 7.1% and U.S. up 2.9%. Operating profit was $196 million, an increase of 12% in Q2. Operating profit grew 39% in the first half of the year.","Q2 margin was 10.6%, an improvement of 60 basis points compared with last year\u2019s Q2. The combined impact of a stronger dollar where we are more profitable and a weaker dollar in less profitable markets resulted in a translation headwind of 40 basis points to margins. ","Diluted EPS of $0.23 includes a charge of $0.02 per share and the early redemption of our $350 million, 6.25 notes, the charge is another expense below operations. Q2 average fully diluted shares decreased 4.5% from last year due to our share repurchase program. ","Turning to slide three, you\u2019ll see our P&L for the quarter. I\u2019ll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. Here it\u2019s worth noting that interest expense decreased to $23 million from $38 million a year ago. You\u2019ll recall that in Q2, 2013 we carried a temporarily higher debt balance, having issued new debt ahead of debt redemptions later in 2013. The comparison also reflects a lower run-rate interest expense this year.","Turning to revenue on slide four, revenue was $1.85 billion in the quarter, an increase of 5.4%. Compared to Q2 \u201813, the impact of the change in exchange rates was a negative 50 basis points, while net acquisitions added 120 basis points. The resulting organic revenue increase was 4.7%. Excluding pass through organic growth would be 4.9%.","As you can see on the bottom half of this slide, we had solid growth in both our reported segments. At our integrated agency networks, the organic increase was 4%, led by our digital specialist and media business, with increases in both the U.S. and international markets. At CMG organic growth was 7.9%, led by continued outstanding performance in our PR agencies and growth and sports marketing.","Moving on to slide five, revenue by region, in the U.S. Q2 organic growth was 2.9% and was 3.5% excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenues in our direct marketing and events businesses. Our top client sectors were healthcare and auto. We were led in the U.S. by Mediabrands, digital agencies, Huge, R\/GA, McCann and CMG. ","Turning to international markets, we had strong U.K. performance with 16.4% organic growth. Growth was approximately 13% excluding the increase of pass-through revenues at our events business. We were led by sector increases in food and beverage, consumer goods and retail. We have significant growth across all agencies with the most significant increases at our marketing services specialists, Mediabrands, McCann and Lowe.","It\u2019s worth noting that total growth in the U.K. was 33%, which includes about 10% from the stronger sterling. It also includes 7% from our acquisitions in the region, notably from FCB Inferno and Lowe Profero.","Continental Europe decreased 1.4% organically. We had solid growth in Germany and Spain, but that was more than offset by decreases in other markets, notably France and Italy. In AsiaPac, our largest international region, Q2 organic growth was 4.4%. Excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenue due to events last year that did not repeat, organic growth was a little over 6%. We were led by double digit growth in China and strength in Mediabrands, R\/GA and Lowe. ","In LatAm organic growth was 7.4%, which is on top of 16% a year ago. We had growth across all agencies led by Lowe and our marketing services specialist. We have solid growth in Brazil and double digit increase in several other markets. ","As you can see on this slide, revenue as reported decreased in the region, which is due to sharply weaker local currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. In our other markets group, which is made up of Canada, the Middle East and Africa, we had 18% organic growth, which was due to strong increases in the Middle East and Canada.","On slide six, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 4.4%. ","Moving on to slide seven, operating expenses. In the second quarter total operating expenses increased to 4.7% compared with our reported revenue growth of 5.4%. Our Q2 ratio salaries and related expense to revenue was 63.2% this year, compared to 63.8% a year ago, an improvement of 60 basis points. Underneath that our expense for base salaries benefits and tax was 53.6% of revenue, compared to 53.5% a year ago. However, this is where we saw most of the currency headwind to margin compared to a year ago.","While FX decreased our revenue by 50 basis points compared to Q2, 2013, it created a small increase in our expense for base payable benefits and tax. The results in reported terms was 30 basis points of margin pressure.","Moving on, expense for temporary labor was 3.7% of revenue, compared with 3.6% a year ago. Incentive expense was 2.7% of revenue. Severance expense improved 40 basis points. All other salaries and related expense was 2.3% of revenue compared with 2.6% a year ago.","Total headcount at quarter end was approximately 46,500. That is a net increase of approximately 500 from March 31, about 40% of which was due to acquisitions during the quarter. The balance of the increase was in higher growth areas of the portfolio such as digital and PR, as well as in growth regions around the world. ","Turning to office and general expenses on the lower half of the slide, O&G expense was 26.2% of Q2 revenue, an improvement of 10 basis points from a year ago. Within our O&G categories, compared to last year we had a 30 basis points of operating leverage and occupancy expense, 20 basis points on telecom, office supplies and travel, and 10 basis points on professional fees.","Going the other way, we delevered 50 basis points on other office and general expense. That reflects increased expense in several categories, primarily related to changes in our acquisition earn-outs.","On slide eight, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point was 9.7%, which excludes the restructuring expense in Q4 \u201813.","Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on slide nine, we ended the second quarter with $901 million in cash and short-term marketable securities. The comparison to December 31 reflects that our cash level is seasonal and tends to peak at year-end. June 30 last year includes $630 million of cash that we had raised and subsequently used for debt redemption in Q3, 2013. ","On slide 10 we turn to our second quarter cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $169 million, compared with $184 million a year ago. Working capital was within the normal range for Q2, a use of $24 million this year compared with a positive $17 million in Q2, 2013. ","Investing activities used $52 million for acquisitions and CapEx. Financing activities generated $2 million, which reflects the issuance of new debt, offset by debt redemption, share repurchases and dividends, as well as lower bank borrowings. Our net increase in cash and marketable securities for the quarter was $125 million, compared with a $32 million decrease a year ago.","On slide 11, we show debt deleveraging from a peak of $2.35 billion in 2007 to $1.76 billion at the most recent quarter end. Note that in Q2 we issued 500 million of new 10 year notes at 4.2% and redeemed our 6.25%, $350 million notes.","In summary, on slide 12, the quarter and the first half represents solid results and good progress towards our financial objectives for the full year. We are seeing solid growth in areas where we have focused our investment in both, people and acquisitions, that is to say high growth regions, as well as the digital marketing service disciplines.","Our operators are focused on the appropriate cost disciplines and margin expansion and our balance sheet is an important area that we\u2019ll continue to deploy for value going forward.","With that said, let me turn it back to Michael.","Michael Roth ","Thank you, Frank. Well, we are pleased that the second quarter featured solid performance, with competitive organic revenue growth and continued focus on cost discipline to drive margin enhancement. The tone of the business is good and conversations with clients point to a continued commitment on their part to invest behind their brands, with a particular focus on efficiencies and effectiveness.","Overall our new business pipeline is sound. We are seeing quite a bit of activity in digital, marketing services and when it comes to clients looking for integrated solutions that combine the offerings of multiple agencies. This is increasingly important in order to reach and motivate consumers in a very complex media and marketing landscape.","Obviously our win on Microsoft is a strong proof point that when we tap into the right talent from across the group we can be successful in addressing the needs of even the most sophisticated global clients.","Turning now to an update on our companies, we continue to see very strong performance at CMG, driven by Weber Shandwick, Golin and DeVries in public relations, as well as Octagon in sports marketing. ","While our digital offerings in the marketing services space have already leading edge, we are pleased to have completed two significant acquisitions during the quarter. Time is a highly created digital agency that will further enhance Weber Shandwick\u2019s social practice throughout Europe. ","Genuine Interactive will be a key drive in elevating the digital agenda across Jack Morton\u2019s global network. McCann once again posted good results. The agency prevailed in the highly competitive CIGNA pitch and added business from a leading multinational client in (Inaudible), as well as winning major local assignments in Europe and Asia. The industry and the market place have taken notice that McCann is viewed as the strong competitive force. We are therefore seeing a great deal of interest from senior talent in joining a power house that is building strong, positive momentum in the market place. ","Performance at Mediabrands remain strong in the quarter. As you know we introduced the new media model some years ago that has taken our offering upstream into more strategic engagements and significantly more activity in the digital content creation and programmatic arena. ","The tech side of media is evolving rapidly. We\u2019ve demonstrated the ability to stay ahead of those developments in recent years and continue to believe we will thrive in this new environment. Our unique cluster approach to regional management has also lead to significantly enhanced collaboration and better work. ","UM and Initiative remain strong global network players and we will be looking to them to build on recent wins such as Heinz Global Inc and Warner Bros in Latin American. ","SCB continues to makes progress in its transformation. The agency just posted its best ever performance in Canada, which is important in light of its stated goal of building a creative idea culture. This included a grand prix in the mobile category for the [buyer stores] (ph), the agency\u2019s largest global client. The recent BMW win in London is significant and demonstrates that the Inferno acquisition has helped SCB raise its game in the U.K. ","Performance in Brazil and India were the agency is among the market leaders remained strong. Top talent has also been successfully recruited in strategic planning roles at the global level in New York and Shanghai. Management is still accessing capabilities in some European markets, but overall we are seeing encouraging sign for the network. ","At Lowe emerging markets remain an area of strength, as does the high standard of the agency\u2019s creative product. As you know we are enthusiastic about the potential that Profero brings to Lowe\u2019s high value idea platforms into a new range of media channels. Lowe and Lowe CE have been very active with the pitch consultants and are being included in a number of regional opportunities. The agency\u2019s Lenovo win has the potential to grow into another important global client, along with Cadillac and of course Unilever. ","Our digital specialist agencies, all posted very strong performance in the quarter. RGA keeps getting stronger as a global agency and has developed a broad range of marketing and consulting capabilities. Huge is on the same growth plan, with multiple U.S. agencies and a London presence, as well as an outstanding performance year-to-date, and MRM is already among the leading global digital networks in our industry, and has been a key contributor to a number of our major IPG, open architecture wins in the past year. ","The number of our strong U.S. independent agencies such as Hill Holliday, Martin, Mullen and Deutsche are also increasingly participating in integrated cross agency efforts. Given the strength of the strategic creative and digital talent within those agencies, this could be another driver in meeting our overall IPG growth objectives. ","At the midpoint of the year we are pleased with our results and progress. Our portfolio of agencies is strong. We are winning share in digital and marketing services, successfully innovating with our media offerings and our global ad networks continue to trend positively. Our long standing strategy of embedding digital expertise within all of our agencies, while also investing organically behind our digital specialist is delivering excellent results. ","Our financial strength has been and will continue to be a source of significant value creation. We've been very successful in deleveraging, while returning approximately $1.8 billion to our shareholders over the past three years.","We expect solid growth in the second half, though somewhat tempered relative to the first six month. We believe that we are well positioned to exceed our organic growth target of 3% to 4% for the year, and improve operating margin by at least 100 bases point to 10.3% or better. To do so, we must stay closely focused on execution and we\u2019ve been consistently clear that for us 2014 is all about execution. This means driving further competitive growth and staying focused on cost, so as to significantly improve margins. This will allow us to continue to build on recent performance and further enhance shareholder value. ","At this point, I\u2019d like to thank you for your continued support and open up the call for questions.","Questions-and-Answer Session ","","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMC. You may ask your question.","Alexia Quadrani - JP Morgan ","Thank you. You guys have done a great job in new business wins lately. Could you give us an update, I guess inclusive of some activity you\u2019ve seen in the most recent quarter of how we should expect the rest of the year to play out in terms of when the tailwinds and sort of headwinds may hit us.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Alexia. Well, what we said in the last call that we were sort of overweighed in terms the tailwind in the first half of the year and we expected that to level out in the second half of the year, and frankly, that\u2019s the way it\u2019s planning out. We just did our bottoms-up REs for the full year and frankly and that\u2019s why we are comfortable with our comment, which I know you\u2019ve already picked up, that we expect to exceed the 3% to 4% organic growth on the revenue side for the full year. ","But for the second half of the year I think it levels off, because we are starting to cycle through some of the client losses that we did suffer and offset that against the client wins in the second half of the year. ","But the important point here is that the tone of the business is very solid. I think the results that you\u2019re seeing, if you put aside the noise between the FX and the pass-through\u2019s, we have a solid performance across our region, as well as our agencies. As far as new business, there is one big global pitch out there and in that we have our media agencies, particularly BPN which is leveraging all the tools and resources within Mediabrands as well in that pitch. So, we are very comfortable with our offerings across the board, and I think our results that we\u2019re reporting today are indicative of a solid performance.","Alexia Quadrani - JP Morgan","And then when you look at Continental Europe, which remains volatile, I think industry wide, I guess do you think the underlying trends are just the right kind of volatility, its trending in the right direction. I mean, do think is there any sign of improvement in France. I guess what will it take to get France kind of back in kind of a flattish or positive territory.","Michael Roth","We\u2019re not counting of France to pull us out of a global economy rebound if you will. ","But what we said at the beginning of the year, we weren\u2019t expecting a great expansion in Continental Europe. The fact that we were positive in the first quarter, frankly the timing issue with respective to some of our existing clients and some client wins, the fact that we were negative in the second quarter. ","For the first half we are still slightly positive and what we said with respect to going into the year, we expect Continental Europe to be flat to slightly up and frankly that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. And I think with that kind of background, I think that\u2019s how we can be comfortable or poised to deliver on our promises and margin expansion. But we are ways off before there\u2019s a recovery in Continental Europe. ","Obviously Germany has been strong for us and frankly Italy had some good performance, but France continues to weigh on us and we are looking at the things in France to help bolster our offering, but again, it\u2019s not going to solve everybody\u2019s problems in terms of global economic recovery.","Alexia Quadrani - JP Morgan","All right, thank you very much,","Michael Roth","Thank you Alexia","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Janedis with Jefferies. You may ask your question. ","John Janedis \u2013 Jefferies"," ","Thanks, good morning. Frank it\u2019s good to see the continuation of the operating leverage in the SRS line. I know you spoke to the FX impact on base and benefits, but in the context of this year\u2019s margin target, can you talk about maybe the income rental headwinds from currency today relative to your initial target?","Frank Mergenthaler","Right now we think John that there\u2019s probably about 15 bips of margin pressure related to FX and that\u2019s not significantly off of what we anticipated coming into the years. So assuming rates stay the same, FX crosses stay the same, it shouldn\u2019t be an issue with respects to meeting our targets.","Michael Roth","Yes and let me add there, these FX headwind if you will, these are translational issues. They are not actually exposure in terms of currency, so it\u2019s all translational, which obviously we don\u2019t have much to do in terms of fixing.","John Janedis \u2013 Jefferies","Got it. Okay, and thanks Michael, and just over the last year we\u2019ve seen a lot of industries attempt to build scale or consolidate and I guess on a practical level, can you talk about any potential impact on your business from the proposed deal in the media space.","Michael Roth","What deal is that John? Look consolidation and scale has always been an issue in our industry in terms of media owners and obviously in terms of our own industry. We always say, we are positioned from a scale point of view to be competitive. ","Obviously with the fact that NBC Universal is such a power house in the media space, having one more big power house, frankly I think sort of balances out the strength of NBC Universal and I think in the long run from our perspective, it gives us additional leverage, which is what I think it does. But I think it\u2019s interesting to see. Content is important and obviously the players that are involved here have significant content that will drive future dollars with respect to the work that we do, to move the needed for our clients, so that\u2019s what we do.","So whatever it turns out to be, we will be responsive to what our clients\u2019 needs are and we\u2019ll respond to the market place, but I think it\u2019s totally consistent with what we\u2019ve been saying about the trends in our industry.","Content is important, media owners are consolidating their offerings for their clients, which gives them leverage against frankly the buyers of that space, and our job is to navigate through it. So I think in the long run it will be probably positive for us. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be negative and it\u2019s a question of how we negotiate on behalf of our clients, and it may be a little more difficult to negotiate, which frankly adds to our value, because that\u2019s what we do.","John Janedis \u2013 Jefferies","Thanks a lot. ","Michael Roth","Thanks John. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Bank with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets","Hey, thanks guys. Well, it looks like MAGNA has done some real kind of industry leadership here with the experiment what ACB on the programmatic side for these dot com properties. Can you talk about what this augers, sort of similar partnerships for other online extensions for the TV side of it. Do you feel like you\u2019re getting closer to the goal of moving linear TV on to the programmatic side as a product you guys offer or a tool. What you think is going on there?","Michael Roth","Well, when this all started we always commented that the last to be included in this was going to be premium content, because it\u2019s going to be hard for the media owners to throw that into the mix if you will, so that\u2019s what gives them all of their leverage. ","This experiment with ABC is an experiment. It\u2019s not large. I don\u2019t think we should be putting it out of proportion in terms of the amount of contents that\u2019s being put in that space, but it will be interesting to see and like all experiments if it proves to be successful, then we\u2019ll be seeing more of it. But I think the last to come into the fold is going to be premium content. And frankly, if I was a media owner, I would understand that, because once they let go of that and you lose some a significant amount of your leverage and frankly, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. ","But I do think ultimately this whole automation is moving forward and frankly we\u2019ve been leaders in that and the consortiums that we put together is indicative of the fact that collaboration in this space is really the way to do it, and I think we\u2019re showing that we have the ability to cross the different media owners and put together an offering for our clients that is competitive and realistic in the market place and in their best interest. ","So, I think it\u2019s certainly an area that we\u2019re going to continue to investment in, and I think it\u2019s going to be an area that\u2019s going to change dramatically as we go forward. And frankly, again, that\u2019s what we do. We\u2019re supposed to be part of a changing landscape and providing advice for our clients. So I think this will be interesting to unfold. Eventually it\u2019s going to be part of it, but we\u2019re not sure what form it will take.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, thank you very much.","Michael Roth","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research. You may ask your questions.","Brian Wieser - Pivotal Research","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. I was wondering, you noted that media was a source of growth. I was wondering if you could talk about the products and services beyond conventional planning and buying inside of media brands that are doing relatively better than others and whether it\u2019s like that Ensemble\u2019s or ID Media\u2019s or some other aspect of the product. ","I had a separate question, but then I\u2019ll just throw it now. I saw news from Australia about R\/GA getting an assignment, creating optimizing ads that are programmatically \u2013 I think it was Telstra. I\u2019m just wondering if you can characterize it, if you think of any opportunities or how big the opportunity is for the non-media agencies around programmatic trading.","Michael Roth","Well, everybody is trying to do their own program and trading as you know. One of our clients are doing their own, media owners are doing their own and obviously an agency like R\/GA. I think we\u2019re having a little bit of \u2013 Brian, I\u2019m not sure whether it\u2019s your connection, but I won\u2019t talk to you about that personally. ","Right look, what we\u2019re trying to do from a Mediabrands perspective is bring all the different disciplines within Mediabrand. That\u2019s why Mediabrand exists and that is basically to put together all the resources. So what you\u2019re seeing is ID Media, Ensemble. ","I think what we are doing in terms of Mediabrand publishing and content generation, these are all things that clients are looking for in order to reach the consumer in a modern way, and that\u2019s what we are excited about and that\u2019s where we\u2019re investing our dollars, and I do think if you just translate that into the big transactions that I just talked about, everyone is chasing content and how it\u2019s going to be able be a part of the story telling, that\u2019s what we do. ","So Mediabrands with its various disciplines in bringing them all together in that integrated offerings, we hope provides a competitive advantage, and that\u2019s exactly what the integrated offering is all about Brain. We are supposed to reach across all of IPG and bring in the best we have to meet the needs of our clients and the stuff you are seeing at MAGNA and Mediabrands publishing and Ensembles and Mobile. Obviously Mobile is a big part of this going forward and Search, all are coming together. So it\u2019s a pretty exciting time for us in this environment. ","Brian Wieser - Pivotal Research","Thank you very much. ","Michael Roth","Thank you Brian.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Nollen with Macquarie. You may ask your question.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","Hi, thanks. Hearing you positive commentary about the tone of the business and about client commitments is great. I just wanted to check on the Q2 organic revenues. Am I thinking too much about it seeing declines in most regions and I clearly understand Europe isn\u2019t fully back on its feet and France we know is weak, but were there any one-time items, timing issues, were there any timing of account wins or losses. Anything like that, that just might have brought those numbers down a bit and is that really nothing to worry about. ","Michael Roth","No. Look, our business, we can\u2019t time our clients on a quarterly basis to fit models and we are cycling through with it. We have client tailwinds in the first half of the year and as you cycle through them and you become part of the year-to-year comparison, then the organic growth is affected by that. The fact is we have the business. It\u2019s just a question of sequential growth following upon a strong quarter, which is what you\u2019ve seen. ","I did say, we did have some client losses. I did indicate there was a flow though in the second half of the year, offset by client wins, which is why I said the second half of the year will temper off in terms of the overall organic growth. But there is nothing dramatic happening in those numbers other than the timing of new business wins coming on-stream, the effect of some client losses and just comparisons from the year-to-year basis. ","And on the international side, when you have 16% growth in Latin America it\u2019s hard to kind of keep repeating that type of growth. So when you come back with a 7% growth on top of that, it\u2019s pretty strong performance. ","Frank Mergenthaler","Tim, six month growth is 5% plus. We are pretty please with that.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","Yes, and I don\u2019t think anyone should complain about 4.7% organic in Q2 either. So I just want to make sure about the items in Q2. ","Michael Roth","Its squeezing and comparisons.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","Fine, thanks very much.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Tim.","Frank Mergenthaler","You\u2019re welcome","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Bird with FBR. You may ask your question.","Bill Bird - FBR","Good Morning. I just have two questions. First, are there any puts and takes on margins that we should take into account in the second half. And then Frank, what are your thoughts on use of the balance sheet and adding leverage. Thank you.","Frank Mergenthaler","I\u2019m not sure Bill of puts or takes. One thing that does create volatility for us is around the continued liabilities earn outs. We can\u2019t control that. It\u2019s kind of an intellectually kind of weird accounting when you\u2019re acquisition is doing better and it hurts your current P&L, but that\u2019s a good thing. So that\u2019s a volatility that we can\u2019t really control. ","With respect to the balance sheet, we have $300 million plus left on our share buyback program and will continue to execute against that program. ","Michael Roth","All you had to do is look at the news this morning and global macroeconomic issues that are out there. I don\u2019t think this is the time for us to borrow money to buy back shares, which is implicit in the question, you just asked. We have a strong buy back program that\u2019s been in place. I think you\u2019ve seen us execute against that in an orderly fashion. I think it does well for our shareholders to have that kind of flow in the marketplace and it to be consistent as opposed to trying to be opportunistic in levering up our balance sheet. ","One of the things we spent a lot of time on the last, frankly eight years, nine years, is making sure our balance sheet is strong, so that the fluctuations in macro economics can be well absorbed if it was such an impact again. We learn by experience and I think between our dividends, between our share buyback programs and frankly, we still have one more rating agency to get us to investment grade, that we\u2019re very comfortable with the leverage right now. ","If you look at our maturing schedule, we don\u2019t have any maturities coming due in the next couple of years, which is a good place to be, in a world that is facing the challenges that we\u2019re seeing. So I think the financial position of IPG is the best it\u2019s been in for years; we\u2019re proud of it and we\u2019re investing in our businesses and we\u2019re returning a fair return to our shareholders and that\u2019s what we\u2019re supposed to be doing. ","Bill Bird - FBR","Thank you and just to follow-up on margins, based on where currency rates are right now, what do you expect the impact to be of currency on margins in the coming quarter or two.","Frank Mergenthaler","We said for the year, 15 basis points of currencies remain as is negative to margin.","Bill Bird - FBR","Okay, thank you.","Michael Roth","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tracy Young with Evercore. You may ask your question.","Tracy Young - Evercore"," ","Yes, I have two questions if I could. One is related to the Microsoft one, the global creative business win. Is there anything that we should think of in terms of onboarding employees or any changes that we should think they are both on a revenue or the expense side. ","And then in terms of the World Cup, did that have any impact in the U.K. or what would you suggest is the reason for that great performance there?","Michael Roth","No, World Cup was not effective in the U.K. Actually in the U.K. it was across the board. All our agencies, everything was doing pretty well in the U.K., so it wasn\u2019t just one particular one-off, so we\u2019re quite pleased. Remember, we did invest in some acquisitions in the U.K. with Profero and Inferno, as well as all of our McCann, Lowe, CMG performance there. So U.K. was pretty much across the board.","As far as onboarding Microsoft, all of that is taken into consideration on the revenue side and the margin side that Frank was talking about. We did have some upfront costs. We continue to hire against it and we\u2019ll see the revenue coming on stream in the second half of the year, which is why we said that the impact of cycling through in the second half of the year should sort of net out against the two and that includes onboarding staff for the Microsoft bit.","Tracy Young - Evercore","Okay, thank you.","Michael Roth","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you, and this question comes from James Dix with Wedbush. You may ask your question.","James Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc.","Good morning guys.","Michael Roth","Good morning James.","James Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc.","Two things; I guess one, first on gross. You said in the past you\u2019re comfortable over indexing I think versus the industry in terms of your business mix to the U.S. Could you give a little color on why you think that\u2019s a positive going forward and I guess a specific reason in light of two things; first, the organic growth was a little slower in the first half in the U.S. than internationally, which was very strong. And then second, I presume most of your clients are global brands with a global P&L and presumably not particularly tied to the results of the U.S. on its own. ","And then secondly, you\u2019ve been pretty vocal as a company about the importance of the shift to programmatic buying for your business and the industry overall. Do you think the shift of programmatic buying leads to higher ad spending by clients or is it leading to more of a shift in spending among the various sources of inventory. And then how does the shift to programmatic so far been impacting the growth and margins of your businesses if at all. Thanks.","Michael Roth","All of that you want me to answer? Okay.","James Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc.","All of that, and I even wrote them down, so I can repeat them if you want.","Michael Roth","I got them, don\u2019t worry about it. First of all, yes, I\u2019m still very comfortable with our mix. If you look at the world base, North America was 59% of our business, U.S. is 56%, and given the uncertainty in the global footprint, I\u2019m pretty comfortable with the United States as being a place to put money and businesses to invest in and so.","I mean ultimately our goal was to get to 50\/50 and get there by growth in the International markets, particularly in the emerging markets. We are very comfortable with our offerings in the emerging markets. India we saw double digit growth, in China, Latin America. All our networks have strong presence in Latin America, including our media businesses.","So, I think our footprint is very strong. I\u2019m very comfortable with the weight of the U.S. because frankly it\u2019s still is the global power house in terms of the economic strength if you will. Obviously double digit growth in China is important, but everyone is looking to the United States to have sustained growth, and even without double digit growth in the United States we can convert and expand our margins, which is what we should be doing.","On program buying, it\u2019s kind of interesting, if you think about it, this is the first time digital has exceeded network spend, and we\u2019ve forecasted to overtake all broadcasting in the next couple of years, and obviously program buying has something to do with that. The up-fronts were kind of weak this year. That doesn\u2019t mean to say that we won\u2019t see the back half of the year strength on the scatter side, and I still think that\u2019s a very important place for us to be. ","And the efficiencies of automation and program buying is here to stay and everyone is seeing how it\u2019s going to go in terms of whether it\u2019s private exchanges, whether it\u2019s public exchanges, whether it\u2019s customized exchanges and it\u2019s all about data and being responsive to reaching the consumers in a more efficient way, and we have to be able to invest in that, and that\u2019s what we have done.","So yes, I think it\u2019s going to be an important part of the future of how we do buying, particularly on the digital side, and as far as the mix goes, we are agnostic. Our business is agnostic. We are advisors. We provide advice to our clients in terms of where they should spend their dollars. ","Now, do we think that if we take a look at a cradle to grave perspective of their total dollars to spend, do we think if we can talk a look at that, we can save them expenditures in terms of reach and effectiveness? Yes, but it takes that integrated offering for us to do that and program buying is part of our ability to deliver on those promises."," ","So that\u2019s why I say, it took me a whole call to get that confusion is good, but confusion is good, especially when you have the expertise that we have, that we can bring to the table.","James Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc.","Great. Just one thing, so is the shift to program helping your growth in margins do you think for your business or\u2026","Michael Roth","It\u2019s not a big margin. It helps our growth in margin, because we\u2019re servicing our clients, and when we service our clients, we\u2019re in there talking to them or working with them in terms of their reach in what their content is, what they should be buying, where should they be spending their money, that help\u2019s our margin, okay. ","We don\u2019t take inventory and that\u2019s a big issue in our industry, in terms of what inventory we are selling, and other than our barter business, which frankly there is some inventory there, but that\u2019s part of the business model, we don\u2019t take the positions and therefore we\u2019re agnostic in terms of what inventory we sell. So we\u2019re not making profits if you will on the inventory that we\u2019re holding to sell to clients.","James Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc.","Okay, so the impact is more. Just it\u2019s taking you up the value chain in place of the advice you are giving clients. ","Michael Roth","Yes, right.","James Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc.","Okay, great thanks very much","Michael Roth","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets ","","Hey, good morning everyone. Michael, just thinking on the marketing services side of your business, maybe agencies like MRM, how much are you seeing any change in how clients are thinking about first party data, CRM platforms, that sort of classic database build? Some of the other competitors like EPSILON have mentioned some new vertical to start to look at those strategies a little bit more in detail where maybe they wouldn\u2019t have previously their more brand advertisers, also may be some more mid market clients looking at it. Something that might have been too expensive for them previously. Is that a trend you guys are participating in as well?","Michael Roth","Yes. I mean, in that space our MRM business is very strong on a global basis and these are big, big projects okay and data management is critical to that and that\u2019s where the tools and resources really come in to play, and we\u2019ve got big global clients that we are working with and it works. I mean, that\u2019s where a lot of the action is taking place, because there\u2019s accountability. ","This business ultimately, if you\u2019re a CEO of a company, and that\u2019s why I made the comment about efficiencies and effectiveness. Clients will spend money when we can prove that its effective and the businesses like MRM and the CRM businesses, historically its accountable and we can prove it and it works. So I think it\u2019s a good part of growth story and as result MRM is doing quite well and frankly as I indicated, that type of disciple is part of that integrated offering that we bring to the clients and it\u2019s becoming more prominent as we go forward.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets ","And so do you see that type of work in the integrated agency networks line primarily, because its within there or is there some of that type of work in CMG as well.","Michael Roth","Well, if you\u2019re referring to the data part of it, the answer is yes, it\u2019s across the board. But the mechanics of that business is \u2013 the fact that its labor intensive is one thing. Everyone thinks it\u2019s all mechanical, it\u2019s not, it\u2019s labor intensive and there are only a few companies that have the resources to be able to do that on a global basis and frankly, that\u2019s one of the reasons MRM is so successful at it. I mean they have the horse power; they have the technology and the resources to make that happen. But that is why we use MRM as part of the integrated offering, even outside McCann, and again, that\u2019s part of the open architecture that IPG can bring to the table.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets ","And just a last one of that, just on that open architecture; are you seeing an agency like MRM start to work more with Mediabrands on applying those sort of CRM systems to programmatic strategies?","Michael Roth","Why, I don\u2019t know specifically on program and strategy, but it\u2019s all data and the answer is yes. I mean that\u2019s what the open architecture is all about and that is you have media, you have CRM, you have creative, you have social media, you have TR, I mean that\u2019s really what we do best. And the industry has gone through cycles of where you pick out specific expertise and you try to put them all together or you go to one source where you have an agency of record and they have all the resource. ","I mean frankly the World Group has all these resources, but everyone on the World Group we reach out to other agencies to help in terms of expertise, so that\u2019s where this industry should be and that\u2019s where it\u2019s going right now. Clients want to make sure they are getting all the resources we have and it\u2019s up to us to deliver it, and they all have to work together and that\u2019s not easy to do and we are seeing much more success as we did years ago and that\u2019s why we are winning businesses.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets ","Great. Thank You.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. You may ask your questions.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities ","Good morning. I wanted to ask you about talent and specifically as the industry moves more towards digital capabilities, your competitive set for talent and this is something that we\u2019ve all talked about a bit, it\u2019s certainly widening. ","Historically you and your peers have not been significant users of non-cash compensation. Wondering if the hiring climate, in particular the digital hiring climate and the competitors are leading you to change your view on that. Could we expect, let\u2019s say a year from now, different types of comp packages out there for this type of employees. ","And then I guess just a quick follow up on that. Frank, I\u2019m wondering if you could comment a little bit on how we should think about this, the sources of leverage for second half. Any changes to the patterns we\u2019ve been seeing or is it just kind of a flow through there. Thank you very much.","Michael Roth","Okay, thanks Peter. Well look, yes, I mean digital talent, it\u2019s not just digital talent. Creative talent, account management, our business is talent, so therefore it\u2019s very competitive. We are very pleased \u2013 I mean if you look at the people we\u2019ve been able to recruit recently in terms of high level people, McCann for example recruiting Rob Reilly on the creative side. He\u2019s had a great impact at McCann and he\u2019s been to recruit talent behind him in terms of what they are doing. ","And yes, I mean our compensation packages are including more equity based compensation to have them part of the performance. I think its pay-for-performance and we try to move most of our high level executives to a pay-for-performance structure. ","On a digital side, even if you take a look at some of our digital acquisitions, we put into earn outs that are based on performance when we buy them and we also put in \u2013 one of the things that\u2019s going on is obviously IP, okay, and the question is who owns the IP. So we have pools in some of our digital agencies and in our media business, where we encourage our people, the entrepreneurs that are within those businesses to think out of the box and we\u2019ll invest some money behind them and they\u2019ll participate, so that\u2019s one of the vehicles we use to retain and keep those type of individuals in the market place. ","But we constantly look at our overall compensation structure to make sure that we\u2019re (a) competitive, and (b) that our people participate on the upside, on the senior levels, and it\u2019s also based on our performance of their various networks. ","So we have a very sophisticated compensation plan based on networks, based on IPG performance and depending on what level you\u2019re being brought in on and use of equity compensation. ","So yes, the answer is we have to do all of it and we have to use it in the right place. You just don\u2019t throw out the equity ownership across the whole company, because it doesn\u2019t have that kind of impact, but on senior talent and individuals who are coming and bringing with them unique expertise, we certainly do use it.","Frank Mergenthaler","And Peter on the leverage question, it\u2019s all about conversion. Three, six months our growth conversion of profit was about 27% on constant currency basis. We said 30% is what our objective was, so we\u2019re in the ballpark. So when we look at the back half of the year, it\u2019s critical for us to convert and when we look at conversion, it\u2019s all about how we manage SRS, because I think our other cost components are very well managed. It\u2019s all about how we manage SRS and that\u2019s going to be the focus for the next two quarters.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities ","Thanks very much. Great first half.","Michael Roth","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Michael Roth","Good morning Ben.","Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask two Michael, one, you talked a little bit about draft in your opening remarks. I think it\u2019s been almost a year, maybe a little less since Carter came on. How is that group doing in terms of growth? I think it\u2019s probably not growing as fast as the overall business, and you guys have been putting up decent top line despite that, so any sort of line of sight on when that business starts to pick up? Any accounts we should be focused on and does he have his whole team in place? ","And then since it\u2019s the last question, I\u2019ll throw my second one in. In admittedly yesterday\u2019s news, but with Publicis, Omnicom unwinding itself since the last earnings call, I\u2019d love to just get any takeaways that you guys have from that whole process. Anything you learned either from the employee side or from the client side or just any thoughts on what happened and if it has any implications for the broader industry would be interesting. Thanks.","Michael Roth","Sure. I thought I was going to get through a call without having to answer that question. First of all, it\u2019s no longer draft, its FCB. It sound like that\u2019s a small task. It is I think what Carter and his team in terms of transforming that organization, the role out of the FCB brand if you will has really taken hold. Carter and the people he brought in have really gelled in terms of the DNA of FCB. ","They came out of the gate, they won some high profile clients. In terms of wins as you know, they won Levi\u2019s, they won Trulia and they won Ghirardelli, and so yes, it\u2019s great and they were competing against top notch agencies. So they really have some great talent and Carter has done an amazing job in bringing in high level people in terms of markets that they needed to build up their expertise, particularly Nigel Jones being brought in over in Europe and Lee Garfunkel in New York. In their healthcare business where Dana is doing very well, so I\u2019m very happy where FCB is and the team and we\u2019re really excited about what the future holds with respect to that transformation. ","It\u2019s not easy to move a battleship like that. The results frankly for the year at FCB are consistent with what we were planning for them for the year; that takes time. You don\u2019t expect it automatically to be a huge contributor in terms of our overall, but it\u2019s an important global network for us and they are contributing and we are very exciting about it. And all you have to do is see Carter and his team in terms of how they pitch new business and the excitement that they have, it\u2019s really great to see.","As far as the Publicis, Omnicom transaction, I was kind of hoping it would continue to delay forever and not take place, because I think the distraction of having two very competitive companies like Omnicom and Publicis, being focused on their transactions as what we are doing out there was kind of fun and they are back. I mean we are competing against them, but we didn\u2019t expect it to stay forever. We didn\u2019t go home and worry about the transaction. ","Even if it got completed, we felt we have the resources and the scale to compete and we used it as an advantage in recruiting some very high talented, high profile individuals and some client pick-ups if you will, but not we are back to competing as usual. So it\u2019s going to take them some time to work though some of their issues in terms of talent and so on, but we just put our heads down and focus on our clients and our business. ","Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley","Does the failure to get that done suggest as to sort of highlight how hard it is to do these kind of deals, given the complexity and it\u2019s a people business or you think its specific to what was going on there.","Michael Roth","I\u2019ll let them answer those questions. I think a $35 billion transaction by definition is difficult to complete, and if you add on top of it, it\u2019s a service business and its multinational and its different cultures. I think it was pretty clear from the beginning it was going to be difficult to complete. ","That doesn\u2019t mean to say you can\u2019t do transactions, but it\u2019s difficult. ","Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley","Thank you."," ","Michael Roth","Well, thank you very much for your support. We look forward to the next earnings call and enjoy the rest of the summer. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude toady\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation. At this time you may disconnect your line.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jerome J. Leshne","Good morning. Thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com, and we'll refer to both in the course of this call. This morning, we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 a.m. Eastern. During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company, which are subject to the uncertainties in the cautionary statement included in our earnings release and the slide presentation and further detailed in our 10-K and other filings with the SEC. At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael I. Roth","Thank you, Jerry, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We're pleased to report strong financial results for the fourth quarter and full year, driven by organic revenue growth for 2011 at the high end of our industry and significant improvement in both operating margin and earnings per share. ","Beginning with revenue, our organic growth was 6.1% for the year. This is ahead of the 4% to 5% growth we had targeted. Our fourth quarter organic growth was 2.8%, and given the challenging comparison to Q4 2010 organic growth of 11.2%, this is a solid performance. For the full year, all of our global networks grew organically. We grew in all client sectors and in most regions of the world, with Continental Europe the sole exception, as we expected. ","Our digital capabilities, whether embedded across our organization or within digital specialist agencies, contributed significantly to our growth. This performance speaks to the quality and competitiveness of our offerings, as well as to the power of our diversified model and geographic reach. Throughout the year, we continue to invest in talent and tools so as to better meet the needs of our clients in the dynamic media and marketing environment. ","At the same time, our operators remained disciplined in their expense management, which allowed us to effectively convert incremental revenue to operating profit. This was clearly evident in our Q4 results. Operating profit increased 17% from a year ago to $385 million, with operating margin expansion of 210 basis points to 18.6%. For the full year, our operating profit increased 25% to $687 million. Operating margin expanded by 140 basis points to 9.8%, within the targeted range we had set early in the year. ","Again, it's worth noting that all of our global networks and all world regions other than Europe improved operating margin during 2011. Frank will provide details on the various key efficiency metrics, but there's one I want to call out. We posted the highest revenue per employee recorded by our company in over a decade. Diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.50 compared with $0.36 a year ago, an increase of 39%. For the full year, diluted EPS was $0.99. Excluding the Facebook gain recorded in the third quarter, full year diluted earnings per share would have been $0.76, an increase of 62% from the 2010 EPS of $0.47. ","Our capital return programs have also been a significant area of sustainable value creation. At this time last year, we initiated our share repurchase program and common stock dividend. These were important milestones for our company. We're pleased to report that during 2011, via buybacks and dividends, we returned a total over $500 million to our shareholders. Today, we're announcing a number of steps that will further utilize our strong financial position for both return of capital and debt de-leveraging. ","First, our board has authorized a new repurchase program in the amount of $300 million. This is in addition to the $50 million of capacity that remained on our existing authorization as of January 1. Second, we've elected to exercise our option to call our 4.25% convertible notes, $400 million outstanding. This action will eliminate convertible equity of 33 million shares that is presently in our diluted share count. ","Overall, 2011 was another very strong year for us. We demonstrated the vitality and competitiveness of our professional offerings, converted top line growth into significant gains in profitability and further improved our capital structure. This progress positions us to deliver on the 2014 goals we set at our Investor Day, which will allow us to drive continued value creation going forward. At this point, let me turn things over to Frank for some additional color on our financial performance.","Frank Mergenthaler","Good morning, everyone. As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of our results. Organic revenue growth was 2.8% in Q4 on top of 11.2% a year ago. This put organic growth for the full year to 6.1%. Operating income in the fourth quarter increased 17% from a year ago to $385 million. Q4 operating margin was 18.6% compared to 16.5% in Q4 2010. ","All our agency teams did a terrific job at driving incremental profitability. We had strong operating leverage on our salaries and related expenses with improvement in all categories. Full year operating margin grew 140 basis points to 9.8%. Operating profit conversion based on our constant currency revenue growth was just north of 30%. Michael spoke to our outstanding year-on-year improvements in EPS. Diluted earnings per share in Q4 was $0.50 compared to our $0.36 per share in Q4 2010. For the full year, diluted EPS was $0.99, or $0.76 excluding our gain on Facebook, which compares favorably with $0.47 in 2010. ","We ended the year in a strong liquidity position, with $2.32 billion of cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet compared with $2.69 billion a year ago. The comparison includes having used $401 million in 2011 to repurchase shares and $111 million on common stock dividends. It also includes net cash proceeds of $134 million from our Facebook transaction in August. As you've heard this morning, our board has authorized a new $300 million share repurchase program. We also announced that we are exercising our option to call our $400 million 4.25% convertible notes. The notes, which include 33 million dilutive shares, will be redeemed for cash effective March 26. ","Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. It's worth noting here that our effective tax rate was 25%, which includes a net benefit from the reversal of valuation reserves related to certain tax assets outside the U.S. Excluding the tax benefit, our effective Q4 rate would have been approximately 34%. For the full year, excluding the Facebook transaction in Q3 and other changes in tax reserves during the year, our underlying effective rate would have been approximately 35%. ","Our average basic share count for the quarter was 448 million compared with 475 million a year ago. During Q4, we used $130 million to repurchase 15 million shares at an average cost of $8.98. Our activity brought the beginning basic share count for 2012 down to 441 million, a 7% decrease year-on-year. ","Turning to operations on Slide 4, beginning with revenue. Revenue in the quarter was $2.07 billion, an increase of 3.4%. Compared to Q4 2010, the change due to net acquisitions and dispositions was positive 40 basis points, while exchange rates added 20 basis points. The resulting organic revenue increase was 2.8%. ","The U.S. was up 2.2% organically on top of 13.1% last year. International markets overall increased 3.6%, including a great result in Latin America, which grew over 30%. On a sector basis, for the quarter, we were led by growth in tech and telecom, auto and transportation and retail. On the bottom half of this slide, you can see that our Integrated Agency Network segment grew 1.4% organically in the fourth quarter on top of 10% a year ago. Organic revenue growth was 5.3% for the full year. ","At CMG, organic growth in Q4 was 11%. We had outstanding performance across public relations, events and branding. For the full year, CMG's 9.8% growth compounded double-digit growth in 2010. ","Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., we had 2.2% organic growth against 13.1% growth rate a year ago. Public relations, branding experiential marketing disciplines, as well as our specialty digital agencies, all had strong quarters. Leading client sectors were auto and transportation, food and beverage and retail. U.S. growth was 6.1% for the full year. ","Turning to international markets. Again, these are organic numbers. U.K. revenue increased 2.5%. We are very pleased to see this result on top of 17% growth in Q4 2010. Continental Europe decreased 3.2% in Q4 as macro conditions continue to weigh on client spending. This was true for both local and multinational clients and in most national markets on the Continent. For the full year, our organic growth on the Continent was flat. Asia Pac grew 1% in Q4. We had strong growth in China and Australia, partially offset by decreases in Japan, where we have a significant presence, and in some of the smaller markets in the region. In Lat Am, Q4 growth was 30% on top of 20% a year ago. All of our global networks contributed to this result. We saw notable increases across our multinational client base and had strong growth in Brazil, Chile and Mexico. ","For the full year, we grew 17.8% in the region, compounding 16% in 2010. We continue to build on our highly competitive position in this part of the world. Our other markets group increased 0.8% for the quarter and 3.4% for the full year. ","On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue changes on a trailing 12-month basis. This, of course, includes the lows of 2009 and the highs of 2010. The most recent data point is 6.1%, our result for the full year 2011. ","Moving on to Slide 7 and our operating expenses. Our operators did a terrific job in Q4 and throughout the year managing costs. Our investment in tools, analytics and information systems continue to show returns in the form of improved efficiencies. ","In the fourth quarter, total operating expenses increased only 0.6% organically compared to last year. For the full year, operating expenses increased 4.5% compared with our 6.1% organic revenue growth. Sequentially, as we moved from Q3 to our much larger fourth quarter, our expenses for base payroll, benefits and tax decreased $4 million. Expenses for temporary labor also decreased. While we continue to invest in the many growing areas of our portfolio, net headcount growth was less than 0.5% in the quarter. ","Total salaries and related expenses in the quarter were 54.9% of revenue. This compares to 56.8% in Q4 2010, a 190-basis-point improvement. Our leverage improved on all expense categories within salaries. Base pay, benefits and tax was 42.7% of revenue compared with 43% a year ago. Headcount at quarter end was 42,400, a year-on-year increase of 2.8%. This is attributable to our investment [indiscernible] growth in media and public relations and digital services throughout our agencies at our digital specialist agencies, as well as in high-growth markets, including China, India and Brazil. ","Severance expense was 2.1% of Q4 revenue compared with 2.7% a year ago. We took actions in Q4 to align our headcount with 2012 budgets by market and to upgrade our competitive positioning in selected markets. For the full year, severance expense is 1.5% of revenue, which is the same level as 2010. Incentive expense in the quarter was 3.2% of revenue compared with 3.5% a year ago. For the full year, incentive expense was 3.7% of revenue, within the range we had previously indicated. Temporary labor expense was 2.9% of revenue compared with 3.1% a year ago. All other salaries and related expenses were 4% of revenue compared with 4.5% last year. ","For the full year 2011, total salaries and related expenses was 62.8% of revenue compared to 63.3% of revenue in 2010, a 50 basis point improvement. ","Turning to office and general expenses on the lower half of this slide. This continued to be an area of improvement for us in 2011. For the 12 months, O&G expense was 27.4% of revenue compared to 28.2%. That's a decrease of 80 basis points for the year, with improvement across all our major expense categories. Looking at the quarter, O&G expense was $549 million, 26.5% of revenue compared with 26.6% a year ago. Underneath that, occupancy expense as a percentage of revenue decreased 40 basis points. This was a result of both our revenue growth and decreased rent expense. For the full year, occupancy expense decreased 50 basis points as a percentage of revenue. ","We continue to see reductions in our real estate footprint as you can see in the appendix of our presentation. Our metric on square feet per employee improved to 234 from 245 square feet 12 months ago. You may recall from our Investor Day that we're targeting 220 square feet per employee by 2014. ","Looking at the professional fees and T&E categories, both decreased 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue from a year ago. ","All other O&G expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 70 basis points from a year ago. We had higher depreciation expense due to the write off of some leasehold improvements. We also had higher pass-through expenses, which were offset by higher revenue. For the full year, this category decreased 10 basis points as a percentage of revenue. ","On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis, which was 9.8% for 2011. As you can see, we've improved consistently under revenue growth. We remain confident that the investments we are making in tools and technology and shared services and process improvements are the basis for further sustained progress. ","Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 9, we ended the year with $2.32 billion in cash and short-term marketable securities compared with $2.69 billion a year ago, a decrease of approximately $370 million. The comparison includes over $500 million returned to shareholders in 2011 in the form of share repurchase and dividends. We also had net cash inflow of $134 million from the sale of approximately half our interest in Facebook. ","On Slide 10, we turn to cash flow for the quarter. Cash from operations was $717 million compared with $979 million a year ago. As a reminder, cash flow in our business is seasonal. We tend to generate cash from working capital in the fourth quarter and use cash in the first quarter. ","Cash generated by working capital in Q4 was $344 million compared with $639 million in last year's fourth quarter. This year\u2019s result is a more typical level of our business. Cash generated from working capital in Q4 2010 was unusually high due to very strong growth by a number of our businesses, led by Mediabrands. For the full year, cash from operations was $273 million. That consisted of $632 million before working capital and cash used by working capital of $359 million, which mainly took place in the first quarter of this year. ","Moving on to investing activities in the quarter. We used $68 million in Q4 primarily for CapEx and acquisitions. During the quarter, we closed on several acquisitions. These included a marketing service agency in Brazil, digital agencies in the U.K. in the social media and eCRM space, a leading PR firm in Germany and a highly creative agency that joined the Lowe network in Australia. ","Financing activities used $118 million in Q4 primarily to repurchase 15 million shares of our common stock for $132 million and our quarterly common stock dividend of $27 million. The net increase in cash and marketable securities in the quarter was $517 million. ","You can see our cash flow schedule for the full year in the presentation appendix. It's worth noting a few items. CapEx for the year was $140 million. Cash used for acquisitions was $63 million for the year. We budgeted around $150 million for 2011, so we did not invest to the budgeted level. Our acquisition pipeline is robust, so we'll see some of that investment carry over to this year. We continue to focus on acquisitions in digital, as well as high-growth marketing disciplines in key world markets. Our cash taxes were $102 million. Excluding the Facebook transaction, this represents a rate of 16% of pretax income, so we continue to utilize our operating loss carryforwards, which allows us to continue to benefit from a cash tax rate significantly lower than our effective book rate. ","Looking forward to 2012, we expect our cash tax rate to approximate 25% as we have nearly exhausted all our NOLs in the U.S. On Slide 11, you see our total debt outstanding at year end and over the past few years. The trend line depicts our de-leveraging, which has seen us take total debt from $2.3 billion at the end of 2007 to $1.8 billion at the conclusion of 2011, which includes our 2 convertible notes. We announced today that we are exercising our option to call our 4.25% $400 million notes effective March 26. There are 33 million common shares related to these convertible notes which will be eliminated from our diluted share count. ","For EPS purposes, since the call takes place near the end of our first quarter, we will show reduction this year of approximately 3\/4 of that total, with the entire 33 million next year. Calling these converts is accretive for our shareholders, reduces our outstanding debt and further strengthens our financial position. Given the current favorable rate environment and our improved credit standing, we are carefully considering issuing new straight debt in amount less than $400 million we are calling, so we will de-leverage. As a result, we will be filing a shelf registration statement later today with the SEC. ","In terms of additional opportunities on the horizon, our 4.75% $200 million convertible notes are similarly putable and callable in March of next year. Also, beginning July 2013, the call option on our $600 million 10% senior notes due in 2017 become more economical. ","In summary, on Slide 12, during 2011, we once again had strong revenue growth, converted that growth to profit at a high rate and achieved our margin target for the year. We will continue to invest in areas of the business that are driving growth. At the same time, we remain confident of our ability to manage expenses and drive continued profit improvement. Our balance sheet continues to be a source of value creation. ","Our announcement this morning of additional share repurchases and debt reduction speak to our confidence in our financial position and our continued ability to generate significant operating cash flow on a sustained basis. Now let me turn it back over to Michael.","Michael I. Roth","Thanks, Frank. Building on a very good 2010 result, we continue to show organic revenue growth that is at or near the top of our peer group. Our conversion was once again excellent, and this led to the margin expansion of 140 basis points, and the 9.8% operating margin we achieved is a level of profitability that IPG has not obtained in over a decade. As a result, the state of our business is strong. This performance keeps us on track to deliver on our goal of fully competitive profitability in 2014. ","Combined with our strong financial position, enhanced capital structure and a return to investment-grade credit ratings positions us to further drive shareholder value going forward. Strategically, the actions we've taken in recent years have significantly bolstered our portfolio. Mediabrands continues to deliver a fully contemporary and competitive offering in an area of the industry that is becoming increasingly vital to every marketer's success. Our investments in talent, along with the leadership we've attracted and developed, gives Mediabrands outstanding management depth at all levels. ","Their digital and specialty offerings from Cadreon to The Audience Platform to the new IPG Media Lab, as well as ID Media, Geomentum and ORION are second to none, and the group is leading the way in developing pay-for-performance models, an area which will continue to be a priority for us at Interpublic. Our investments in digital talent across the group and our decision to hold all operating unit leadership accountable for delivering native digital expertise are also proving out. The social media capabilities at CMG are best-in-class, and the market share gains consistently posted by our PR agencies, Weber Shandwick and GolinHarris, as well as Octagon and Jack Morton, reflect the degree to which we've been investing in digital talent at all of these agencies. ","At McCann, MRM is among the industry's leading global digital networks, with offices in over 30 markets and a strong track record of growth in recent years. R\/GA is not only the most celebrated digital agency in terms of awards and press recognition, it is also a creative force that is now serving clients from 8 offices in Latin America, Asia and Europe. HUGE is on a similar growth pattern, and we will soon have an announcement of how we are looking to further leverage the great technology talent that's at the core of that agency. At its U.S. operations, Draftfcb already has more than 350 people in the digital practice. They're fully embedded in the agency's integrated behavior-based agency model. In 2011, Draftfcb worldwide once again delivered outstanding top and bottom line performance. ","Our U.S. integrated agencies continue to perform at an exceptional level. From Mullen, Hill Holiday to Martin Agency and Deutsche, a Lowe & Partners Company, all of these agencies have strong full-service offering that span every consumer touch point, strategic and creative talent that comes up with big brand ideas and leading edge digital capabilities that include Web development and social media, digital media planning and app development, as well as a full range of analytic tools. ","Turning to the high-growth markets, where we also are well positioned. Across the portfolio, we're very strong in India and Brazil, where in 2011, we saw organic growth of about 20% for the full year, as was true in China. At the agency level, it bears noting that McCann Worldgroup remains one of the industry's most powerful global networks capable of delivering a full range of marketing service capabilities in over 100 world markets, with strong teams across Latin America and key Asian markets. In 2011, McCann continued to improve its financial performance and expand margins, as well as further upgrade senior talent throughout the organization. ","Lowe is well positioned in India and Southeast Asia and has an outstanding agencies and world-class creative talent in all the key Latin American markets. Draftfcb has one of the most powerful holistic offerings in India, a strong Brazil to hub Lat Am operations and is the clear market leader in South Africa, from which it plans to build its business in that emerging continent. Our Middle East operations under the MCN umbrella are among the largest and best in that region and will surely be a long-term driver of growth for both our clients and for our businesses. ","Our step-up investments in India over the past few years and our recent focus on Brazil are bearing fruit. In 2011, we closed over 20 additional acquisitions, and our M&A pipeline is strong. While we don't believe there are any holes in our offerings on a macro level, we will continue to bring a disciplined approach to identifying and integrating acquisition partners that can help us move the business forward. This includes seeking out quality assets in high-growth geographic markets and among businesses in the more dynamic areas of marketing services such as shopper marketing, PR and healthcare communications. Our primary focus in digital will continue to be growing talent and capabilities organically, but we will seek bolt-ons that extend our digital reach or represent a good client fit. This is especially true in the international markets, such as with the recent digital deals we've completed in the U.K., Germany, the Nordics, Brazil and India. While digital and emerging markets and marketing services led the way this past year, contributions to our growth came from across the portfolio. There was consistency in terms of performance among our largest multinational clients and a local client base, as well as all client sectors.","All of our major agencies contributed to our positive organic growth. The tone of our business remains solid. An increasingly sophisticated digital media ecosystem represents an opportunity for us, or as I often say, complexity is good. As in the recent news that suggest improvements in the U.S. economy, since our revenue mix in the developed markets skews towards the U.S. with less exposure to Europe than our competitors, in the emerging markets, our recent results have been very strong, and we'll continue to invest behind our agency brands there. ","Now turning to 2012, there remain significant macro uncertainty on the global level. We're facing revenue headwinds due to some client losses, and it is still early in the New Year. As a result, we're targeting 3% organic growth for 2012. It bears noting that the revenue headwinds will likely be front-loaded in the first 6 months of the year, and as is our practice, we'll update you regarding our outlook and the tone of the business on our quarterly calls. As was evident with this year's organic revenue growth, our offerings is strong, and despite revenue headwinds, we believe there's more upside in the current new business pipeline than we had at this time a year ago. ","Specifically, we're seeing more midsized opportunities across the portfolio and a few large pitches that could represent significant gains for us. Draftfcb has started the year strong, with digital and CRM wins at Discovery and Cox communications, while Mullen has added business from Google and earlier this week, U.S. Cellular. At McCann, the agency extended its global relationship with American Airlines and was tapped by Merck to handle creative duties on several brands. MRM has further extended its GM relationship in a number of international markets and recently won business at Computer Science Corp. and J&J. Lowe won the global Becel business from Unilever late last year, and Deutsche continues to earn new assignments from Microsoft. ","R\/GA just announced that it's growing its relationship with Unilever on top of big wins with McCormick's, O2 and Grey Goose in 2011. Recent headline wins at HUGE include Comcast and Under Armour. There's a great deal of new business activity across the board at Mediabrands, led by wins at Exxon and LifeLock. And at CMG, we have a robust pipeline both domestically and internationally. ","Our demonstrated ability to convert incremental revenue into margin growth should allow us to increase operating margins in 2012 by at least 50 basis points above the 9.8% we're reporting today, assuming a 3% organic revenue growth. Of course, our goal is to exceed that performance. Our agencies are moving in the right direction and supporting the evolving needs of our clients. ","We're building on strong positions in emerging disciplines and geographic regions. We're committed to continuing to return capital to our shareholders. These are accomplishments we can all be proud of. Above all, they reflect the great professionalism and hard work of our people around the world. Our recent progress and outstanding 2011 results also gives us confidence that we can keep moving the business forward and continue delivering shareholder value and appreciation. ","I thank you, and we'll open up the floor to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alexandria Quadrani, JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Alexia Quadrani. First off, could you give us some specifics about McCann's performance, I guess, specifically in the fourth quarter? I know you gave us a lot of color for the year, but I'd love to know how McCann did in Q4 versus your expectations. And then when you look at your guidance for 2012, specifically the top line guidance of 3% organic revenue growth, I guess first thing, does that assume some new business coming in? And secondly, do you assume McCann has sort of outsized growth in 2012 maybe to make up for a little bit of more softness at Draftfcb given the SC Johnson loss?","Michael I. Roth","Well, let's focus on 3% because I think that's the relevant question here. One is, of course, as I said, we have headwinds of 2% to 3% coming into 2012. So when we say 3% for the year, that takes into effect the headwinds we have, so therefore, there\u2019s assumed revenue growth either from our existing clients or from new business, which is why I referenced some of the new business wins that we're already experiencing in the first quarter and the solid pipeline we have. So that number that we're using takes into consideration any client losses and, frankly, some levels of success in our pipeline. If you contrast it to where we were in 2011, when we started 2011, we had 3 major clients up for review, and some, we were moderately successful on, and obviously, SC Johnson, we lost. We're not in that position for 2012, and as I say that, I touch wood, okay. But so we see, there's some clients up for review not of the magnitude we had before. And frankly, there are active pitches going on right now where we see upside. For example, the Bank of America review that's there. Hill Holliday is leading our charge there. They're an existing client, so there is risk there. But we feel we're well positioned on that pitch. The Unilever media, we're incumbent in some parts of their markets. We hope to, obviously, retain that and expand markets. So there are opportunities for us to improve. McCann, a lot has made note of some of the client losses because frankly, whenever McCann loses a client, it gets headlines. But what you don't see is client wins that they're receiving from existing client base where they're expanding relationships. We do our budgeting process from the bottoms up, and obviously, that reflects improvements from McCann in 2012. And as I indicated in my remarks, McCann improved in 2011, so they showed revenue growth. They showed margin improvement. So notwithstanding some client losses that get headlines, we believe McCann is very well-situated from a competitive point of view moving forward.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And just last question. On Continental Europe and the performance you saw there in the quarter, did you see any, I guess, notable change toward the end of the quarter or into January? Was there further deterioration, or was it relatively stable throughout the quarter?","Michael I. Roth","Relatively stable is an interesting way of putting it. Look, we knew we have challenges in Continental Europe. Our results reflect that. But as I indicated, this is not unexpected from us, and frankly, for 2012, we're not counting on a major recovery. So it didn't deteriorate any worse in December, if that specifically is your question, but obviously, we're not assuming a huge growth in 2012.","Operator","Next question comes from John Janedis, UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Frank, we haven't seen the salaries and related line as a percentage of revenue this low in maybe about a decade or so. So I'm wondering, were there onetime items in there or timing issues? And can you talk more about the levers coming in 2012?","Frank Mergenthaler","No, John. I mean, look, the progress we've made has been on managing base and benefits and, to some extent, offsetting that temp labor. But the incentive expense and severance has been relatively stable, and we've just seen continued pressure by our operators to drive the base benefits and tax down. And when you look forward to 2012 and the incremental leverage we hope to get in margin expansion on the 3% growth rate, the 2 big areas we'll continue to focus on is aggressively driving greater leverage out of base benefits and our temporary labor.","Michael I. Roth","There are only so many levers that we have, and those are the key ones, as Frank points out. And we manage to margin, and all our business units, our performance is matched up against that. So that is the key area of focus throughout the world for all of our operators.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Frank, is the assumption that, that severance number stays around 1.5% then?","Frank Mergenthaler","Yes, John. I mean, we historically have guided people to 1%. It's been tracking higher, so it's probably going to be somewhere between 1% and 1.5%. But to the point Michael made is our operators are incented to deliver margin, so to the extent the severance number is higher than that, they've got to go find incremental savings somewhere else within their cost structure.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then, Michael, just back to Continental Europe, the read through from what you just said that the people on the ground there that you have, they're saying that things are not getting better, they've kind of stabilized. And also, can you just talk about new business there?","Michael I. Roth","Yes, a lot of the business -- we have a mix of local business and multinationals there. And look, it's very cautious there, and everybody is concerned. So we're just basically forecasting a very slow improvement and no big pickup, but the tone is cautious. There's no question about it. We have some local wins and some existing clients spending money, but I wouldn't say that the recovery is taking hold and we've seen bottom. I think a lot is going to unfold as this action is taken in the money markets and Greece and so on and how it all affects it, but there's a caution up there that continues.","Operator","Next question comes from Ben Swinburne, Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple. Frank, can you maybe talk -- you talked about working capital both in the quarter and the year. And I know you guys have a long-term view of where your cash flows are headed, but maybe you can just talk a little about what we should expect a normal year to look like for working capital, maybe a year that looks like what you guys are guiding for in '12. And then on the buyback authorization extension and the convertible bond, you mentioned that Q1 is usually a working cap outflow. So should we assume not much in the way of buybacks in the first quarter outside of the redemption? And any comment on how the $300 million sort of fits into the full year? Do you expect this to offset in the year, or something that's just sort of out there, depending on what the stock does.","Michael I. Roth","Let me talk about the buyback, and Frank will talk about working capital. We have a yearly program for buybacks, okay? Some of it is open market, some of it is a program buyback. So we will continue throughout the first quarter in the buyback. Obviously, we're out of the market as certain things come up, but it's a full year program.","Frank Mergenthaler","And Ben, on the working capital, you've been around the story a long time in this industry. I mean, there's a lot of volatility. And if you go back and look over time, you can see in a normal year, as long as primarily your media business is growing or your revenue is growing, the model's working capital-accretive. What we saw in 2010 was just an unusually significant working capital generation in the fourth quarter. We had a very significant new client come on in media. Our Mediabrands group did very well. Our overall company did very well in the fourth quarter, which gave us a $600-plus million generation of cash in Q4 2010, probably almost 2x what we normally see. That unwound in the first quarter of '11, which gave rise to the full year. So if you go back and look over the last 3 years, we've generated about $500 million from working capital. So again, you can expect continued volatility, and I think that Q4 2010 was a bit of an anomaly, and it cycled through in the first quarter this year. We would expect 2012 to be more normalized. I'm not ready to put a number on what exactly that means.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. No, that's very helpful. And then I didn't know if you guys had a currency number you want us to use at this point in the year. I know it's early, but there's been some volatility there as well.","Frank Mergenthaler","Relatively de minimis, Ben.","Operator","Next question comes from David Bank, RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions, I guess, one backward-looking, one forward-looking. So backward-looking, if you look at the domestic organic growth performance versus the peer group, you obviously faced some really, really difficult comps, and you didn\u2019t lag the peers to a certain extent, but you faced, by far, more challenging comps. How much of the delta versus the sort of industry do you think was about comps versus headwinds in business wins and losses? Is it that same sort of 200-, 300-basis-point delta? And the second question is as you look going forward, and I know it's probably hard to quantify this, but when you gave your 3% organic target, how much of it is a function of growth in existing client business versus new wins?","Michael I. Roth","Yes. I mean, that's a question on growth from new business versus existing clients. That is an issue that we constantly address. The significant part of our growth is coming from existing clients, and that's where the opportunities are both from a margin point of view and organic revenue growth. Obviously, whenever there's new business out there, we want to participate. We want to win our fair share. But the key to these assumptions are retaining clients and growing existing clients from an organic point of view. On the 300 basis point question, 2011 didn't have -- we had 2% headwinds going into 2011. I would say that when you back out the headwinds and the difficult comps, I think we're still slightly ahead of our peer groups in terms of the fundamental organic growth, and part of that has to do with our weighting between U.S. and foreign. We're overweighted in the U.S. We had strong performance in the U.S., and I think that's what accounted for our organic growth.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Specifically in the fourth quarter, though, you think that's -- the answer's the same for the fourth quarter?","Michael I. Roth","?","Yes, pretty much so. We had some timing issues in the fourth quarter on some small revenue items in some of the Asia Pac countries. But I think, again, we look at this on a full year basis, and I think going into 2012, our weighting in the United States is going to do us well.","Operator","Next question comes from Peter Stabler, Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Michael, I just wanted to ask you a question about visibility. Our sense is that, kind of secular changes occurring across the traditional advertising landscape are leading clients to try to be more reactive to business results, not lock into long-term commitments, kind of be a bit more nimble. Is that something that you see? And how would you characterize your visibility today versus where we were a year ago?","Michael I. Roth","I think multinational clients are looking at full year. Obviously, they'll wait depending on how business situations are by location. But there's no question that the multinationals are looking to expand markets, particularly in the emerging markets. And they have programs, and we're working with them to spend those dollars. So we have that kind of visibility. It's the project-based businesses that we always are careful about because when business is suspect, that's the stuff that gets pulled back. The long-term brand building, launching new products and things like that, we have visibility into that, and when we do our business forecasting, it's bottoms up. So what happens is our agencies know what launches, whether it's a new car, whether it's a new product and in what regions. So there is a fundamental investing in brands that we see. It's the project business that is the wildcard in a lot of these numbers. And frankly, the tone right now, and I think you've seen it in some of the articles that are out there, multinational clients are increasing their marketing spend because they see the return on investment as real, and it's our job to show them that what we're doing helps them move the needle. And if it moves the needle, then they're happy. Even in a difficult environment, I mean, that's how you build brands and you capture market share. The key here is our ability to show that there's a return on investment, and frankly, the pay-for-performance model that we're using more in the Mediabrands environment lends itself to that type of environment. And that is if you spend your dollars and we're successful in helping you move the needle, we'll get paid for it. So I think there's visibility into product launches, brand building and gaining market share. The project-based business is where we don't have as long a vision into the future.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","One quick follow-up, if I could. Could you remind us the largest markets in the all other bucket?","Frank Mergenthaler","It's Canada. Canada is the largest.","Operator","Next question comes from Bill Bird, Lazard.","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Could you talk a little bit about how you see the pacing of the 2012 margin climb?","Frank Mergenthaler","Bill, I would imagine given the seasonality of our business, I think it would be consistent with prior years. The first quarter is usually, from a profitability perspective, very weak. Second quarter is usually stronger. Third quarter is relatively weak, and you have an awful lot of your profit coming in the fourth quarter.","Michael I. Roth","I hate to bring a sore point up, but if you remember 2011, we always look at our numbers on a full year basis, and there may be hiccups on quarters as we experienced one in 2011. We continue to manage our businesses to the full year, and that's how we give our guidance, and that's frankly how our businesses are operated. So it's hard for us. Obviously, the first quarter is always a more difficult quarter for us. But again, we take that into consideration in the models and how we forecast for the year.","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And on Q4, severance was a little bit above trend. I was just wondering how best to interpret that.","Frank Mergenthaler","It was actually down year-on-year, and for the full year, Bill, it was 1.5%, the same it was last year. It's usually a heavier quarter just because we're looking at the subsequent year's budget, and to the extent we're falling short of where we need to be, it usually causes us to take actions with headcount, and that drives the severance number.","Michael I. Roth","Yes, and incidentally, those reductions are in the markets that are having problems, so you see -- Continental Europe, that's where you see the severance action. So we have to match revenue and expenses, and if we're not forecasting a big recovery in Continental Europe, you can expect severance in Continental Europe to match the lack of revenue growth.","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And finally, what's your expectation for CapEx for 2012?","Frank Mergenthaler","$150 million is probably a good number, Bill.","Michael I. Roth","The other piece of that is what are we forecasting for M&A, right? And although we were short of spending our dollars in 2011, we're going to use around $200 million for 2012, which is a rollover of some of the stuff we have in the pipeline in 2011 and our expected budget for '12.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Chesler, Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Let me just re-ask Bill's question about the margin progression in 2012. So we know -- with 2011 in mind, in terms of the progression towards the 50 basis points for the full year, which is your full year target, maybe the answer is obvious because of your comments about the revenue headwinds in that first half. But is this a year where, again, we'll see most of that forward progress in the latter part of your fourth quarter even?","Frank Mergenthaler","Matt, again, I would look to the phasing you've seen over the last 2 or 3 years. As Michael pointed out, we build our budgets bottoms up for the year. Quarterly phasing of those annual budgets, there's some art to it, right? But we're focused on building our plans for the year, and we hold our operators accountable for delivering their annual results. We do phase it, but again, there's always movements quarter-to-quarter, as Michael pointed out, like we saw in the second quarter last year, where we got a lot of pressure because our revenue was short. We said the majority of it will slip into third quarter. It did.","Michael I. Roth","I think your observation on the headwinds is a valid one. We have to make up some ground. Also, new business wins don't kick in the second you win them. So I mean, you have to factor all that in, but our business unit\u2019s factor in as well existing client growth and where this launches and so on. So it's a combination of making up any shortfalls and existing client pipelines. And so that's why we don't give quarterly guidance because we know that there are cases where this is going to be lumpy. And I think what you're seeing is we put out numbers that we believe we're going to deliver on a full year basis, and so far, we've been pretty good at that.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","On the revenue headwinds, are they concentrated to any particular market, perhaps, the U.S. because of SCJ? And in Latin America, growth has been incredibly strong. You guys are performing well broadly there. Could we see significant double-digit revenue numbers there continue for a number of quarters? And finally, just an update quickly on the NOL position in Europe would be great, too.","Michael I. Roth","All of that, okay. Look, obviously, Latin America is hot. There's no reason to expect us not to continue strong performance. They have a few events coming in Latin America like the Olympics and the World Cup. So that, obviously, will help in terms of the momentum in Latin America. Plus it's a solid environment where we're seeing a lot of growth. I think the headwinds are probably more domestic than international, particularly because of SCJ, although there was a foreign component with SC Johnson, as well as the Microsoft runoff that's embedded in there. So I think it's more skewed to the United States.","Frank Mergenthaler","On the NOLs, Matt, we started the year with $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion. We used $400 million of losses, which leaves us about $1.4 billion left, with about $1.1 billion of them being attached to Europe.","Operator","James Dix, Wedbush.","James Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Just 2 things. I guess just a little more color on maybe the U.S. growth. You talked about the headwinds maybe falling more in the U.S., I guess, especially in the first half of the year. When you look at your 3% organic, are you expecting U.S. to be kind of, at the end of the day, kind of in line with that or any material deviation from that for the full year basis? And then the second question was just -- incentives, they dropped a little bit as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter. I'm just wondering whether you thought -- for the full year, you were basically paying out a fairly full bonus pool. And kind of what we should be looking for kind of that typical 3.5% to 4% range for 2012?","Michael I. Roth","Well, our incentives are based purely on performance, so I think 3.5% to 4%. Hopefully, we'll hit 4%. I mean, that means we exceeded our budgets, and everybody's going to be happy with that. As far as U.S., look, we're 55% in the United States, and so obviously, that gets factored into our growth numbers to that effect. So again, we can't talk about it by quarter, but obviously, our results are skewed to the United States. ","Well, thank you. And again, thank you all for your support, and it should be an exciting year for us. Thank you.","Frank Mergenthaler","Thanks, everybody.","Operator","Thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jerome J. Leshne","Good morning. Thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com, and we'll refer to both in the course of this call. This morning, we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks, to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 a.m. Eastern.","During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company, which are subject to uncertainties in the cautionary statement included in our earnings release and the slide presentation and further details in our 10-K and other filings with the SEC.","At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael Isor Roth","Thank you, Jerry, and thank you all for joining us for our review of our fourth quarter and the full 2012 results. As usual, I'll begin by covering key highlights. Frank will then provide additional financial information in detail, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies, the tone of the business and significant developments, to be followed by a Q&A.","Beginning with revenue, our fourth quarter organic increase was 0.4%, which brought us to 0.7% for the full year. After 2 years of organic growth results that were among the best in our industry, we faced challenging comps, as well as revenue headwinds in 2012 of approximately 3%. While we were able to show growth despite these significant hurdles, it was not at the levels we had originally targeted when we came into the year. It's important to note that as we enter 2013, our performance in terms of client retention and new business has improved markedly, and we have fully cycled the 2011 client losses.","Turning back to the full year 2012. Results in many of the world's most dynamic emerging markets, including Brazil, China and India, were consistently strong. These were offset by lower client spend in the U.S. and macro challenges in Europe, which we had noted in our third quarter and continued in Q4. By region, our fourth quarter largely tracked the trends we had noted throughout the year. Organic growth in LatAm was 8.6%, and in Asia Pac market, it was 11.4%. Our growth in Asia Pac over the last few years has made it our largest region outside the U.S., having surpassed Continental Europe in 2012. Continental Europe, our organic revenue decrease was 2.6% for the year, reflecting the ongoing challenges of regional economic conditions. In the U.K., revenue grew 4.8% for the full year.","Overall, our international organic revenue growth was 3.8% for the year. In the U.S., the organic decrease of 1.8% for the year reflects 4% of domestic headwinds that we called out for you at the beginning of the year. It is clear that the difference between our organic performance in 2012 and that of our peers was primarily the result of account losses in 2011.","We're turning the page to 2013 with much improved net new business performance over the course of 2012. The key for us is that our offerings remain fully competitive. Not only are we seeing strong growth in emerging markets, but our digital offerings also continued their strong growth in 2012 at both our pure play digital agencies and the embedded digital capabilities throughout all of our agency brands.","Turning from revenue to expenses. Our results continue to reflect careful and effective cost management. During the quarter, total operating expenses decreased organically by 1.4% from a year ago and, for the full year, increased by only 0.005% organically. This performance enabled us to maintain our operating margin level of 9.8% despite a year that was more challenging to revenue than expected. For the full year, diluted earnings per share were $0.94, and excluding our Facebook transactions, diluted EPS was $0.82.","We continue to be very active in using the strength of our balance sheet to drive value creation. In Q4, we repurchased 14 million shares, bringing our activity for the year to 33 million shares and $351 million. In addition, we were opportunistic in the capital markets with the issuance of $800 million of debt at the lowest rates in IPG history. The funds will be used to finance 2 debt calls in March and July of this year.","We also sold our remaining investment in Facebook and, in so doing, increased our existing share repurchase authorization by $100 million. We are pleased to announce today 2 additional measures: an increase of 25% to the quarterly dividend and additional share repurchase authorization in the amount of $300 million on top of the $100 million remaining on our repurchase authorization as of January 1. These are further signs of the strength of our financial condition and our confidence in the operating trajectory of our business.","Over the past 2 years since initiating our return of capital programs, we've put nearly $1 billion to work for shareholders in dividends and the repurchase of 75 million common shares. We've also retired an additional 33 million diluted share equivalents in convertible debt. As we move into 2013, macro conditions remain uncertain in many of the world's larger markets. And as a result, our outlook for the year is appropriately measured. That said, we remain confident in the value of our services and competitiveness of our agency brands, as well as our continuing strong cost disciplines.","Accordingly, with 2013 organic revenue growth consistent with our peers, we will resume the expansion of our operating margin. With organic growth in the 2% to 3% range, an improvement of 50 basis points on this year's operating margin of 9.8% is an achievable target. We've shown that we can drive significant margin expansion when we deliver organic revenue growth at or above industry levels.  Continuing that progress so as to reach competitive margins of approximately 13% under U.S. GAAP remains a top priority for us. Alongside that objective, we plan to continue to use our financial strength to drive EPS growth and shareholder value creation.","I will now turn it over to Frank to continue the discussion of our performance.","Frank Mergenthaler","Good morning. As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of our results, including a number of the highlights Michael called out. Q4 organic revenue growth was 0.4%. We grew 1.8% internationally and decreased 1% in the U.S.","Full year organic growth was 0.7%. Our operating expenses remained very well controlled, with the increase from Q3 to Q4 associated with our much larger revenue quarter in Q4. Year-on-year, total operating expenses decreased organically in the fourth quarter. Q4 operating income was $410 million and operating margin was 19.9%, the highest level IPG has attained in 10 years, an improvement 130 basis points from a year ago. This brought our margin for the full year to 9.8%. Q4 diluted earnings per share was $0.68, which includes the benefit of a gain in the sale of our Facebook shares, which is reflected in other income. Excluding Facebook, our diluted EPS was $0.56 in the fourth quarter. For the full year, our diluted earnings per share was $0.94. Excluding the impact of Facebook, EPS was $0.82.","We ended the quarter with $2.59 billion of cash and short-term marketable securities on the balance sheet. That total includes cash proceeds of approximately $800 million from our debt issuance in November, which is earmarked for the call of 2 debt issues in March and July of this year. Average diluted shares decreased 11% for the year. Our basic share count outstanding on 12\/31\/2012 was down to $414 million.","As you have seen in our announcement earlier today, our board has authorized a 25% increase to our quarterly dividend from $0.06 to $0.075 a share and a new $300 million authorization for our share repurchase program. Furthermore, we have exercised our call of our convertible notes, which includes approximately $17 million diluted shares.","Turning to Slide 3, you see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. Here, it's worth highlighting other income of $95 million consists almost entirely of the Facebook gain. Our effective Q4 tax rate of 29.5% reflects the impact of Facebook and discrete tax items. Excluding those effects, our normalized tax rate would have been 34%. For the full year, our normalized effective tax rate was 38.5% with similar adjustments for Facebook and discrete tax items, which is in the range we have indicated in the past.","Turning to operations on Slide 4, beginning with revenue. Revenue in the quarter was $2.06 billion, which is a reported decrease of 40 basis points due to change in currency exchange rates. The FX impact was a negative 130 basis points. We added 50 basis points due to net acquisitions and dispositions, and our organic increase was 0.4%.","For the full year, organic revenue growth was 0.7%.","As we mentioned in our calls throughout 2012, revenue headwinds from lost accounts in 2011 were approximately 3% for the full year and a bit north of 2% in Q4. As you can see on the bottom half of the slide, our Integrated Agency Network segment, where these revenue headwinds are almost entirely concentrated, was flat organically in the quarter.  Organic revenue decline for IAN for the full year was 0.8%.","Organic growth at our CMG segment was 2.7% in the quarter. This is against double-digit growth a year ago and continues the solid performance of our marketing service specialists, including PR, branding and sports marketing. For the year, CMG grew 8.2% with strong performance across all businesses.","Moving to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., our organic revenue decrease was 1% during the quarter, which reflects domestic headwinds of approximately 3%. By client sector, we saw continued growth in the U.S. in tech and telecom, auto and transportation and financial services. The consumer goods sector decreased due to an account loss last year, and the retail sector also continued to be soft. The pharma sector increased, though only slightly, due to new assignments, while we otherwise continue to see the category softness. We had growth in many areas of the U.S. portfolio, including our media business, our integrated independent agencies, CMG and McCann Worldgroup.","Turning to international markets. Organic growth was 1.8% in the quarter, driven by Asia Pac and LatAm. This brings full year organic revenue growth internationally to 3.8%. Asia Pac increased 10.8% organically for the quarter, 11.4% for the full year. For the quarter, we were led by growth in media and marketing services. Among our agencies, Draftfcb grew notably. We also had double-digit increases in Australia, India and several smaller markets. For the full year, we had double-digit growth in China, driven by growth with existing clients as well as new client wins. In LatAm, Q4 increased 6.6%, a very solid performance on top of 30%-plus growth a year ago. We were led by marketing services, media and McCann, along with contributions from new offices of R\/GA and Huge. We saw growth from multi-national and local clients and from new client wins. For the full year, organic growth was 8.6%, compounding double-digit growth in each of the previous 2 years. Brazil, our largest regional market, increased high-single digits for the full year, with growth across marketing disciplines.","Turning to the U.K., our organic revenue decrease was 6.9% in Q4, primarily due to project assignments that did not repeat from a year ago. We have a relatively large events business in the U.K., and as we have seen before, it can lead to volatility in quarterly growth. For the full year, U.K. organic revenue growth was 4.8%.","Continental Europe decreased 2.5% organically in Q4. While we continued to grow in Germany, our largest market on the continent, we had decreases in France, Italy and Spain, as well as a number of smaller markets. In our other markets group, revenue increased 2% organically in the quarter, which reflects our growth in the Middle East, North Africa region and South Africa, partially offset by decline in Canada.","On Slide 6, we recap the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. Most recent data point is 0.7%, our 2012 result.","Moving to Slide 7 and operating expenses. Our operators continue their effective focus on expense management while also investing in talent and capabilities to build our offerings around the world. From a year-on-year standpoint in the fourth quarter, total operating expenses decreased 1.4% organically, which includes a notable decrease in incentives, demonstrating the leverage on this expense line and our commitment to a culture of accountability. For the full year, total expenses increased only 0.5%.","Total salaries and related expense were 55% of revenue in Q4. Base payroll, benefits and tax was 44.3% of revenue in Q4 compared with 42.7% a year ago. Underneath that, Q4 headcount grew modestly compared to the same period a year ago, approximately 2%, with over 1\/3 of our increase from net acquisitions. The balance of our hiring reflects organic investment growing disciplines in regions, which was partially offset by a decrease in the U.S. and Continental Europe consistent with revenue decreases. Sequentially, compared to Q3, our headcount decreased slightly, as we were aggressive with our severance actions where required. Year-end headcount was 43,300.","Severance expense was 1.6% of Q4 revenue compared with 2.1% a year ago, though higher than we had anticipated going into the quarter due in part to senior-level changes at McCann. Most of the actions we took in Q4 were to align our headcount with 2013 budgets by market and discipline. For the full year, severance was 1.3% of revenue.","Incentive expense in the quarter was 2.2% of revenue compared with 3.2% a year ago, which reflects a Q4 decrease of 30%. For the full year, incentive expense decreased 20% and was 3% of revenue, the low end of the range we indicated during our last conference call.","For the full year 2012, total salaries and related expenses were 63.1% of revenue. We remain focused on our objective of moving this ratio to 60% or less. The keys here are competitive organic growth over time and continuing to leverage our investment in business tools, analytics and processes.","Turning to office and general expenses on the lower half of the slide. Fourth quarter O&G expense was $520 million or 25.2% of revenue, an improvement of 130 basis points compared to a year ago, with leverage on nearly all major expense categories. For the full year, O&G expense was 27.1% of revenue compared with 27.4% a year ago. Our improvement of 30 basis points is due to leverage on occupancy expense and professional fees.","Occupancy was 7% of revenue for the full year 2012, an improvement of 20 basis points. Square feet per employee declined again during the year to 230, a 20.1% decrease since our year-end 2005, continuing our progress to our objective of 220 square feet per employee.","On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis with the most recent data point of 9.8% for 2012. In '12, our limited growth made it challenge to expand margins for the 12-month period, but we also had strong performance from our operating teams on expenses. We are confident that our expense discipline positions us to resume our margin expansion in 2013 under competitive organic revenue growth with the ultimate goal of reaching peer-level profitability.","Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 9. Our year-end position in cash and short-term marketable securities was $2.59 billion compared with $2.32 billion a year ago. The comparison includes $800 million this year from our November debt issuance and net cash proceeds of $95 million from the sale of our Facebook shares in November. It also reflects over $450 million returned to shareholders during 2012 in the form of share repurchase and common stock dividends and a reduction of our long-term debt by $150 million in Q1.","On Slide 10, we turn to cash flow for the quarter. Q4 cash from operations was $802 million compared to $717 million a year ago, including $408 million from working capital compared with $344 million. Full year cash from operations was $357 million compared with $273 million in 2011. As a reminder, our operating cash flow is seasonal. Our business tends to generate significant cash from working capital in the fourth quarter and use in working capital in the first quarter.","Investing activities in Q4 generated $22 million, which includes proceeds of $95 million from the sale of our remaining investment in Facebook. Financing activities generated $570 million, which includes the proceeds from our November debt issuance. Primary uses of cash include $150 million for repurchasing 14 million common shares and $25 million for our quarterly common stock dividend.","The net increase in cash and marketable securities in the quarter was $1.39 billion. Cash flow for the full year appears in our presentation appendix. It's worth noting a few items, namely CapEx, acquisitions and tax. Our CapEx was $169 million. As usual, this was divided between our IT investments and improving and refreshing our real estate. Our targeted CapEx, as we have said previously, is approximately $150 million annually, while in any given year, it can be north or south of that as level's a resulting of timing.","During 2012, we invested $146 million in acquisitions. This included several digital specialist agencies around the world, acquisitions in healthcare marketing and a leading shopper marketing agency. Our M&A pipeline continues to be very strong. While timing can shift between periods, we continue to target $150 million to $200 million annually. We remain focused primarily on high-growth disciplines and markets, expanding our digital capabilities and opportunistically strengthening our presence in key world markets.","Cash taxes for the year were $96 million. Excluding the effect of the Facebook transaction, this represents a cash tax rate of 17% of pretax income. We continue to benefit from our operating loss carryforwards and a cash tax rate lower than our effective book rate. In 2013, we estimate our cash tax rate will be in the range of 20% to 22%, still lower than our expected effective book rate of 37% to 39%.","On Slide 11 is our total debt at year end from 2007 through 2012. You can see our trend of deleveraging over this period. The increase at our year end 2012 was temporary due to the double carry of $800 million we issued in November to finance the redemption of 2 debt calls in March and July. Excluding the redundant $800 million, the pro forma year-end debt level was $1.652 billion.","Last week, we announced the call of our $200 million 4.75% convertible notes effective March 15. There are 17 million diluted shares related to these convertible notes. To the extent note holders participate in the call and do not convert, their shares will come out of our diluted share count. Should some note holders convert to common stock, we intend to address those shares in our open market repurchases. Additionally, in July, we plan to exercise our option to call our 10% $600 million senior notes at a price of 105.","Slide 12 shows the total of our average basic and diluted shares over the last 3 years and, at the far right, depicts the total as of year end 2012. You can see that average total shares decreased approximately 14% between 2010 and 2012. Most of that reduction happened between 2011 and '12. A starting position for this year, 2013, is 457 million, on the right. That is already a going-in decrease of 5% from the 2012 average. As we pointed out, with our board's action this week, the total of our repurchase authorizations is $400 million, and we are addressing these shares in our remaining convertible debt.","Turning to Slide 13. In summary, while top line growth was challenging, we are well positioned for 2013. We continue to build on a record of strong expense discipline. With a return to growth, we expect to resume our margin expansions in '13. We have significantly decreased our outstanding shares with more to come this year. Our plans to call both of our remaining convertible debt and our 10% note will remain in a meaningful benefit to interest expense beginning in July of this year, all of which means we are positioned for strong comparable EPS growth.","With that, let me turn it back over to Michael.","Michael Isor Roth","Thank you, Frank. Well, 2012 challenged us in terms of growth, but we proved our ability to manage cost, continue to invest in growth areas of the business and drove significant value creation through our strong balance sheet and return of capital to our owners. Our results reflect strength in the digital capabilities across all our agencies, which continue to position us to capitalize on the rapid changes that are taking place in the media and consumer environment. This was evident across the portfolio at stand-alone digital specialists such as R\/GA and Huge, within our global networks in all marketing disciplines and at our integrated U.S. independent agencies.","Mediabrands posted very strong performance, demonstrating that the new media model we introduced 5 years ago continues to evolve ahead in the marketplace. Both UM and Initiative are strong brands, and the early indicators are that our recently created third network, BPN, is getting traction and opportunities for growth. The emerging media capabilities at Mediabrands, such as our automated trading desk, social and mobile offerings and ORION holdings are posting growth as they expand further into international markets.","Our focus on marketing services is being rewarded, as CMG posted strong performance for the year. Across the disciplines, major brands such as Weber Shandwick, GolinHarris and DeVries in PR, Octagon in sports marketing, Jack Morton in experiential marketing and FutureBrand are all growing share in their respective areas of expertise and show great progress in building their digital talent base.","Our U.S. independent integrated agencies are also very strong. They include Hill Holliday, Mullen, The Martin Agency and Deutsch, which works with Lowe internationally. The caliber of this group was highlighted by the recent announcement of AdAge's A-list of the industry's top 10 industries. Along with R\/GA, Mullen and Deutsch were on the list, as was Lowe, whose Colombian operation, Lowe-SSP3, was named International Agency of the Year. Lowe continued to grow with Unilever, its largest client, win sizable accounts in key growth markets such as Brazil and India and further improve its standing as one of the industry's most creative global networks.","At McCann, we made a necessary management transition to a successful long-time leader within IPG, Harris Diamond, supported by 2 outstanding advertising executives, Luca Lindner and Gustavo Martinez, who joined Harris in the newly created Office of the Chairman. The team has been well received by clients and other key constituents as well as internally. They've begun to add talent in key need areas, and we believe the company is on the right footing to deliver growth and enhance profitability.","While Draftfcb cycled through a number of account losses, it nonetheless delivered on its profitability goals. The challenge for the organization is to take its fully integrated model and combination of art and science to the next level so as to drive organic growth. Upgrades in key creative roles domestically and a closer alignment with Mediabrands globally will help it in this regard. As we previously indicated, we're working with management to recruit the next leader for the agency. That process has been moving along, and we should name a new CEO by the end of the first quarter.","In emerging international markets, our results were strong last year on top of outstanding performance in 2011. Across our 3 global advertising networks, Mediabrands and CMG, our presence in these markets has been significantly strengthened in recent years through our M&A activity and organic investment in talent. In the aggregate, we are now well representative relative to our competitors in key growth markets with notable strength in India, Brazil and the MENA region.","Operationally, during 2012, we continued to show that we are increasingly disciplined and financially sound. We opportunistically tapped the capital markets to prefund future maturities, locking in the lowest rates in our history. With our board's ongoing support, we used our balance sheet to further drive shareholder value through our dividend and share repurchase programs, both of which we have enhanced to date, showing the continued confidence in the future of our business. Our credit profile was recognized by our extremely successful debt issuance during the fourth quarter. Most important, though, was our ability to respond to a volatile economy and our revenue headwinds by closely managing costs, also evident in our aligning incentives to the reality of our performance.","Looking forward, the macro business environment remains uncertain in many of our larger markets, with measured growth expected in the U.S., Continental Europe remaining challenged and emerging markets likely to garner greater spend on the part of our clients, as was the case last year. Key client sectors will remain highly competitive with auto, consumer technology, financial services and retail likely to lead the way. For the most part, clients have strong balance sheets, and there was a continued willingness to invest, particularly behind those services where we can demonstrate our effectiveness.","We are coming into this year in a much stronger position than 2012 with respect to account retention and new business activity. Our pipeline is strong with opportunities from existing clients as well as net new client pitches, and we have fully competitive offerings across our portfolio. We expect to return to organic revenue growth performance commensurate with that of our peers in 2013. With growth in the 2% to 3% range, we are confident that we can convert at a high level and resume the trajectory of margin expansion that we've shown in recent years, which would make a 50-basis-point improvement on top of this year's 9.8% operating margin an achievable target. Combined with our strong balance sheet and return of capital programs, this should put us in position to deliver EPS growth and enhance shareholder value in 2013 and the years to come.","We thank you for your support, and now we'll turn it over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alexia Quadrani, JPMC.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you give us a sense of how revenues are trending so far in 2013? I guess, any colors you can give us in terms of client budgets and their outlook? And do you think you'll get positive organic revenue growth in the first quarter?","Michael Isor Roth","Alexia, always asking for the next current results. Look, the trend from the third quarter to the fourth quarter was positive. So obviously, we would hope that to continue. We don't give quarterly guidance, Alexia, as you know. The good news is, for example, in 2013, we had some nice wins in our portfolio. Most notably was the SABIC win in Saudi Arabia. They are a global petrochemical diversified company. And what we were most proud about that was that it was a pitch head to head against our -- all of our holding company competitors, and the integrated offering including Weber Shandwick and McCann really showed well in that pitch, and we're really excited about it. There are other wins in -- so far in 2013. So as we indicate, we're positioned for 2013 to deliver peer-level organic performance and expand margins. Let me -- and while you're here, let me just comment on the 9.8% because I know that's one of the questions. When we come to year end, we take a look at a lot of actions we can do in terms of achieving our targets and our stated goals, particularly at the end of the -- in the first -- fourth quarter, we faced issues like severance and, obviously, incentive comp, and we can take actions that potentially could hurt us in the future to achieve short-term goals. So for example, we made some changes at McCann, as we all know, and that carried with it a severance expense. So if you recall, we had indicated severance expense in the range of 1%. We ended up for the year at 1.3%, and we've decided that these are the actions that we need to take to position us for 2013, and as a result, that additional severance impacted our margin. The same is on incentive. Although we've indicated incentive comp is one of the key variables in our variable cost model, we still have to pay incentives to motivate and reward good performance, and certainly, among our agencies, we had very high-performing agencies that we had to compensate appropriately for their performance. So all of this together sort of indicates that we were a little disappointed in the margin. We're hitting 2013 with some good news behind us, and frankly, in our pipeline, we see some potential opportunities that, if they come to fruition, I think you'll be very pleased, as we would be, in terms of the revenue outlook for 2013.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, Michael, just to follow up on it, I was pleased to hear that McCann Worldgroup was a positive contributor in the quarter. Looking at 2013, I know it's still early days after the change of management there, but do you think it could be, I guess, a real positive contributor in '13? Or do you think it'll still sort of trail the rest of the company's results?","Michael Isor Roth","Well, look, I've -- Harris and the team and I have been in a lot of meetings with them with clients. I think they really have been making their presence well felt within our existing clients. As you know, existing clients is our main source of revenue growth, and I'm very pleased the way Harris and the whole team have been received by our client base. So I think with respect to existing clients, I'm comfortable in terms of where we are, and I do believe that their offering is evidenced in the SABIC, as well as some other wins that we have out there. Remember, wins from existing clients don't make the headlines the way pitches do, so it's not that McCann isn't winning business out there. They have won business, and therefore, I'm comfortable that the direction that the new team at McCann is taking will enhance our overall profitability and move us forward.","Operator","The next question comes from John Janedis, UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Michael, obviously, Europe's been fairly sluggish for a few quarters now. Embedded in that guide of the 2% to 3%, does Europe need to move into positive territory? And is your visibility better today versus this time last year?","Michael Isor Roth","No, it does not have to move into positive territory. We said this before. We are not assuming a big recovery in Europe, and it would be great if it's there. Obviously, when you see a positive number for us in the U.K., it's reflected in our results, and we're pleased with it. But I don't see any great green shoots, if you will, that would turn that around in the short term, and therefore, we're not counting on it with respect to that number that we gave you.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","In terms of visibility across the broader platform?","Michael Isor Roth","Well, visibility in the U.K. -- in Europe, who has visibility in Europe? Every day, we wake up in the morning and we see new news out there. Look, Germany is doing -- performing for us. We hope that continues. We hope France stabilizes. That's an important factor for us, but we don't see any great visibility in terms of the turnaround, nor are we accounting on it. What we have to do is manage our costs with the consistent notion that we don't see the big recovery. So a fair amount of severance cost that you see comes out of rightsizing our businesses in those markets that are -- that we don't see turning around quickly.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then both you and Frank spoke about some of the changes at McCann and related severance. With Harris now in the role for 3 months or so, do you see much more in terms of incremental personnel change? And is there a potential for severance to tick up this year? Or do you think you're done there?","Michael Isor Roth","We always put out 1%. We always debate what the right number is for severance. We manage our severance based on the needs of the businesses. So as I said, we had put down guidance on severance of 1%. We came in at 1.3%. If you want to do the math, if you add the 0.3% to the 9.8%, you get to 10.1%. I know we don't have the luxury of doing that, but the point is, we make business decisions based on the needs and on long-term value creation. We think Harris and his team are focusing on talent where the growth areas are. I expect to see some additional talent added to McCann. That's consistent with where we said we would be, and so that's all built into our plan. Whether there's extraordinary severance as a result of that, we don't expect that, but we will see some key talent people being added into the growth markets to help us along in terms of the competitive offering.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Bank, RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions on the sort of balance sheet, generally. The first is, if you look at the combined retirement of the debt that's going to be funded by the $800 million you prefunded, can you give us a general sense of how much interest expense, annual interest expense reduction we should expect from that? The second question is you re-upped the buyback authorization, but could you give us a little bit better sense of timing as to when you expect to complete that $300 million? And I guess the last question is, when you look at your slide on sort of bank covenant leverage and you're below 1.9x slightly and you've got another kind of almost full turn of capacity and at very low leverage, how did you kind of -- how do you arrive at capital return decisions at this point, because it seems like you have a little bit more dry powder than suggested by the current authorization?","Michael Isor Roth","Well, first of all, what we said when we did the debt refinancing, that in 2013, we'd have a slight positive effect. In 2014, it should be about $0.05, and Frank and the team are shaking their heads. So that should be a $0.05 a share for us in 2014. The -- when we embarked on the \"turnaround\" of IPG, we said we were going to bolster our balance sheet, build up our cash reserves to secure any company that's going through a turnaround. We wanted to make sure we were well positioned. And what we said was that at the point in time when we felt we had sufficient visibility into the trajectory of where we were heading, we would start returning any excess cash that we had on our balance sheet to our shareholders. So when we instituted the dividend and started the share buyback program, that was us making good on the promise that we had excess cash on our balance sheet. We view shareholder buybacks and dividends as a critical component of enhancing shareholder value, and I think the $1 billion that we've returned to shareholders is a pretty good indication that we meant it when we said it. Obviously, as you go forward, the timing of when we buy in our shares is we like to use it on an orderly basis according to a program as we roll it out. But it's always a lever that you have in terms of share buyback, whether it be opportunistic or whether you wait as the visibility into the year goes on. And I think that's the way any normal company handles share buyback. So I think the key here is we've indicated how we view returning capital in the form of dividends and buybacks, and we will continue to do that, but we're not going to go out and say exactly when we're going to buy it and when we're going to increase it or not. I mean -- but I think you should get a pretty good indication of our board's view on enhancing shareholder value. On the covenants, Frank?","Frank Mergenthaler","Yes. David, we look at our leverage constantly. Right now, we're comfortable with where we are. We think that we've delevered at an appropriate level. We constantly look at maturities when they come due. I think you've seen us be very opportunistic in the capital markets to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, but right now, we're very comfortable with where we are from a leverage perspective.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Chesler, Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","You talked about a 2013 growth outlook of 2% to 3%. Can you walk us through how you got to that as a sort of an appropriate or the most reasonable realistic outcome? Just like to get a sense for whether any past account activity is going to contribute negatively or positive to that number. And does net new business this year have to be positive for you to deliver on that?","Michael Isor Roth","Well, what we have said was, coming into 2013, the amount of headwinds -- as we've said ad nauseam, we had to -- overall, 3% headwinds coming into '12. That number for 2013 is about 0.5% to 1%, okay? So that is factored into the headwinds for 2013, okay? You then overlay on top of that the various forecasts for our industry. Of course, the one we pay most attention to is Magna and its forecast for the global advertising environment, and frankly, that's in the 2% to 3% range. So we're consistent with where we see Magna forecasting. Obviously, if the overall result in terms of organic growth for our industry is higher than that, we would hope to participate in that. So using the 2% to 3% organic growth for the year, we -- and looking at our levers to enhance our margin, obviously, SRS and a few other G&A type reductions, we're comfortable we can expand our margin. We used the 30% conversion rate on the incremental revenue. Whenever we delivered peer-level performance or better on the organic side, we've converted at, at least 30%. So that's how we get to those numbers.","Frank Mergenthaler","And Matt, also behind that are bottoms-up budgets by agency, by client that incentive targets for all of our people around the world are tied to.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just talk a little bit about Mediabrands. I heard you in the prepared remarks about how Mediabrands was a positive contributor, and you're clearly feeling good about that business. But can you put that in the context of some of the news articles that we read in the trade press or other places about some of the significant changes that you're making within that organization, whether it's kind of Draftfcb or otherwise?","Michael Isor Roth","Yes. Look, Mediabrands is a great success story for us at IPG, and we're quite pleased with its performance and its direction. Basically, the changes that are being made at Mediabrands are to further enhance their offerings and be competitive in the marketplace. By using Mediabrands as a focal point in the key markets, it avoids a lot of duplication in certain areas. It isolates some of the offerings that both UM and Initiative can tap into without, certainly, violating any conflict issues, but it basically focuses the business units in the markets that are growing with the resources that are necessary. So I think Matt and the entire team have done an outstanding job in really focusing on the needs of the clients in those marketplaces and what are the tools and resources that are necessary to compete. With respect to the changes at Draftfcb, when we formed Mediabrands, what we said was that we were going to align our global networks with the brands within Mediabrands. Initiative was aligned with Draftfcb, and that has been the strategy throughout our planning process. What we're doing now is basically solidifying the relationship between Draftfcb and Initiative so that we know where the resources are. They'll be within Draftfcb. They'll be where we --- they have to be in the marketplace, but they'll be aligned directly with Initiative, which is what it takes as far as the integrated offering goes in the marketplace. So all these changes are consistent with what we said the direction of Mediabrands was heading.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Swinburne, Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I guess 2 for you, Michael, one on Asia and China. You mentioned the strength in those markets has become now a pretty big business for you guys. Are there ways to sort of supercharge that growth by being more acquisitive? Or are these markets where you really need to build organically on the ground rather than go sort of buy your way into more client penetration? And then at the risk of beating a dead horse on the 2013 outlook, and thanks for humoring me, it seems like from quarter-to-quarter, the psychology in the industry can swing wildly, so I don't want to read too much into what we've heard so far, but it does feel like there's some incrementally constructive views of 2013 in the last couple of months. Surprising to me, anyway, post the fiscal cliff resolution, but it does seem like the outlook has gotten a little bit more rosy from maybe bleak 3 or 4 months ago. Do you share that view? We heard from Omnicom and a couple others. Or are you feeling a little bit more cautious maybe than they are? I know it's hard to be at -- to put yourself in their shoes, but just I wanted to see if you'd comment on that.","Michael Isor Roth","Yes. Look, we've seen better results in terms of revenue in the fourth quarter than the third. That's no reason for us, and I said, to raise the flag and victory is here. Well, obviously, seeing the strength in our global markets is encouraging, and fortunately for us -- I mean, the statement that our Asia Pac has exceeded Continental Europe, for us, is a pretty big statement. Unfortunately, one's going one way and the other one's going the other, and that's how that happens. But I do think that we do continue to see strength in India, Brazil, in China, obviously, Australia. So Asia Pac is performing well, and it's going to be a key component of the organic growth that we stated to you. How we get there in those markets is both: we have organic growth and acquisitions. I think if you look at the transactions that we've embarked on, certainly, in India and Brazil, we've made acquisitions in digital, in media, in traditional advertising, and those type of transactions were add-ons to our various offerings, whether they be Mediabrands or our global networks, McCann, Draftfcb or Lowe. So those type of transactions are built into our pipeline in terms of acquisitions and probably will continue. China, we have a little different strategy in that we chose to expand in China, which we have been doing organically more than through acquisitions because, frankly, the acquisition route in China, unless there's something really big out there, is a difficult one, and we're more comfortable adding key talents in the various networks that we have and respond to client needs in China that way. So it's a mixed bag in terms of organic as well as acquisitions, but I think the results that we've posted show that we've been very responsive to the marketplace. Our growth in Brazil is very exciting, and our offerings down there are truly among the best in the region.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter Stabler, Wells Fargo.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple for Frank, if I could. Based on your prepared remarks, Frank, you've suggested that margin opportunity going forward is really going to be salary and related. I think you put a 60% of revenue target out there over the long term. Could you help us understand a little bit of the moving pieces in there? If we look at base benefits and tax, a bit of deleverage in the quarter and for the year. Can we see some improvement in base benefits and tax? Or are the improvements you're targeting really going to be in the other buckets going forward? And then secondly, does it matter where growth comes from? And when I say that, does it -- from a margin perspective, if CMG or IAN diverge significantly from recent trends, does that impact potential margin growth, or is it really a neutral? And then, likewise, on a regional basis? If the U.S. continues to be very sluggish, would that impact your margin target of 50 bps?","Frank Mergenthaler","Peter, on the margin growth side, the critical component here is growth and converting that growth at -- we put out a number of 30%, and we're pretty comfortable with that. And we've seen, in years with growth, we've achieved it. So if you do the math and, whether it be 2% or 3%, convert at that level, you may need some incremental leverage in O&G, but not much so that we're factored on -- we're focused on is continuing to drive greater leverage from our people. And we saw this year, in a no-growth environment, it's tough, right? We saw base and benefits move up a little bit, and we offset that by reduction incentives. That's not a sustainable model. We need growth. With respect to the margin profile, without getting into specifics, there are certain regions that are higher-margin regions than others. So there is some merit to -- depending on where the growth happens, how does that impact the overall product, sure. Right? And the U.S. is our strongest from a margin perspective without the -- throughout the whole portfolio. So that does matter.","Michael Isor Roth","Yes, and so does the mix of business. I mean, all our businesses don't have the same margin. I know your next question is which ones or why. We're not going to do that, but the answer is the mix of our business has an impact as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Wieser, Pivotal Research.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","I just want to drill on a bit into both McCann and Draft because you did mention some favorable trends there. Did you see the -- what was favorable? Was it inside of some of the sub business units? By that, I mean McCann Erickson versus MRM versus Momentum? Or -- and it's the same for Draft. Was it -- did you see strength by country? Or was it by particular kind of client? One of the questions we tend to hear a lot about is, are these entities broken, and of course, we know that these are global networks that have a lot of strengths. So I'm just curious if you could characterize where the strength is because we know it's there. It's just hard to tell from outside.","Michael Isor Roth","Well, I'm glad you say neither of these, say, global networks are broken. All right. There are areas for improvement that we've been focusing on it. I think the key issue in Draftfcb is that it was cycling through some client losses, and when you do that, I mean, it's a tremendous accomplishment to be able to achieve your targets on profitability when you have to cycle through client losses. Of course, they've added new business during that period, and those -- and that business that was added goes to the issue of their competitiveness in the marketplace, and that was good. So the SeaWorld one, Fidelity win, these are the kind of wins that Draftfcb posts, and they started recovering against the client wins that they had. So we're comfortable with the competitiveness of their offering. A good amount of their wins are both in above the line, as well as below the line, as they say, but they don't view Draftfcb and nor do we in that context anymore. They're a fully integrated network, and that's the type of businesses that they compete in and win on. McCann, certainly, international was a good component for McCann, and that shows the breadth and the strength of the McCann Worldgroup. Your point on the Worldgroup versus McCann Erickson, MRM is a very powerful offering and showed some great client wins, notably at GM for sure, their healthcare businesses, Momentum. So they have very strong businesses in their own rights, but the McCann Worldgroup includes McCann Erickson. And when we talk about McCann, we talk about the entire global network, which continues to be one of the premier global networks in the business. And what we've been doing is enhancing its overall talent and business focus to bring it to the levels that we believe it should be at.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Dix, Wedbush Securities.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Just 2 things. I guess, if you could give a little color on what you think the predictability is of your full year margin and revenue targets given you have a fairly high reliance on the fourth quarter every year, in particular over some higher-margin revenues, including our presumed some pay-for-performance items, which will get trued up toward the end of the year? And are there any systems or initiatives, which you think you're putting in place on the inside that are improving your ability to kind of track that as you go through the year? And then, I guess, just secondly, how best should we think about the timing of achievement of your long-term peer margin goals? Is it -- is the best thing to kind of assume roughly that 30% incremental flow-through and then pencil it out based on whatever our own growth assumptions are? I just want to raise that just because it doesn't look like the industry's going to be getting to that 4% to 5% organic growth level, which I think was kind of a key assumption back at your Investor Day. So I just wanted to kind of revisit that with you.","Michael Isor Roth","Yes. Jim, I think that's a fair point. When we had our Investor Day, it seems like years ago, we did use a 4% to 5% growth number to achieve our competitive margins by 2013. Given the reductions in revenue growth that we've experienced during this period, I think it's fairly safe to say, by doing the numbers, as you just did, it's moved out about a year in terms of achieving our target. I think the key here is that trajectory is where we're heading, and we will get there. It make take us a year or so longer, but we're focused on getting there. As far as the reliability of our forecast in the fourth quarter, it's not quite the music business. I'm dating myself when I talk about the music business, where the records would sell in the last month of the year and that was the whole year. And so we do it from a bottoms-up, as Frank indicated, and the cyclicality of our business is built into our forecasting. It may not be 100% accurate, but it's there.","Frank Mergenthaler","James, remember, it's thousands of clients in 100 countries, right? So it's difficult to get any degree of predictability.","Michael Isor Roth","Well, thank you very much. We appreciate the support, and we look forward to an exciting 2013.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I'd now like to introduce Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jerome Leshne","Good morning. Thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com and will refer to both in the course of this call. This morning, we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks, to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 a.m. Eastern.","During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company. These are subject to uncertainties and the cautionary statement included in our earnings release and the slide presentation and further detailed in our 10-K and other filings with the SEC. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful, supplemental data that while not a substitute for GAAP measures allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance.","At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael Isor Roth","Thank you, Jerry, and thank you for joining us this morning as we review our results for the first quarter. As been our practice I'll start out by recovering highlights of our performance, Frank will then provide additional details and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies to be followed by a Q&A.","We're pleased to report our strongest growth quarter in two years despite the year. Organic revenue growth in the first quarter was 6.6% driven by implement. Our seasonal Q1 operating loss includes significantly the 12 million from 42 million a year ago, reflecting effective operating leverage on our principal expense categories.","As a result, diluted EPS was a loss of $0.05 per share compared with the loss of $0.14 share a year ago. Our growth reflects both increases with existing clients as well as new business wins. We will led by double-digit increases in the auto, healthcare and financial service sectors.","In the U.S., organic growth was 4.8% comprised the growth across most of our businesses notably McCann, Mediabrands, our digital specialist agencies, many of our U.S. integrated agencies and public relations.","It's worth noting that U.S. organic growth would have been 6.5% excluding the decline in past through revenue during the quarter. This was primarily from our event business. International organic growth was strong at 9.1%, we had double-digit increases in LatAm, Asia-Pac and the U.K. as well as a welcome return to growth in Continental Europe, which was up organically by 3.8%. International performance was strong across the portfolio. All of our global networks contributed as did our digital agencies and our marketing service specialist at CMG.","Turning to expenses and margins, total operating expenses increased 4% compared with our 6.1% reported revenue growth. Operating leverage on our salaries and related expenses improved by 80 basis points. While leverage on our office and general expenses improved by 130 basis points. As a result, Q1 operating margin improved by 200 basis points and our operating loss in Q1, which is seasonally our smallest revenue quarter improved by $31 million.","As we indicated on our last call, cost discipline and margin enhancement are our top priority for this year and we were able to execute against that objective during the quarter. Our capital structure and financial strength continue to be a source of value creation in Q1. As previously announced in February, our Board approved the 27% increased to our quarterly dividend and authorized an additional 300 million share repurchase program.","During Q1, we repurchased 3 million shares using $45 million. Over the trailing 12 months, repurchases were 28 million shares using approximately $450 million. We have approximately 375 million remaining in our authorization. But there is noting that this is the first quarter and also our smallest revenue quarter, so the results we are sharing today need to be kept in the profit perspective.","However, we are encouraged by the fact that performance in the quarter speaks to the competitiveness of our agencies and the quality of our global assets in key growth markets. We therefore remain well positioned to deliver or exceed our financial targets for the full year.","At this stage, I'll turn things over the Frank to some additional detail on our results and I'll join you after these remarks for an update on the tone of our business and an update on our agencies to be followed by the Q&A. Frank?","Frank Mergenthaler","Thank you, Michael. Good morning. As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast.","On slide 2, you'll see an overview of results, a number of which Michael's touch upon. Organic growth was 6.6% in the first quarter. We typically have a loss in our seasonally small first quarter which was 12 million this year a significant improvement from a year ago. Operating margin was negative 0.7% compared with negative 2.7% in Q1 2013. We drilled operating leverage on both of our principal operating expense lines compared to last year.","Turning to slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow.","Here, it's worth noting that interest expense was dramatically lower from a year ago. You will recall that in Q1 13, we carried temporary higher debt balance having issued new data ahead of debt redemptions later in the year.","In addition, the comparison also reflects the lower underlying run rate of our interest expense this year. Also worth noting here is a very low tax benefit in Q1 compared to last year. The Q1 rate this year was only 7%, which is result of our mix of profitability in the quarter by tax jurisdiction around the world. We continue to expect that our reported tax rate will be in the range around 39% this year, while our cash tax rate should be 20% to 22% of pre-tax income.","Turning to revenue on slide 4, revenue was 1.64 billion in the quarter, an increase of 6.1%. Compared to Q1 2013, the impact of the change and exchange rates was negative of 140 basis points while net acquisitions added 90 basis points. Resulting organic revenue increase is 6.6%.","As you can see on the bottom half of this slide, we had very solid growth in both segments. At our integrated agency network segment organic growth was 6.8% with strong increases in both the U.S. international markets. At CMG, organic growth was 5.7% led by continued and outstanding performance in our PR agencies and growth and sports marketing.","Moving on to slide 5, revenue by region, in the U.S. Q1 organic revenue was 4.8%. Leading client sectors were auto and healthcare pass-through revenues as well as related direct expenses will lower than a year ago which was a drag on U.S. growth with most of the decrease occurring in our events business.","Turning to international markets, the U.K. grew 10.7% organically. We had growth in nearly all client sectors paced by auto and telecom. Among our agencies, we are notable increase in our marketing and service specialist including our event specialist Jack Morton and that McCann.","Unlike the U.S., we have higher pass-through revenue expense in the U.K. due to growth of our events business. This increased our growth rate in the region which would have otherwise been organic of 3.7%. It\u2019s worth noting that our total growth was 21% including acquisitions in the region notably FCB Inferno and Lowe Profero.","Continental Europe increased 3.8% organically, marking our first quarter of growth in the content over two years. We were led by low Mediabrands and CMG. We had growth in several of our largest national markets on the content including Germany, France and Spain. In Asia-Pac, our largest international region Q1 organic growth was 11.9% led by double-digit growth in China and Australia and solid growth in many other national markets. Our media business is very strong across the region as were McCann, CMG and RGA.","In LatAm organic growth was terrific at 18.3% on top of 16% a year ago. We had strong growth across all agencies led by McCann, Lowe, FCB and our marketing service specialist. We had double-digit growth in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina. Our other markets group made up of Canada, the Middle East and Africa increased 1.4% organically in Q1.","On slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 3.8%.","Moving on to slide 7, operating expenses. In the first quarter, total operating expense increased to 4% from a year ago which is relative to our reported revenue increase of 6.1%. Our Q1 ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue was 72.6% this year compared with 73.4% a year ago, an improvement of 80 basis points. Our base salaries benefits in tax was 60.3% of revenue in Q1 an improvement of 100 basis points leveraging our growth and benefiting for restructuring actions. Temporary labor was 3.9% in revenue compared with 3.8% a year ago. Incentive expense improved 10 basis points and severance expense improved 50 basis points as a percentage of revenue.","All other related salaries and related expenses was 3.3% of revenue compared with 2.6 a year ago.","Total headcount at quarter end was approximately 46,000, headcount increased during the quarter by 1.2% nearly half of which was due to acquisitions. A little more than 50% of our new hires were in expanding areas of the portfolio such as digital, media and higher growth regions in the world.","Turning to office and general expenses on the lower half of the slide, O&G was 28.1% of Q1 revenue an improvement of 130 basis points from a year ago. Underneath that improvement, we had 110 basis points of operating leverage and other office and general expenses mainly due to lower pass-through expenses.","On slide 8, we share our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 9.6% which excludes our Q4 restructuring expense.","Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on slide 9, we ended the first quarter with $777 million in cash and short-term marketable securities. Our cash level seasonal intends to peak at year-end. We will recall that on March 31st a year ago, we are carrying approximately $800 million of cash that we raised to prefund debt redemptions in 2013. In the bottom half of this slide on the current liabilities, the current portion of our long-term debt reflects our $350 million, 6.25% notes.","On slide 10, we turn to cash flow. Cash use in operations in Q1 was $726 million compared with $775 million a year ago. The comparison includes $723 million used in working capital this year, which is a similar to last year's level. As a reminder, our operating cash flow is seasonal. Our business tends to generate significant cash and working capital in the fourth quarter and uses cash and working capital in the first quarter. Investing activities in Q1 used $49 million for acquisitions and capital expenditures. Financing activities used $91 million mainly for share repurchase in our common stock dividends.","Typically the pace of our share the first is geared to our fourth quarter when our cash flow strongest. Our net decrease in cash and marketable securities for the quarter was $866 million compared with $940 million a year ago.","On slide 11, we show debt deleveraging from a peak of 2.35 billion in 2007 to 1.66 billion at the end of the most recent quarter end. Note that subsequent to the end of the quarter, in early April, we should 500 million of new 10 year debt at 4.2%. We'll apply a portion of the proceeds towards the early redemption of our 350 million 6.25% notes in May.","In summary, on slide 12, the quarter represents a good start in terms of achieving our financial objectives for the full year. Growth was strong in those areas of the business where we have focused our investment in both people and acquisitions that is to say high growth regions the digital and marketing service disciplines as well as the U.S. market.","We are also seeing the appropriate return on the investments made at the end of last year to one expenses. Our operations are focused on margin expansion and our balance sheet is an important area that will continue to deploy going forward.","With that, let me turn it back to Michael.","Michael Isor Roth","Thank you, Frank. Well, as you can see our quarter featured fully competitive organic revenue growth and we converted at the levels that we want to see. Our strong financial position will allow us to continue to invest in talent and targeted acquisitions as well as capital return program that drive further value creation for our shareholders.","In terms of the tone of the business, we're hearing from our operators and marketers are committed to investing behind their brands. While there are certain areas of macro uncertainty such as China, Russia and perhaps India pending results of its election, the overall environment is one that should create sufficient opportunities for us to achieve or exceed our stated growth objectives for the full year.","Our new business pipeline is solid with activity across the full range of our portfolio. As you would expect, media, digital and marketing services are dynamic areas but we are also seeing a number of RFPs in the area of integrated services both at the agency network and at the holding company level.","We had a very strong performance in these types of competitions last year and are working to replicate that result in 2014. As you know our positive 2013 net revenue business means that we entered this year with some tailwinds. These will be more favorable in the first half of the year than the full year. As previously indicated the second half will also reflect some client losses in the U.S. during the lateral part of last year.","Turning to an update on our companies, McCann had a strong quarter as it make further moves to enhance its position as a global powerhouse that delivers integrated marketing solutions to multinational and local clients. The group is winning business and has a very active new business pipeline. McCann has also continued to add senior new talent that will help take the agencies creative product which took dramatic steps forward in 2013 to an even higher level.","We continue to see strong performance of CMG, where our PR agencies are expanding geographically and in terms of capabilities. Weber and GolinHarris recently collaborated to win a significant consolidation with a top 10 multi-national client. GolinHarris and DeVries are building out the global presence and Weber Shandwick industry leading social media practice within media co is leading the way and taping a broad range of daily streams to effectively engage with consumers and these new channels.","Octagon posted solid performance to start the year and Jack Morton is moving to significantly enhance its digital offerings. Mediabrands also build on its positive momentum. UM and initiative a winning new assignment in key international markets and the groups developed market cluster is posting strong performance.","The Mediabrands digital companies including Cadreon, Reprise and Ansible continue to be growth drivers. The recently announced partnership with AOL to beta test the industry first cross screen programmatic advertising platform is another step along this journey. And our recent investment in ADstruc will allow Orion to incorporate the benefits of digital buying into our outdoor media offerings.","During the quarter, Foote, Cone & Belding announced that it was rebranding to reclaim the equity in one of our industry\u2019s most storied names as well as clearly signal it's intend to take the high ground in terms of creativity and brand stewardship. These moves compliment the agency\u2019s proven ability to deliver highly accountable marketing solutions and its single P&L model.","Domestic new business performance with win from Levis, Tulia and Jia deli chocolate is an early positive sign that the leadership and cultural shift to the agency is taking hold.","At Lowe, the focus is fully on the integration of Profero that new partnership has already won a number of projects in the U.S. and Asia. The network\u2019s leadership also continues to refine, combine (indiscernible) offerings which has recently been introduced to agency search consultants. The team lunched the new campaign for the national Milk board out of New York and recently recruited senior and creative and strategic talent into the Detroit office. And the agency is making progress in operationalizing it\u2019s significant (indiscernible) which will be run at the new office in Barcelona.","R\/GA, Huge and MRM all had very strong performances in the quarter. We continue to support these agencies as they build out new capabilities from consulting to analytics and digital retail operations. MRM's global footprint places it among the industry\u2019s leading digital networks and R\/GA is now active in over 15 markets including San Paulo, London, Sydney and Singapore with China and India currently in the planning stage.","The expansion of Huge started to reach eight U.S. cities last year. We're also seeing increased collaboration on major clients and new business initiatives from digital specialist agencies.","An additional element of our portfolio that sets us apart for many of our peers is the group of fully integrated U.S. independents such as Mullen, Hill Holiday, Martin, Deutsch and Carmichael Lynch. These agencies have fully modern offerings including strong digital analytics and channel planning capabilities and as a whole they performed well in the quarter. Significant highlights with the promotion of Karen Kaplan, Chairman of Hill Holiday and Kristen Cavallo, the President of Mullen's flagship Boston office.","Key wins during the quarter included HTC at Deutsch LA and GNC at Carmichael Lynch. Mullen's worlds become a break out viral hit (ph) also there special mention. Overall, we are pleased with progress thus far in 2014. Our portfolio with agency is strong. Our strategy embedding digital expertise across the group while also investing organically behind our digital specialist is yielding positive results.","In our ability to deliver open architecture, best the IPG Solutions is increasingly becoming a differentiator for us in the marketplace. We will always offer combinations of siloed agencies will create single client entities that disregard the value of their agency brands; our approach is wholly client specific and post together the right talent for each breeds in a highly collaborative team approach.","During the quarter, we saw a good performance from our top 20 clients, an important source of organic growth for us. We're also seeing meaningful opportunities in terms of new business. The U.S. market which is our largest remains solid. Latin America, Asia and the BRIC market posted double-digit growth. Our focus on margin expansion with evidence in the Q1 results and this will remain a top priority for us going forward.","Our financial strength has been and will continue to be a source of significant value creation. We've very effecting in deleveraging while returning about 1.7 billion to shareholders over the past three years. We believe that we remain well positioned to meet or exceed our organic growth target of 3% to 4% and achieve an operating margin level of 10.3% or better. Plus or less, 2014 is about execution, continuing to drive competitive growth while focusing on cost discipline, so as to significantly improve margins. This intern will allow us to deliver our ultimate commitment, which is the further enhance shareholder value.","With that, I'd like to thank you for your time and continue to support and open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. Our first question Alexia Quadrani with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Alexia Quadrani \u2013 JP Morgan","Thanks for the color you gave on the impressive improvement in organic revenue growth. Is there any more detail you can give us in terms of how much of that came from the tailwind of new business you won historically versus how much might be overall improvement in the marketplace?","Michael Isor Roth","Thank you and thanks for joining us this morning Alexia. Well, we said we were going to have tailwinds in the first half, and I would say in the first half they were 1.5% to 2%. And going into the second half, we're not likely to see that kind of lift from those tailwinds because of the losses that we experienced at the end of the year that you know but overall our tone is very solid Alexia which is why we're being as supportive as we are to the commitments we've made to achieve our target or exceed.","Alexia Quadrani \u2013 JP Morgan","And just to follow-up but you still see probably net positive in terms of a challenge versus headwinds when you look at the first half versus the second half?","Michael Isor Roth","Yes. Right now we're net new business positive. Yes.","Alexia Quadrani \u2013 JP Morgan","And then just on the improvement in euro market, I guess, I don't know if you can answer this question but how much sort of you really on a firmer ground now and things are bit better or how much of it is things look better but we should still expect some volatility quarter-to-quarter because it's early days?","Michael Isor Roth","One quarter, we're painfully aware of our performance in the last quarter in terms of Continental Europe. What we saw in the first quarter is our new business wins particularly Lowe CR and Zurich starting to come on board and that accounts was at the 3.8% organic growth in the first quarter. We still have a ways to go to raise any flags in Continental Europe.","As we said, for the budget, for the full year, we're budgeting slightly 1% to 2% growth in Continental Europe, it's nice to see us ahead of that in the first quarter but we still have three more quarters to go.","Alexia Quadrani \u2013 JP Morgan","Alright. Thank you very much.","Michael Isor Roth","Thank you, Alexia.","Operator","Our next question is Tim Nollen, Macquarie. Your line is open.","Tim Nollen \u2013 Macquarie Research","Hi, thanks. Couple of things, one is just ask about the growth and emerging markets versus U.S. and Europe, it seem some of your competitors have lower emerging market growth figures and kind of indicated that some multinationals are shifting budgets from emerging markets back to the U.S. and Europe which are a bit more stable at least in Europe case that it has been in the past few years. One of you could just comment on general budgets and clients spending in emerging market versus the U.S. and Europe?","Michael Isor Roth","Well, I think our results indicate that it's both. We see strong growth in our emerging market, obviously China and Latin America double-digit growth, Australia we saw a double-digit growth, India was slightly off. We had some shifting of some client business add up India and that accounted for the lack of -- the kind of growth that we were seeing in India. And as I indicated, in India a lot of dependent upon the outcome of the election that are coming up. We still believe India will be a strong growth opportunity for us and I might add we did bring our Board of Directors to India at our last Board meeting which is a positive statement to our support of our agencies in India.","And the growth in the United States continues to be solid. I think when you look through the pass-through\u2019s that we add a negative impact on in the U.S., we'll organically up 6.5%, which indicates that obviously the tone of our business in the U.S. continues to be solid. But I don't see any dramatic pullbacks if you will. But you can't continue to have double-digit growth on top of double-digit growth forever.","So I do believe, we'll see that settle down, but it will still settle down into a higher growth pattern, which we're very comfortable with. But for example in Latin America, the huge growth we saw in Latin America was on top of 16% last year. So that's very encouraging but at some point it has the level off. But client is still looking at those as markets where they can either gain market share or enhance their brand.","Tim Nollen \u2013 Macquarie Research","Okay, thanks. Can I ask another question, you call out some of your independence during particularly well right now and it strikes me that this is somewhat different between you and some of your peers that you have the separate independence, is there anything you can say about profitability or future path, you've done something in the past with putting independence in the larger groups Campbell Ewald all being a recent example, does that makes sense longer term to maintain in those independence?","Michael Isor Roth","Yes, in fact our independence continue to be among our higher margin contributing agency. I think the trend that -- in the case of putting Campbell Ewald with Lowe that was on the heels of frankly a pitch than involved Campbell Ewald and Lowe and Hill Holiday I might add in terms of the Cadillac business and we were looking to both Lowe guidance for the U.S. So we thought this was a great opportunity to do that. But the way we look at our U.S. independence they're fully integrated. They have media, they have planning, they have PR businesses, they have events, they have consulting. So if they (indiscernible) don't fix it and what we do is when our independence have global opportunities don't happen to a Lowe, McCann or FCB, the partner as well as partnering with Mediabrands offerings on a global basis. So we're quite pleased with our current structure. We don't see any immediate need to merge any of our independence because we do have this collaboration D&A at IPG. And we've been very successful in taping into these types of arrangement. So there is no need to merge them but in Lowe and Campbell Ewald it was specific and it really met a need of both the organization. So we're pleased with our Independence, they do a great job and particularly you saw Mullen and you saw the wins the Deutsch and Carmichael Lynch and Hill Holiday continues to be an outstanding performer for us.","Tim Nollen \u2013 Macquarie Research","Okay. So If I can just threw you a last softball on that topic still.","Michael Isor Roth","Okay.","Tim Nollen \u2013 Macquarie Research","The relative low margins versus your peers over the years is perhaps more due to struggles that you've had with the various large networks but you had good things to say about them McCann and now FCB, is it safe to assume that famous words but these are on the right track now and the whole group margin can rise, it's not a matter of splitting out between the traditional Agency Network and the independence but everyone is doing better now.","Michael Isor Roth","Yes and I think both Frank and my comments, we indicated that our performance improvement was of course with the Board of our global network. So that's encouraging, it's always been our position that-- our drive is to be competitive margins or better and that's what we're focused on and we do believe there is still opportunity obviously for us to expand margin. But the repositioning of Lowe in the past few years, the addition of Profero to Lowe is obviously a big help and their recent client wins particularly with CR is an indication of that competitiveness. FCB back on the right track. They have a great new management team and they perform well in the first quarter and obviously the McCann is doing well this first quarter and we expect great things from that organization. So we're very pleased and yes we're on track to achieve our goal of competitive margins and that's what we're focused on.","Tim Nollen \u2013 Macquarie Research","Alright that makes perfect sense. Thanks very much.","Michael Isor Roth","Thank you, Tim.","Operator","Our next question is Peter Stabler, Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Peter Stabler \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thank you. Good morning.","Michael Isor Roth","Good morning.","Peter Stabler \u2013 Wells Fargo","I have a couple of question on the media side. So once again, you guys called out strength and contribution from Mediabrands there seems to be a trend across the peer group. So couple of questions here, one: as you look out over the year do you think that this is kind of secular trend that can continue for multiple years and if so why and then secondly would love your updated thoughts on the idea of scale, this is a topic that we debate frequently with investors with regard to the media business, how important the scale but love your update thoughts on that. Thanks very much.","Michael Isor Roth","Sure. Let me start with scale, because obviously that question is relevant and continues to be relevant in light of some potential transactions that are out there. I've said this before peer; we compete against WPP before the announcement of Publicis and Omnicom. And if you look at the presence of WPP versus Omincom which is, they're relatively had the same side depending on markets they are in and we've been able to compete very effectively against those organizations giving our scale. So the important of scale is yes, it's important.","However, we have the relative scale, we've been able to deliver and we frankly view our size is being the right size because we have the scale to buy efficiently and have presence in the marketplace and people have to pay attention to us. We place $35 billion - $37 billion of media in total, that's not insignificant. So it gives us to see that the table but we're also more flexible, we're able to create personalize, specific and customized offerings in the planning and buying area that clients like to see and we've been very successful at it.","So I think media will continue to be a growth vehicle going forward for us. But what I like about the media and which is what I think is what's happening in our industry is the integrated offering is really coming to life here and that is the whole notion of what this model is going to look like in the future and that's from the cradle to grave. And we have this going on with a number of our clients where we look at the total pot of what the client is using to spend and take all of their dollars whether it's allocated to media buying, whether it's allocated to creative, whether it's allocated to digital, we have to look at this as a total picture and certainly media and planning is a critical component of it but so as digital, so as PR and so as experience and marketing. And that's what clients are looking for. And that's why when we get these RFP into the holding company, what we do as we approach it and a total integrated way focused on what client needs are and we don't pay attention for the sialos that are associated with it. And last year, we were very successful in that offering and so far we have a number of those going on this year which I hope to be successful in.","So I think there is a trend which is where I think it belongs and that is looking at media and our agencies that are creative, digital and PR all together and bring to the table truly the integrated offering focused on the customized need of our clients and I think that's what you're seeing.","Peter Stabler \u2013 Wells Fargo","One quick follow-up for Frank, thank you Michael.","Michael Isor Roth","Sure.","Peter Stabler \u2013 Wells Fargo","With regard to growth, however in the U.S., it was a negative offset. So could you just try to size those two things us? Was this a wash?","Frank Mergenthaler","For the U.S., it had an impact of about 170 basis points. So our actual growth was 6.5% and in the U.K. it was adversely effected growth they're sort of organically goes from 10 to 3.7. So on net and net it's a bit of a headwind on our overall because the U.S. is such a large marker for us and overall adverse impact of our organic growth by about 70 BPs.","Peter Stabler \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thank you.","Frank Mergenthaler","You're welcome.","Operator","Next question is Brian Wieser, Pivotal Research. Your line is open.","Brian Wieser \u2013 Pivotal Research","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering you know then given the the lingering delays in the Publicis Omnicom merger, do you think that's helping with the account activity at the present time?","Michael Isor Roth","Brian, I get that question a lot. I can't point to any specific clients that are in play if you will as a result as the potential merger. But there is always that kind of uncertainty that's out there. But I can't say specifically and anything we hearing anecdotally it is just that it\u2019s anecdotal. Our view is we're competing against the same players we completely against before. And frankly until that transaction is closed both Omnicom and Publicis are going in the market on as separate companies anyhow. So it's kind of businesses usual in the RFP world. But I think there is a lingering issue over that, certainly the conflict issue is there and but we haven't seen huge transformation if you will because of the conflict frankly one of the issue is -- when is these things going to happen and if it\u2019s going to happen at all and I think the point-- the key questions is client awaiting to see the same things that everybody else is waiting to see.","Brian Wieser \u2013 Pivotal Research","Obviously no status quo for now.","Michael Isor Roth","I think that's the reality of it. We have always seen recruiting opportunity, yes. Have we been able to add some very talented people to our company as a result of this I'd say somewhat yes. But really the true impact of this is yet to be see and we're all -- the client as well as all of are in the business are waiting to see what happens.","Brian Wieser \u2013 Pivotal Research","Okay. And the second I just wondering we know that Huge and RGA are obviously doing very well but is the profit profile of those agencies and may be its not them specifically but digital and agencies of that nature generally better than, comparably well run conventional agencies?","Michael Isor Roth","Well, one of the things about digital, they are more pitching in activity than some of the others because some of their businesses is project based. So therefore the new business pitches expenses. We saw that frankly at our RGA last year and we call that out in our yearend results and frankly we saw the results of that in the first quarter that RGA had a particularly good first quarter on the new business front. So I think what you see is more new business pitch activity and expenses but overall there margins have been very solid and they've been among our better performing agency. So we'll take that type of pitch expense anytime given the conversion rates that we're seeing in our digital agencies.","Brian Wieser \u2013 Pivotal Research","Got it. Thank you very much.","Michael Isor Roth","Thank you, Brian. Next question please?","Operator","James Dix, Wedbush. Your line is open.","James Dix \u2013 Wedbush Securities Inc.","Hey, good morning guys. Just a two things, in terms of the new business activity Michael, you indicated it was fairly active. Is there any key accounts where you defending at least in part maybe in some of these integrated pitches, I'm just curious what the puts and takes might be there on some of those, some of that bigger activity. And then I guess just secondly I know you have historically said you're quite comfortable being a little overweight and your U.S. business mix and it look like you had another strong quarter if you exclude the pass-through in the first quarter. But is it possible given your strength in the international growth that international might actually outpace your overall growth this year, I am just curious about how you seeing the geography shape up. Thanks.","Michael Isor Roth","Well, what's interesting is Asia-Pac became our second largest market. So there 12% the next big is the Europe I guess, it\u2019s 10%. Now we got there both by the growth in the Asia-Pac and the decline we had in Continental Europe, so that's part of it. But yes, there is no question that we're seeing an increase in Latin America as well and eventually we'll like to see that. Right now we're 57% in the U.S., 60% North America. We would like to see that a little bit less than 60% and more in the markets but it's going to take it some time to get there and the rest of the world increased. And the next question was on pitches. The most notable pitch page that public, and I had this page with public is of course the Microsoft page which we are in the final stages and we're retaining the international media part of the business of Microsoft that's we're pitching as well as hopefully increasing our business opportunity both in the media and creative and collaboration and deployment part of the business. It\u2019s a pitch, it's probably the biggest pitch out there right now and we've got a great offering there and we're quite pleased with what we put forth and frankly how some of the other holding companies as well, so we're continuing to push that. But we do have a couple of government mandatory reviews out there but other than those of the only big pitches that are out there.","James Dix \u2013 Wedbush Securities Inc.","Just one follow-up on that. So the international media is already been carved out or set aside that you're going to keep out or is that just part of the overall pitch? Got it, got it.","Michael Isor Roth","Yeah, so this the way pitches structure that I don't like to go to details, but everything on the table other than a couple of parts of the visit they're step out. But for long intends and purposes the media is up for review, we do the international part of the media and we're (inaudible) the international part and hopefully adding to that.","James Dix \u2013 Wedbush Securities Inc.","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Next question Tracy Young Evercore. Your line is open.","Tracy Young \u2013 Evercore","Yes, hi. Thanks so much for the color on the U.K. and the pass-throughs. Can you give us any guidance towards second quarter, how we should be thinking about the same issue. And then also could you give us some sense of the (indiscernible) in business for first quarter how that built throughout the quarter? Thanks.","Michael Isor Roth","Monthly basis?","Tracy Young \u2013 Evercore","Yeah, just generally.","Michael Isor Roth","We don't give monthly numbers if you will. The trend if you will is continues to be positive and so that's was just of your question is the answer is yes.","Tracy Young \u2013 Evercore","Yeah, thanks.","Michael Isor Roth","Okay. ","Frank Mergenthaler","And on the past those Tracy.","Michael Isor Roth","Yeah, our visibility is (indiscernible) is a project based if the material up in any quarter we'll call out, so you folks out line of side.","Tracy Young \u2013 Evercore","Okay. Thank you.","Michael Isor Roth","You're welcome.","Operator","Final question is Richard Tullo, Albert Fried Company. Your line is open.","Richard Tullo \u2013 Albert Fried Company","Hey guys, thank you for taking my questions just two quick one. Well, first of all congratulations on great execution on the cost side the equation.","Michael Isor Roth","Thank you.","Richard Tullo \u2013 Albert Fried Company","Healthcare.","Michael Isor Roth","That on the revenue side either.","Richard Tullo \u2013 Albert Fried Company","No. Would you guys I think the, I never loosely over the revenue side the equation is just the cost side of the equation is seems to be the focused. Healthcare, how much of the growth was due to new drugs or the rollout of Obama Care, because that seems to be moved a little bit there?","Michael Isor Roth","Yeah, that's healthcare was a double-digit growth that before us. There is no question, we do have some big engagements on healthcare particularly in California on the side of the business and that helped in terms of our growth in healthcare, we want break out how much, but it was clearly effective for us in that growth. But healthcare, I don't have the breakdown in terms of new drug versus old, but if you recall one of the reasons last year that healthcare didn't perform as well as we would like was a lot of drugs will coming (inaudible) and I do think as part of the a activity in healthcare right now, we are a number of new drugs that are out there, that are contributing to the growth in that segment.","Richard Tullo \u2013 Albert Fried Company","Okay. And a little bit treat about this AOL deal. Can you please provide a little color on what the (inaudible) from other thing is that go on and (inaudible) or?","Michael Isor Roth","It\u2019s all part of it in. here basically what we're trying to do in terms of the program part of our business is to get as much course platform inventory in one place. And the partnership with AOL is continues, because we have a number of partnerships with AOL, they're like wind in terms of seen the growth of a digital platforms all coordinating in one place and therefore since we are committed to having at least 50% of our media placed in the digital program although space over the next couple of years. The partnership with AOL. Frankly we have partnerships also with clear channel if you will (inaudible) this is all part of our course platform mobile as well as TV buying if you would and the AOL is kick start to that, it's a data test and we'll pretty excited about what we're seeing there.","Richard Tullo \u2013 Albert Fried Company","As we get into mobile, what point you think in terms of focus does that over shadow TV. And is there -- and you going to 1% and you think that will reflect on CPM rates and any of the (inaudible) in the equation?","Michael Isor Roth","Well, I don't think there is any question at the growth and mobile will continue to be additional. But it's not the only platform out there. It certainly the one is getting most retention certainly in roller areas where they are any other bandwidth if you will and mobile continues to be strong growth vehicle. We're still learning how to deal with mobile in terms of the impact of mobile and what type of content was unable and mobile versus traditional media. But it will continue to be a strong component of our growth and all of our offerings right now contain a portion of mobile planning and execution and that will continue to grow. I don't think it will replace all other outlets if you will, but certain this growth is indicative with being continued to important factor and what we do.","Richard Tullo \u2013 Albert Fried Company","Thank you very much. And congratulations on a terrific quarter.","Michael Isor Roth","Thank you very much. Yes, we're very pleased with our quarter. When I saw that (inaudible) we have ended a call earlier and if any call would end earlier would be this one, so that's not to be (inaudible).

Sir, you may begin.","Jerry Leshne","Good morning. Thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our Web site, interpublic.com. This morning, we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 Eastern.","During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our Company. These are subject to the uncertainties in the cautionary statement that are included in our earnings release and the slide presentation, and further detailed in our 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP measures, allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance.","At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Jerry, and thank you for joining us this morning as we review our results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016. I'll start out by covering highlights of our performance, Frank will then provide additional detail, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies and the tone of our business, to be followed by our Q&A.","We're pleased to report another quarter of solid revenue and profit increases. Our third quarter organic revenue growth was 4.3%, on top of a very strong 7.1% in Q3 '15. Acquisitions had a positive impact of 40 basis-points, while FX was a negative 1.7%. As a result, total revenue growth was 3%. ","We continue to see positive momentum in the quarter from a broad range of our creative, marketing services and media offerings. Our digital capabilities also continue to be very significant drivers of growth for us. As you remember, as of some years ago, we committed to organic rebuilding digital talent and expertise within every agency across our organization, so as to effectively migrate to new competencies and serve the evolving needs of marketers. Our results demonstrate that this strategy continues to pay-off.","In terms of geography, we grew organically in every world region with the exception of Asia-Pac. Our international organic growth was 8.1%, driven by Continental Europe, the UK and LatAm. U.S. organic growth was 1.8 % for the three months, against extremely strong comparables in the quarter with two consecutive years. Globally, we continue to see growth from nearly every client industry, and were led by the tech and telecom and food and beverage sectors.","Turning to Q3 operating expenses and margins, operating expenses increased 2.5% compared with recorded revenue growth of 3%. And as a result, operating margin expanded 50 basis-points from last year\u2019s third quarter to 10.8%, reflecting leverage on our salaries and related expenses. For the first nine months of the year, organic growth was 4.8%. This is very well balanced with 4.8% growth in the U.S. and 4.9% internationally. It\u2019s worth noting that the charge in pass-through services added 90 basis-points to our organic growth in the quarter, and added 10 basis-points through nine months.","Operating profit year-to-date is up 9%, and operating margin in the same period expanded 40 basis-points, reaching a level of 11.7% for the trailing 12 month period, which is the highest level our Company has achieved in well over a decade. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.64 this year through the third quarter compared to $0.55 in 2015, an increase of 16%. ","Turning to our update on share repurchases, during Q3, we use $81 million to repurchase 3.5 million shares. Year-to-date, we utilized approximately $193 million, repurchasing 8.5 million common shares. Since instituting our return of capital programs in 2011, we've returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases, as well as reduced our diluted share count by 27%. At the end of the third quarter, we had $265 million remaining on our current authorization.","Overall, our performance continues to underscore the strong competitive position of our agencies, around the world and across the full spectrum of advertising and marketing disciplines. The strength and growth of digital activity is also notable. We continue to manage expenses effectively in order to deliver on our margin objectives, which has been a key priority for us. As we head into our always important fourth quarter, economic and political conditions continue to present macro uncertainties. Nonetheless, the overall tone of business remained solid. We\u2019ve also posted another good year in new business front. And while the tailwinds from recent wins were relatively slight this past quarter due to timing, we expect the impact to be more evident in Q4.","We had previously increased our full-year 2016 organic growth target to the high end of 3% to 4% range that we shared with you coming in to the year. In light of the strength of our offerings and our strong organic revenue performance through nine months, we believe it's appropriate to raise our organic growth target to a range of 4% to 5%. Given the higher levels of profit contributions, we have historically seen on our growth in the fourth quarter, we continue to feel that we remain well positioned to achieve 50 basis-points or more of operating margin expansion for the full-year 2016.","At this stage, I'll turn things over to Frank for additional details of our results, and join you after his remarks for an update on our operating units to be followed by Q&A. Frank.","Frank Mergenthaler","Thank you, Michael. Good morning. As a reminder, I'll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. On slide two, you'll see an overview of results, a number of which Michael has touched upon. Organic revenue growth was 4.3% in the quarter, and 4.8% for the first nine months. Q3 operating profit was $207 million with operating margin of 10.8%, an increase of 50 basis-points from a year ago. For the nine months, operating margin expanded 40 basis-points and operating profit grew 9%.","Third quarter diluted EPS was $0.32 a share and was $0.31 adjusted for certain below the line items in the quarter. This compares to last year\u2019s diluted EPS of $0.27. For the nine months adjusted diluted EPS was $0.64 this year compared with $0.55 in 2015, an increase of 16%. Average fully diluted shares in Q3 decreased by 1.8% from last year due to our share repurchase program.","Turning to slide three, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. Here is worth noting that our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 33%, which compares favorably to our adjusted effective tax rate to Q3 2015 of 36%. As you have seen in the past, we\u2019ve volatility and the tax rate from quarter-to-quarter. We continue to expect that our full- year 2016 effective rate will be at the lower end of 37% to 39% range that we indicated in the earlier in the year.","Slide four has more detail on our revenue growth. Revenue was $1.92 billion in the quarter, an increase of 3%. Compared to Q3 15, the impact of the changing currency exchange rates was a negative 1.7%. Our net acquisitions added 40 basis-points to revenue. The resulting organic revenue increase was 4.3%. It's worth noting that net increase in pass-through revenue in the quarter, mainly in our events business in the UK, benefit organic growth by 90 basis-points. For the nine months, our change of pass-through revenues only increased organic revenue by 10 basis-points.","As you can see on the bottom half of this slide, at our Integrated Agency Networks, the organic increase was 3%. This was led by strong growth by McCann, R\/GA and HUGE. IAN's organic growth for the first nine months was 4.7%. At our CMG segment marketing services specialist organic growth was 9.4%. We again have strong performance at Weber Shandwick as well as our events business Jack Morton, and our sports marketing at Octagon. Organic growth was 5.6% at CMG, excluding the impact of higher pass-through revenues. For the nine months, organic growth was 5.3%. ","Moving on to slide five revenue by region, in the U.S., Q2 organic growth was 1.8% on top of 7.1% in Q3'15 and 7.9% in 2014. Excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenues, organic revenue growth was 2%. It is worth noting that acquisitions in U.S. added another 60 basis-points in the quarter. Leading client sectors were food and beverage and tech and telecom, as well as our other sector, diverse clients. Slower U.S. growth, compared to the first half of this year, was due to a less robust tailwind from the timing in account wins, and to a particularly strong comp in the healthcare sector.","In the UK, organic growth was 16.4% and was 4.8% excluding the positive impact from higher pass-through revenues at our events specialist, Jack Morton with continuous strong performance from McCann, R\/GA Octagon, as well as Jack Morton. UK acquisitions add 3.9% to our growth in the quarter. By client sector, we were led by tech and telecom and healthcare. It's worth noting that our UK operators are not citing a specific impact in clients spending related Brexit.","Turning to Continental Europe, organic growth was 8.3% in the quarter, a strong result driven by new business wins in the region. We\u2019ve notable increases in the retail of food and beverage sectors, led by Mediabrands and McCann in Germany and Spain, among our largest markets.","In Asia-Pac our organic decrease in Q3 was 1.4%. This comes on top of 7.2% growth a year-ago. In our largest regional markets, we had single-digit growth in India, while revenue decreased in Australia and China. For the nine months, our organic revenue decrease in the region was 80 basis-points.","In LatAm, Q3 organic growth was strong, 17.8%, on top of 14.4% growth a year ago. We\u2019ve increases in all of our largest national markets, including Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Mexico. Growth was driven by higher spend by existing clients and by new client wins. We had notably strong performances from McCann, R\/GA, HUGE, MediaBrands, Octagon, and FutureBrand. For the nine months, organic growth was 15.4%. In our other markets group, organic growth continued to be strong in Q3 at 5.6%, driven by new business wins and by performance in Canada, led by Mediabrands and HUGE. Organic growth was 6.7% for the nine months.","On slide six, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12 month basis. Most recent data point is 4.9%.","Moving on to slide seven, our operating expenses. In the third quarter, total operating expenses increased 2.5% from a year ago, compared with our reported revenue growth of 3%. FX reduced our percentage operating margin by 10 basis-points in the quarter. Compared to last year, but it was neutral than margin from nine months. Underneath our margin improvement of 50 basis-points in Q3, the ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue was 63.9% this year compared with 64.4% a year ago.","The improvement was driven by year-on-year operating leverage on two categories; our expenses for incentives; and for our category of other salaries and related expenses. This was partially offset by increased base payroll on temporary health as a percentage of revenue. Our total headcount at quarter-end was approximately 50,400, an increase of 3.4% year-on-year. This reflects both organic hiring and acquisitions, in support of growth in areas such as digital, creative, media and PR.","Turning to ops and general expenses on the lower half the slide. O&G expense was 25.3% of Q3 revenue, compared with the same level year ago. We leverage our expenses for travel, supply and telecom, as well as for professional fees. That was offset by increased pass-through expenses as a percentage of revenue in our other O&G category. The net result was operating margin expansion of 50 basis-points in the quarter and 40 basis-points for the first nine months.","Slide eight depicts our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. Most recent data point is 11.7%, which is an improvement of 60 basis-points from a year ago. Slide nine is provided for clarity on EPS adjustment in the quarter. We\u2019d a below the line gain of $3.9 million in other income, primarily due to sale of a small non-strategic business outside the U.S. Benefit to our diluted EPS was $0.01. As you can see, the impact of the new accounting standard for share based compensation was de minimis in the quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.31.","Moving on to slide 10, the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended quarter with $895 million in cash and short-term marketable securities, which is comparable to the level last year. The comparison to December 31st reflects that our cash level is seasonal and tends to peak at year-end. Slide 11 is our third quarter cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $520 million compared with $282 million a year ago. The comparison reflects increased cash generated from working capital this year, $318 million compared to $155 million a year ago.","As we have pointed out previously, working capital can be volatile quarter-by-quarter. Investing activities used $65 million, mainly for CapEx. Financing activities used $234 million, chiefly for share repurchases and our common stock dividend, as well as decreased short-term borrowings. Our net increase in cash and marketable securities for the quarter was $219 million. On slide 12, we show our debt de-leveraging from a peak of $2.33 billion in 2007 to $1.74 billion at the most recent quarter-end.","In summary, on slide 13, through nine months we\u2019ve achieve 4.8% organic growth and 40 basis-points of margin expansion, which represents very solid progress to our objectives for the full year. We are seeing growth in areas where we have focused our investment in both people and acquisitions. Our operators are focused on the appropriate cost disciplines and margin expansion. And our balance sheet is an important area that we can continue to deploy for value going forward.","With that, let me turn it back to Michael.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Frank. Well, as you can see, through the first nine months of 2016, we reported solid results in terms of both organic revenue growth and margin progress. As I\u2019ve mentioned, contributions to our positive results came from across the portfolio. It was very good balance among our agencies; geographic regions and most to all client categories. Behind the strength of two very key strategic positions that we took some time ago; the first was to invest in talent; and foster a culture that makes us a top choice for talent in every marketing discipline and capability. Given how important compelling content is for any media, entertainment or communications company, in the current environment, having the most outstanding creative strategic and digital talent as never been more viral for success and we are well positioned in this regard.","Now as a talent priority that has long been key for us is our commitment to diversity and inclusion as a driver of business performance. In environment that encourages respect and trust it's key to a creative business like ours, and a competitive advantage comes with having a variety of perspectives and beliefs when solving our client business challenges. We had reinforced this focus through a comprehensive set of award winning programs. And we ensure accountability by tying executing compensation directly to the ability of our leaders to achieve diversity objectives. While Interpublic has made a great deal of progress and we take pride in that, as an industry, we still have a ways to go in this journey.","The second major strategic decision is our approach to digital. Unlike some of our competitors, IPGs digital capabilities have been largely grown organically in are embedded within every one of our agencies. This investment in people with new skill sets in developing new products and services, and in incubating new technologies, has allowed us to stay highly relevant in today's digital world. We wanted to be at the first place as clients turn to for help and guidance as they seek to navigate the complexity of the media and marketing landscape. We know that there\u2019re some questions out there about what technology conversions will mean to our industry going forward.","We may all be facing new kinds of competitors, as more comes, IT and consulting come together. However, it's worth noting that to-date the emergence of technology enabled marketing has created meaningful opportunity for the agency holding companies. This has definitely been the case for IPG given our skill set, focused on digital. Our media agnostic view of the channel allocation and a longstanding commitment to open architecture where we've been an industry leader with this approach to delivering the best customized talents and solutions that can provide the integration of marketing functions our clients are increasingly asking for.","What is not commonly understood is how much resource IPG already has in place across the group when it comes to date expertise, data analytics, and proprietary tools that we can bring to bear in order to create accountable marketing campaigns that drive marketplace results. Data and analytics is an area we will continue to focus and invest behind. So as to ensure that we can create even more targeted, dynamic, and effective work on behalf of our clients.","Moving on to operational results, it's clear that during the quarter and for the year-to-date, in addition to solid growth, we've continued to be very disciplined in terms of cost management. We remain focused on converting at the appropriate levels to deliver on margin improvement target for the year. We also remained committed to the robust capital return programs that we put in place in recent years, which have been driving significant shareholder value creation. At the agency level, McCann Worldgroup\u2019s performance in the quarter was strong. Their creative product continues to earn high levels of industry recognition, and they\u2019re growing well in a number of their major clients. Notable wins came from Reckitt Benckiser and Chick-fil-A, as well as Qualcomm this past October.","We're seeing a high degree of collaboration among the advertising, MRM, momentum and the strong healthcare offerings. Mediabrands once again made significant contributions to our profitability. UM has rebuilding out it seems to deliver for recent global wins. Leading edge capabilities like Cadreon and Ansible are also being introduced into a range of new international markets. And we added to the reprised SCO offering with an attractive acquisition based out of the UK that will serve as a regional center of excellence. Mediabrands also recently recruited strong new leaders for AMEA and Asia-Pac regions.","Furthermore, in the quarter, they retained BMW North America, and extended Coca-cola in the Middle East. As mentioned last quarter, we have longstanding record of transparency in our dealings with marketers and media vendors. We are proud of role we play is wholly objective and media agnostic advisors to our clients. At CMG, we saw continued outstanding work out of Weber Shandwick. Some of you will have previously heard, I\u2019d just point out, that it's the full range of Weber\u2019s digital capabilities from strategy through analytics, all the way to content creation, moving a standalone company who would be one of the largest social media agencies in the world.","Octagon and Jack Morton were also strong performers in the quarter. MullenLowe continue to make headway in terms of integrating the network and promote new leaders for its New York and London agencies. Both our executives content to the Company through the acquisition of digital agency Profero, which made important contributions to Q3 performance. MullenLowe also benefited from its bundle lead offerings, MediaHub, which continues to partner closely with Mediabrands as it did in the recent global win of Western Union. FCB is producing visible and successful new advertising work for clients, including AB InBev, and a number of cresol branch, which work for new global client Clorox and follow.","The agency further bolstered its leadership with a significant creative high. She will lead the creative group in the flagship Chicago office. FCB Red, the agency shopper marketing unit is a market leader as our operations in the number of key emerging markets, including India, Brazil and South Africa. As you know, we have a range of full services domestic agencies, including Deutsch, Hill Holliday, and the Martin Agency and Carmichael Lynch, which conserved clients independently, who partnered with other IPG units in the customized integrated offerings that we referred to as open architecture. As mentioned earlier, this is the concept that we\u2019ve been working to refine for some time. It has fuelled many of our largest wins in recent years, including recently Harley Davidson this quarter. And it's something you are now hearing more about from a number of our competitors.","An additional highlight in the quarter was the performance of R\/GA and HUGE. These are among the industries\u2019 best digital networks. The strategic work they do for clients on digital transformation rivals out any consultancy and the range of services they provide from UX and design to strategy, digital storytelling, data visualization, and more an unrivalled in our industry.","Starting from a single agency in the New York, both R\/GA and HUGE, are evolving into powerful multi office networks. In the case of R\/GA, there are now 14 locations on four continents. During the quarter, they posted major wins with Simmons and Mercedes Benz. HUGE has grown to 7 U.S. offices and an equal number internationally, working with major clients, including Google, HBO and Under Armour.","Looking forward, as mentioned in my opening remarks, the tone of the business remained solid. The new business pipeline is strong overall, and we are new business positive for year-to-date. As indicated previously, tailwinds from recent wins will be a more prevalent in Q4 than they were in Q3, which we are sharing with you today. Investments in talent supplemented by our measured and strategic approach to acquisitions to ensure that the level of professional offerings remain highly competitive. And that\u2019s vital for us to capitalize on the level of complexity and even confusion that exists in today\u2019s marketing landscape.","Despite the macro uncertainty that\u2019s out there due to political and economic factors at around the globe, we\u2019re highly focused on delivering against our top and bottom-line targets for the year. As stated at the outset in light of the strength of our offerings and a strong organic revenue performance from nine-months, we believe it's appropriate to raise our full-year organic growth target from previously 4% to a range of 4% to 5%. Given the high level for profit contributions we\u2019ve historically seen our growth in the fourth quarter. We also believe that we remain well positioned to achieve our target of expanding 2016 operating margin by 50 basis-points, or more. Combined with the strength of our balance sheet and our proven commitment to capital return, which has been a source of significant value creation, this will allow us to further enhance shareholder value.","As always, we thank you for your support. We\u2019re intent on closing out the year strongly, and we look forward to posting you on our results at our next call. With that, let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Alexia Quadrani from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Alexia Quadrani","Just digging in a little bit further on the U.S. organic growth in the quarter, Frank, I think you highlighted very difficult comp on the healthcare side. And then obviously a little bit less tailwind I think both of that in terms of new business in the quarter. Given the tailwinds there was just a pick-up in Q4. Is there unusually difficult comp in Q4? How should we think about the underlying growth rate of the U.S.? I pushed on it, there\u2019s just a couple of your peers also, highlighted weakness in the U.S. organic growth when they reported earliest week, some cited it's an election noise. I guess any more color you can give on the other line trend of the U.S. market, it will be great?","Michael Roth","Let me just say, for the nine months, our growth was 4.8% in the U.S., which still is a solid performance, given where our forecast for the full year and what the industry is saying in terms of the macro growth of our industry. And, yes, you\u2019ve pointed out correctly that in the third quarter we were a little bit light in the U.S. compared to what we\u2019ve been delivering. We\u2019ve grown organically 15% in the last two years in the U.S. And obviously as we grow it gets a little more difficult. That said, the tailwinds that we referred to, we\u2019ve indicated we were light in the third quarter, coming-in in the fourth quarter. I can\u2019t say -- again it\u2019s a function of the fourth quarter a lot of our revenue comes in, a lot of our operating margin comes-in in the fourth quarter.","I\u2019d like to tell you that all of that tailwind comes-in at the U.S., and we\u2019re back to levels of organic growth that you\u2019ve seen. But I can\u2019t say that. We do think there\u2019ll be improvement in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. But I think the healthcare item that Frank pointed out. We had a tough comp in the healthcare side, and we did have a little bit slowing down, in particular, in one of our agencies, in terms of healthcare and that contributed to it. But again, I\u2019m very comfortable with the performance we have in the U.S. It continues to be a key driver for us going forward. What I like about our U.S. performance for the year is that it's across all of our agencies. We see MullenLowe. We see McCann, Mediabrand, CMG, our independent agencies. All of our agencies are strong in the U.S. And I believe we will continue to see improvement in those markets.","Alexia Quadrani","And then just a follow-up, if I can, on the very strong growth you saw in Europe in the quarter. The pass-through revenues, I think, you highlighted, helped a bit. And was that purely in the UK? And was there a any pass-through year ago in the UK in the same period that were comping? And then on the Continental Europe the very impressive growth there. It sounds like it sort of just general improvement from what you\u2019ve been doing in some new business wins, or is there something one-time-ish there we should look into?","Michael Roth","Yes, let me focus on the UK. I don\u2019t believe we have it. It was a one big event and we saw that at Jack Morton. And but other than that, we still had a solid performance in the UK of 4.8% growth in the UK. I think that's the right number. So we\u2019re still pleased. We continue to have strong offerings across the CMG portfolio, as well as our agencies in the UK. So we're pleased. The R\/GA, in particular, is very strong in the UK. Management is there and the offerings we see in R\/GA is particularly strong and growing nicely. So we don\u2019t -- and as far as Brexit goes, as we said, we haven\u2019t seen any impacts on Brexit yet. Obviously, sometimes down the around, we\u2019ll see some impact where we haven\u2019t seen it.","Continental Europe is the different story in that. As you know it's 8% of our revenue, at least for the nine months. And new wins and clients spend in that particular region has a nice effect, which is what you\u2019ve seen in this quarter with the results for Continental Europe. We set for on a full year basis, we've always said we'd see 1% up or 1% down. It's encouraging that we're seeing that improvement. We saw a good flow through in terms of new business at McCann as well as Mediabrands, as they on-boarded some new client wins that we had in those markets, particularly in Germany and Spain. So, we're excited to see some improvement in the Continental Europe. Again, we\u2019re not raising a flag of total victory in Continental Europe. They still have many challenges. But our client mix, if you will, is producing those kind of results.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ben Swinburne","Last quarter you guys talked about some revenue, I think in the U.S. that have flipped a bit. I think you had indicated back-half. Sort of if you can revisit that, and talk that whether that has continued to be out there, or if that should have in the third quarter? And any color around timing and sizing. And then Frank I was just wondering if you could help us on the pass-through impact to margins. Would you have gotten some leverage in all other ONG if not for the 90 basis-points of pass-through? Just some color on underlying margin trajectory would be great too.","Michael Roth","And let me just quickly on the pass-through. In terms of margin, it was -- the effect in the margin was only 10 basis-points this quarter, if you will. And for the full year, we expect that to be neutral. It would does stand out if you will. And I think what you are referring to is last year in the fourth quarter. We did have an impact on margins that was higher than that. But we don\u2019t see that in the fourth quarter. As far as the timing goes, we did see and as we said the tailwinds was not as robust in the third quarter. And we will see that tailwind coming-in in the fourth quarter. But it's not all U.S. And so, I wish I could tell you that all of it was U.S. and we backup in terms of the high numbers for U.S. But the good news is we do have the tailwinds. They will hit us in the fourth quarter. But I couldn\u2019t tell you that the majority of that in pass- through was coming in the U.S. And that's how I responded before to the question.","Ben Swinburne","And then just as a follow-up Micheal, I'm sure you\u2019ve listened or got windows the earnings commentaries from your competitors this week. And it seem to be very focused on the U.S. election as we are I am sure enjoying this process. I am just wondering you didn\u2019t bring it out that all in your prepared remarks. You seem to be quite confident in the tone; any sense from even in any sector-specific, like healthcare, where the election outcome poses incremental challenges to spending, any thoughts there at all?","Michael Roth","No, we haven\u2019t seen it. In fact first of all from a business perspective we don\u2019t play in that arena, so it didn\u2019t affect us. It did affect us a bit on the media side because we have to place local media, and obviously that was being crowded out by elections. So, we have to find new ways of reaching consumers in those markets we\u2019re more efficient. That helps us to bit, okay in terms of consulting with our clients. But we haven\u2019t seen a big political impact. As far as the tone of business, particularly in Europe, I think they are nervous. But I can't particularly point to a particular client pullback as a result it. I think they are watching this very carefully. And frankly they should be concerned about it.","But I think we will be okay and our clients are very sophisticated in terms of where they allocate their dollars, and the tones of business. And we are rightly with them focusing on that. But I have not seen as much of a dramatic impact that some of our competitor said on the call. And I think the U.S. issue that showed up frankly so far in all three of our results indicate that a lot of this is client and sector specific, and we\u2019re seeing that. But I continue to believe that 61% of our business is in the U.S., and I like that positioning right now given the terms of business.","Operator","The next question is from Mr. Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Peter Stabler","So, a couple if I could. My first one on ANA and transparency, Michel, you talked about your position in IPG. You are not buying digital media as a principal; wondering, do you think the ANA comments and some disclosures from one of your competitors around digital buying overseas. Do you think its resulting in any attitude shift in the market towards transparent digital buying, whether you guys could be a beneficiary of that? And then I have got a quick follow up. Thank you.","Michael Roth","Yes, I have said this before. And if I didn\u2019t believe this we would have changed our strategy. Conversations with our clients and the pictures that we\u2019ve been involved in, although I can't say specifically it was the reason that we either win businesses or not, our transparency reputation and the fact that we are media agnostic makes a difference with our clients. And the more you see in the price about questions on that, the more it becomes relevant in our conversations. And yes I do believe it enhances our opportunity to expand our media offerings.","And I think, as I said, I think, rather than us changing to what our competitors are doing, I think, we are going to see a slowing down of that on the other side. Because I think clients deserves the transparency that we give them, and I think they are entitled to realize and know where their profitability is coming at their expense. And I think that\u2019s the right way to approach this environment.","Peter Stabler","And then quickly back to the regions. Latin America. You cited broad strength across a number of countries. You didn\u2019t call out the Olympics. I am wondering, just that you\u2019re confident that some of the strengths could continue. Just some comments on that will be great. Thanks so much.","Michael Roth","Yes, that\u2019s a fair question Peter. We had said before. We didn\u2019t see a big impact on the Olympics. We did have some. Obviously, our marketing services businesses, Octagon and Jack Morton, obviously, had some events in the Olympics which affected our results, not materially. But no, actually that\u2019s real growth which is what you were kind in your question. We did on-boarded some new clients in Latin America in terms of LatAm Airways and Bradesco. And we see some client spend increasing there. So that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing the reason for our growth in Brazil. So it's client specific. It\u2019s on-boarding. And frankly what I like about it across the regions in Latin America, it\u2019s not all Brazil. We\u2019re seeing strengths in the other market.","We\u2019re seeing our digital offerings do very well in South America. R\/GA and HUGE are doing very well down there, because the digital environment is right for growth. And frankly, we use those markets for production facilities, given the talent base that we have in Latin America and the effect in this that we\u2019ve been able to utilize that talent on a worldwide basis. R\/GA, in particular, as well as HUGE use that as a base to service global clients, if you will, in the connected world, as I\u2019ll quote, Bob Greenberg. And we\u2019re seeing that come to fruition using those resources in Latin America.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Steven Cahall from Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open.","Steven Cahall","First question, I just maybe wanted to zero in a bit more on some of the U.S. commentary, if possible. It looks like probably for 2017, you have a slightly easier comp than what you have on 2016. But you also talk about maybe some of the new business being outside of the U.S. So should we in sort of the medium term think about an acceleration organically in the U.S. business, or is it just a bit more of a complex make sure than that and that new business acceleration is more global?","Michael Roth","Well, I appreciate your question. Right now, we\u2019re really focused and getting through 2016. We haven\u2019t started our 2017 forecasting models yet in terms of our business reviews. I think the only way to look at this is that 61% of our business continues to be in the U.S. The tone of the business is solid. If you look at MAGNA, in terms of their forecast of U.S. advertising, roughly 4% is the growth expectations. I think, if you use that as a guideline, we should be plus or minus that. And we\u2019ll talk to you more about 2017 when we give you our full results for 2016.","Steven Cahall","And then maybe if we think about the pace of reviews coming up both for Q4 and what you\u2019re seeing in the RFP pipeline for next year. And I guess kind of question goes back to what you talked about with your media agnostic strategy, as well as base for video measurement issue. Do you see any of these as catalyzing another round of reviews, like we saw in 2015? Or would you think that the next 12 months is going to be a little bit less manic than, than what you saw 12 months prior?","Michael Roth","Yes, I had said, I don\u2019t think 2016 was going to be as manic as 2015. And I think that was true, except for certain Holding Companies had particular items in review. Fortunately, that wasn\u2019t us. And I do think that whole spectrum of transparency raises legitimate questions for clients to look at their service providers. We\u2019re doing very strong and effective communication with our clients in terms of our transparency. Frankly, some of our clients have audits out there in terms of what we\u2019re doing. And fortunately, we\u2019re coming through those audits pretty well. That's good.","And I think from a tone point of view, clients will continue to look at this. Whether it gives rise to pictures and reviews, I can\u2019t say. But I would expect we\u2019ll see a fair amount of reviews coming into \u201917. And that's at least of which is these goals and cycles and we are heading into what third of a third year of cycles and clients as three year contracts. And has an order of business practices they put a number of their businesses in review every two or three years. So I expect to see, I would call that normal. It's not normal way it used to be, but it seems to be normal what's happening in our industry.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Omar Sheikh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Omar Sheikh","First for Frank, on margins. If you look at the first nine months, it looks like most of the sort of improvement you\u2019ve seen in margin comes in O&G rather than salaries. And just wonder whether you could give some commentary on whether you see that continuing into Q4? And maybe any you have to say about next year and the scope the mix of margin improvement that would be helpful. And then Michael, maybe you called out data and analytics is being an area that you would like to invest behind. I wonder whether may you could talk about whether your preference would be for organic or inorganic investment as behind that theme? Thanks.","Michael Roth","Look analytics data and analytics is a fortune product. We historically -- we\u2019ve done strategic acquisitions. We see most of our growth coming organically, for example, in Cadreon we\u2019ve seen -- we\u2019ve expanded it internationally. We've coordinated their offerings among all resources and agencies within U.S. and we will continue to do that. So I think the bulk of the growth will come organically. However, we are looking at strategic acquisitions in that space. We also are looking at a more coordinated basis in terms of our data base, if you will, in terms of the DMP. And that will be a key focus for us in 2017.","To make sure that all the agencies within IPG have a consistent offerings and utilizing the unique capabilities we have at Mediabrands, I see that as an important growth vehicle for us. Clients are looking for it. That's the area where we're seeing a lot of competitors, if you will, trying to get have in-roads in our clients. So that's when I talk about investments and data analytics, and we\u2019re going to be stepping up our efforts in those parts. And frankly if we don\u2019t have it organically and we don\u2019t have those capabilities internally, we will look to add-on. So, look, with Mediabrands we added two very nice agencies this past year; one in the SCO space; and one is the mobile space. Those are growth vehicles for us.","Mobile clearly it's going to be a key driver for business going forward. Our Ansible offering we have consolidated a number of businesses with the new acquisitions to make sure that we are fully integrated mobile offering across our various brands. So this is the value of the holding company across all of our networks. And we continue to focus our Mediabrands as a key source of providing those unique competencies utilizing these data.","Frank Mergenthaler","And Omar on the margin question, we target our agencies to deliver a margin improvement target. And whether we get leverage from both major cost buckets, one major cost bucket, it's somewhat relevant to us. With that said, Michael made comments early on about the important of talents. So right now, we attribute our growth being tied to investments we made against talent. We\u2019re constantly looking at that. So to the extent we can squeeze more of the O&G to help support those investments and talent and still meet our margin objectives, that\u2019s a good answer. But with that said, Michael, mentioned 50% of our profits in the fourth quarter right. So I would imagine that our salary line is a contributor of leverage in the fourth quarter, and as we moving into '17 -- in \u201917 well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Brian Wieser from Pivotal Research. Your line is open.","Brian Wieser","So on the use of dispositions of some McCann Worldgroup entities in the Nordic markets over the past quarter, and separately we know that Publicis has altered how it's managing markets below the top 20. I was wondering at a macro industry level and maybe for IPG specifically as well. If you think it's less necessary now than it was say 20 and 40 years ago to have these massive extensive global networks have dominated the largest agency groups. And separately also, wondering if you could also talk about the current ebbs and flows of centralization versus decentralization in some of the agency groups? For example, it seems like there is a lot of deepening of investment in Cadreon versus putting maybe more investment in some of the individual media agency brands. There is not investment going there as well. But just curious your thoughts on how much should live with the agency brands versus more centralized entities?","Michael Roth","We\u2019ve got an hour and half, Frank. Let me start. 10 years ago we started open architecture. And it was our belief that clients -- in a client centric environment that we should be focusing on the needs of clients, not our particular silos. And when we look at open architecture the issue is do we in essence mould all of our agencies together and say bye away, here is our best people, and irrespective for the silos. Obviously, there\u2019re conflict issues. There\u2019re cultural issues. There\u2019re different go-to-market strategies. And frankly that serves us well in the marketplace.","We don\u2019t believe that we need to restructure our entire Company to make open architecture work. We\u2019ve been doing open architecture for 10 years. And frankly some of our most profitable and growing clients utilize an open architecture model. And the reason it works is because we have made it part of DNA of our organization. People within the quote silos know that if they don\u2019t have the capabilities within their agencies they could raise their hand and we can bring in an expertise that we\u2019ll work closely with them on a collaborative basis and meet the needs of our clients. You don\u2019t need to restructure entire company to do that.","And the reason we are comfortable with that is we hold our agencies responsible for collaborative work. So, when we do compensation and incentive compensation, we look at the degree of open architecture and collaboration. And on many of engagements, there are multiple agencies serving one client. And they don\u2019t have to worry about whose silos it belongs, because frankly we do that. We work closely with the agencies and we determine what the proper allocation. Clients shouldn\u2019t be involved in it. We think that the better way of doing this, because when you have one single purpose of agency doing this, we have number of those. But most of the time, when you have a single purpose agencies, it's harder to recruit talent. It's harder to keep talent. It's harder to get a sustainability of the quality of the people within those agencies.","And open architecture is serving us very well. We get the highest grades of our reviews when we have open architecture model. Because the clients realize that we\u2019re putting them to first. And by the way, our definition of open architecture includes third-party providers. So, if our clients come to us and say we like it work with X, Y, Z, in addition to your resources, sometimes we work better with third parties, unfortunately, than our own. But that\u2019s part of the model, if you collaborate everyone and put them all into one silo, you will never get that.","So I think the notion of providing all the resources IPG has to the client is the correct one, which is why frankly we started it 10 years ago. But I don\u2019t believe you have to restructure the company to do that. You lose a lot of the culture. You lose a lot of the accountability. And you lose the focus that our core agencies have within those particular agencies.","Brian Wieser","I think the bigger question is getting it outside of the top, the largest markets does. That was the restructuring aspect of what Publicis has been doing, I was curious. And I guess, I\u2019m wondering if we\u2019re seeing something similar with some of the dispositions of McCann. And in other words, do you need to have expense of 60 country markets in this role going forward?","Michael Roth","No, of course now. We saw in the first year, we came in. We got rid of 50 agencies all over the world. I\u2019ve said this. We\u2019ve got rid of Uzbekistan. We didn\u2019t need agencies in those markets, and because the world doesn\u2019t operate that way anymore. So, yes, we constantly are looking at that and ensure that disposition that we\u2019ve made are consistent with getting rid of non-producing agencies that don\u2019t cost -- that are costing us money and aren\u2019t adding any value. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ve being doing.","On the question of Cadreon and Mediabrands and whether we\u2019re centralizing, it doesn\u2019t make sense to invest all of that money in one particular offering, and not have it available for all of the other agencies. When I first came to this business, I used to walk around, travel to our different agencies, and they would all wheel out what they believed is best-in-class to offering, in particular, on the media side. And we were spending a lot of money and a lot of things that we didn\u2019t have to duplicate, it\u2019s everyone we\u2019re able to raise their hand and work closely with the competencies. For example, Mediabrands, whether the UM initiatives or Mediabrand as a holding company, if you will, of media. And I think that\u2019s the right way to do it. And we\u2019ve done a traffic job on that.","For example, if you look at MullenLowe and Mediabrands and MediaHub and MullenLowe working with Mediabrands on the Western Union pitch. I mean that was a great example of competencies within an agency, as well as tapping into particular resources we have in Mediabrands. The same thing is Harley-Davidson. The same thing in all of our open architecture wins. So, I think that is the most efficient way use our expertise, and the most efficient way to meet the needs of our clients. And more and more of our agencies are realizing that as if can do it that way, they get a better offering and it\u2019s much more efficient and clients realized that they\u2019re looking out for their behalf instead of their own silo.","Brian Wieser","Great, thank you very much.","Michael Roth","You\u2019re welcome. Other than that I don\u2019t feel strongly about it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Barry Lucas from Gabelli & Company. Your line is open.","Barry Lucas","Thanks, and good morning. Frank, I don\u2019t want to beat this margin question to death, but your comment that you expect leverage in the fourth quarter coming out of salary lines. So, my suspicion is, strong suspicion is, given the delay in on-boarding some of the new business and the likelihood that you\u2019ve had people in place to serve those accounts ahead of the business coming-in. Now the revenue has come-in and that would be one of those contributing factors to improvement in that area?","Frank Mergenthaler","Yes, we look very closely at sequential progression of our salary line, whether that\u2019d be in headcount, whether that\u2019d in would be in other components. And if you look from first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, its clear operators are managing that quite efficiently. And as you pointed out, the fourth quarters is our largest revenue and profit quarter. So, do we expect as that revenue starts to ramp up that we're hiring massive hedge, we don\u2019t. So, we should get appropriate leverage through the salary line in the fourth quarter. We take a lot of comfort in our operators\u2019 ability to manage sequential headcount progression and they\u2019ve been doing a very good job.","Michael Roth","Yes, let me just add one other point to that, Barry. New clients tend to have less margin than more mature clients, and that's a fact in our business. And so what -- I'm tampering a little bit the expectation frankly that as we on-board all this new business that we have, it's coming in at very high margins. And the margin number of expectation should be a lot higher than, frankly, as this business matures as we go through it. That said, we do have some revenue coming-in in the fourth quarter that we've already incurred a significant amount of expenses. And obviously that revenue comes with a higher margin.","So, this is not an exact science. The timing of how we get our revenue and how our expenses is fluid, if you will because we have to manage to make sure we have the right people on-boarding new, as Frank said. But we also have to realize that expectations of new clients takes a period of time for it to mature, it just doesn\u2019t happen overnight. Which is why, even when we started the year, everyone said well, why are you being so conservative in terms of your organic growth and margin. And the answer to that is staffing and on-boarding new clients and macroeconomics are all coming into play at one-time, is a tricky thing to model. And that's why we like to look at this on a full-year basis as opposed to quarter-to-quarter.","So, we manage it as best as we can. But if 50% of our margin comes-in in the fourth quarter, we can't, with a high degree of accuracy, tell exactly where that's going to come.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question is from Mr. Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Dan Salmon","Michael, in your prepared remarks on the individual units for FCB highlighted their shopper marketing division in particular for strength. My question was on shopper marketing more broadly across IPG, as it's in area that one of your peers have cited that as a bit of a challenging one recently. It sounds like it's been more of a positive story for you. Could you maybe remind us the size is that discipline across all of IPG, your short and near-term views on it. And in particular maybe the difference between how performs domestically and emerging markets? And maybe how it's evolving towards digital? And then one other just high level question, you also commented on the continued convergence with the consultants and systems integrators. Just anything that you are seeing that's changing there? In particular, seeing some of those competitors maybe starting to look a creative or media as opposed to strategy and technology work, that\u2019d be great. Thanks.","Michael Roth","Yes, those are two great questions. Shopper marketing, it's important to FCB to have a great competency in it. I would say it's not big overall. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a major part of our business as a IPG as a whole. That said, opportunities for those agencies that operate on a very effective basis and we will continue to invest behind when we see opportunities. But I wouldn\u2019t call it out as one of the major growth vehicles around the world, if you will. But it is very important to FCB and they do a great job at it. In fact, that\u2019s one of the agencies we pull out when we have RFPs that call for shopper marketing expertise, because they do it so well.","The more broader question on the convergence is really how we have to look at the transformation of our industry. I do believe we are seeing new competitors entering our business. And they are bringing with them CRM expertise. They are basically system integrators. And because they are already in our clients, they view it as an opportunity to bring in CRM expertise, as well as creative. Which is another reason why I think what we compete against those, the fact that we have standalone agencies with strong creative talent, it's very hard for these other parties to compete against what McCann or in FCB, or MullenLowe or our independent agencies, the firepower we can bring in on creative work. There is no way that there new competitor, if you will, could compete with that.","And then the results show that, even though these outliers are coming into our business, are trying get there. I think if you look across all the holding companies which have been pretty successful when it comes to those integrated offerings that we provide versus what they are providing. That said, we have to watch it very carefully. And clearly, they are going to be coming out pretty strongly. So we have to be well suited. And I believe the open architecture integrated offering is a very compelling argument against them trying to get into our business.","Dan Salmon","Thanks.","Michael Roth","Thank you. Operator, thank you. We\u2019ll conclude the call now. Thank you all very much for participating. We look forward to giving you the results for the full year.","Operator","Thank you.

This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Sir, you may begin.","Jerome J. Leshne - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning. Thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com. This morning, we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 AM Eastern.","During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company. These are subject to the uncertainties in the cautionary statement that are included in our earnings release and the slide presentation and are further detailed in our 10-K and other filings with the SEC.","We will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP measures, allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance.","At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jerry, and thank you all for joining us this morning, as we review our results for the fourth quarter and 2015. As usual, I'll start out by covering the highlights of our performance; Frank will then provide additional details; and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies, to be followed by our Q&A.","We're pleased to report a very strong performance for both the fourth quarter and full year. Among the financial highlights, organic revenue growth was 5.2% in the quarter, which brought our organic growth to 6.1% for the full year. In 2015, we grew organically in every major region of the world and across nearly all major agencies and client sectors.","Operating margin in the quarter was 20.8%, an increase of 120 basis points, marking our highest Q4 margins in at least a decade. Full-year operating margin was 11.5%, an increase of a 100 basis points from 2014, which is at the high-end of the range we targeted coming in to the year. Operating profit increased 11% for the full year.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year was up 23% to $1.21 from $0.98 in 2014. That excludes a loss of $0.12 per share this year, largely non-cash due to the disposition of non-strategic businesses in the third and fourth quarters. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.66, excluding a loss of $0.03 per share for business dispositions.","Over the last two years, in a very fast changing and competitive industry, we have achieved total organic revenue growth of 12%, which is outstanding compared to our principal peers. During that two-year span, we have also increased operating profit by 32% and comparable diluted EPS by 55%. All of our people can take pride in these accomplishments. Their talent, the great work they do every day on behalf of our clients what drives such terrific results in the marketplace. We thank them for their hard work and dedication.","Returning to the fourth quarter, organic revenue growth was 5.2%. Currency had a negative 5.5% impact on revenue, while net business dispositions were a negative 20 basis points. We posted notably strong growth in the U.S., Asia-Pac, UK and LatAm. Continental Europe remain challenged although the region did show modest organic growth for the full year.","Our Q4 growth reflects contributions from all major disciplines, including advertising, media, public relation. We continue to have especially strong performance from the digital services embedded across the portfolio as well as growth at digital specialists R\/GA, Huge and MRM\/\/McCann.","At the agency level, a wide range of our portfolio contributed to growth led by McCann, Mediabrands, FCB, Weber Shandwick, Golin, Octagon and FutureBrand. The top-performing client sectors in Q4 were tech and telecom, healthcare and financial services.","New business was another highlight of the quarter. In media, we were pleased to add Johnson & Johnson's global buying and planning to the roster of 2015 media wins. That includes U.S. responsibilities for J&J, Coca-Cola and CVS.","Creative wins in the quarter included Verizon Wireless, MGM Resorts, ALDI Nord, and Bank of America's retail business. As a result, our net new business was positive in Q4 as it has been through the year.","Operating expenses were again well managed. Underneath organic growth of 5.2% in the quarter, our organic operating expense increase was 3.1%. The result was Q4 operating margin expansion of 120 basis points.","For the full year, operating margin expansion of 100 basis points reflects leverage on both our salaries and related and our office and general expenses.","During Q4, we repurchased 5 million shares using $113 million. For the full year, we utilized $285 million for the repurchase of 14 million shares. In our year-end share count, eligible for dilution, decreased 3% compared to 2014. This activity built on a sustained capital return program that we initiated in 2011, since that time, we've returned a total of $2.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchase, and we reduced our outstanding shares eligible for dilution by over 25%.","In addition, on the strength of our operating results, we have announced this morning our board's decision to raise IPG's quarterly dividend by 25% to $0.15 per share. This marks our third consecutive year of higher dividends with annual increases of 25% or more. We also announced that our board has authorized an additional $300 million for share repurchase. Combined with $159 million remaining on our existing authorization as of the beginning of the year, this brings the total amount available for share repurchase to $459 million. These actions demonstrate our confidence in the financial and operational strength of IPG as well as our future prospects.","Turning to our 2016 outlook, it's encouraging to see our agencies competing so successfully in the marketplace. We continue to convert growth to operating profit at a high level and we remain committed to a disciplined use of capital that can further drive shareholder value.","As you can see in our results today, the tones of business remains solid through year-end in most major world regions. And we all know that marketing is becoming increasingly complex and dynamic every day, due to the pace of technological innovation and shifting consumer behavior. This represents further opportunity for our company as well as our industry.","Given these trends as well as the overall strength of our offerings, we are well positioned to continue to deliver solid growth. There are, however, factors that require us to temper our outlook. Of course, our industry-leading results for past two years sets a high bar for comparable performance in 2016. Moreover, in certain markets, macro conditions present uncertainties and even headwinds. This is true most clearly in Brazil but also with respect to markets such as Continental Europe and the Middle East.","There is also concern for slowing in China. The currency environment remains volatile, which could have negative effects on client spending. As we said since the start of the year, there is significant volatility in the financial markets. As a result, the uncertainty we're all experiencing leads us to approach the new year with a degree of caution.","Notwithstanding this environment, for 2016 we are currently targeting 3% to 4% organic growth. Net acquisitions to date should add another 50 basis points to our growth in the year. It's worth noting that at current FX rates, the currency impact to our top line as well as to our operating expenses is expected to be approximately negative 2.5% for the full year.","Along with this level of growth, we expect to continue to build on our record operating margin expansion. We are therefore targeting an additional 50 basis points or more of margin improvement in 2016, which would bring us to at least 12%, closer to our objective of 13% operating margin or better.","As always, as the year unfolds we will regularly review our perspective when we report back to you during our quarterly calls.","At this stage, I'll turn things over to Frank for additional details on the results.","Frank Mergenthaler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning. As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast.","On slide two, you'll see a summary of our results. Fourth quarter organic growth was 5.2%. U.S. organic growth was 6.2% and international organic growth was 4.1% with all major regions, except Continental Europe, which decreased only slightly. For the full year, all regions were up organically and organic growth was 6.1%.","Q4 operating margin was 20.8% compared with 19.6% a year ago. For the full year, operating margin increased 100 basis points to 11.5% and operating profit increased 11%. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.63 and was $0.66 excluding expense of $0.03 per share for business dispositions, which is reflected pre-tax in our other expense line.","Full-year diluted EPS was $1.09 per share and would have been $1.21 per share excluding business dispositions expense in Q3 and Q4, which were largely non-cash. We purchased 14 million shares for $285 million during the year.","As Michael mentioned, we announced this morning that our board has once again significantly increased our common share dividend to $0.15 per share quarterly and added $300 million to our share repurchase authorization.","Turning to slide three, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue expenses in detail on the slides that follow. Here it is worth noting a few below-the-line items. The $12 million of expense for the dispositions of a few non-strategic agency offices is reflected in our other expense line below operating income.","Our effective tax rate adjusted for the dispositions was 33.1% in the fourth quarter and 35.2% for the full year, which compares favorably to last year's adjusted tax rate. Our tax rate has been volatile from year-to-year, given our operations in over 100 countries, our utilization of loss carry-forwards and the requirements of adjusting valuation allowances.","In 2015, our effective tax rate benefited from the implementation of planning strategies and from the net reversal of small tax valuation allowances in the fourth quarter. We expect our normalized effective rate will be in the range of 37% to 39% in 2016. It is also worth noting that our cash tax rate in 2015 was 29%.","Turning to revenue on slide four. Fourth quarter revenue was $2.2 billion. Compared to Q4 2014, the impact of the change in exchange rates was a negative 5.5%, while net dispositions were negative 20 basis points. The resulting organic increase was 5.2%.","For the full year, the strength of the U.S. dollar continued to have a significant translation impact on reported revenues and operating expenses in all international regions. Revenue growth for 2015 was therefore 1%, consisting of 6.1% organic growth and a positive 30 basis points from net acquisitions, while currency was a negative 5.4%. It's worth noting that our pass-through revenue decreased approximately $25 million organically in 2015 compared to 2014, which was an impact of 30 basis points in organic growth.","Lower pass-through revenues are offset dollar for dollar, however, by lower O&G expense. We anticipate a similar negative pass-through impact of 30 basis points to 50 basis points in total organic growth in 2016, which is reflected in the growth targets Michael shared earlier.","On the bottom portion of this slide, Q4 revenue growth balanced between our IAN and CMG segments, which had growth of 4.9% and 6.5%, respectively. For the full year, organic growth at IAN was a robust 6.7%. At CMG, organic growth was 3.6% for the year with the important qualifier that this is where we see a disproportionately large impact from decreasing pass-through revenue on the smaller of the two segments. Underlying growth at CMG was high-single digit percent.","Moving on to slide five, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q4 organic growth was 6.2%, driven by growth from existing clients and net new business. We were led by our largest fully integrated networks, McCann and FCB, as well as by Mediabrands, R\/GA and Huge. We had strong performance from PR agencies Weber Shandwick and Golin. Among client sectors, tech and telecom and healthcare continue to be growth leaders. For the full year, U.S. organic growth was 6.8% with increases across all major disciplines with sector leadership from tech and telecom and healthcare.","Turning to international markets, the UK grew 7% organically in Q4. We continue to see solid performance from McCann and FCB and had notable growth at Jack Morton. UK organic growth was 6.6% for the full year.","In Continental Europe, the environment for growth continue to be challenging and our agency's revenue change in the quarter was negative 80 basis points. In our largest markets, we had moderate growth in Germany but that was offset by decreases in France, Spain and Italy. For the full year, organic growth for Continental Europe was a positive 1.4%. Overall, the Continent represented 9% of our 2015 revenue mix.","In Asia-Pacific, our largest international region, organic revenue growth was 7.9% in Q4. That was on top of 13% growth a year-ago. Among our largest national markets, we had solid increases in India, Australia and China. We had growth across most of our agencies including Mediabrands, McCann, Mullen Lowe, Jack Morton, Weber Shandwick and R\/GA. For the year, organic growth in the region was 8.3%, paced by double-digit growth in China, India, Singapore and Hong Kong.","In LatAm, we grew 5.5% organically in the quarter on top of 11% growth a year-ago. We continue to see strong performance in Argentina, Mexico and Colombia along with a slight decrease in Brazil due to continued macro headwinds. Our growth in the region is led by McCann, Huge and R\/GA. For the year, organic growth was 4.7%.","In our other markets group, revenue increased 60 basis points organically on top of 12% organic growth in Q4 2014. This group is made up of Canada, the Middle East and Africa. For the year, organic growth was 4.8%, with strong performance in the Middle East and Canada.","On slide six, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. Most recent data point is 6.1% for calendar 2015.","Moving on to slide seven, our operating expenses. In the fourth quarter, the organic increase in our operating expenses was 3.1% compared with 5.2% organic revenue growth. Salaries and related expense decreased to 56.2% for the fourth quarter revenue compared with 57.4% a year ago. That was mainly due to lower incentive and other performance-based expenses in the quarter. Incentive expenses were accrued at a higher level over the first nine months of this year compared to 2014 due to strong operating performance throughout the year. Base payroll, benefits and tax increased as a percentage of revenue in Q4, mainly due to the impact of currency changes.","Office and general expenses were 23% of fourth quarter revenue this year, the same level as last year. For the full year, operating expenses increased 4.8% on an organic basis compared to organic revenue growth of 6.1%.","Looking at the sources of operating leverage for the full year, our ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue improved 20 basis points to 63.8% from 64% in 2014. Underneath that, base payroll, benefits and tax expense was 52.7% of revenue compared to 52.6% a year ago. But it is worth noting this ratio would have improved by 20 basis points if not for the decrease in our pass-through revenue which is offset in our O&G expenses.","Expense for temporary labor was 3.6% of revenue for the full-year 2015 compared to 3.8% a year-ago. Incentive expense was 3.7% of revenue for the full year compared to 3.5% in 2014, reflecting strong performance against our financial targets, almost entirely in our long-term incentive programs. Severance expense was 0.9% of revenue in 2015, the same level as the year-ago. Our other salaries and related category was 2.9% of revenue compared with 3.2% in 2014.","Year-end head count was approximately 49,000, an increase of 3.6%. The increases were due to hire in growth areas of our portfolio including McCann, Mediabrands, Public Relations, and for digital talent notably in support of new business wins.","Turning to office and general expenses for the full year, O&G was 24.7% of revenue compared to 25.6% in 2014. We had operating leverage on nearly all of our O&G categories as our real estate, purchasing, shared service and IT teams continue to drive significant efficiencies. That includes 40 basis points on occupancy, 10 basis points on telecom, office supplies and travel, and 50 basis points on all other O&G, which includes the benefits of lower pass-throughs.","On slide eight, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. As the chart reflects with the most recent data point 11.5%, we have come a long way. There is still work to be done and we remain highly focused on attaining our long-term goal.","Slide nine is provided for clarity on the impact of business dispositions on our diluted earnings per share. As shown here, our loss on sales of businesses was $12 million in Q4 and with minimal tax benefit, resulting in a loss of $0.03 per diluted share. For the full year at right, the expense of our business sales was $50 million before tax with again only a small tax yield. Result was a loss of $0.12 per diluted share for the year. In sum, the adjusted EPS comparison is $1.21 per share for this year and $0.98 per share for 2014.","Turning to slide 10, the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the year with $1.51 billion of cash and short-term marketable securities, which compared to $1.67 billion a year ago. We returned $481 million to shareholders during the year through our share repurchase and common stock dividends.","On slide 11, we turn to cash flow for the full year. Cash from operations in 2015 was $674 million compared with $670 million a year ago. That includes $118 million used in working capital compared with $131 million a year ago. Our investing activities used $203 million in the year including $161 million for CapEx and $29 million for acquisitions.","Our M&A pipeline continues to be strong. While timing can shift between periods, we've continued to target a $150 million to $200 million annually for acquisitions. Financing activities used $473 million in 2015, mainly $285 million for the repurchase of our common stock and $196 million in common stock dividends. In 2015, our net decrease in cash and marketable securities was $158 million.","Slide 12 is the long view of our debt decreasing from $2.3 billion in 2007 to our current debt level of $1.76 billion at the end of 2015.","Slide 13 shows the total of our average basic plus dilutive shares over time. And at the far right, is the total as of year-end 2015. This has been an area of substantial progress with average total shares decreasing by 125 million shares over the time period. Our starting position for 2016 is 409 million on the right.","In summary on slide 14, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and the year. Our teams executed very well, achieving strong revenue growth, while maintaining expense discipline. And our balance sheet continues to be a source of value creation as evidently actions announced by our board today. That leaves us well positioned entering 2016.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Michael.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Frank. Let me apologize for the granularity we're showing in this report. It is a full-year report, which is why this is the time of the year where we really provide some more detail. So please bear with us. I hope you'll see some of the important ins and outs in our performance for 2015.","But from every perspective, 2015 was a very successful year, which saw us accomplish significant milestones in terms of our performance in the marketplace, as well as our financial results. We continue to demonstrate the effectiveness of our offerings with particular emphasis on our creative and digital capabilities. We further strengthened our position as the destination of choice for the industry's top talent.","One key element of our talent strategy is the long-standing successful commitment to diversity and inclusion. We reinforce these values through a comprehensive set of award-winning programs, and we ensure accountability by tying executive compensation directly to diversity objectives. We began our formal programs a decade ago. Since then, we've seen dramatic improvements in the diversity of our workforce. An environment that encourage respect and trust is key to a creative business like ours, and a competitive advantage comes with having a variety of perspectives and beliefs when solving our clients' business challenges.","The quality of our people and our work helped us deliver industry-leading organic revenue growth, and we further enhanced operating margin by 100 basis points. We also continued to strengthen our capital structure, achieve investment grade status from all the major credit agencies and built on our strong shareholder return programs.","Highlights of our performance included continued progress in McCann Worldgroup and shared growth at CMG as well as outstanding performance from Mediabrands in the midst of a historically unprecedented number of media account reviews. R\/GA delivered its strongest financial and reputational year ever. FCB continued in the successful implementation of its turnaround plan. We once again saw a dynamic growth from our digital special agencies and within the embedded digital capabilities across our portfolio.","The quality of our offerings is at its highest level and well over a decade. This was evident in the recognition we received across the portfolio. We once again led all holding companies in Ad Age A-List honors, with R\/GA, McCann and Deutsche on this prestigious list and UM chosen as Media Agency of the Year, a designation it also earned from Adweek.","Across every marketing discipline, we posted exceptional performance in the industry's most important competitions that award creativity and marketing effectiveness, Weber Shandwick and Golin won numerous PR Agency of the Year honors. Our healthcare agencies dominated the medical marketing and media awards. At Cannes, R\/GA was named Agency of the Year, and The Martin Agency brought home the Grand Prix in the film category.","In terms of awards per dollar of revenue, IPG agencies' performance in Effie Awards globally led the industry with MullenLowe taking both the Grand Effie and winning Agency of the Year. Importantly, the effectiveness of our agencies was equally apparent and consistently strong new business performance throughout the year.","During 2015, McCann posted strong growth across the range of its agencies and further improved its creative profile. Management continued to build on the level of collaboration and cross-selling within Worldgroup, as well as the strong digital and accountability offerings at MRM. The agency also strengthened its already powerful position in key markets such as India, China and Brazil.","At CMG, our award-winning public relation agencies, Weber and Golin continue to gain market share, driven by growth from their largest clients and best-in-class digital in content market capabilities where both firms have established positions at the forefront of their fields.","Octagon and Jack Morton remain leaders in their respective disciplines. Mediabrands was also a top-tier performer with very strong performance in the media reviews that dominated the headlines in 2015. Having already won the U.S. J&J, Coke, and CVS assignments, UM closed the year by prevailing in the global J&J consolidation and added a solid showing in the Sony review in early 2016. The organic investments we've made in digital, programmatic and data capabilities are playing a key role in Mediabrands success.","R\/GA had an outstanding year which featured strong growth, as well as creative work that is recognized across all digital media and increasingly at traditional channels as well. The agency is also a leader in terms of innovation, not only in the agency's offerings, but also with accelerator programs where it incubates startups and share learnings with many other major clients.","Positive momentum at FCB continues, as the agency secured new assignments from leading advertisers such as InBev, Coca-Cola, Fiat, Chrysler. At Cannes, FCB had its best performance ever in the arrival of a tremendously talented new global creative leader and take the quality of the agency's products to an even greater height. FCB's healthcare offering was once again a top performer in its space.","MullenLowe continue to progress. Their position as a nimble global network with a strong creative culture and contemporary hyperbundled approach is being well received in the marketplace. The global leadership team is aligned and energized. We are also seeing the benefits from the integration of Profero as the group's digital partner, especially in key markets such as the U.S., UK and China.","Our focus on open architecture solutions, which combine the best of our talent from across the organization, was once again a meaningful contributor to our results. Many multi-agency opportunities came into the group, domestically and internationally. The largest of these included the year's most significant holding company review in Latin America, LATAM Airlines, which we are now serving in over 20 countries, as well as J&J's Janssen Pharmaceuticals, which further underscores the value that our custom-built Wx unit delivers to this important client. And we continue to improve our delivery of integrated multi-agency solutions for existing multinationals.","Overall, our strong performance in 2015 reflects a series of long-term strategic decisions we have backed with significant investment over time. The key drivers of our industry-leading organic revenue performance have been talent acquisition and development, particularly in creative and strategic roles, the open architecture model that I just discussed, as well as embedding digital experience into all our agencies. Our commitment to developing new skills, products and services and incorporating technology in all of our offerings has allowed us to stay highly relevant in the digital world.","For the year, we also saw continued progress related to the operating and financial management of our company. First and foremost, significant improvements in profitability keep us on track to achieving our long-term goal. Many initiatives are fueling the strong profitability trajectory that Frank shared with you. Among them are our performance incentives put in place that are driving continued focus on leveraging our investment in base payroll and temporary labor.","On the real estate front, our measure of square foot per employee decreased again in 2015 by approximately 3% to 202 square feet, down from over 240 square feet a few years ago. In the back office, over 75% of global revenue is now on an SAP platform, most of which is supported by our shared services. This included 2005 (sic) [2015] additions in India, China, and the U.S. with plans to add our agencies in Australia and Brazil in 2016.","Our return of capital programs also continue to positively impact results, and we've put approximately $2.5 billion towards total shareholder returns since 2011, the point in which we reinstituted these programs. We remain fully committed to further improving margins and building on these robust capital return programs. The latter is evident in our board's actions announced today with our dividend increase by 25% and provided for our current authorization of approximately $460 million for share repurchase.","We are well positioned as we move into 2016. As you've heard me say before, complexity is good because the value proposition of our portfolio of offerings is highly relevant to clients as they seek to navigate a dynamic media and marketing landscape. The general tone of the business remains solid. Yet as we've seen since the start of the year, there is significant volatility in the financial markets, and we will closely monitor the impact it has on consumer sentiment.","We are therefore approaching the year with appropriate degree of caution. Therefore, for 2016, we're targeting 3% to 4% organic growth, an improvement of margin of 50 basis points or more. Coupled with our continued commitment to capital returns, we are confident that achieving these targets will allow us to build on our strong track record of enhancing shareholder value.","We thank you for your time and support, and we look forward to updating you on our progress on our next call. At this point, I'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. Our first question is from the line of Ms. Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much. I guess my first question is, Michael, you have such great insight in sort of what the advertisers are thinking and sometimes there is a disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street. I guess what I'd love to hear is what are your advertisers saying in terms of their outlook for the year. And I guess how rattled are they, if at all, about any of these macro concerns?","And then just sort of a follow-on kind of along that same theme there. Your new business wins have been so impressive from what we can see on the outside. You guys see a lot more obviously internally. Do you think you're in a better position, I guess, going into 2016 than you were in 2015 in terms of your tailwind of new business?","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well. Good morning to you, Alexia. How come you didn't ask me how our January sales were?","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I still might.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Look, I don't think there is any question that there appears to be a disconnect between what's happening in the market and business. If you look at how we finished the fourth quarter, the tone of our business was solid.","That said, as we look into 2016, everyone on a global basis is watching this very carefully and are concerned about the future direction of the global economy. Our business is subject to changes in macroeconomics. And that's why we've put a tone of caution in terms of our forecast for 2016.","That said, we haven't seen major pullbacks by our clients. We do our budgeting on a zero-up basis. We take all of our agencies. They look at their book of business. They look at what they anticipate based on conversations with our clients. They put some levels of caution in those numbers. They also put some levels of optimism in terms of to-be-generated revenue. It's not an exact science and \u2013 which is why if you look at 2015, we started the year fairly conservative. And as we went through the year, we upped our guidance, and we expanded our margin expectations.","But the tone right now is okay, particularly if you look at 59% of our business is in the United States, and although we don't see high expectations in terms of growth, 3% to 4% growth in the United States enables us to expand margin by at least 50 basis points. And that's, to answer your other question, gives us a conversion around close to 30%, which is what we've always said. And if you expand the organic growth, that's where you see expansion of over the 50 basis points.","So the tone of the business, at least right now, is consistent. But, again, given this volatility, it's something that we have to put some element of caution out there. And I think it would be irresponsible for us not to have done that. And certainly, you're seeing that by our competitors in terms of the numbers they're showing.","Let me just comment. And Frank mentioned it, we do build in about 3% to 4%, some element of our pass-through in that guidance. So if you assume the 30-basis point to 50-basis point reduction in the pass-throughs, effectively that organic number is 3.5% to 4.5%. And let me just add that that pass-through is a direct pass-through. It's not us taking positions with respect to digital inventory, which I'm sure will be another question.","As far as the headwinds and tailwinds, yeah, we had some great wins on the media side. We did have some losses. There is a change in the tone of our business, and that is because a significant part of our business growth is coming from digital. Digital business tends to be much more project-oriented. And as a result, some projects that we were able to deliver in 2015, we're not sure of repeating in 2016.","So with respect to tailwinds, the tailwinds are in a specific, as we've said going into 2015. That said, we do have tailwinds, but I wouldn't equate them to as high a number as we had in 2015. But the other side of it, given our performance on the digital side, we believe our offerings are so strong that we'll see a project-based business continue in 2016.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And if I just squeeze in one more. Maybe for Frank, if you're looking at the margin permit this coming year. I guess, where do you think most of the leverage comes from the salaries and related or the O&G?","Frank Mergenthaler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. we're looking for both, Alexia. The key thing, the key metric that we look at is organic growth versus organic growth of our expenses. And it gets little convoluted when you look at the individual metrics because of the impact of passers on those metrics and also the impact of the foreign exchange. So again, we're looking at leverage out of both of our major cost buckets.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks very much. Congratulations on a great year.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Frank Mergenthaler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Janedis with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Michael, great to see the consistency this year. I know you talked about some of the headwinds globally. But as for the budget, are you assuming a similar performance out of Continental Europe and Latin America particularly in light of the comments on Brazil? And then on the related topic, given the comments about a potential currency impact on spend, was there any visible impact last year given the impact from currency? Thanks.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Look, we went into 2015 assuming plus or minus 1% in Continental Europe. We actually ended up on a full-year basis up 1%, a little bit over.","Frank Mergenthaler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So for our forecast for 2016 is very similar to how we went into 2015. I might add, we did increase some margin in Continental Europe which shows if we have revenue we can expand margin.","The second half of year of Brazil was better than the first half of the year. We had some hiccups in Brazil in the first half of the year. We're not assuming a big recovery in Brazil. But we do see offsets in the rest of Latin America which is why we believe we should have a good year coming out of Latin America. So that's built in to our forecast. We're not expecting double-digit growth in LatAm. Remember, we're coming off of double-digit growth for 2015. So we expect some single-digit growth \u2013 mid-single digit growth in Latin America.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just separately, Frank, given the uncertainty, is this going to be a year where temp labor ticks up rather than full-time hires? And does budget assume an increase in FTEs?","Frank Mergenthaler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You know, John, we look at total SRS and really don't bifurcate between \u2013 base that on the tax and temp. Yeah. I think there is a tendency to leverage temp when there is a lot of new business activity, which we saw last year. But I think we managed it quite well. But we don't get that granular. We look at our agencies to deliver an SRS target that we said in the budgeting process.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Speaking of that, was project business up in the fourth quarter?","Frank Mergenthaler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Michael, two for you. I'm wondering if maybe you can time travel back to the last two Februaries when you also guided the 3% to 4% and help us think about whether there is anything different that you see today in macro uncertainty versus the last two years where I think Europe was probably a friend of mine. Obviously, we've got some issues in other \u2013 in emerging markets now. I'm just wondering if you think things are worse, better or sort of similar to how your clients are talking to you about their business today versus the past years, when obviously, you delivered strong results.","And then, you had made a comment in a recent conference that you thought media review activity could be pretty high in 2016. I'm just wondering maybe you could revisit that comment and sort of fill us in a little bit.","And then, Frank, I'm just wondering if maybe you could give us some cash tax guidance or help for 2016 or any comment around your NOL position at this point. Thank you, guys.","Frank Mergenthaler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You keep forgetting I'm a tax guy. I'll only answer the tax question for you.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","You yelled at me last time for that, too. I keep forgetting. Sorry.","Frank Mergenthaler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Cash taxes are at 29%. We've used up our NOL in the U.S., which is why the cash taxes have gone up. We still have over $1 billion of NOL, but that's principally over in Europe which we can't use until those earnings take effect. So we did see some benefit there. But basically our cash taxes are in the 29% range right now.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think it's different. Now, look, first of all, let me talk about the UK. I think what we have seen if you compare it to two years ago, a turnaround in the UK, so we're forecasting it as our performance this year was 7% to 8% and we see a good solid year for the UK as well going into 2016. So I think that's a \u2013 and that's a big thing. It's 9% of our business. And so therefore, that's encouraging for us going into 2016.","I think Continental Europe anecdotally seems to be better but I haven't met anyone who isn't concerned about Continental Europe. I was in Davos, the conversations continued to be concerned with the financial institutions in Europe in particular, and I think that uncertainty drives our clients to be concerned. That said, it's a global economy and there is no question that our multinational clients are looking for growth markets, India, China, Latin America, frankly United States, we're seeing a good pickup in the United States, and I think that's a little bit different than it was a couple of years ago.","So there is no question that this volatility in the financial markets and in the financial institutions is giving everyone a lot of angst in terms of whether it be access to liquidity, whether affecting the capital markets and if I were running one of those companies I would be looking hard at the same, which puts an additional burden on what we have to do. I think they're not stopping spending, they're just being very careful in terms of where they spend. And that puts the burden on us to prove that what we do actually works. And if we can put together a fully integrated offering, that shows how we can move the needle, it's innovative, we save some money in the process. We're effective, we're held accountable for the performance of that. Then I think our clients have the money to spend, and they will do that. But they do have an element of caution in that, which is why it's still early in the year and a lot of things are happening, and let's face it, we have issues with oil. And who knows what's going to happen with the price of oil and those kind of things?","So there is caution out there. But what's amazing is our business \u2013 as I said, we're not expecting a 6% growth again. We're forecasting 3% to 4%, and if we deliver 3% to 4%, we can expand margin by a healthy 50 basis points or better. And I think that's a reasonable way to go into 2016. I'm not trying to be a Debbie Doubter here, but I'm just trying to be cautious in terms of what may be ahead of us, and if we're wrong, then we'll adjust accordingly. But right now, I'm comfortable with the numbers that we're putting out there.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Anything on the reviews front?","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I mean, we still have \u2013 the U.S. Army is probably the biggest one that's with mandatory review. Last time we had it, we were prevailed in the review. BMW media is still out there. We're comfortable where we are in that. The rest of reviews were challenges, so we hope to pick up some business along those lines.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. A couple if I could. Michael, wondering on the guidance and the reference to the 30 bps to 50 bps headwind from pass-through, is that tied to the dispositions this year?","And then just generally speaking, wondering if you could back up a little bit and talk about the CMG services, the below-the-line stuff in some cases, branding event, shopper marketing, sport sponsorship. PR has been doing well. But give us your outlook. A lot of time spent talking to investors about concerns on secular challenges, most of that have to do with traditional advertising. I just want to \u2013 I just wonder if you look at that question through the lens of marketing services, what's the outlook there? And then one quick follow-up. Thanks.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Okay. Pass-through is a direct pass-through. It has nothing to do with dispositions. So the 30 basis points is apples-to-apples, and that's principally from our CMG businesses, particularly Jack Morton and our event businesses. And again, as you recall, those are direct pass-throughs for revenue and expenses.","I'll comment on PR. And so I'm going to let Frank talk about it since it falls within his purview. Remember, the PR business has changed dramatically, okay? What's happening is all our different disciplines, they're all covering also some aspects of the marketplace, digital capabilities, social networking, social media, content.","All of that is part of what we're seeing across the board in both digital and PR agencies and our traditional agencies. And as a result, Weber Shandwick in particular was a leader in terms of looking at their portfolio and converting to the digital and social environment. And as a result, we've seen them taking market share out there, it's because of their content and new thinking in terms of PR.","Now, we're encouraged by that. We think they continue \u2013 we have best-in-class offerings there and we continue to see solid growth there. Frank?","Frank Mergenthaler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I mean, to add on to Michael's comments, we made specific investments of our new capabilities around PR. And you look at our performance at Weber, at Golin, at DeVries, it's clear they're gaining market share. And the critical thing is we're going to need to continue to invest and keeps our place in the marketplace.","And looking at the rest of the portfolio, our sports business at Octagon, our experiential business at Jack Morton are very, very strong. And the CMG segment does get impacted by the decline in pass-through, and that's intentional. We've been trying to migrate our contracts away from being a principal specifically in our experiential business to an agent.","So when you look at it on a net revenue basis, our growth has been high-single digits for the past three years. So those businesses are very, very healthy. And it's nice in our branding business that future brands had, again, a very strong year. So we're very supportive of that segment and we'll continue to invest.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Let me add. By the way, when we say we talk about invest, we actually had an acquisition by Golin in China this year. And we haven't had one \u2013 we basically grow our businesses in China organically by hiring some really talented people as we did in 2015. But for Golin, we actually hired \u2013 we bought a company that's very attractive and added to their portfolio.","The other important point is when we talk about integrated offerings, we mean it. And so when we put together open architecture, whether it's Golin, whether it's Octagon, whether it's Weber Shandwick, we bring them into the open architecture model.","So when we're sitting at the table and presenting the best of IPG to our clients, it includes a full array of our businesses. So our marketing services, our traditional agency businesses, our digital capabilities, and our media, they're all sitting at the table. And frankly, that's what clients want to see. And the collaboration is critical to that, which is why we spend so much time on collaboration within IPG. And this open architecture model actually works. And even on \u2013 when we're just looking at media pitches, we bring in the open architecture on media.","We have different disciplines, digital, experiential. All of that comes to play in these pitches. And frankly, I'm a firm believer that's one of the reasons we've been successful in the new business arena because I've heard a number of clients say to me when we walk out of the room that what was refreshing is that they didn't know which individuals was from which discipline, and the team really spoke as one voice. And they were focusing on clients. And that makes a big difference to the clients because they don't have to worry about our silos and our issues. They're just interested in servicing their clients. And if we didn't have the marketing service arm that we have at CMG and the media, and the digital capabilities, and the creative capabilities at our agencies, we wouldn't be able to do that. So I'm very comfortable with that.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for all the color. I'll leave it there.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Frank Mergenthaler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisors. Your line is now open.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, that was a good question. Thank you. Can we go on to the next?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Wieser with Pivotal. Sir, your line is now open.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. On that open architecture angle, I was curious if you could just comment a little bit about Philippe Krakowsky's role now with Mediabrands and sort of what the thinking is behind that and how that presumably ties into bringing resources across the holding company into Mediabrands or tying it together.","And separately, maybe a bigger picture question, I'm curious about how you think about either making or refraining from strategic shifts at the holding company level versus encouraging the individual business units to do the same. We've seen Publicis obviously stake a claim in consulting services and WPP maybe a bit more investing across ecosystem and content and media owners and data. I'm just curious how you're thinking about the role of the future direction of marketing services and where that should originate from.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. First of all, as you know, Philippe is sort of an integral part of the collaboration we have at IPG. Henry has done a tremendous job in coming into Mediabrands and the success of Mediabrands is pretty evident by the results of their performance. And he's done a great job, Henry and his team and his UM initiative and all the rest of Mediabrands.","Philippe's oversight and role at Mediabrands is exactly that, to bring \u2013 to make sure that we're looking at all the possibilities of collaboration and, as well, Philippe has a technology background and helping in terms of new media and new technology as well. So it was exceptionally well received at Mediabrands and the people. But frankly, Philippe has an HR responsibility, so he knows a lot of those people very well and they've worked very closely together. So I can't tell you how many favorable e-mails I received from both clients as well as individuals on that move, so we're really excited about it.","Marketing services, as I said, it fits very nicely into the open architecture model. I don't believe we have to own various data sources and so on when we can rent them. But that said, we did a data analytics acquisition in Israel this year. Mediabrands has their own data sources and when they need to use that, they have over 80 or 100 different data sources. So as long as there is partnering out there where we can rent it, we think we have to do it.","We have a sufficient amount of analytics and data to make our offerings competitive, if not better, and we don't have to own it. But when there are unique opportunities out there, we make some tactical investments in it. We did it in a little company \u2013 in Samba TV. We did it in Keep. So we look at it both ways.","The key to this in the open architecture is having a vehicle without having to restructure our corporation to collaborate. And since we've been doing it for 10 years, we didn't need to restructure our entire company. We have high-priority objectives for all of our CEOs that require them to collaborate both within their networks as well as outside. So it's kind of interesting to see everybody jumping on this but we started doing this 10 years ago and it's part of our DNA.","And every time there is a new thing out there in terms of whether it be data, whether it be content, we want to participate, and we'll do it through our partnerships, through investments or just contractual arrangements.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Jerome J. Leshne - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Brian. Operator, next caller \u2013 next question, please.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I guess it's been that clear.","Operator","Thank you. Sir, our next question, thank you, is from Mr. Bill Bird with FBR. Sir, your line is now open.","Bill G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","... 2016. And then second, what are your current thoughts on targeted leverage? Thank you.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Bill, I'm sorry. We didn't hear the first part of your question.","Bill G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","I'm sorry. I was wondering if you could talk about the new buyback authorization and what a reasonable pace of buybacks do you expect in 2016.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, we've been averaging close to $300 million buybacks per year. And we have an extra $149 million on top of the authorization. We're not committed to doing all of it in one year. We have \u2013 we'll have a normalized annual buyback throughout the year.","That said, every once in a while we're opportunistic. You saw we were a little over-weighted in the fourth quarter when we saw some price pressure on our stocks. So we have the flexibility. But for analytics point, if you use $300 million I think that's a reasonable number for us to spend and will be opportunistic and see how the marketplace goes.","This is part of a long-term strategy. We believe that given our leverage, obviously, bringing our ratings up one more notch would be very helpful to us. In that it will give us \u2013 free our commercial paper program which could help us in terms of cyclicality of our cash flows. And that could free us some additional cash as well.","So from an overall program point of view, we're very comfortable with our balance sheet and where we are. We hope to have a commercial paper program if we get one more notch up. We have a robust return of capital on buybacks and a 25% increase in dividend is a very nice mix between dividends and buybacks. So our overall structure in terms of return has been very well received by the investors. Before year-end, between Frank and myself and Jerry, we've met with most of our shareholders and this is based on the input we're getting from all of our shareholders.","And as far as our leverage, we're very comfortable and then we want to be where we are heading into a market that is as volatile or potentially volatile as it is right now.","Bill G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Mr. Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Sir, your line is now open.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Well, thanks. I wonder if I could try to tie together a few of the threads in the conversation here and ask a question this way. Given the sense of confusion between what the financial market is telling us and what you and your peers are telling us about ad spending, I wonder if there is something beyond traditional advertising or even traditional marketing services in what you are doing with your clients, i.e., are companies like IPG becoming more business services providers, providing technology and advertising and marketing services overall and, therefore, you become more embedded in your client's budget processes and therefore you have a greater chance of sustaining more resilient spending beyond just what we might call advertising and marketing services? Is that something that maybe is providing a sense of optimism amongst your clients on their spending?","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Tim, that's a great question and the answer to that is yes, okay, particularly on the digital. If you look, for example, what R\/GA is doing in terms of design and business planning and product development, the accelerator program are examples of that. We have capabilities. There aren't many companies that have the capabilities we have both in terms of typical advertising role, media planning, content distribution, digital expertise, insights, all of that put together.","And frankly, what we do actually works. And we have data and we have all sorts of information that shows that if we can bring all of these offerings together, we can, in fact, help our clients move the needle. And it's refreshing to be able to walk into a room and put together some new ideas from a business context. And you're right, it's not just traditional advertising. It's looking into the future. We can anticipate where consumers are going to be spending their money. And based on those insights, we can help our clients real-time look at where they can allocate their dollars. And if it's not working, we can shift with them. We can create dashboards with our clients. We can help them do design work. We can do branding for them.","It really turns out to be a full-service offering that we can tap into, and it gives them a degree of comfort that they're getting cutting-edge insights without having to add 12 different disciplines coming in a room working together. So I do believe.","And of course, we do consulting. I mean, several of our agencies have a consulting bases armed to it. So yes, our business is changing. And frankly, that's why I'm bullish on our industry. For years, they've talked about our industry being dis-intermediated, going away. We always find a way to sustain ourselves. And I think if you look at our results, you had a pretty good indication that we're capable of doing that. So yes, I thank you for that question.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","With that said, I think those were our last questions. I really thank you for your support throughout the year. We're excited about 2016, notwithstanding some caution that we've made. And I look forward to bringing it to light. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference.

All parties are in a listen-only mode, until the question-and-answer portion. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jerry Leshne","Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com. This morning, we are joined by Michael Roth; and Ellen Johnson. We will begin with prepared remarks to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 AM Eastern Time.","During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company. These are subject to the uncertainties in the cautionary statement that is included in our earnings release and the slide presentation and further detailed in our 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.","We will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful supplemental data that while not a substitute for GAAP measures allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance.","At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Jerry and thank you for joining us this morning as we review our results for the fourth quarter and 2019. I\u2019m pleased to be joined this morning by our CFO, Ellen Johnson. I\u2019ll start our call by covering the highlights of our performance, as well as our outlook for the New Year. Ellen will then provide additional details and I\u2019ll conclude with an update on our agencies to be followed by our Q&A.","We\u2019re pleased to report strong performance for both the quarter and full year. At the top of our financial highlights, net revenue organic growth was 2.9% in the fourth quarter, which builds on the challenging 7.1% count in the fourth quarter of 2018. That brings organic growth for the full year to 3.3% which exceeds the high end of our targeted range for year and again, places us at the forefront of our industry.","Regionally, fourth quarter US organic growth was 2.1%, which is on top of the 6.3%, US organic growth in the fourth quarter of the prior year. It\u2019s also worth noting that our growth in the US this quarter includes that is in spite of the headwinds we have described in prior calls, which dragged on US growth by 4.3% in the quarter.","International organic growth was 4.1%, which on top of 8% growth a year ago, also represents continued strong performance. We grew our net organically across the UK, Continental Europe, LatAm, Canada, the Middle East with Asia-Pac, the sole exception. Globally, we saw a solid Q4 increases at both our IAN and CMG segments, which reflects very broad participation across agencies and disciplines.","Our growth was led by media, data services and tech. We also saw contributions from our creatively led global integrated networks. Among our marketing service specialists, fourth quarter growth was based by sports and entertainment marketing and experiential marketing. Our top performing client sectors were tech and telecom, healthcare, retail, financial services and food and beverage. For the year, it\u2019s worth noting that every client sector grew other than auto, where we are contending with our headwinds.","Turning to our operating income and EBITA, fourth quarter operating income was $491 million. EBITA was $513 million of in Q4, compared with adjusted EBITA of $504 million a year ago. EBTIA margin was 21.1%. For the full year, adjusted EBITA was $1.2 billion, an increase of a 11.3%. Our adjusted EBITA margin was 14%, an increase of 50 basis points from the year ago, attaining the high end of our target range for the year.","Full year diluted reported earnings per share was $1.68 and was $1.93 as adjusted which his comparable to $1.86 per share a year ago. Our results for the year further demonstrate the strength of our client-centric, integrated offerings and the quality of our people, our combination that has produced leading organic growth and margin improvement over a period of many years.","We\u2019re proud of our consistent level of achievements amidst significant change in our industry, and the dynamic environment in which we are all operating. Along with strong performance, we have continued our investments in outstanding talent across our agencies and in the tools and capabilities that keep us on a leading-edge of our industry.","This is especially true in key areas like digital, data services and analytics, strategy and creative. On the strength of these results and confidence in our future prospects, we\u2019re pleased to announce this morning our Board\u2019s decision to raise the IPG\u2019s quarter dividend by 9% to $0.255 per share. This marks our eighth consecutive year of dividend increases. However, which time our quarterly dividend per share is more than quadrupled.","As we turn to our outlook for 2020, we do so with the foundation of highly competitive agencies, collaborating effectively in our open architecture framework and converting revenue growth to operating profits at margin accretive rates. Further, we\u2019re extremely well resourced with data science capabilities that are fundamental to a future of high order offerings.","From a capital allocation standpoint, we continue to be focused on organic investment in our business, to maintain growth leadership on deleveraging our balance sheet following the Acxiom transactions and as demonstrated in our action this morning, on returning capital to shareholders. All of these priorities further our commitment to driving shareholder value.","As it\u2019s apparent in our results, the worldwide tone of business among our clients were made solid through yearend. While there are macro issues that required continued attention, including the sustainability of economic expansion, the state of international trade and global political developments, the backdrop nonetheless appears down as we enter the New Year.","In addition, like all global companies, we are concerned about the coronavirus outbreak and we want to convey our deepest support and commitments to the people of China. Naturally, we are focused on the wellbeing and safety of our own people, as we have 2,500 employees in Greater China and thousands more partners, clients and suppliers. Most of our people in China are working from home, and are subject to travel restrictions.","We have technology in place that makes it easier for our people to work remotely. We are closely monitoring the situation and we\u2019ll take every necessary precaution to safeguard our people. Nonetheless, we continue to see opportunities for solid growth in 2020. Even as we are comparing once again, against industry-leading growth rates and we\u2019ll continue to contend with revenue headwinds in the first half of the year.","For 2020, we are targeting organic growth of 3%, we outcycled through large headwinds by midyear. And we\u2019re well positioned with world-class offerings, a distinctive go-to-market strategy and a unique high value added resources.","Turning to EBITA margin for 2020, we also expect to continue to hedge to our longstanding record of margin expansion in the upcoming years. We\u2019re targeting EBITA margin expansions of 20 basis points over our 2019 adjusted EBITA margin, which would bring us to 14.2% in 2020. As always, as the year unfolds, we will regularly review our perspective on the year during our quarter calls.","In summary, we believe that the drivers of shareholder value creation are the quality of our people and resources, revenue growth, margin expansion and share dividends, they all will continue to work well in Interpublic as we enter a New Year.","At this stage, I\u2019ll turn things over to Ellen, for additional detail on our performance and then I\u2019ll return with an update and highlights of our businesses. Ellen?","Ellen Johnson","Thank you, Michael and good morning. As a reminder, my remarks reflect the slide presentation that accompanies our website [technical difficulty]. On Slide 2, you\u2019ll see a summary of our results. Fourth quarter organic growth was 2.9%, on top of strong growth the year ago. US organic growth was 2.1% and international organic growth was 4.1%.","For the full year, our organic was 3.3%. Q4 EBITA was $513 million and EBITA margin on net revenue was 21.1%. For the full year, our adjusted EBITA margin was 1.2 billion and adjusted EBITA margin expanded 50 basis points to 14%. For the quarter, our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.88. Full year adjusted diluted EPS was $1.93.","Over the course of 2019, we\u2019d retired debt in the amount of $400 million. Gross leverage at yearend was 2.3 times, 2019 and adjusted EBITA as defined in our credit agreement. As Michael mentioned, we announced this morning that our Board has once again raised our common share dividend. They\u2019ve approved a 9% increase to $0.255 per share quarterly.","Turning to Slide 3, you\u2019ll see our P&L for the quarter. I\u2019ll cover revenue and the operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow up. Turning to revenue on Slide 4. Fourth quarter net revenue was $2.43 billion compared to Q4 2018, the impact of the change in exchange rate was negative 1%. And the impact of net debt position was a negative 1.1%. The resulting in organic revenue increase was 2.9%.","Net revenue growth for the full year was 7.4%, consisting of 3.3% organic growth and a positive 5.8% from net acquisitions while currency was a negative 1.7%. Net acquisitions for the year were cheaply Acxiom\u2019s revenue over the first nine months, less the impact of certain small non-strategic agency. Acxiom growth was included in our organic change, beginning with the fourth quarter.","As you can see, on the bottom half of the slide, Q4 organic growth for integrated agency network segment was 2.9%. growth in IAN was led by a range of our offerings, including IPG Mediabrands and Kinesso, Acxiom, McCann Worldgroup, FCB, notably FCB Health, MullenLowe and Huge.","At our CMG segments, organic growth was 3.3% in the quarter, driven by strong performance at our Octagon sports and entertainment marketing group and by Jack Morton in experiential. Full year organic growth was 3.5% at IAN, and 2.3% at CMG.","Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by regions. In the US, organic growth was 2.1% in the quarter, which includes a revenue headwind of 430 basis points that we\u2019ve called out previously. Our domestic growth was led by a range of offerings, notably media, technology and other services, healthcare and both FCB and McCann and our creatively led services at MullenLowe and Carmichael Lynch.","For the full year, US organic growth was 1.9% that\u2019s on top of 5.1% a year ago and includes the impact of headwinds of 3.3%. And again, the headwinds will be get diminished in Q2 and are essentially cycled at midyear.","Looking at our international markets, we had another strong quarter from the UK, with 4% organic growth, you\u2019ll recall that\u2019s on top of 9.6% in Q4 2018. We continue to see contributions to growth across the number of our offerings in agencies. Notably, IPG Mediabrands, Jack Morton and Huge.","For the full year, UK organic growth was 3.7%, a solid increase against 9.7% growth in 2018. In Continental Europe, organic growth was 6.2%, this was highlighted by increases in most of our largest national markets, namely Spain, Germany and France. Q4 cast an outstanding year of 7.3% organic growth on the continents. In Asia-Pac, our primary concern as Michael mentioned earlier, is the safety and wellbeing of our colleagues, as well as all those affected by the coronavirus.","Looking at our results in the regions. Our organic revenue decrease was 3%. Consistent with recent quarters, we continue to see mixed performance in our largest regional markets. Revenue in China and Australia decreased, well India was flat in the quarter and Japan increased. Our organic change in the region was negative 30 basis points for the full year.","LatAm was 17.1% organically in Q4 which was on top of 17.4% a year ago. We continue to see growth across the regions were led by our offerings in Brazil and Mexico, powered by both new client wins and growth with existing clients. Full year organic growth was 21.8%. In our other markets group, organic revenue growth was 4.7% in the quarter, led by increases in the Middle East and Canada. Full year organic growth was 4.6%.","Slide 6, if you look at the expense drivers of our margin expansion in the quarter and the year. I will focus my remarks on a full year. Our ratio of total salaries and related expense to net revenue ratio for the full year was 64.6%, which is an improvement of 140 basis points. Underneath that, we improved in all major expense categories. These payroll, benefits and tax, performance based incentive, compensation, temporary labor and severances.","At yearend, our companywide headcount was approximately 54,300, which is an increase of less than 1% from a year ago. Our office and other direct expense was 18.1% for the full year and net revenue compared was 16.9% a year ago. The increase is mainly due to the consolidation of Acxiom for the full year which has a relatively more investments in data and technology.","SG&A expense decreased to 1.1% from 2019 or a 2.1% as reported in 2018. Excluding Acxiom deal expenses from 2018, the SG&A ratio was 1.7%. The change mainly reflects a greater expense allocation to our agencies in 2019 to that including the Acxiom for the full year and lower expense for performance-based incentives and compensation in SG&A.","Our depreciation \u2013 our expense for depreciation was 2.2% of net revenue in 2019, that\u2019s an increase of 20 basis points. The amortization of acquired intangibles was 1% in 2019, compared to 0.5% in 2018. For both depreciation and amortization, increases due to the consolidation of Acxiom for the full year in 2019, compared to only the fourth quarter in 2018.","Turning to Slide 7, we present detail on adjustments for reported fourth quarter results in order to give you better transparency and a picture of comparable performances. This begins on the left-hand side with our reported results and steps through our operating income to EBITA and our adjusted diluted EPS.","Our amortization expense for acquired intangibles was $21.4 million, resulting in EBITA of $512.7 million. On our operating expense, we had a loss in the quarter of $24 million in other expense, related to the disposition of a few small non-strategic businesses.","In our tax provision, we recorded a net benefit in the quarter from valuation allowance reversal settling $25.3 million which we have backed out here. While an adjusting item, the allowance reversal reflects fundamentally improved operating performance in the related markets. At the part of this slide you can see the after tax impacts for diluted share based adjustments. The total was $0.04 per share the difference between $0.84 reported diluted EPS and $0.88 as adjusted.","Slide 8 depicts similar adjustments to the full year. Again, for continuity and comparability this also brings in the impact of the restructuring charge from Q1. Our amortization expense was $86 million and Q1 2019 restructuring charges were $32 million. Business dispositions over the course of the year resulted in a [$1] [ph] loss of $46 million.","The impact of discrete items from tax was a benefit of $39 million. The results as adjusted full year diluted EPS was $1.93. Note at our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year was 25.8% which is at the low end of our targeted 26% to 28% range. In 2020, our direct forecast for our normalized effective tax rate is unchanged at 26% to 28%.","On Slide 9, we turn to cash flow for the full year. Cash from operations was $1.5 billion compared with $555 million a year ago. The comparison which was $443 generated from working capital, compared with $431 million used in working capital in 2018. As we have pointed out on previous calls, working capital can be volatile from year-to-year.","Due to the variation in timing of collections and payments evened by only a few days. The timing percentage of both for late 2018 resulted in a benefit to us in 2019. Investing activities was $152 million in a year, reflecting our CapEx of a $199 million. 2018 includes the Acxiom acquisition.","Our financing activities used $843 million, which was mainly $403 million for the repayment of long-term debt and $363 million for our common stock dividend. In 2018, proceeds from long-term debt issuance related to the Acxiom acquisitions. Our net increase in cash was $519 million.","Slide 10 is the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the year with $1.2 billion in cash and equivalents. Our $500 million, 3.5% senior notes mature in October this year and is reflected under current liability.","Slide 11 depicts the maturity schedules of our outstanding debt. Total debt at yearend was $3.3 billion, which is a reduction of approximately $400 million from a year ago and $500 million since the Acxiom financing in October 2018.","In summary on Slide 12, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and the year. Our teams executed very well, achieving strong revenue growth in spite of significant headwinds, while maintaining expense discipline. Our balance sheet continues to be strong and a meaningful source of value creation. As evidenced main actions announced by our Board today. That leaves us well positioned entering 2020.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Michael.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Ellen. Well we were pleased to have achieved strong results for 2019, highlighted by organic revenue growth that once again, leads the sector. In each of the past five years, our growth rate has topped the industry average. This continued outperformance speaks to our talent, offerings and a differentiated holding company model. For some time, we\u2019ve seen our key role as supporting and nurturing strong agency brands, so that they can continue to produce great advertising for our clients.","Simultaneously, we have never lost sight of the evolving landscape and a disruption taking place in marketing, media and communications. To address these challenges, we\u2019ve invested in key areas that create an IPG disposition for the future.","These have included embedded digital expertise across the portfolio, leading edge media and data capabilities and open architecture solutions, all of which have helped us fill our future facing company. Today, IPG is in a preeminent position to help brands reach consumers in a highly efficient and relevant way.","Our company can unite data with creativity, to deliver advertising that is valued by consumers and valuable for brand. We can help business leaders find tomorrow\u2019s growth through the combination of technology, craft and collaboration. And we have created a modern holding company with a culture of integrity and transparency, where IPG sets the standard regarding conscience and respect for privacy, accountability and brand safety.","As we have noted on prior calls, understanding data and its power is absolutely essential and it\u2019s been the priority for us over many years, well before we acquired Acxiom. Today\u2019s IPG has the ability to help companies optimize the value of their own first-party data and the service of enhancing the customer experience and in helping our clients reach their business goals.","Thanks for our long-term strategy, there are many more used cases with which we are increasingly involved ranging from power and ecommerce to the execution of omnichannel and media. Sometimes the job is to help a company determine if the data they hold has been sourced in a way that meets the most rigorous, ethical and regular \u2013 regulatory standards. Other times the challenge is to put first, second and third party data to work to drive new insights and innovation.","To further enhance our media and data services and tech offerings, last quarter we launched Kinesso, a marketing technology company that leverages our data science skills to provide services that help marketers make media activations faster and more effective. Kinesso was currently working in close partnership with Mediabrands, where there was the most adjacency and therefore, the great opportunity. Acxiom and Kinesso capabilities are being brought to bear on all our major clients and new business opportunities.","We have coupled these strategic moves with strong financial management. Consistent with recent years, during 2019, we demonstrated our ability to remain disciplined on cost and to deliver against our stated financial goals. Our record is sustained long-term margin improvement is something we are very proud of.","Our Board\u2019s decision today to increase the dividend shows the continued commitment to return value to shareholders as well as confidence in our future prospects. In addition, in the future, as we return our debt levels to more historical ratios, we will return to including share buybacks in our capital allocation programs.","To provide a progress report on the key developments within our portfolio, let\u2019s now turn to the performance of the agency level during the quarter. At our integrated agency network, Mediabrands closed the year with a very strong performance. UM retains the relationship with GoPro and added Armor All, recently acquired by existing client Energizer.","And it has just named UM, a best place to work in 2020. Initiative also posted a very good quarter and end of the year. The agency saw a notable win with [indiscernible]. At CES, IPG Media Lab was again on the convention floor, identifying the most exciting and relevant innovations in products and providing guided experiences for our clients.","FCB also grew in the quarter, driven by strong performance from its health operations. FCB Health was named Global Healthcare Network of the Year for the third consecutive year and Area 23 named our Global Agency of the Year and Regional Agency of the Year at the 2019 New York Festivals Global Awards.","McCann Worldgroup saw growth globally, as well as an important industry accolades, notably Global Agency of the Year awarded by Adweek and Network of the Year at the Epica Awards. In addition, McCann\u2019s work for Microsoft, featuring the first female and openly NFL Coach in Superbowl history, has been wildly herald it as one of the best of the broadcast topping the major rankings.","MullenLowe Group closed the year with a number of new business wins, including being named the Global Agency Partner for Bayer in the US TaxAct and they gave us budget group of both headed to MullenLowe\u2019s roster. Collaborating with the group\u2019s integrated media arm, MediaHub MullenLowe won media and created duties for Hawaiian Airlines media hub also added interest.","After a year with IPG, Acxiom continues to expand its role to the clients in our agencies. Today, our data and tech solutions have a seat at the table, and now adding value with both existing and new clients. As mentioned early in the fourth quarter, IPG launched Kinesso, a marketing intelligence engine powered by Acxiom. Kinesso furthers IPG\u2019s vision as brands\u2019 trusted partner in data science by bringing together top data and technology talent with addressable media experts.","Turning to CMG for the first time \u2013 for the fourth time in six years, Holmes Report and Weber Shandwick Global Agency of the Year, Weber Shandwick and its consultancy United Minds launched a new suite of expanded offerings to help companies access cultural risk within their organizations. Golin had a trio business wins in the quarter including Lego, Twitter and Meso robotics. The agency also restructured leadership naming a new CEO from the [indiscernible].","Octagon also had a solid quarter, announcing new business wins at several sporting conferences. The agency is coming off a successful Superbowl where it represented three players in the game, many corporate clients and managed multiple activations in the Miami.","All in at the agency level, IPG continues to have many of the industry\u2019s most vibrant brands. Last month, IPG Agencies and People swept the inaugural campaign US Agency of the Year Awards, taking home more on as in all other holding companies combined. These awards which are unique and that they are judged by clients recognized leadership, creative excellence and business performance.","We\u2019ve also focused on creating a holding company model that is not just differentiated by our offerings but by our culture and our commitment to diversity and inclusion as well. 2019 IPG joined the Business Roundtable and redefining the purpose of a corporation. Setting a new standard at how a company should operate. As we continue to generate long-term value for stakeholders, through innovation, transparency and corporate responsibility. In addition, our focus on ESG continues to be a part of our business priority.","According to the management top 250 ranking, IPG ranked as one of the best managed companies of 2019 and was the only company from the advertising industry included in the lists. Developed by the Drucker Institute and the Wall Street Journal, the ranking makes a corporate effectiveness through customer satisfaction, employee engagement, innovation, social responsibility and financial strength. Additionally, IPG was named the top company to work for by LinkedIn and was the highest ranked company in the advertising sector on the list, which compile the most 50 most-sought after companies where people want to work and develop their careers.","Our differentiated culture and strategy are our key reasons to our long-term performance have been strong. Notably in our organic growth performance as this metric shows the foundational strength and competitiveness of our operations. It goes without saying that we remain focused on evolving the IPG offerings. But our results demonstrate how well positioned we are for the future, with the company that remains highly relevant to marketers in an increasingly crowded and complex media environment.","Looking forward, the tone of the business remain sound, new business activity is solid, the greatest strength of our portfolio positions us well to grow with our existing clients as well as participate in the Fitch opportunity as we see today. And our hard work to create a modern highly collaborative company ensures that we have positioned to profit from opportunities that may come from outside of traditional arena going forward.","In light of these factors, we believe that we should continue to see organic revenue growth and we are therefore targeting growth of 3% for 2020. Along with this level of growth, we expect a further improved EBITA margin by an additional\\ 20 basis points which would bring us to 14.2% in 2020.","On top of our recent success, we feel that it remains significant potential for value creation and enhanced shareholder value over the long-term for our company. As always, we thank our clients, our people who have been the foundation of our long-term success. And we look forward to updating on our progress, at our first quarter call.","With that, I\u2019ll open it up to questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.","Alexia Quadrani","Hi, thank you. Thank you very much. A couple of questions. First to get down like business was so strong across the Board in the quarter and I\u2019m wondering if there was one particular area that really outperformed that surprised you guys in the upside? And then secondly, do you see the sort of momentum or maybe the healthy ad spend environment in general sort of continue into 2020 when you speak with your clients as a sense of optimism? And then I\u2019ll add a one more follow-up? Thank you.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Alexia. Well the fourth quarter obviously came in strong and frankly, it was across the Board, our integrated network came in strong as I mentioned Jack Morton and Octagon came in strong and obviously Mediabrands, Dater, Acxiom pretty much FCB Health and all our units performed well in the fourth quarter. So that gave rise to our strong growth in the fourth quarter and notwithstanding the headwinds that we came in.","I mean it sets the tone for 2020. When we set a target of 3% for 2020, it still \u2013 we continue to have very difficult comps year-on-year, which is a good thing as we continue to set the pace for the industry, we still are setting goals on top of that. And was Ellen indicated, we still have headwinds in the first half of 2020 so when we set a goal of 3% for the full year of 2020, that reflects cycling through those headwinds.","So we continue to feel that tone of the business continues to be solid and the compensations with our clients indicate that we are offering our value proposition to our clients that moves the needle and obviously that bodes well with respect to our open architectural approach to meeting our clients\u2019 needs. Now of course there are wild cards out there, the coronavirus, you know, I know the question is how is that going to impact us?","China is roughly 2% of our total revenue, it\u2019s important to us, because our clients are there, when total revenue which \u2013 it\u2019s is not that significant, but what remains to be seen is, what impact this will have on our suppliers and the chain \u2013 the supply chain and what impact that would have on US companies and other global companies. But it\u2019s \u2013 there still some wildcards out there with respect to 2020, but the tone continues to be solid as we move into certainly the first quarter.","Alexia Quadrani","And just a quick follow-up on the new business you mentioned and we see that from our data there is headwind still on the first half of the year. So do you think when you look at the back half from what\u2019s happened there been announced sort of today, can you find that you\u2019re going to see some actual tailwinds or to be more neutral in terms of the wins you\u2019ve had more recently or in the last fall?","Michael Roth","Yeah, thank you. If we \u2013 if we\u2019re forecasting a 3% of organic growth, we hope we have some tailwind. But we do have some recent losses that were \u2013 the project business that you know all of that had with the Bank of America should tail off in the second part of the year. But we have new business that win coming on stream that should offset that.","So when we look at a target, we look at into \u2013 we take into consideration business wins, potential business wins that we have in the pipeline and as well as losses that we\u2019ve realized. So all of that get factored into both the organic growth target as well as the margin expansion.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you very much.","Michael Roth","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ben Swinburne","Hey, good morning everyone. Michael could you just give us an update on the Acxiom integration, I know obviously you have the asset now for some time, but just you had talked about revenue synergies or revenue opportunities I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re starting to see those actually flow into the numbers if the 3% has any sort of Acxiom bump, for a lack of a better phrase and how that\u2019s all tying into Kinesso which you mentioned in your prepared remarks?","And then just for \u2013 maybe for Ellen, in the fourth quarter you had \u2013 your incentive comp was down I think as a percent of revenue you got some nice leverage there, base day was up offsetting that can you just remind us sort of how bonus accrual process works and where that shows up in the P&L when you guys have a year strong as you did last year? Thanks.","Michael Roth","Yeah, look \u2013 what I\u2019ll go \u2013 what you\u2019re seeing is a performance-based compensation. Some business units performed well, some didn\u2019t deliver on their targets, and remember last year we exceeded our goals much higher than this year. So the incentive comp is working exactly as it\u2019s supposed to be working and that is \u2013 those units that outperformed were compensated, those that didn\u2019t reflected it. So the incentive comp number that you see also in the fourth quarter, because we do it on a full year basis, we had a catch up and reflected in our final numbers. So, the incentive comp worked exactly as we expected it to, with respect to pay for performance.","As far as Acxiom goes, you know, I\u2019ve said in the last call, we\u2019re very happy with, first of all, how the integration is going. The integration is pretty much done in terms of all the necessary physical legacy accounts and all the different comp plans and all the things that integration from mechanical point of view need to be done, but more importantly, the integration of Acxiom with IPG and our offerings and the seat at the table that Acxiom has with respect to our existing clients as well as a potential new business is real, and they have a seat at the table along, you know as part of Kinesso as well, with all business pitches and with our major clients.","So as we indicated, that was one of the, you know, if you look at Acxiom versus the management of first-party data, okay, so that business continue to be solid. As we said in the third quarter, it\u2019s performing consistent with our business case in terms of acquisition. I think we used like a 5% growth for that business, [technical difficulty] that it continues to perform well and we\u2019re very happy with the first-party data management and the core business of Acxiom.","On top of that with the formation of Kinesso, where we have putting together the adtech, the martech in the service business and obviously Acxiom provides the data backbone, but Kinesso is the technology part of that and then we have Cadreon in there which focus on the activation. And we\u2019re really pleased with how well that proposition is working both with respect to new business pitches and getting the attention of our existing client base.","So of course in the 3% number for 2020, we continue to bake into a solid performance for Acxiom, solid performance with Kinesso what we said last time last year that we will start introducing new products through Kinesso in terms of the value-based offering, and we do have a pickup in part of the organic growth for 2020, which reflects the synergies between the Kinesso, the Acxiom and the Mediabrands in particular, because what we said was, we were going to focus on Mediabrands, initially because that\u2019s the logical place for them to come together. Then eventually we\u2019ll roll it out to our creative agencies as well.","So we\u2019re very pleased with how Acxiom is performing. I think it\u2019s very clear to us that it was the right decision for us to acquire Acxiom, and it gives us a competitive advantage when dealing with the full integrated offering in open architecture. I mean \u2013 the stuff that Kinesso was doing with respect to focusing on high value audiences and the value that it creates, creates an immediate impression with clients, because they frankly haven\u2019t seen that type of offering and we\u2019re really pleased and excited about the future of that.","Ben Swinburne","Thanks, Michael.","Michael Roth","Thank you, Ben.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dan Solomon from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Dan Salmon","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Michael, one for you and one for Ellen. Over the last year so \u2013 I \u2013 there\u2019s plenty I could ask you about Acxiom or Kinesso, but I think Ben covered a lot of it there. I want to ask maybe about R\/GA. It\u2019s never easy to see an industry legend. He\u2019s out of an agency, but the transition with Bob Greenberg, that\u2019s played out there over the last year, that agency has been such a huge contributor to your growth over the last decade or so, I just love to hear it update on how that\u2019s going?","And then, Ellen, the Michael\u2019s comments, I think in the press release reiterated the intention to get back to share buyback at some point. I know you won\u2019t give us a timeline for that. But just maybe remind us what are the milestones with your balance sheet that you\u2019re watching, you\u2019re executing on your cash flow generation for the company overall? What are the things you want to check the box on before you think about that again? Thanks.","Michael Roth","Yeah, unfortunately I\u2019ll take that one too. That\u2019s a topic very close to my heart. Believe me, we have Ellen and the entire \u2013 all the finance team \u2013","Dan Salmon","And the board \u2013","Michael Roth","And the board. We addressed this issue very carefully. In my remarks, I commented that our goal you know for 2020 is to continue to pay down debt. We have a $500 million tower there that we\u2019ve looked to reposition and pay down in one form or another. And frankly, when you get to the levels that we were previously at, in terms of maintaining our investment grade, we see given the cash flows that sometime next year we should be reaching those levels.","So I think it would be reasonable to think that all things happening the way we want them to, we could be back in the market buying shares sometime next year, obviously that requires Board approval. We\u2019ll talk to rating agencies, which is very important to us and we\u2019ll take into consideration the overall market conditions.","But it\u2019s certainly we believe strongly that one of the shareholder value creation opportunities for us is to continue to return cash to our investors up until Acxiom you know, we had a good mix between buybacks and dividends, we paid debt, we distributed $4.4 billion already in terms of that type of mix, and we\u2019re very pleased with it. So the sooner we can get back to the mix between dividend increases, as we saw we did this year and share buybacks, the better we believe is for our shareholders and we\u2019ll continue to focus on that opportunity.","Thank you for asking about R\/GA. You know, we have a new CEO, Sean Lyons. He\u2019s beefed up his team, he\u2019s repositioned some of the individuals within your organization. They\u2019re looking at the go-to-market strategy on a global basis. As any new CEO, Sean is taking a look at the entire organization and what markets they should be in, what offerings they have, particularly in terms of the consulting side of the business is a strong opportunity for them. They\u2019re making investments in that and they\u2019re sowing very good traction in that area. So we continue to be excited about R\/GA.","Of course, Bob Greenberg is in fact a legend. There aren\u2019t many legend, real true legends in the business. And he continues \u2013 he will be part of R\/GA frankly forever. But I\u2019m really excited about what Sean and his team putting together in terms of the go-to-market strategy, leveraging the expertise and the traditional, strong base under the leadership of Bob Greenberg. So R\/GA will continue to be a strong contributor to the overall performance of IPG.","Dan Salmon","Great. Thanks, Michael.","Michael Roth","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Tim Nollen, Macquire. Your line is now open.","Tim Nollen","Well, thanks. I actually do have another Acxiom question, if that\u2019s okay. I just want to ask about with so much concern amongst the market these days about data privacy and Google\u2019s changes to cookies, could you just give us a rundown of Acxiom\u2019s work with first as well as third-party cookies. I think there might be a misunderstanding out there about Acxiom is just a third-party data seller. I think that\u2019s a vast \u2013 a very, you know, minority of the business. I just wanted to \u2013 you know sort of in terms of doing your work that is very much more about the first-party data management? And then in terms of the actual sales, just if you could just give us a sense of how much is \u2013 of the importance comes from the first-party versus the third-party? Thanks.","Michael Roth","Well that \u2013 do you want to call it sales, two-thirds, approximately two-thirds of Acxiom business is just managing first-party data, and we don\u2019t say that light and just managing. Remember, their management of first-party data is best-in-class. Forrester gives it the five star rating. It\u2019s well known in terms of their expertise in privacy. They are a trusted manager of first-party data. In fact, you know in the UK when they introduced GDPR, Acxiom played an important role, working with the regulators and executing those type of rules and regulations and inviting clients.","So when we bought Acxiom, everyone misunderstood it to be, frankly the InfoBase, which is the third-party data management part of their offerings. Everyone focused on that part of the business. But the true core business of Acxiom is first-party data. And this year, they\u2019ve added new logos, their performance has been, as I said, very consistent with our business plan in terms of the acquisition. And that\u2019s a core competency that frankly, you don\u2019t see anywhere else. And well you know we\u2019re sort of scratching the surface in terms of having IPG access to the first-party data management clients that Acxiom has and vice versa. And we wanted to make sure that we roll this out on a very even basis without overwhelming the Acxiom people.","So the core first-party data business is a gem and it\u2019s well respected. And frankly, now with the California privacy rules and more privacy rules throughout the United States, we see their expertise even more in demand and it just buttresses the fact that this will be a true game changer for us as we move forward. So the first-party data is critical to the success of Acxiom.","The third-party data, you know, puts together sources from all over the globe. And it distinguishes Acxiom, frankly from the competition. And one of the questions that\u2019s come up is, you know, we don\u2019t have to use the InfoBase. Mediabrands has amped their own data source, which uses other third-party data. So it\u2019s up to our clients to make sure which one is best suited for them. But we certainly have all the tools and resources with respect to third-party data at our demand, if you will and it\u2019s being used very effectively with Kinesso and Acxiom together in terms of the value-based proposition and they\u2019re bringing to the client.","And candidly, you know, one of the questions is, is this thing hunting? And the answer is, yes, it is. You know, we had a number of client wins, particularly on the media side, where Kinesso working together with Mediabrands as well as Acxiom had made a difference in terms of the success of the pitch, plus the strength they have when they sit at a table with existing clients, I mean, this is the kind of stuff that clients are looking for. And we have them sitting at the table and the role of our top to top and open architecture positioning.","With respect to cookies, I know everyone\u2019s writing about it. We\u2019ve been worried about the cookies and the regulatory environment with respect to Google now for years, and we\u2019re building up ways to work around it. We\u2019re highly confident that we\u2019re working with Acxiom and Kinesso and all the other tools and resources that we have, that we will have a solution in place to address that issue. And we\u2019re working closely with Google and the other providers to make sure that in fact happens. But that was one of the purposes of us buying Acxiom as well.","So I think we\u2019re really well positioned to the changes in the environment that\u2019s coming. And in fact, more than ever clients need the expertise that we bring to the table, which is why we\u2019re so excited about not just Acxiom and Kinesso, but all of the offerings we have at IPG. When you put together on a team in terms of an open architecture, the creative capability, the activation capability, the experiential, the PR, the media capabilities and the secret sauce that comes out of Kinesso in terms of value propositions, it\u2019s a very compelling offering. And I think you see the results in our organic growth.","Tim Nollen","Yeah, that\u2019s great. Thanks, Michael. Can I slip in a quick follow-up, which is also on Acxiom about the cost side, just maybe give us a quick review of what cost lines it impacts? And sort of what is the cost to run and maintain and invest in Acxiom?","Michael Roth","Well, this one, I\u2019ll let Ellen. How\u2019s that?","Ellen Johnson","Listen, Acxiom is a great business from both the top line and the bottom line that we\u2019re very pleased at. Their business mix is a little bit \u2013 more heavy weighted and office and general than SG&A. But all that\u2019s taken into account in the numbers you see on the forecast. But it\u2019s a great business, both top and bottom line.","Michael Roth","Yeah, incidentally, one of the other differences is actually Acxiom has a different incentive plan. And it\u2019s a little different than we traditionally have in our business. So that\u2019s also reflected in some of the numbers in terms of whether the O&G is up, whether the incentive comp is a little different, because they do have a different incentive plans and cost profiles.","Tim Nollen","That\u2019s great. Thanks very much.","Michael Roth","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.","Michael Nathanson","Hey, thank you. I have two, one on Acxiom and expecting one for Ellen. So Michael, one of the concerns I think we heard early on with Acxiom was we got two-thirds of business managing people\u2019s first-party data, that the non-IPG clients would tend to leave just because they\u2019d be concerned about being in the same, let\u2019s say marketing vertical as a competitor, maybe you know, an IPG client. So are you seeing any type of, you know, client pushback from the Acxiom clients that are non-IPG clients? That\u2019s one.","And then for Ellen, you talk a bit about what that working capital swing implies, the big benefit you had. Our deal terms, you know, improving a bit, does that imply a huge media spend in the fourth quarter, so anything kind of underlying the huge improvement in working capital for the quarter?","Michael Roth","Let me address the \u2013 we see zero conflict. That was part of our due diligence. When we did our due diligence on Acxiom, it\u2019s a legitimate question. But if you look at financial services for example, which is one of the significant part of the Acxiom business, we don\u2019t see any potential conflict, where clients are worried about that. And in fact, sometimes it adds to their expertise, right? If you have \u2013 if you pretty much own a sector, and you had in the financial service sector where Acxiom manages first-party data for probably most of the top financial service companies, that\u2019s an expertise that is hard to come by, if they\u2019re trusted. And in the due diligence we tested, not only with we test existing client relationships, they were onboarding a new client. And we tested to see how the new clients\u2019 reaction to this. So the question of conflict with the Acxiom, first-party data I mean it\u2019s totally an opportunity for us and not a conflict. And, you know, working capital, I\u2019ll let Ellen.","Ellen Johnson","Thank you.","Michael Roth","This is Ellen\u2019s first call so I\u2019ll let Ellen answer the working capital.","Ellen Johnson","So working capital is something that we manage very closely, but it\u2019s part of those. So, if you remember back in the 2018, we had a bigger use of working capital, and then 2019, it was a benefit. And the days that you get the collections and disbursements around yearned can vary from time to time, and cause that volatility, but nothing has really changed in the underlying either way we manage working capital or the things that we\u2019re seeing in terms.","Michael Nathanson","Okay, thanks Ellen. Thanks Michael.","Michael Roth","You know, let me just make another point. I know all the questions are on Acxiom and it should be, because Acxiom is providing a significant advantage to us in the competitive marketplace. But we have the rest of our business, okay. And the rest of our business is doing pretty well. I mean, we have leading creative agencies in the world. We have each of our global networks for example, have different go-to-market strategies. When we put together our open architecture, we have the luxury of picking and choosing the best people in the business that have expertise in the client sector. And we can put them together on a seamless basis in open architecture. And if you look at McCann, you look at FCB, you look at MullenLowe and you look at our Independents, the Hill Holidays, the Martin Agency, these are world-class creatives and agencies that bring to the table, the secret sauce that puts all of this together. But and yes, Acxiom is great. And it\u2019s you know it\u2019s \u2013 when you look at it as a percentage of our overall business, you know, we don\u2019t want to lose sight of our PR business and all the other businesses that we have within our portfolio.","And candidly, the strength of our results this year has been, it\u2019s not just the Acxiom. It\u2019s all of our businesses that had those kind of capabilities. And when you look at our go-to-market strategy using open architecture, I mean, it\u2019s compelling when you put them all together in a room, and the ability for us to replace one versus the other. I mean, this is real time, if one of the agencies is not performing well, these clients in the open architecture engagements say, we\u2019re having a problem with XYZ in this country and we have the ability to pull an expertise under the open architecture model that is best-in-class. And we see it a lot in the healthcare side of the business. We have the expertise with \u2013 between FCB Health and McCann Health, that are world class, and they can focus on specific diseases and MedEd, and all these capabilities, and we have the luxury of being able to bring all these resources together on an open architecture basis. And that\u2019s what\u2019s driving our results. So I don\u2019t want everyone to lose sight of that part of it. Do I have time with one more question, Jeff?","Operator","You have the next \u2013 our final question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi. Your line is now open.","Jason Bazinet","I hate to do this? But can I just go back and ask on the working capital side? I know you guys, you know had a big inflow in the fourth quarter. But sometimes you look back on the outflows for Q1 and it can be as low as $200 million, sometimes of $800 million. And as we all try and figure out sort of the cadence of your debt reduction and the pivot towards buybacks. Is there any color that you can provide in terms of expectations on working capital drag for the year?","Michael Roth","Yeah, I think this is normal. I mean, if you look back on a year-to-year basis, last year we were negative and we were strong in the first quarter. So it\u2019s a timing and it\u2019s all generated from our media business in particular. When we look at our cash flows, we look out on a full year basis. When we look to paying down debt, it\u2019s based on our expected cash flow on a full year basis, and where we\u2019re going to end up at year end. And I think it\u2019s reasonable to assume that we will continue to pay debt significant amounts so that by yearend we\u2019ll be in a strong position to take a hard look at getting back into the buybacks side of that just and maintaining a strong investment grade rating and getting all of our ratings to where they should be in terms of solid investment grade. So we look at on a full year basis. You know, there were anomalies on quarter-to-quarter, and a lot of it has to do with the media side of the business, which is very robust for us so that\u2019s a positive.","Jason Bazinet","All right.","Michael Roth","That\u2019s how we manage it.","Jason Bazinet","All right. Well look forward to the buybacks when they come.","A - Michael Roth","Okay. Yes, I know. Okay well thank you very much. And again, we appreciate all the support and we look forward to our first quarter call. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And this concludes today\u2019s conference.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jerome J. Leshne - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning. Thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com. This morning, we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 [a.m.] Eastern.","During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company. These are subject to the uncertainties in the cautionary statement that is included in our earnings release and the slide presentation, and further detailed in our 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.","We will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP measures, allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance.","At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jerry, and thank you for joining us this morning. As we review our results for the second quarter and first half of 2015. I'll start out by covering highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional detail and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies and the tone of business to be followed by a Q&A.","We're pleased to report another quarter of strong organic revenue, as well as profit growth. Organic revenue growth in the quarter was 6.7%. Net acquisitions had a positive impact of 30 basis points, while FX was a negative 5.7%. Notably, FX had essentially no impact on our percentage margin. Total revenue growth was 1.3%.","We saw positive contributions to our top-line performance by a broad range of our creative, marketing services and media offerings. Our digital capabilities, which are embedded across the portfolio and consistently among the best in the industry, were significant drivers of growth for us again this past quarter. Regionally, our largest markets were standouts, as the U.S., Asia-Pac and UK showed very good growth with healthcare and tech and telecom, the leading client sectors.","Our operating profit in the quarter increased to $216 million, up 10% from a year ago. Operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 11.5%, reflecting leverage on base payroll, benefits in tax and all O&G expenses. Diluted EPS was $0.29 a share, an increase of 16% compared to last year's adjusted Q2.","Moving to the first half of the year, organic revenue growth was 6.2% on top of a strong 5.6% a year ago. For the six months, we posted a 21% increase to operating profit and a 45% increase in diluted earnings per share. This performance continues to lead our industry and builds on a record of accomplishments in which our people can take great pride.","Turning back to additional color on the quarter. In the U.S., organic growth was 7.7% in Q2, an outstanding result. We had notable growth at most of our agencies including McCann, FCB, R\/GA, Huge, Mediabrands, Deutsche, Mullen, Weber Shandwick, and Golin.","Our international organic growth was also very solid at 5.3%, once again driven by a full range of services. By region, we were led by 11.8% growth in Asia-Pac highlighted by continued double-digit increase in India and China.","We again saw a strong performance in the UK, which was up 7.9% organically. In Continental Europe, organic growth was 3.6% in the quarter and 3.6% for the six months as well. LatAm decreased 1.6% organically in the quarter, chiefly due to challenging macro conditions in Brazil, which we had called out for you during our first quarter call.","For the first half of the year, our 6.2% organic growth reflected contributions across all major disciplines as well as all regions of the world with the exception being a small decrease in the LatAm. First half operating margin growth was 100 basis points, with leverage on our base payroll, benefits in tax, and on office and general expenses.","As we said previously, cost discipline and margin enhancement continue to be a top priority and we continue to successfully execute against that objective. With respect to share repurchase during Q2, we used $51 million to repurchase 2.4 million shares while over the trailing 12 months, we had utilized approximately $280 million for share repurchases. We had $342 million remaining on our authorization at the end of the quarter.","Since, instituting our return of capital programs in 2011, we have returned over $2 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases, as well as reduced our diluted share count by 25%. In sum, our performance in the quarter and the first half continues to underscore the strong competitive position of our agencies across the full spectrum of advertising and marketing disciplines, in terms of our digital expertise and in many of the world's key advertising and media markets.","While economic conditions in some areas of the world present macro headwinds and uncertainties, the overall tone of business remains solid, and we are effectively managing expenses. At the midway point of the year, we believe we are very well positioned to exceed our targeted organic growth for 2015. We are therefore upping that target from the previous 3% to 4% organic growth to a new range of 4% to 5% for the full year. Consistent with that, we will look to deliver toward the upper end of our full range operating margin target of 80 basis points to 100 basis points improvement over 2014.","At this stage, I'll turn things over to Frank for additional detail on our results and join you after his remarks for an update on our operating units to be followed by Q&A.","Frank Mergenthaler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Michael. Good morning. As a reminder, I'll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast.","On slide two, you'll see an overview of our results, a number of which Michael touched upon. Organic growth was 6.7% in the second quarter, with the U.S. up 7.7% and international growth of 5.3%. In our first half, organic revenue growth was 6.2%, reflecting 7% U.S. growth and 5.2% international growth. Q2 operating profit was $216 million, an increase of 10%. Operating profit grew 20% and 21% for the first six months. Q2 margin was 11.5%, an improvement of 90 basis points compared with last year's Q2. There was essentially no impact from FX on percentage operating margin compared to last year. Diluted EPS of $0.29 compares to Q2 2014 at $0.23 as reported and $0.25 excluding a charge of $0.02 per share for early redemption of debt in last year's second quarter. Q2 average fully diluted shares decreased 2% from last year due to our share repurchase program.","Turning to slide three, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in the detail slides that follow.","Slide four has more detail on our revenue growth. Revenue was $1.88 billion in the quarter, an increase of 1.3%. Compared to Q2 2014, the impact of the change in currency exchange rates was significant at negative 5.7%. While the dollar was stronger against almost all currencies, the most significant changes for our revenue mix were the euro, pound sterling, the Brazilian real, and the Australian dollar.","Acquisitions added 30 basis points to revenue. The resulting organic revenue increase was 6.7%. It is worth noting that organic growth was actually higher at 7.5%, when excluding the decrease in our pass-through revenues, which occurred mainly in our events business. As we have pointed out previously, lower pass-through revenue was offset dollar for dollar by lower pass-through expense and therefore has no impact on profit.","As you can see on the bottom half of this slide, at our integrated agency networks, the organic increase was 7.7% .This was led by our global integrated offerings at McCann and FCB, by Deutsch in the U.S., our digital specialists R\/GA and Huge, and by media brands. IAN's first half organic growth was 7.2%.","At our CMG segment, organic growth was 2.3%, but was mid-single digits excluding the decrease in pass-throughs that have no profit impact. We had double-digit organic growth at our PR agencies, Weber Shandwick and Golin, which continue to gain market share.","Moving on to slide five, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q2 organic growth was an outstanding 7.7%, with contributions coming from a very broad cross-section of our agencies, disciplines, and client sectors. We also had strong performance in the UK. Organic growth was 7.9%, with notable growth at McCann, FCB, Mullen Lowe and R\/GA. Organic growth was 7.1% over the first six months.","Continental Europe increased 3.6% organically in the quarter. We had positive contributions from Weber Shandwick, McCann, Mullen Lowe and R\/GA. Among our larger national markets, we continue to see very good growth in Spain and had mid-single digits in France. Germany and Italy also had slight increases. While Q2 is our second consecutive quarter of good growth on the Continent, which is certainly welcome, our bottoms-up market view and macro conditions nonetheless indicate caution for the near-term.","In Asia-Pac, our largest international region, Q2 organic growth was 11.8%. We had double-digit growth in China, India, and Singapore, as well as notably strong growth in Australia. Regional performance speaks to the strong positioning across our three global integrated agencies, our media business, our digital specialists and our public relations offerings.","In LatAm, our organic decrease was 1.6% in the quarter. The decrease was driven by the increasingly challenged economy in Brazil, partially offset by growth in other markets, such as Argentina and Mexico. As you can see on this slide, our reported revenue decrease includes the effect of sharply weaker local currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Our other markets group, which is made up of Canada, the Middle East and Africa, decreased slightly in the quarter on an organic basis, but is up 3.9% for the six months.","On slide six, these (12:41) chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 5.8%.","Moving on to slide seven, our operating expenses. In the second quarter, total operating expenses increased 30 basis points from a year ago compared with our reported revenue growth of 1.3%. The FX impact to operating expenses was a negative 5.7%, as it was on revenue.","Underneath our strong margin improvement, the Q2 ratio of salaries and related expense to revenue was 64.2% this year compared with 63.2% a year ago. The comparison is driven by higher accruals for incentives and other performance-based bonuses, partially offset by leverage on our base payroll, benefits and tax. The decrease in pass-throughs revenues weighed on the SRS ratio as well, though the effect on our margin is offset in O&G.","Base salaries, benefits and tax were 53.2% of revenue compared with 53.6% a year ago. Incentive expense was 3.7% of revenue compared to 2.7% a year ago. Our category of all other salaries and related expense was 2.6% of revenue, compared with 2.3% a year ago. Total head count at quarter end was approximately 48,400, an increase of 4% year-on-year. The increase reflects our acquisitions as well as organic hiring in support of growth in areas such as digital, creative, and PR, as well as our increases in the U.S., UK and Asia-Pac.","Turning to ops and general expenses on the lower half of the slide. O&G expense was 24.3% of Q2 revenue, compared with 26.2% a year ago, an improvement of 190 basis points. We had leverage across all of our O&G expense groups, occupancy, professional fees, travel and entertainment, and all other O&G. In the quarter, we had a lease buyout credit in occupancy, which was offset by a net increase in reserves for certain contingencies in other O&G.","On slide eight, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 10.9%, that's a 120 basis point improvement from a year ago.","Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on slide nine, we ended the second quarter with $856 million in cash and short-term marketable securities. The comparison to December 31 reflects that our cash level is seasonal and tends to peak at year-end.","On slide 10, we turn to the second quarter cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $260 million, compared with $169 million a year ago. That includes $41 million generated from working capital, compared with the use of $24 million in Q2 2014. Investing activities used a net $30 million for capital expenditures, financing activities used $109 million, chiefly for share repurchase, our common stock dividend and payments related to previous acquisitions, somewhat offset by higher short-term borrowings. Our net increase in cash and marketable securities for the quarter was $114 million, compared with $125 million a year ago.","On slide 11, we showed debt deleveraging from a peak of $2.35 billion in 2007 to $1.78 billion at the most recent quarter-end.","In summary, on slide 12, the quarter and the first half represent very solid achievements and good progress to our objectives for the full year. We are seeing growth in areas where we have focused our investment in both people and acquisitions. Our operators are focused on the appropriate cost disciplines and margin expansion. And our balance sheet is an important area that we can continue to deploy for value going forward.","With that, let me turn it back to Michael.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Frank. We're very pleased with our results for both the second quarter and year-to-date. In terms of organic revenue growth and margin process, Q2 showed very good performance, which was once again ahead of that of our peer group. All of our major units and all regions, other than LatAm, contributed to this outstanding result.","It bears noting that the digital expertise we have embedded throughout the portfolio has been a significant driver of our growth. It's also worth pointing out that unlike others in our space, we have largely grown these digital capabilities organically and they are key to our strong integrated offerings.","We continue to demonstrate disciplined cost management, and we will remain focused on converting at the appropriate levels, so as to deliver on our margin improvement targets for the year. Investments and talent supplemented by strategic acquisitions should ensure that we maintain the very high level of our professional offerings. We also remain committed to robust capital return programs that can drive further value creation for our shareholders.","Looking forward, the tone of the business remains positive. Clients are committed to investing behind their brands to achieve their business objectives. And the complexity of the marketing landscape represents an opportunity for smart marketers and their agencies. We are capitalizing on this opportunity, as evident in our organic growth to-date this year.","While we saw some signs of strengthening in Continental Europe, we remain cautious in light of political and economic uncertainty in the region. Brazil has also seen a meaningful slowdown, and we will continue to monitor the state of the Chinese economy, and adjust our businesses there accordingly.","Our new business pipeline is sound, and we are involved in the full range of opportunities being contested in the marketplace.","As you all know, there is a great deal of activity in terms of media reviews. A number of the reviews involve defending existing client business, where we are one of multiple incumbents, which means there is a both risk and upside for us.","We are also pursuing those net new opportunities, where we believe we have the most to gain. And we are passing on others due to conflict or in order to appropriately manage our resources. The volume of media business that is in play is a function of clients' continual demand for greater efficiencies, as well as cyclical reviews on the part of some clients. It is also a reflection of the fact that technology is impacting communications planning and media investment decisions.","Before moving to my usual update on the agencies, I'll comment on developments at Cannes, which as you all know is the industry's premier awards competition, when it comes to creativity and innovation. Once again, we're pleased to see outstanding performance from across the portfolio.","In terms of awards and points won at Cannes relative to revenue, we continue to be near the top of the industry. Highlights included R\/GA being named Agency of the Year, which is a first for a digital agency and a sign of how core digital has become to success in our business. FCB took home a Grand Prix for work done to promote wellness among women in the UK and the network had its best ever performance at Cannes.","McCann won four gold lions for its groundbreaking makeup genius work for L'Or\u00e9al. This is a Smartphone and tablet app we helped the client develop that incorporates real-time facial recognition and augmented reality, and it has been downloaded over 10 million times since its launch last year.","Other highlights included The Martin Agency, which won the coveted Film Grand Prix with a very creative approach for pre-roll digital ads for Geico, as well as GGH Lowe, Germany, which won 12 lions with one of the festival's most awarded campaigns. Other agencies honored included Campbell Ewald, Deutsch, Hill Holliday, Initiative, UM and Weber Shandwick.","In other highlights of Q2 results, we saw continued strong performance at McCann Worldgroup. The quality of the agency's creative product is high and integration across disciplines remains a focus. I mentioned the caliber of the digital work that McCann is doing for major clients such as L'Or\u00e9al. And it's also worth noting that MRM, which is an integral part of Worldgroup, is one of the industry's top digital networks with offices in over 20 world markets.","Progress at FCB has been steady with improvements evident in the quality of the creative work, rate of consistency, in terms of new net new business, and the development of strong capabilities in shopper and digital marketing. Not only is the agency raising its game, but it's also becoming an increasingly attractive destination for talent. As was evident in the recent announcement that Susan Credle will be joining as Chief Creative Officer.","At CMG, our award-winning public relation agencies keep winning market share and defining the ways in which digital channels can transform this marketing discipline. Weber Shandwick and Golin have raised the bar in their sister CMG agencies from Octagon to Jack Morton and FutureBrand, are also innovating to their respective areas of expertise.","We've been saying for some time that the creative firepower of Lowe is something that's at a premium in today's world of fragmented media and hard to engage consumers but that the agency needed scale in the U.S. to tap into opportunities with major multinationals. By combining them with Mullen and naming Mullen's CEO Alex Leikikh, to lead the merged entity, we believe we made that possible and put the agency on the growth path that we need to see from Lowe. Mullen's offerings are highly creative, as well as digital and accountable, as was evident in their winning the Grand Effie for their largely viral campaign on behalf of American Greetings.","I mentioned the level of new business activity in media earlier. And the team at Mediabrands is fully focused on securing existing relationships and capitalizing on the new client opportunities we are best suited for. The unit is not only performing well in financial terms, but we continue to see the benefits of our investments in Cadreon, our programmatic platform and AMP, our proprietary data stack and all our longstanding commitment to media transparency also differentiates us from a number of our competitors. Our U.S. integrated independent agencies continue to be a source of strength for Interpublic.","Mullen's outstanding offerings are now part of Lowe's go-to-market proposition. Deutsch continues to be a leader in the marketplace with exceptional creative and digital capabilities. Along with The Martin Agency, Hill Holiday, Carmichael Lynch and a number of others, our domestic independence provide clients with a breadth of services, including full-fledged digital, UX, analytics, and social capabilities.","In terms of digital, R\/GA remains the leader in just about every area of innovation that's defining the future of our business. The recent major win with Verizon was a further confirmation of the strength of their offering and the accolades for Bob and his team from Ad Age to Cannes, demonstrate the degree to which technology-enabled marketing is at the center of everything we do. We're fortunate to have another agency that's tracking along a similar growth path in my hometown of Brooklyn, which is where Huge is based. So, they now have offices in eight other markets and counting. I mentioned the global success of MRM earlier and the integration of Profero into Lowe is going well and has played a part of the growth we are seeing from the Lowe network in a number of international markets.","One last observation about the importance of digital expertise. I've mentioned previously that some of our peers have approached digital through big headline grabbing acquisitions, which have often stayed siloed within those holding companies. Going back quite a few years, we made the strategic decision to grow digital competencies organically within every one of our agencies. This strategy places our integrated marketing solutions at the center of a connected world and continues to be evident in our strong organic growth performance.","The benefits of this approach are evident across the Interpublic Group. We built out Cadreon at Mediabrands, and that is one of the strongest tech platforms in this dynamic space. We've invested in top talent at all our brand agencies.","Mullen and Deutsch have outstanding digital skill sets across a range of disciplines, and McCann and FCB are on the same growth path. The social media and content creation capabilities at Weber Shandwick are second to none. If those were standalone groups, they would be among the world's largest digital agencies in their respective disciplines.","Golin has a strong real-time digital media offering. Recent acquisitions such as Genuine, Prime and Hudson Global will up the digital game of others in our marketing service specialists. And the addition of Profero is adding an important dimension to Lowe's creative strength.","Turning to the second half of the year, we see some geographic markets that will require monitoring, and we will of course remain vigilant on cost and on the appropriate levels of margin conversion going forward. But our performance for the first six months has been strong on both the top and bottom line.","At this point, we believe that the appropriate organic target for the full 2015 is 4% to 5%. And given our strong growth performance to date, we should aim to deliver in the upper range of our operating margin improvement target of 80 basis points to 100 basis points. Combined with our company's financial strength and commitment to robust return of capital, we then and will continue to be a source of significant value creation. This will allow us to further enhance shareholder value.","With that, I'd like to thank you for your time and support and open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Okay. Our first question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan. Ma'am, your line is open.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. Congratulations on a very impressive quarter here. My question was kind of on the organic revenue growth outlook for the back half of the year. I don't want to be greedy, I know it's been an amazing run for the first half. But if you could give us some more color in terms of how you're seeing the back half of the year in terms of, is your guidance just to \u2013 taking into account that you have to be somewhat conservative, there is still some uncertainty in both Europe and in practically all the markets or is there some specific headwinds in terms of accounts movement and stuff that we should keep in mind as we think about our estimates for top line for the back half of the year?","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Alexia. It only took us two minutes to get to the question of what our forecast was, (29:02) Look, obviously, all of the above, there's a degree of conservancy in there. But as we had said on our previous calls, we expected tailwinds in the first half of the year. And frankly, we see that leveling off in the second half of the year, partially because our comps are a little different in the second half of the year and the on-boarding of new clients that we had, starts to level off in terms of those comps, plus we had a little bit of headwinds in terms of some of the client losses.","So, obviously, the second half of the year, we're targeting a little bit pullback on the growth as a result of that impact. Nonetheless, we're still confident in our forecast in the 4% to 5% that we moved \u2013 that's why we moved it in that direction. We always try to do better, but, I think that's a realistic number for us to take into account both the uncertainty that's out there...","Let me just comment on the media reviews. Most of these media reviews that are taking place, the impact of that won't be in effect until really 2016. So, to answer your other question, we don't expect to see an impact on the media side of the business as a result of these reviews until 2016, and hopefully we'll see positive impact as a result of that.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Just a quick follow-up, if I may. On the euro market. I know you don't give margins by region, but just if you can maybe talk generally, do you think with the better organic performance we've seen in Europe \u2013 now two quarters in a row, are you seeing improvement in profitability in that region?","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're always focusing on improvement, as you know, we had taken a reserve against repositioning Europe to realign the cost with the organic expectations. We never stop looking for margin improvement in Europe, it's nice to have some organic revenue but, I think we're being very cautious. We don't have built into our plan a recovery in Continental Europe, and along with that, we're managing our costs very carefully. And we hope to see some margin improvement, but Europe continues to be a difficult market for us to expand margins, and we still view it as a very important market for us. So we're continuing to invest in new people and talent in there, and frankly we've done a few acquisitions there, and we're seeing positive results.","But, margin improvement is a little bit harder to get in Europe than we're seeing elsewhere in the world.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Alexia.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. David Bank of RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thanks. Thanks for the shower for Brooklyn there, Michael.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll always remember that, David.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So, June historically has been \u2013 I have a couple of questions. The first is, June has historically been kind of a pretty big month for you, and the industry for that matter. And over the past couple of years, that has sometimes driven real volatility around 2Q and your outlook. Can you give us a reflection on June in particular, and what it's telling us about your business and the general environment?","A second question is, while you've taken the top line up, kind of a step function, the range in operating leverage at margin was pretty narrow to begin with, at 80 basis points to 100 basis points, that's 20 bps, and you kind of said, so we'll be at the upper end of that range. My question is, without \u2013 there really isn't like a step function up that matches top line, have we sort of maxed out on operating leverage conversion, in that you're not going to \u2013 whether or not the top line kind of materially accelerates from here, and this is a pretty good level. Do you \u2013 is it possible to sort of start squeezing more operating leverage out incrementally, or have we kind of hit a reasonable run rate? Thanks very much.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All of that. Okay, look June, as \u2013 you're right. You're correct. June is a big month for us and the industry, and we're encouraged by what we saw in June across the board, and obviously that's why we're more comfortable in moving the organic revenue up to 4% to 5%, but June doesn't make a year. And so, we still have some cautionary issues out there, particularly in terms of Europe and South America. So therefore, we have some level of conservancy in those numbers.","Our margin numbers, we look at it on a full-year basis, okay. So when you look at the six months and what our conversion ratio in the six months. As you know, we look to convert at a 30% ratio and frankly, for this quarter, we didn't quite make 30%, but we're comfortable in our range of 80 basis points to 100 basis points, because the rest of the year, we expect to see the impact of the onboarding of the talent that we had in the first half of the year, and the revenue coming in in the second half of the year.","We never give up trying to expand our margin, and I think it's a 30% continues to be a reasonable objective for us to \u2013 and for you to assume in the conversion as we go forward and frankly, using the 80 basis points to 100 basis point margin improvement, that's where we get to the targets that we're driving against, okay.","And I think that's a conservative way for us to look at it. We wrestled with the issue of what we do with that margin expectation. And we felt that by at least saying we think we'll be on the high side of that is an indication to you that we believe we have cost under control, in terms of managing it. We still have more work to do. And given the levels of revenue that we see, we're comfortable with that, and we'll deal with future margin expansion as we put this year behind us.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Janedis of Jefferies. Sir, your line is open.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Hey, Michael, for a long time you've talked about acting as an agent for clients and not taking inventory. And therefore being transparent and agnostic. I know it's hard to parse out your growth versus peers, but I was wondering if you're seeing any benefits in other parts of your digital business, or clients giving you more wallet as a result of being more transparent?","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think that's a fair question, John, and I've talk about it a lot, as you noted. One thing is, you can see the difference in terms of the announced gross versus net that our competitors are putting out there, or soon to put out there, in terms of their future releases. Our only issue of gross versus net reflects the pass-throughs that we see in some of our marketing service businesses. So, you will not see an inflated organic growth number from us, as a result of taking inventory into our ownership, in terms of selling it to our clients. So, we believe that continues to be a market distinction for us, when we're dealing with our clients. Now, whether that makes a big difference or not, I think that it's still something to be seen, in terms of the reviews that are going on. But I can tell you anecdotally and specifically, when we have conversations with our clients about that, that all of them indicate that they believe the way we're approaching this, is an appropriate way to deal with it and they're pleased to see the transparency, and the positions we're taking.","That said, there's no question that some of our competitors are having success going a different way, and that's something we're going to consider and we always will consider, as we move into 2016. And frankly, if the marketplace doesn't put a benefit to us, in terms of taking that position versus our competitors, then it's something we have to look at, in terms of our go-to-market strategy. But right now, we believe frankly, one, it's the right thing to do, in terms of dealing with an agnostic position with respect to our clients. We are an advisor and as an advisor, we find it inherently difficult to be in a conflict position when we are advising them on where they should place their media dollars. And we believe that, that is the right go-to-market strategy.","If clients, however, feel that as long as they're getting a savings and they're getting a benefit in terms of where their media dollars are being spent and that doesn't make a difference, then we'll take a look at it, but right now we believe, it's making a difference in the marketplace. I cannot tell you that we won this particular pitch, which is what your question is, because of that \u2013 because these pitches that are going on right now, I know a lot of ink is being spent in terms of making a point that this issue of transparency and rebates is why these reviews are taking place. But actually these reviews are taking place because clients want to make sure that their media dollars are being spent appropriately in terms of efficiently, in the right place and using all the tools and resources that are out there, and they want to make sure that they're getting best-in-class services.","And frankly, if I were a client, I'd be asking the same questions. So, it's not down to a pure question of taking inventory or not taking inventory or transparency or not transparency. It's everything being considered at one time, and we're very comfortable with our position and we lead with that in terms of our go-to-market strategy.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. And maybe one quick one for Frank. You haven't done much on the acquisition front this year. Can you talk about the pipeline and are the better (39:11) spreads in the disciplines you're pursuing widening?","Frank Mergenthaler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Pipeline is robust, John. We've got a number of things we hope to close in the next quarter, quarter and a half. Pricing is competitive. As we've spoken before, the model we like to approach is try and get to an acquisition before there's a process. Some agency we work with on a common client get to know them, they get to know us, that's a path to success in this workforce. But our corporate development team is working hard, they're very busy and you can expect us to close some further transactions in the back half of the year.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Let me just add in terms of our acquisition strategy, and I kind of referred to in my remarks, we don't look to do big transactions and we feel that they're, a) difficult to integrate, b) the price that you pay for that in terms of using your balance sheet, as well as the risk associated with integration, make it a difficult thing to do. That said, some of them are successful and some aren't. Our approach has been quite successful, I mean, I use Huge as an example. When we acquired Huge, they had 80 people to 100 people. Now, they have 800 people to 1,000 people on a worldwide basis.","There aren't many of those transactions, but those are the kind of transactions that we look at, we look at small to medium acquisitions that are in the sweet spot of the areas that we need the expertise, whether it would be digital, which obviously is what everybody is looking at right now, or a geographic area or it's a discipline.","So, we've done a number of transactions in our PR business. Obviously, our PR business is very successful and we're certainly gaining market share against our competitors. So, therefore when we look at opportunities and acquisitions if we can bolster their go to market strategy, that's a good thing and we find transactions that it's appropriate in. So, don't expect us to announce a huge transaction on the M&A side. But we are looking on a very careful basis to be within the range, we always say we spend between $100 million and $150 million. We can go up above that a little bit obviously if the right transaction comes along, but we're very careful and disciplined in terms of our acquisitions.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for that.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities. Sir, your line is open.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for the question.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","An industry question for Michael, as you're no doubt aware there's a narrative out there around intermediation, it's been out there for 20 years, right.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","If you were a company (41:59) 10 years ago, we're going to take all your business, five years ago...","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yup.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","...it was going to be crowdsourcing and YouTube videos and today's flavor seems to be technology and in-housing of programmatic and other activities enabling marketers to more cheaply and efficiently produce assets and promote those assets without the help of the agencies. So I guess, I'm just wondering if you step back and think broadly about the share of marketing services that is going to agency holding companies. Do you think it is materially different today than it was five years or 10 years ago and if you look out over the next couple years, are there things that concern you in terms of looming threats or new competitors et cetera. Thanks very much.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that's a fair question, Peter. Yeah, it's out there. My favorite slide that I show when I make presentations is a headline in the Wall Street Journal that declares the demise of the advertising industry because of all these new technologies and so on. And then of course, my next slide is that quote was 25 years ago. Look we have to be on our toes, we have to continue to invest in what works and what clients are looking for and as long as we can add that value to clients, there's no need for them to take it in-house or use other services. I think what we're seeing actually now, because of the distribution of media outlets right now, most of our clients are looking for solutions, because it's very difficult for them on their own to really go through all of these different outlets on an integrated basis.","So, I think the value proposition that we have now is as strong as it's ever been. And as long as we have the type whether it would be programmatic buying, whether it would be content, whether it would be PR, whether it would be content creation, all of it and distribution on a global basis, and we are the only place and I say we, as an industry, we are the only place where we could bring all of this together. And hopefully on an agnostic basis, to advise our clients where to put their money.","So, I think our value proposition right now is as strong as it's ever been. And yeah, clients are going to look to make sure that we're doing it efficiently and it's no different than when we look at acquisitions, do we choose to grow it organically or buy it, so the buy versus rent argument is out there and it always is an analysis and it's incumbent upon us to show that we have the tools and resources to help our clients. And if we don't, they're either going to do it themselves or use some of the other providers. So do I think it's challenging? Yes. Do I think we've stepped up to the plate? Yes. Do I think we have to do more? Of course. And that's really what's driving a lot of these media pitches right now.","They want to make sure that they're getting the best. And so, that they can make decisions with respect to how they move their business going forward and they're looking to us to provide a solution. And if we can't do that, they'll look for other solutions and that's no different than it's been 25 years ago. And we just have to stay ahead of the curve. And I know, our competitors whether it be the tech companies or consulting companies, are trying to have inroads in there, in addition to clients taking it in-house, but if you \u2013 I talked about this in Cannes, the creativity part of this is something that I think we can't lose sight of. And that is we do have that secret sauce as I put it, in terms of bringing that creative aspect, for all of these different tools and resources and we're the ones who are going to provide that, because this is where the talent wants to be.","To work with these clients, whether they be global clients or domestic clients, these creative people are looking to do that, and we provide that, it's very difficult for these tech companies or consulting companies to recruit and retain the talent that we have in the organization.","If you just look at McCann and FCB in terms of \u2013 as well as the rest of our businesses, but when you look at a Rob Reilly or a Susan Credle or any of the other creative people we have within our organization, those talented people are looking to our industry to use their talent and it's tough to get those kind of people and keep them engaged the way we do.","So, I think that the demise of our business is not something that's going to happen and it's just, we just have to remain on our toes to make sure that we continue to invest in people, leverage our creativity expertise, and make sure we have the tools and resources to help our clients.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just a couple for Frank, Frank, the pass-through revenue that you called out in your prepared remarks, is that all in the U.S. or any geographic color you can give us?","Frank Mergenthaler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Ben, it's primarily the U.S. and the UK.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then, just going back to this margin question or I guess our insistence to revisit the margin question. Frank, when you think about the incentive comp, are you guys accruing at a level that needs to go up, because you've raised your outlook because I know that's an area in the past when you've had a really strong top line year, you've had to ratchet that up as you've moved through the quarters.","Frank Mergenthaler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think, especially in the second quarter, Ben, we take \u2013 we're right in the middle of our midyear reviews to look at the full year. A year ago, we had some concerns about the back half of the year and you look at our accrual in the second quarter, our incentives was down. This year, we felt more positive about it. So we raised it up, so every quarter, we effectively mark-to-market how we \u2013 what we think we're going to need for the year, based upon our current thinking of the year. So right now, we're accruing to where we expect to land.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, in general, we use 3.5%. And in this quarter, you're right, we had to catch up, and the reason we had to catch up is not so much is the forecast, but our results indicate an improvement that requires us \u2013 of course, a lot of \u2013 our incentive comp is based on \u2013 a significant part is based on performance, which is what \u2013 is where it should be. So, there's a correlation between our performance and our incentive accrual, right.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And that's really what you're seeing right here.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then, congratulations on getting the rating agencies all aligned. I know that was a work in progress, but I guess, I wonder if you could just update us on how you think about leverage now going forward? You guys are generating more cash flow than maybe you expected earlier in the year, given the top line strength and just, as we think about the model over the next couple of years, it seems like you've got a lot of capacity. What's the right leverage level for the company, in your view?","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You know, the right leverage is always a function of the macroeconomics. We want to make sure that we're well positioned for any surprises that may be out there. Frankly, we learned this the hard way 10 years ago, and we've worked very hard, and thank you for acknowledging, to get the investment grade. I guess on a pure numbers basis, you can look at our leverage and see that we're probably under-levered. And, especially with the investment grade, I know the next part of your question is, are we going to be putting in a commercial paper program and use some of our excess cash? We're managing our cash flow, our treasury department, financial \u2013 Frank and his organization, we look at this very carefully. And frankly, if the opportunity is out there for us to put in a commercial paper program and it's beneficial to us, we will do that. And that should free up some opportunity for us to look at return to shareholders, whether it be in the form of dividends or buybacks. We still have plenty left in our buyback authorization, we have over $300 million left, and we intend to use that. And so, I like the position we're in right now from a financial order (50:27) position. And as we get stronger on the macroeconomic environment, then we'll look at the appropriate leverage, and I think that's what we've done for years, and that's the way it should be right now.","A knee jerk reaction to put on a large amount of debt to buy back shares, for example, which a number of people would argue, I think is a short-term play versus a long-term play. But we do look at this, and it's incumbent upon us to review those transactions with our board, which we do, and we'll make a call between buybacks, using our leverage, and dividend distribution. I mean, that's what we owe to our shareholders, and that's how we view it.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And I just have one last one. Michael, when we look at the performance first half of the year, I think it's 6% plus organic and more, if you adjust for pass-through. I'm trying to reconcile that with the comments from marketers about focus on cost and procurement impact, and the tough global macro; how do you reconcile those things? Are you \u2013 do you have all the good clients, or are you taking a lot of share, or do you think that there is something happening in media buying, in particular, that's allowing the agencies to really benefit from this shift to digital spending? You guys tend to not talk about how much of your business is digital, and I understand completely why you do that. But could you give us any sense for, just how much that \u2013 the buying business is changing, and whether that's helping to drive this continued strong top line we're seeing?","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I thought you would have noticed that much of my script was focusing on our digital capability. Frankly, I don't think we get credit for the strength of our digital offering. So that's why we spent so much time in our comments to show our strength in digital. You're asking me, which of my children do I like better? I think what our results show, is that we have strong offerings across the board. And our global networks, McCann obviously, is on the front foot and doing very well. FCB, Mullen Lowe, these are very powerful networks on a global basis. And we're seeing the results of investments we've made, restructurings that we've done, particularly, for example, Mullen Lowe, we brought in new talent at McCann and FCB.","And I think- I don't think, I know we're seeing the results of that. I think McCann is a perfect example, in terms of Harris and his entire team, and the people that he'd been able to bring in to McCann, we're seeing results. And so, that is a very competitive offering in the marketplace, and that's certainly, along with FCB and Lowe \u2013 Mullen Lowe, excuse me \u2013 contributing to the growth that we're seeing and yeah, in a way, we're taking market share. That doesn't mean that our digital offerings, the R\/GAs, the Huge, the Profero, the MRMs, all these \u2013 we have some silo digital offerings that are, frankly, double-digit growth. So they're helping us a lot.","Our marketing services, Weber Shandwick or Golin, are taking market share. I don't think there's any question that we're seeing that, and media is a strong performer for us, and we're very comfortable \u2013 we made some personnel changes in media. I think Henry's putting together a great team. He has extensive experience in media, and it's helping us in these pitches that we're involved in now. I'm feeling pretty positive about where we stand in these pitches that are out there. As I said, we're defending clients that we have the long-standing relationship, I'm comfortable with that. And in those situations, where we're new to the block, we hope to pick up some additional revenue.","So, I think it's all of the above is why we're performing, and frankly, that's why investors should be looking at us. It's not just one trick pony, it's not an overweight in one particular area, whether it be media or , and on a global basis, we're well distributed in terms of our sources of revenue.","So, if you put it altogether, you'll end up with an organic growth that we have and that's what makes a competitive organization, and frankly, that's why we're feeling good about this particular result that we're showing, because it's across the board, it's not just one particular network or organization or discipline that's contributing to it.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, guys.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right. You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Dan Salmon of BMO Capital. Sir, your line is open.","Dan Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey guys, good morning. Michael, you called out Brazil a couple of times in your prepared remarks and highlighted it for deceleration. Could you just give a little color on that. It's kind of a funny year there where you're coming off this difficult comp with the World Cup, but going into Olympics next year, how much is just disruption around being in-between a couple of huge events versus sort of core challenges on the macro side there?","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah I mean last year, I think last quarter we were up 7% and before that we were up double digits, so \u2013 there is a relative strong comp in Brazil in particular but \u2013 look there's no question that there's a pullback in Brazil. I mean the huge growth that we've seen across the board is just not there, so, we're concerned about it.","Of course, we had a particular issue in Brazil, that we had to deal with, so I'm not going to bury your head to it, and frankly, we will be able to put that behind us and we feel we have \u2013 we certainly have that fenced it right now, but it's a market that is going through a lot of changes down there.","And so, we're cautious about it. Fortunately, in LatAm, we're seeing strength in Mexico, and Argentina, so that offsetting some of the weakness we're seeing in Brazil and so for the full year \u2013 although, we're down in the quarter, we're relatively flat. We hope for the full year.","And I think that really reflects what we're seeing in the macroeconomic environment. Of course coming into next year we hope to see a pickup in Brazil, because we do have events coming there. And hopefully particularly with our marketing service businesses, we can provide some kick to the organic side of the business, but it's a concern. The other side of it is of course, it's not a major part of our business, and that's one of the benefits of our global footprint.","Dan Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right.","Operator","Okay. We have come to the bottom of the hour. Back to you Mr. Roth, for any closing thoughts.","Michael I. Roth - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I thank you all for your support. All you can tell, we're delighted with our results, but we're certainly not raising any flags. We have a lot of work ahead of us, and we'll now go back to putting our heads down and delivering. Thank you very much for your support.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you do have any objections, then please disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jerome J. Leshne","Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com, and we'll refer to both in the course of this call.","This morning, we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 a.m. Eastern.","During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company, which are subject to uncertainties in the cautionary statement included in our earnings release and the slide presentation and further detailed in our 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.","At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael I. Roth","Thank you, Jerry, and thank you, all, for joining us for our review of our third quarter and 9 months 2012 results. As usual, I'll begin by covering key highlights and developments. Frank will then provide additional financial detail. I'll conclude with an update on our agencies to be followed by the Q&A.","Beginning with revenue in the quarter, our organic decrease of 0.9% was made up of 5.2% International growth and a 5.4% decrease in the U.S. These results reflect greater caution on the part of our clients, particularly in September, headwinds from 2011 losses and extremely challenging third quarter comparisons.","As you recall, our industry-leading growth of 8.7% in last year's third quarter was driven by 10% growth in the U.S. and benefited from a revenue shift of $26 million from Q2 into Q3. In addition, we continue to see the impact from last year's account losses, which was 2.5% in the quarter, also notably, in the consumer goods sector, and in the U.S., that number was approximately 4%.","In the U.S., we had growth at our media businesses, our digital agencies and the marketing service specialists in our CMG segment, as well as a number of our integrated U.S. independents. From a sector perspective, we grew in the auto and financial services verticals while the softness that we noted on our second quarter call in the pharma and retail sectors continued in Q3.","The solid International results were on top of an outstanding performance in several markets a year ago. We were led by a U.K. market with an organic increase of 25%, which included several large assignments related to the Olympics. The Asia Pac region had solid growth on top of a 15% increase a year ago. In LatAm, organic growth was flat from last year. But it's worth noting that Q3 last year featured over 20% growth in LatAm, and the region is up almost 10% organically year-to-date in 2012.","Turning to expenses. Our results in the quarter reflect careful and effective cost management. Sequentially, from Q2 to Q3, all of our major expense categories were flat or decreased. The only exception was pass-through expenses, which are directly offset in revenue, and this was due to our high volume of Olympic projects connected to the London games.","Q3 operating profit was $131 million, and operating margin was 7.9%. Profit performance in the prior year period was the best of any third quarter in our company's history, which made for another tough comp. Q3 diluted earnings per share of $0.15 compares to $0.16 in Q3 '11, excluding the impact of our Facebook transaction a year ago.","In the third quarter, we continued to drive value from our balance sheet. We repurchased approximately 8 million shares in the quarter for $83 million. This brings our repurchases to 19 million shares and 201 million through the 9 months. Over the past 12 months, we put approximately $600 million to work in the form of share repurchases, dividends and retiring long-term debt.","Diluted shares in the quarter decreased 15% from last year's third quarter, due to our share repurchases and elimination of a convertible debt issue earlier this year, as well as dilution from our convertible preferred shares last year.","Looking ahead, Q4 is always critical since it is our seasonally largest quarter and our most significant profit contributor. We expect to achieve revenue and profit growth in the fourth quarter. With respect to the full year, we anticipate positive organic revenue performance. Given our growth through the 9 months and client caution, we now expect a lower rate of growth for the year than we have previously targeted.","In 2012, we will see year-on-year improvement with respect to operating margin. On a trailing 12 months to September 30, our margin increased 30 basis points. This demonstrates that we can enhance profitability at lower rates of revenue growth. Once again, Q4 will be key, but we believe that with organic revenue growth of at least 1% for the full year and a continued focus on cost, a 50 basis point improvement in operating margin remains attainable.","By the end of the fourth quarter, we will finish cycling the impact of last year's account losses on our top line. Consequently, we're confident that we will be in a position to grow at the rate of our industry in 2013. Our track record of cost discipline means that with competitive growth, we are well positioned to achieve further margin expansion, ultimately, to our stated goal of fully competitive profitability. We continue to repurchase our shares and have additional accretive opportunities in our debt profile available to us over the next 9 months to drive incremental value creation.","Now I'll turn it over to Frank and after his remarks, I'll return with some observations on the tone of our business at our agencies.","Frank Mergenthaler","Good morning. As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast.","On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of our results. Our organic revenue change was a decrease of 0.9% in Q3 against 8.7% growth last year. We continued our strong expense discipline across the company. Our quarterly progression from Q2 to Q3 was well controlled and year-end expense growth was 1.2% organically. Q3 operating income was $131 million and operating margin was 7.9%. Q3 diluted earnings per share was $0.15.","We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash and short-term marketable securities on the balance sheet. That total does not include our ownership interest in Facebook and reflects our share repurchase, dividends and deleveraging activity over the past 12 months. In that time, we also invested $190 million in acquisitions, focused in high-growth digital, marketing services and specialty disciplines, as well as high-growth markets around the world.","Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. Our average basic share count for the quarter was 431 million, a decrease of 7% from a year ago, which reflects our share repurchases activity over the past 12 months. Average diluted shares for the quarter decreased 15%, which also reflects the retirement of convertible debt earlier this year and dilution from our convertible preferred shares in Q3 2011.","Turning to operations on Slide 4, beginning with revenue. Revenue in the quarter is $1.67 billion, a reported decrease of 3.2%. Compared to Q3 2011, the impact of change in exchange rates was a negative 310 basis points. The effect of net acquisitions and dispositions added 80 basis points of revenue growth. The organic decrease was 0.9% or $16 million. Over the first 9 months of the year, organic revenue growth was 0.8%. As we called out in our last conference call, revenue headwinds are approximately 3% for the full year and they were 2.5% in Q3.","As you can see on the bottom of the slide, the organic revenue decreases at our Integrated Agency Network segment was 4% in the quarter, reflecting greater than 3% headwinds. Last year's third quarter organic growth for IAN was 8.3%.","Organic growth at our CMG segment was 14%. This includes project work from the Olympics in the U.K., as well as solid growth across our portfolio of marketing services specialists, including PR, events, sports marketing and branding. This performance is on top of Q3 2011 organic growth of 10.9%.","Moving to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., our decrease was against growth of 10% last year and reflects domestic headwinds of nearly 4%. We saw growth in the U.S. for our integrated independent agencies, our media businesses and at CMG. We had client sector growth in the U.S. in auto, transportation and financial services. The consumer goods sector decreased, and as of Q2 this year, the retail sector decreased, but this was compared to a 30% increase a year ago. We continue to see softness across much of the pharma category due to in large part to the industry's patent cliff.","Turning to International markets. Organic growth is 5.2%. That's on top of solid growth of 6.7% a year ago. The U.K. was a key driver. Organic revenue growth was 25.3%, which was helped by a portfolio of Olympic project work across a range of clients.","Continental Europe was flat organically in Q3. We continue to grow in Germany, our largest market on the continent. We had a small decrease in France. It's worth noting that we continue to see pressure on the markets such as Italy and Spain due to the harsh economic environment. On a reported basis, double-digit percentage decreases in the quarter and 9 months reflect the effect of a stronger U.S. dollar against the euro.","Asia Pac grew 5.3% organically and is up 11.7% for the 9 months. Q3 performance was on top of 15% growth a year ago. We were led by growth in media and marketing services, with notable increases in Australia, China, India and several smaller markets in the region. We grew with existing clients, as well as new client wins.","In LatAm, Q3 was flat against 22% growth a year ago. The 9 months organic growth is 9.7%.","In our other markets group, revenue decreased 1.8% organically, which reflects decreased revenue in Canada, as well as in the Middle East and North Africa region, partially offset by growth in South Africa.","On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 1.4%, which is updated to include Q3 2012.","Moving on to Slide 7 on our operating expenses. Our operators continue their effective focus on expense management. In Q3, operating expenses were flat to down in all of our major expense categories with the exception of pass-throughs that increase with growth in our events business. From a year-on-year standpoint, operating expenses grew only 1.2% organically, including the growth of our pass-through expenses, but the decrease in our top line put pressure on our expense leverage in the quarter.","Total salaries and related expenses were 63.7% of revenue in Q3 compared to 63% a year ago. On a trailing 12-month basis to September 30, salaries and related leverage was 63.1% compared to 63.4% the same period a year ago, an improvement of 30 basis points. Our leverage on base payroll, benefits and tax was 53.8% in Q3 compared with 51.1% -- 51.5% a year ago, which is primarily due to our revenue decrease.","Average Q3 headcount grew by 2% compared to the same period a year ago with approximately half of our increase from net acquisitions. The balance of our hiring reflects organic investment in growing disciplines, including media, public relations and in digital services throughout our agencies. It also supports our growth in markets such as China, India and Brazil. Offsetting these investments were decreases in Continental Europe and in the U.S., tracking revenue decreases. Quarter-end headcount was 43,500.","Severance expense was 1% of Q3 revenue compared with 1.1% a year ago. Incentive expense in the quarter was 2.3% of revenue compared with 4.1% a year ago. Q3 reflects our lower incentive accrual compared to Q3 2011 due to our latest projections for full year revenue.","Turning to office and general expense on the lower half of the slide. O&G was $475 million in Q3, which is an increase of 2% from a year ago, due to higher pass-through expenses. O&G increased $22 million on an organic basis, $21 million of which was pass-through expenses. These are direct costs offset in revenue.","Moving on, we drove 20 basis points of leverage on occupancy expense compared to a year ago as we continue to find efficiencies in our real estate portfolio. Occupancy was 7.2% of revenue compared with 7.4% a year ago.","On Slide 8, we show our operating margin improvement on a trailing 12-month basis with most recent data point of 9.4% for September 30.","Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 9. We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and short-term marketable securities, excluding our remaining ownership in Facebook, compared with $1.8 billion a year ago, a decrease of approximately $600 million. Comparison includes $440 million returned to shareholders over the last 12 months in the form of share repurchases and common stock dividends, as well as a reduction of our long-term debt by $150 million.","We've also invested approximately $190 million in acquisitions over the past 12 months. Restricted marketable securities line seen here, $95 million, is our remaining 4.4 million shares of Facebook mark-to-market as of September 30. The restriction lapses in the middle of the next month.","On Slide 10, we turn to cash flow for the quarter. Cash used in operations was $104 million compared with cash generation of $150 million in Q3 2011. Cash used in working capital is $240 million compared with the use of $34 million last year, due to the impact of trailing account losses and our slower Q3 growth.","Investing activities, we used $131 million, primarily for acquisitions and CapEx. Acquisitions in Q3 reflected our emphasis on high-growth disciplines and expanding our digital capabilities. Our acquisitions in Q3 included a health care technology and market research specialist agency and a leading shopper marketing agency.","Financing activities used $98 million, the largest components of which were $83 million for share repurchases and $26 million for our quarterly common stock dividend. The net decrease in cash and marketable securities in the quarter was $313 million.","On Slide 11, we see our total debt outstanding at the end of Q3, as well as our year end from 2007 through 2011. Our total debt reduction since the end of 2007 has been nearly $700 million to the level you see here of $1.68 billion. Over the next 9 months, we will have additional opportunities to address nearly half of our outstanding total to further improve our balance sheet and reduce our effective cost of debt.","In March of next year, we can call our $200 million, a 4.75% convertible debt, which includes 17 million diluted shares. In July, we have the option to call our 10%, $600 million senior notes at a price of 105.","Turning to Slide 12, in summary, we are managing a challenging top line with disciplined cost control. We continue to utilize our balance sheet to drive value with additional opportunity in front of us, and we remain confident of our ability to drive margin improvement with sustained growth.","With that, let me now turn it back over to Michael.","Michael I. Roth","Thank you, Frank. Well, as we already noted, during the third quarter, the combination of increased client caution, deep comps, especially in the U.S., and headwinds from 2011 client losses, again concentrated in the U.S., outweighed our growth internationally and at a number of our agencies.","The momentum at Mediabrands and across the CMG portfolio continues to be positive. Those agencies are picking up new assignments, building leading-edge digital expertise and winning market share, particularly at Weber Shandwick and GolinHarris. We are also seeing strong performance at R\/GA and HUGE, as well as within the digital capabilities embedded throughout all our agencies, including the U.S. independents.","Draftfcb has made progress in replacing revenue from 2 large client losses, developing its offering in digital and marketing services and effectively managing cost. Lowe continues to build on its leadership position with Unilever and is a top creative network focused on emerging markets. The transformation at McCann continues. Major clients are increasingly seeing the best of its integrated marketing solutions, and we are committed to supporting this great brand by investing in its talent and its resources.","New business performance this year is on a more solid footing, and we were net new business positive through the third quarter. Year-to-date, performance in the BRIC markets has been very strong with growth north of 12% on top of an even better performance in 2011. Relative to our peers, we are very competitively represented in emerging economies in our revenue mix, so we should continue to enjoy the benefits of being in those high-growth markets.","We have outstanding agencies in India and Brazil across all our global networks. Brazil and Argentina are also providing to be promising markets for our digital agencies and a great source of digital talent. As we said before, our investment in China will largely be organic through talent acquisition and development.","The other high-growth area of the business is digital. We continue to see significant progress across the portfolio. This is an area that has contributed very good growth year-to-date. We'll stay focused on adding to our capabilities through hiring and training, as well as incubation of new capabilities, such as MAP, our digital audience platform and automated trading desk. We'll also support further international expansion for R\/GA and HUGE on top of a tactical digital M&A activity at our major global networks.","To reiterate, we expect to see organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter and to achieve positive organic revenue performance for the full year. We're committing to delivering year-on-year improvement in operating margin for 2012.","From the second to the third quarter of this year, we continue to demonstrate strong expense management. In fact, over the past 12 months, organic cost increases have lagged organic revenue growth. Therefore, as mentioned earlier, a 50 basis point improvement in operating margin remains attainable with annual organic revenue growth of at least 1%.","It's worth noting that our 2012 incentive compensation plans were built around the revenue and margin targets we set going into this year. So accountability for performance against these goals is very much in place.","Looking forward, we should be going into 2013 in a much better position than we did this year. We're positioned to achieve competitive growth, which, in turn, will allow us to deliver further margin expansion. We've also called out additional opportunities in our debt profile that will present themselves in the next 9 months, and our share repurchases and dividend programs will continue to be strong drivers of value creation.","While this year has proven to be more challenging on revenue than anticipated, we continue to manage the business effectively. The quality of our offerings is sound, and we're focused on making improvements where and when required. We have great digital expertise and precedents -- presence in high-growth emerging markets. Above all, our ability to help clients manage in an increasingly complex consumer and media landscape represent a significant opportunity. These factors position us well for the balance of this year and to create shareholder value in the years to come.","Thank you. I will open up the floor now to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMC.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just -- if you can give us a little bit more color on the weakness in the U.S. How much worse, I guess, was September versus the rest of the quarter? And anything one-time-ish in it, or should we just assume that the pullbacks will continue? I know you have some very difficult comps in the quarter. Just trying to quantify how much the weakness was sort of incremental client caution that you mentioned or just some sense of what the trend is in the underlying business going into Q4?","Michael I. Roth","Alexia, we were positive in July and August in terms of organic growth. So frankly, the decline in September was a bit of a surprise to us. But frankly, we're seeing that in the whole industry. I think we've seen it in all of our peers who I've mentioned. Obviously, that's -- there wasn't any one specific items that caused that, and what we're seeing as a general tone is this concern and uncertainty with respect to the macroeconomic environment. And I think, not just our industry, I think we've seen it in -- with respect to all industries, that we're seeing caution in terms of expenditures. And until this macro uncertainty is removed, I think we can't say with certainty what the outcome is going to be. That said, the fourth quarter has traditionally been our strongest quarter. And remember, last year, in the third quarter, we had this shift from the second quarter into the third quarter of a single item of around $28 million, which distorted the comps. So I think what we're seeing is consistent with what the industry is taking into account. Our comps of last year had some client losses. And we're cautious, but as I indicated, what we're saying is with at least 1% organic growth for the year, we should be able to expand our margin to, at least, a 50 basis point mark that we had indicated. But there's some uncertainty out there, and I think we're just going to have to manage our business. The cost controls that we have within our company, I think, are coming through very strongly, and you see that. And of course, our model is a vary based -- variable cost-based model, which is how you see the change in our incentive comp which reflects it. Remember, our businesses are compensated, including the corporate, by the way, on revenue and margin. So when you see a pullback in either of those 2, then there's adjustments in our incentive comp. That's how our model is built, and that's how our forecast and our modeling, going forward, takes into consideration.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And when you look at the very strong performance you had in the U.K., you mentioned the Olympics, obviously, was a big factor there. Could you tell us if you think you would've had positive organic growth in the U.K. aside from the Olympics?","Michael I. Roth","Yes. It wouldn't have been 25%, but the answer is yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I have 3 for you. Just following up on the Olympics question. If you guys had the pass-through cost of $21 million, then logic would say that the revenues are going to be somewhere in the low $20 million range, right? That's kind of a logical assumption.","Frank Mergenthaler","There's some margin in that number, Michael.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Right. So I'll put a little margin, okay. I just want to get that clear. Second thing is I guess going back to the weakness in September. At what point when you're in the fourth quarter, do you feel like you have a handle on fourth quarter organic? I mean, is December the most important quarter -- the most important month in the quarter, will 2 to 3 months give you confidence? At what point when you come back to the market do you have a better sense of what fourth quarter looks like on organic?","Michael I. Roth","Remember, a lot of our project business is in the fourth quarter. And December is the critical month. If you remember, historically, whenever you look at whether there were good years or bad years -- and certainly, that -- not that I think we're in that position. But when we saw 2008, December is where it really came -- basically, the project business stopped, okay? We don't expect that to happen, but certainly, December is a critical month. So what we see in October and November is much the business as usual, and we just sort of see how it comes out in December. And we won't have visibility into that until we're close to it.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Last question's for Frank. On flexibility of costs in the fourth quarter, aside from the comp -- the performance comp, is there anything else you have in terms of flexibility that you can bring down if you see that organic revenue coming down? Or are you pretty much locked in with a lot of your cost buckets in the fourth quarter?","Frank Mergenthaler","The biggest thing, as you know, with fourth quarter being our largest revenue quarter from a seasonality perspective, you've got correlated sequential growth and expenses. We're very focused now on managing that sequential increase in costs against that revenue, right? So that's the message out for everybody is focus very hard on kind of what our run rate was coming out of Q3, be very disciplined about adding cost as that seasonal revenue comes in on -- in Q4.","Michael I. Roth","This doesn't start if -- the basic thrust of your question is this doesn't start tomorrow, all right? And at the end in the second quarter, we did our bottoms up, and we said we better be careful with our cost increases. So we started managing those cost items that potentially are variable at the end of the second quarter, and that's -- and you're seeing some of that right in the third quarter. So I think that's a good example of how we are -- we have visibility into the cost side of our business, and we take actions as quickly as we can to make sure that the impact of those actions that we take are felt as soon as possible.","Operator","And our next question comes from Benjamin Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.","Hersh Khadilkar - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Hersh Khadilkar, actually, on behalf of Ben. Just wondering, given the more cautious tone on the top line environment, does it change your view on the buyback pace for this year and next?","Michael I. Roth","No. I think that's one of the great stories of our company, and that is we have a very strong balance sheet. We continue to anticipate that to be the case. And certainly, by year end and -- we continue to have, what, an excess cash position and financial flexibility on our financing. And as we indicated, we're committed to the buyback program. And we see that as a great indication to our shareholders that we're committed to enhancing shareholder value, and therefore, that's why we put in the buyback program and the dividend in the first place. And we see no reason at this point to change our views on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Janedis from UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Frank, you've talked historically about the need for leverage in the SRS line to hit the long-term margin targets. I think this year most of the margin leverage comes from O&G. And so when we look ahead to next year, what kind of growth do we need to see on organic for improvement in SRS?","Frank Mergenthaler","John, I think we've demonstrated that with any growth we've gotten leverage out of SRS, right? So if you look at trailing 12 months, we've generated 20 or 30 incremental basis point of margin as of September 30, and most of that is coming -- or a good proportion is coming out of SRS. So we're very confident, with sustained growth, we can continue to drive leverage, and that will be a key contributor to getting us to competitive margins.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then separately, I guess, there's been a lot in the press about the pharma category. Michael, can you give us an update on those clients and maybe how that might translate into a headwind next year, if at all?","Michael I. Roth","Yes. I mean, what you -- there are a number of things that you're seeing in the pharma business. One of note, of course, is the consolidations that are out there. And frankly, we -- pharma is a very important sector to us, and health care is 15%. And we continue to view that as an opportunity for us, evidenced by the acquisitions that we've made in that category. So what we're experiencing right now is the -- a lot of these drugs are coming off patent, but there is a pipeline of new drugs and launches. And frankly, we are experiencing some wins in terms of new products going to market, and this is on a global basis. And so I think it continues to be an important sector for us. And I think as we move out into 2013 and beyond, pharma will come back in these launches of new products, and we certainly have the capability within that sector to compete very effectively and add to our growth as a result of it. I might add -- I know the questions are going to be on new clients. The J&J consolidation was out there, and we had -- I know Jerry had a lot of questions on it. So let me cover some of it right now. Good news for us on J&J, particularly on the media side, we mentioned in the last quarter that J&J had a review going with respect to its European media. I don't know if it's been out in the press yet, but we did pick up incremental -- and on that one, we weren't really doing any European media business for J&J, and we were successful in picking up new markets with respect to that review. So we're very excited about that, and it shows how strong our relationship with J&J is on the media side. So the next question is we do have a review on the U.S. side of the media, but I think the fact that we've picked up incremental business in Europe is a strong indication of our relationship on J&J and how they view our media offerings. So we're comfortable with that review as it proceeds. On the consumer brand review that they had, again, our strength in J&J is in the ACUVUE, in the pharma business and the media business. We had some consumer brands, particularly Tylenol, that we did lose. But again, the overall strength of our J&J business is in the other sectors.","Operator","And our next question comes from Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Wondering if we could get a little bit more detail about Q4 and the headwinds. You provided us some information, and I apologize if I missed this. Could you give us a sense of what the U.S. headwinds are in Q4 and total? And then I got one quick follow-up.","Frank Mergenthaler","The U.S. headwinds are 3% to 4%.","Michael I. Roth","And particularly in the consumer goods sector.","Frank Mergenthaler","And for the aggregate, it's around 2.5%.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And we all know that you're in the thick of talking to clients about 2013. Commentary coming out of your European competitor suggest not just fear, I guess, but also kind of hesitation. And just wondering if you could give us any color on the nature of the conversations. Do you feel like nominal GDP growth for you is realistic? You've already commented on your confidence around competitiveness. But if you had to take kind of an early look at 2013, any guidance would be great.","Michael I. Roth","Well, Magna put out a -- they put out their release, did they not? Yes, okay. I'm sorry. They did pull back slightly in terms of the macro impact on a global basis. So I think that's really what we're -- frankly, what we're seeing. The conversations that we've been having with our multinational clients, of course, is caution. But they also are viewing this as an opportunity, so -- which is exactly why you're seeing some strength in the emerging markets, because that's where our clients see the battle to be won or lost. So we are seeing very strong conversations about how they can either launch products or gain market share in those markets. And what we're doing is we're putting together plans to help them effectively gain market share or launch in those areas. And so I think that conversation and our results reflect that, that they're still going on. And I don't think you're going to see major pullbacks in those markets, because what I view as our enlightened clients view this as a good opportunity to gain market share. So we're right next to them in terms of helping them to do this. Of course, there's caution, as I indicated, and particularly in Europe. But actually, when you look at our overall International results, they're positive, which, given the competitive set in that area, we're very proud of the results that we're seeing on the international markets. So I think there's caution. We're concerned. But I don't see this as wholesale cutbacks the way we've seen in the past.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matt Chesler from Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to revisit the earlier question. I think the question was trying to get a sense for any of the revenue implications in 2013 from some of the consolidations that didn't go your way. Because I know you had made a comment earlier that you were net new business positive through the third quarter, but a couple of those consolidations didn't go the way -- I know some of them weren't as big as the headlines appeared. But do you \u2013 as you go into 2013, what's the implications from those losses?","Michael I. Roth","Yes. I think the big one that you're referring to -- we can't really comment on specific clients. But the one that you're referring to is the Pfizer consolidation. And as we indicated, there was some impact of that. A lot of it was local business that we already do, and it's not taking into effect until the end of '13 and '14. So we don't have a lot of visibility into that right now, but frankly, it's sort of business as usual for us. So we -- as we indicated, we didn't think that's going to be a material impact for us, certainly, going into 2013. On the other side of it, we have been picking up additional product launches on a global basis, whether it be in McCann, health care or Draftfcb, and our pharma offering at J&J continues to see that as well. So although there may be some exposure as a result of the consolidation at Pfizer, we are seeing some positive impacts and wins in our other pharma sectors.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Would you go as far as to say that you're entering 2013 with a tailwind or is it...","Michael I. Roth","I wouldn't mention that. First of all, I told the team I don't like to jinx thing. I'm kind of superstitious. So I'll keep it where it is right now, and we're net new business positive for the first 3 quarters.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, right. And then in terms of the buyback, do you think of your investment in Facebook is it something that's supplemental to your current authorization, or that would just help you deploy what you've already committed to?","Michael I. Roth","Well, I think if you look at our best -- past actions, when we sold the other half, the immediate thing we did was increase our authorization. I think that should give you an indication on how we view the Facebook and proceeds, if and when we realize them. My lawyers are looking at me like crazy.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just in terms of the bigger bucket for base benefits and tax. What kind of leverage, and what should we be expecting in Q4? Is it possible that, that can be down sequentially, given the -- that you guys got an early start on your expense controls?","Frank Mergenthaler","We don't expect this to be down sequentially, Matt. I do think -- we are expecting to see greater leverage out of it. Just because of the seasonality revenue growth, that would be very difficult to do to reduce it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a couple. I'm sorry if you said this but, Frank, did you -- were you able to parse out in the U.S. what the tailwind from Olympic-related work in the 3Q was in terms of basis points?","Frank Mergenthaler","What we said was it came at -- there's about $20 million of incremental Olympic work in the U.K.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","In the U.K.? Okay.","Frank Mergenthaler","U.K.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","What about the U.S.?","Frank Mergenthaler","Again, that's -- there's no incremental Olympic revenue in the U.S.","Michael I. Roth","Well, let me just comment about Olympics. Down the road, it's not immediate, but obviously, in Brazil, we have some engagements with respect to the FIFA and the Olympics in place. So that's pretty exciting to see down the road. So there are opportunities. Right.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then, Frank, I know you have some issues that come up in 2013, I mean, your balance sheet. So converts to call, I think that's March, and you've got 10% notes that you could potentially term out midyear next year. I guess the question is, is there any reason at all that you would not look to refinance those issues at much lower rates?","Frank Mergenthaler","No.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. All right, that's good. Okay. Okay, great. And then...","Michael I. Roth","Well, you heard my comments and saying we see opportunities on our balance sheet. That's what we were referring to.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Sure. Okay, got it, loud and clear. And then -- and finally, Mike, for you -- Michael, for you. I wonder -- it's just kind of interesting that CMOs in the U.S, you wouldn't be using this type of environment with capital kind of a little bit easier, to just go after market share, and so it's -- I understand there's caution. But I'm just wondering, is there anything else going on with respect to how CMOs are looking at the world? Are they taking incremental dollars and perhaps doing some more on their own, in terms of earned media? Maybe you could just provide us an update on what you're seeing in digital and technology. Are people maybe allocating dollars more efficiently to mobile or to social? And just wondering if what's happening is that because usage and time spend is moving towards those types of platforms, that they can perhaps spend and campaign a bit more efficiently?","Michael I. Roth","It's a great question. And the fact is that's where a lot of the action is taking -- look, just take a look at the increase in digital overall, and you can see how it's outpacing spend in other outlets. That doesn't mean TV and cable is not growing. It is. But \"the Internet\" and digital is growing at a faster rate. The notion of paid and earned media, you're spot on, on the point that our clients are looking to us to make sure that they get better reach, more effectiveness with less expenditure. And I was waiting to use this phrase on this call and I'll use it and that is that confusion is good. So this is where we earn our keep. And yes, the clients are saying, \"I want to gain market share. I want to increase my exposure to the consumer base. But I want to do it in a much more efficient way.\" So we are seeing that, and ultimately -- and I don't -- they're looking to see more earned than paid, and it's incumbent upon us to have the tools and resources to do that. So we are seeing the impact of that, and frankly, you're seeing a lot of that. A lot of the reviews that are out there are on the media side, and the reason for it is because everyone -- they're looking for efficiencies. I might add, by the way, on the Unilever media pitch, I think that came to a close after the last announcement we had. And on that one, we retained the business we had, and we picked up some incremental business there, which also was good. But what they're looking for is for us to use all the tools and resources to be more efficient in how they spend their dollars. So it's not that they're taking the dollars and spending it elsewhere. They just want to get more for the same amount of money that they were spending. And in some cases, there's pressure on their P&L, and they're concerned about where to spend their money on a macro basis so we see some pullback. That's not the same as where we experienced before, just a total stop of marketing dollars.","Operator","And our next question comes from James Dix from Wedbush.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Two -- just a couple of things. Just going back to September, which seems to have been a tough month industry-wide. Do you have any other color as to where you saw, geographically, any more increased caution than anywhere else? Because for the quarter, at least, your International growth beat my expectations and seemed pretty strong. And so I was curious as to whether you had any more color as to what you saw in September, specifically, by geography, and whether that kind of mix of concern by geography is continuing in -- so far in the fourth quarter.","Michael I. Roth","Yes. I think most -- not most of it, a good part of it was here in the United States, and that was reflected in our results today. And frankly, the impact on retail is one of the areas that we've seen it. I think that's where the question of macro impact, of getting our act together in Congress and the uncertainties in terms of the fiscal cliff that we're facing, and I think you're seeing it on the retail sector. So it's likely to spill over to our caution on the part of our clients on the retail side, and so I think a portion of it is coming through there.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then secondly, I mean, if you were able to achieve your 1% organic growth, or at least that, for the year, what are the items that could cause you to have less than 50 basis margin improvement for the year? Is it just the mix of the growth versus headcount? Or I'm just trying to understand kind of how those dynamics could play out for the full year and what you're seeing in the fourth quarter.","Michael I. Roth","Well, one of the items that's in there, frankly, that would impact it would be severance, all right. To the extent we have to take actions and we see softness in the revenue, then historically, because of our variable cost model, it comes out in headcount. So you might see some -- right now, we're using 1% in severance. So you'll see a slight tick -- pickup in severance. The rest of it is pretty consistent of what we've seen in the past.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess finally, on incentives for the year. I know you've talked about 3.5% to 4%. I mean, it sounds like part of your lower accruals in the third quarter was due to the lower organic growth. Any general sense at this point as to what we should be modeling for that for the whole year, or is it just too hard to say?","Frank Mergenthaler","I'd probably say 3% to 3.5%.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Bank from RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Frank, I feel like every call for the past couple, I've asked you this question, which was when you think about the minimum amount of tailwind you need to get the operating leverage for the 50 basis points of margin improvement, what's the minimum amount of revenue you need? And I guess where the question is getting answered here in that, this year, at least, it sounds like you don't need any more than 100 basis points necessarily to get there. So I guess I'll take one more shot at it. What do you think is the minimum amount of revenue growth you need to get the 50 basis points of improvement? And then recognizing that this was a -- and there's a bunch of extraordinary things going on this year in terms of client headwinds and just general environment, what do you think you need on a more sustained basis over the next couple as you target the margin improvement? What is the minimum amount of revenue growth you think you need to get the operating leverage?","Frank Mergenthaler","I'll try again, David. For this year, as we called out in Michael's comments, that we believe with 1% growth, 50 basis points is attainable. What puts that at risk is the comment Michael just made. If, in fact, as we go through 2013 planning and revenue concerns move to next year and we need to take action with respect to headcount because it's a variable cost model, as Michael called out, there could be some severance pressure on it, right? So if we've got to take severance actions, we're going to go ahead and do that, and that may put the 50 basis points at risk.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess I'm asking though, like could you do it at lower than 1% or is that the kind of -- is that the...","Frank Mergenthaler","We said 1% gives us 50 -- 50 basis points is attainable, right? So...","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then more on a going-forward basis?","Frank Mergenthaler","Going forward, I think we're still in the same place as where we were on Investor Day, when we put the longer-term model in front of the investment community. We were at 4% to 5% growth. We think we can get 100 basis points of margin improvement, and we're still there. So we'd like to see -- as Mike said, we're going to be competitive with respect to top line. What that means based on macroeconomic situation, we're not sure yet. We're not ready to commit to that yet. But we think with 4% to 5% growth, we can get back on the margin trajectory that we called out on the Investor Day over a year ago.","Michael I. Roth","Let me weigh in a little bit here. We've consistently said that what we need is growth to expand margin. Remember, we're still not at competitive margins, okay? So we're in a little different position in terms of margin expansion. So when we say we need -- whether it be 1%, we can expand margin. I think what we've shown, if you look at our results through the 3 months, we've had a 30 basis point margin expansion, okay? And so the point here is that, directionally, we still have the opportunity to expand margin in a low-growth environment. To get to the competitive margin, obviously, we have to step up and have greater revenue. But for the thesis of whether we're in a position to expand our margin, then we don't need those kind of growth levels to consistently do that because of the variable cost model that we have. And if we weren't managing our costs as effectively as we are, then we couldn't make that statement. Now -- and I -- and you're seeing this in -- across all businesses now and, certainly, in the United States. The issue is a revenue issue. It's not a cost issue. Businesses have learned how to manage their cost profile. So even though people are meeting their objectives, they're meeting it by the cost side of the business, not the revenue, and that's really what's driving the macroeconomic concerns. And that is, at some point in time, we have to convert to a more growth on the revenue side than expense management. And that's the concern that I think you're seeing across all sectors. And so we see growth. We see margin expansion. But until we get real revenue pickups in terms of the macroeconomic side, that's when you see the greater expansion on the margin for us going forward, and that's a truism.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess just one quick follow-up. You've definitely have sort of spoiled us in your ability to generate the operating leverage off of a less robust revenue base growth. So the question really is in -- and I don't know if you can answer this one. But can you keep doing this? If you get -- no one really knows what next year holds exactly to within 100 or 200 basis points. But if you were to only grow, say, 100 basis points next year, do you think 50 bps of margin expansion is doable again?","Michael I. Roth","Well, I'm not going to pin 50 basis points. What I'm going to tell you is I just said...","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I tried, Michael.","Michael I. Roth","That on margin -- with revenue growth, we continue to be able to expand margin. And yes, the answer is we can keep doing that because we have a variable cost model. And -- but it's not going to grow at the rate that we'd like it to grow in a more robust environment. That's not even a robust environment. Our Investor Day, we said 4% to 5% organic growth, okay, which is, historically, what our industry has been able to grow. And what's holding the industry from historically getting there has been the macroeconomics. Remember, our position in -- and we've proven it is that we have competitive offerings. So now it's -- we're crossing the street with the crowd looking at macroeconomics. And so in a lower growth environment, then we can still grow margin but it's not going to be at the growth rate that we would all like to see. But it's a revenue issue. It's not a cost issue.","Operator","And I do have a question from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Two questions. First, notwithstanding all the broader issues you've already discussed, how are you thinking clients may time their decisions on budgets for next year, in light of things like the U.S. fiscal cliff coming right up at the end of the year? Do you expect a delay in terms of when you'll be hearing back from clients? And then just secondly, any changes in the labor market for digital talent these days?","Michael I. Roth","Well, the changes are that it's continuing -- it's not a change. It continues to be very competitive. I think we're seeing less turnover. When you have a difficult economic environment, you don't see a lot of people jumping jobs. But it's still -- that's the area that we're still seeing a lot of competitiveness in terms of recruiting. The good news is we have great agencies and great clients, so we're -- we are -- have good places for those talented people to go and feel comfortable with the work they're doing. So I think it's a challenge, but we're up to it. And if you looked at our headcount improvement or increase, if you will, on the digital side and in the media side is where we're seeing our growth. So it shows we do have the ability to hire in there. When our clients are going to see the light? If all -- if everyone gets their act together and we have resolution of all the fiscal cliff and the sequestration and all the stuff that's out there, then I think 2013 will be a pleasant surprise for everybody. And -- but we're not going to see it all of a sudden in December, the floodgates are going to open up and happy days are here again and we're looking at huge growth rates. So I think it'll happen, but it's just a question of when all these other issues, and Europe, let's not forget the issues in Europe, all come together. And if we get resolution of all this, then I think we can return to the days when we see good, solid growth in our industry, and we'll see the margin expansion that we were talking about. But it is not a light switch that all of a sudden they just open up the floodgate. Because remember, this takes a while for people to get their plans together and for us to put -- to work with them in terms of how to spend their money.","Operator","We are now approaching 9:30.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jerome J. Leshne","Good morning. Thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com and will refer to both in the course of this call. This morning, we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks, to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 a.m. Eastern.","During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company. These are subject to uncertainties in the cautionary statement included in our earnings release and the slide presentation and further detailed in our 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.","At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.","Michael Isor Roth","Thank you, Jerry, and thank you for joining us this morning as we review our results for the quarter and 9 months year to date. As usual, I'll start out by covering the key highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional detail. I'll conclude with an update on our agencies, to be followed by Q&A.","Beginning with revenue, we're pleased to report a quarter of solid growth in most key world markets and across our top 20 clients. Our organic growth was 2.8% in Q3.","In the U.S., our growth was 3.7%, accelerating from the first half of the year, reflecting growth by McCann, Mediabrands and our PR agencies, as well as our digital capabilities across the portfolio. The leading client sectors helping to drive growth in the U.S. were auto and transportation, health care, consumer goods, food and beverage and financial services. It bears noting that given our strong portfolio of domestic public sector clients, U.S. organic growth was adversely affected by 100 basis points in the third quarter as a result of the government cutbacks.","In the Asia Pac region, organic growth was 11.3%, reflecting strength in most national markets including double-digit growth in Australia, India and China across a broad range of our agencies. Asia Pac, now our largest international region, grew to nearly 13% of our revenue base for the third quarter.","In the LatAm region as well, our agencies continued their strong performance with revenue up 8% organically in Q3. We've grown the market by approximately 50% organically over the past 3 years.","In the U.K., we decreased 9.3% organically, but last year's 25% Olympics-related growth was a particularly steep comparison. Underlying revenue growth remains solid. Excluding events, the U.K. grew 5.7%. It's worth noting that the Olympics revenue in Q3 '12 contributed over 1% to our total growth last year, making this year's overall Q3 comparison more challenging by that amount.","Against the context of growth in most major regions, Continental Europe remained the exception. As we have seen in the first half, our results continue to reflect the region's challenging economic conditions with revenue decreasing 5.9% in Q3.","During the third quarter, we continue to build on a strong new business record for the year. We added notable headline media assignments with Hershey's and Nationwide Financial. Our Lowe London office successfully defended its Morrisons assignment, and Draftfcb similarly retained the Kmart creative work in U.S. Both were important votes of confidence from valued clients, as was McCann's win of Pillsbury. Along with significant wins earlier in the year, this makes new business for the first 9 months of 2013 a highlight of our performance.","Turning to operating expenses and margin in the quarter. We were pleased to again record another quarter of disciplined expense management. Q3 operating margin grew by 40 basis points to 8.3% from 7.9% a year ago. The comparison includes the impact of Continental Europe, which weighed on our margin results for the quarter. Operating profit increased 7.7% to $142 million compared with $131 million in Q3 '12.","During Q3, we took another important step in our successful transformation to a simpler and lower cost capital structure. We redeemed our $600 million, 10% notes, which we had refinanced at a blended rate of 3.2%. And as you can see in our report this morning, we've already begun to realize significant interest savings from this transaction.","We also remain committed to our share repurchase program, buying in an additional 6.2 million shares using $100 million. Since initiating our return of capital programs in 2011, we've returned a total of $1.3 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and the repurchase of 94 million shares. And we've retired an additional 33 million diluted share equivalents through the redemption of convertible debt. We currently have $320 million remaining on our authorization.","Following the quarter earlier this month, we reinforced the conversion of our remaining $222 million of convertible preferred stock to 17 million common shares. The transaction eliminates the 12 million annual preferred dividends, and as the preferreds were already dilutive, there's no increase to our fully diluted share count.","In Q3, diluted earnings were $0.11 per share as reported and $0.17 per share excluding a charge for the early debt redemption. The latter result compared favorably to EPS of $0.15 a share a year ago.","For the 9 months, we are tracking against our targeted organic revenue range of 2% to 3% for the year. In terms of margins, both the macroeconomic conditions and our performance in Continental Europe have been more challenging than expected.","In addition, expenses for new business activity have also been significant, while revenue related to our wins is not fully reflected in 2013. We will continue to drive to our target of 50 basis points of margin expansion for the year. However, delivering such a result will depend on a very strong performance in the fourth quarter.","Furthermore, we are considering targeted year-end actions required to appropriately position the business for further operating margin expansion in 2014 and beyond. I will talk more about that in the Q&A.","At this stage, I'll turn things over to Frank for some additional color and join you after his remarks for an update on our agencies, the tone of the business and our outlook on the remainder of this year.","Frank Mergenthaler","Thank you, Michael. Good morning. As a reminder, I'll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast.","On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of results. Organic growth was 2.8%, which includes 3.7% in the U.S. and 1.6% internationally.","In the U.S., it's our fourth consecutive quarter of stronger growth. Our growth in Asia Pac and LatAm was terrific. Our revenue decreased 9.3% organically in the U.K., which was expected against last year's Olympic revenue in our events business. Excluding that business, organic growth in the market was approximately 5.7%. Continental Europe continued to be weighed down by the difficult regional economy.","Q3 operating profit was $142 million, and margin was 8.3%, an increase of 40 basis points from a year ago.","We had $1 billion of cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet at quarter end. As Michael mentioned earlier, we completed a very accretive call at 105 of our 10% notes. Our Q3 charge for the transaction was $0.06 per share net of","tax. Diluted EPS was $0.11 as reported and $0.17 excluding the debt redemption charge compared with $0.15 last year.","Turning to Slide 3. You'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. Here, it's worth noting the debt redemption charge of $45 million appears in our other income expense line below operations. It reflects the $30 million cash premium to redeem the 10%, $600 million notes and another $15 million of unamortized costs and discounts.","Turning to operations on Slide 4. Revenue was $1.7 billion in the quarter, an increase of 1.8%. Compared to Q3 2012, the impact of change in exchange rates was a negative 140 basis points, while net acquisitions and dispositions added 40 basis points. Resulting organic revenue increase was 2.8%.","As you can see on the bottom half of the slide, the organic increase at our Integrated Agency Network segment was 4%, reflecting balanced growth between the U.S. and international markets.","At our CMG segment, our organic decrease of 2% was due to last year's Olympics revenue spike in Q3. The very strong performance of our public relation agencies continued in the quarter, and our organic revenue growth at CMG was 6.4% for the 9 months.","Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., organic growth was 3.7%. This reflects growth in all our global networks, our media business, nearly all of our U.S. independents and the CMG group of marketing service specialists.","Continental Europe decreased 5.9% organically. By country, Germany increased in the quarter, while France, Italy, Spain and most other national markets decreased. The continent was 10% of our Q3 revenue. While we have done extensive work over the last few years to lower our expense base in Europe, this is an area we'll be evaluating in the coming months so as to ensure that we manage expenses with current revenue reality, thereby positioning ourselves for operating leverage when growth returns.","In Asia Pac, organic revenue growth was 11.3% in Q3. By market, our growth was led by strong increases in Australia, India and China. There are [ph] notable increase in our media business, as well as increases at McCann and our marketing service specialists.","In LatAm, Q3 organic revenue growth was 8% with contributions from many of our agencies including Lowe, Mediabrands and CMG across most of large national markets. Our Other Markets group increased 3.1% organically.","Moving on to Slide 6. We chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 1.8%, which is updated to include Q3 '13 and the roll-off of Q3 2012.","Moving on to Slide 7, our operating expenses. The sequential development of expenses from Q2 to Q3 remained well controlled. Total salaries and related expenses were $1.09 billion, a decrease of $27 million from the preceding quarter. Underneath that comparison, expenses for base salaries, employee benefits and payroll tax decreased $11 million from Q2. Severance expense for the quarter is 1.2% of revenues.","Total headcount at quarter end was 45,300, which is an increase of 1% from June 30. We added new talent to support our growth in LatAm, Asia Pac and in the U.S. for new business, as well as our higher-growth digital, marketing services and media disciplines.","Our expense for temporary labor was 3.8% of revenues. This is a bit higher than we would have liked due to the high level of pitch activity in the quarter.","Incentive expense was 2.2% of Q3 revenue, while other salaries and related category was 2.5% of revenue. It's worth noting that our ratio of total salaries and related expenses to revenue in Q3 was 64.3%, which is higher than last year due almost entirely to the higher level of pass-through revenue in our Olympics work a year ago. The effect on our operating leverage, however, is offset in our O&G expense ratio. We had very strong leverage in the quarter as lower pass-through revenue expenses had the opposite effect.","Turning to office and general expenses on the lower half of the slide. O&G expense was $465 million or 27.4% of Q3 revenue. Professional fees decreased sequentially, as did expenses for T&E, office supplies and telecom. Our occupancy expense was approximately flat with Q2 level. Our other O&G category increased from Q2 due to higher pass-through expenses but decreased from the third quarter of 2012.","On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 9.7%.","Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 9. We ended the quarter at $1 billion of cash and short-term marketable securities, which compares to $1.2 billion a year ago. The comparison reflects that we have returned over $540 million to shareholders over the last 12 months through share purchases and common stock dividends.","On Slide 10, we turn to cash flow for the quarter. Cash provided by operations was $161 million compared with the use of $104 million a year ago. Working capital was a source of $38 million compared with the use of $240 million in Q3 2012.","Our investing activities used $45 million for CapEx. Our financing activities used $730 million, primarily $600 million for the redemption of our 10% notes and $100 million for the repurchase of 6.2 million common shares at an average price of $16.11 per share. Our common stock dividend used $31 million.","Slide 11 charts our debt reduction over the past few years, beginning in 2007 with $2.3 billion. We had a short period of double carry following our debt raise last November to refinance 2 debt issues in 2013. That's reflected here on 12\/31\/2012. Following the redemption of our $600 million, 10% senior notes, however, our debt level was down to $1.7 billion as of September 30.","In summary, on Slide 12, we are pleased with our growth in most key world markets in Q3. We built on our 2013 new business record. Our expenses remain well controlled as a result of the investments we have made in analytics, tools and talent in this area. We continue to see developments in our capital structure that are value creating for shareholders. We eliminated a sizable piece of expensive debt, the call of the 10% notes. And the conversion of our convertible preferred frees up $11.6 million in annual dividends that were flowing to the preferred stockholders. Our balance sheet has never been in better shape. We are focused on continuing our top line momentum, managing through the challenges in Continental Europe and expanding margins.","Now let me turn it back over to Michael.","Michael Isor Roth","Thank you, Frank. The underlying strength of our agency brands is driving organic revenue growth. This reflects new assignments from existing clients, as well as net new business, which has been quite strong for us this year. We are new business positive for the year to date and trailing 12 months. Across the organization, the pipeline of opportunities continues to be solid, with the greatest need being for integrated and accountable solutions.","During the quarter, we saw contributions from McCann, Mediabrands, Lowe and across the CMG portfolio, particularly at Weber Shandwick and GolinHarris, which continue to win market share domestically and internationally. In fact, earlier this week, the Holmes Report named Interpublic as its first PR Holding Company of the Year.","At CMG, Jack Morton, Octagon and FutureBrand also remained on positive trajectories.","McCann Worldgroup is showing consistent success on the new business front, both in the U.S. and in a number of international markets. As important, its clients are consistently seeing the strengths of its best-in-class global integrated marketing services. Results from creative competitions also continue to show good progress with recent major wins at regional competitions in Asia and Central Europe.","At Draftfcb, we're already seeing new energy since Carter Murray came on board last month. Feedback from across the agency, including clients and staff, has been very positive. We started to see senior talent joining the organization, and we'll soon be reviewing the positioning of agency with the new team with an eye to developing a plan that sets the network up for a resurgence in 2014.","Lowe continues to build on its leadership position with its largest client, Unilever. The new alignment with Campbell Ewald in the U.S. is going well, and the joint agency leadership is already in the market, introducing the offering to search consultants. The SEAT win with Huge was an encouraging development that demonstrates the value of Lowe as a top creative network focused on key emerging markets, supplemented by a leading-edge digital partner.","Mediabrands continues to win business at both of its global networks while building its leadership in dynamic media landscape with offerings such as ORION Trading and Cadreon digital buying platform, which we have taken global in the past few years. Most recently, the MAGNA Consortium is a clear statement that we will be a leader in the fast-growth automated buying space. Clients value these innovations in today's increasingly complex media environment.","In emerging markets, our position remains strong. All 3 of our global networks have high-quality agencies in both India and Brazil. Mediabrands and CMG are also well represented, and we have recently bolstered their offerings through acquisitions.","We have one of the top multidiscipline groups in the Middle East and North Africa region, as well as a solid partner in Russia. In China, we continue to invest in talent and organically grow the business. In both the quarter and year to date, we've seen strong results in these key markets off of tough comps from the prior year.","With organic revenue growth of 2.4% through 9 months, we are tracking within our targeted revenue growth range of 2% to 3% for the year. In terms of margins, as you've heard this morning, the combination of performance in Continental Europe, which has been lower than expected due to the regional operating environment and increased investment to support new business wins, has made the first 9 months of the year more challenging than anticipated.","We will continue to drive to target our 50 basis points of margin expansion in 2013. However, delivering such a result will depend on a very strong performance in the fourth quarter. Performance against both our growth and profitability goals is essential to continuing to drive shareholder value. Accordingly, it is how we are measured and it has direct impact on our incentives. Accountability for delivering on our full year targets is therefore very much in place. We're seeing the teams across the organization are clear on that linkage of pay and performance.","Looking forward, it's good to know that this year's business performance is on solid footing. Growth in emerging regions has been strong. Relative to our peers, we are very competitively represented in these high-growth economies. So we should continue to enjoy the benefits of that element of our revenue mix.","We're seeing significant progress and success across the portfolio of our digital services. This is an area that's contributed very good growth year to date. We will stay focused on adding to our capabilities organically through hiring and training, as well as incubating and growing newer capabilities such as the multichannel automated media buying.","We'll also continue to support the growth of our digital specialist, R\/GA, MRM and Huge, on top of tactical digital M&A activity at our major global networks.","The transformation of our balance sheet to one that is both simpler and more economical has put us in a strong financial position. Only a few years ago, our total debt was $2.3 billion. Today, that's down to $1.7 billion. Previously, our debt included $800 million of convertible debt. Today, we have no converts. Our average cost of debt was 7% in 2009. Today, it's 4%. A few years ago, we also had a $525 million of convertible preferred stock senior to our common. Today, all of that is gone. And our total eligible diluted share count, which not long ago was $560 million, is down to $441 million, a decrease of over 20%.","All of this represents another powerful source of continued value creation for our shareholders. Above all, the ability to help clients manage in an increasingly complex consumer and media landscape represents our most significant opportunity. At a time of change and uncertainty in our industry, what we need to do is keep being committed to servicing our clients and the quality of our work. We've proven that we have sufficient scale and expertise to compete effectively in the media and digital arenas. But bigger doesn't mean better when it comes to creativity, consumer insight, client service or the integration of marketing disciplines. Those are all areas where our agencies excel and in which we have a full range of capabilities that position us well to create further shareholder value in the years to come.","Thank you. And I'll now open up the floor to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. First on the U.S. organic growth that you saw in the quarter. Could give us a bit more color in terms of maybe what verticals really saw pickup versus the previous quarters? And on the new business front impacting U.S. organic growth, I guess how much of a ramp of business you saw last year are you seeing now flow into it? And should that ramp further in the fourth quarter?","Michael Isor Roth","Thank you, Alexia. Well clearly, what you -- given the strength in auto and transportation, it's not a surprise to see how strong we were in the quarter on auto and transportation. Health care also was strong in the quarter. We were up actually 15.5%, as well as consumer goods, food and beverage. We had a slight dip in tech and telecom, but for the year, that's still positive. And financial services was slightly off in the quarter, but again, on a year-to-date basis, we were positive. The one area that we continue to have a bit of a drag is in retail. But across all sectors, we have very strong offerings, and obviously, we're quite pleased with the performance within the U.S. I made reference to the fact that we have a large business of government business, if you will. And we actually -- a lot has been written about impact of the shutdown. And so it was important for us to call that out. And we actually did have an impact in the quarter on our organic as a result of this shutdown. So I know we don't get to back that out, but if you look at the 100 basis points, then you see what our true performance and our strength in the U.S. is reflected. On the question of new business, we haven't seen the full impact of our business wins in 2013, which obviously bodes well for us in 2014. So we start seeing some of it in the third quarter. We'll see more of it in the fourth quarter. But the true impact of our new business wins is in 2014, and as Frank pointed out, we're seeing an impact of ramping up on the cost in our new business pitch expenses through the year.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then in the fourth quarter, should you see a bit of an impact then also in the government shutdown and in the Q4 numbers if you saw it in Q3? And I guess is there any sort of number you guys have internally where you need to get on organic revenue growth estimate in the U.S. to hit that margin target for the year?","Michael Isor Roth","Yes. Thanks, Alexia. Well obviously, when we -- I know it's difficult to understand when we say we expect -- we need a strong fourth quarter. I mean, the result of that is really -- gets to the core issue here, and that is what effect the Continental Europe is having on our results. To put it in context, Continental Europe is 10%, okay, which is not a large number. But the other side of it is it's still important enough. And given the scale that we have, frankly, the lack of scale we have in Continental Europe, changes in Continental Europe for us have an impact on our margin. If you would look to a year-to-date basis, if we were to have performed on the organic side similar to what we performed last year, so let's assume a 2% to 3% drop in organic instead of the rate that we see now, we would have had approximately a 50-basis-point improvement in margin. So Continental Europe is having an effect on our margin. So therefore, when you look at the fourth quarter, unless we see a turnaround in that in the fourth quarter, it's going to be hard for us to achieve those numbers. And that's why we put it in that context. But again, we are seeing positive things happening in the U.K. McCann is performing well, obviously, in the U.K. and in Europe. Gustavo and his team and all of them in the McCann are having good success with existing clients in Europe. So we're doing things to bolster that performance in Europe. And candidly, if you look at the way we've approached Europe in the past, our first line of defense is to right-size our expenses with our revenue, and that's the reference of the comment that we're going to take a look at year-end actions here. Clearly, we need to take a look at that in a very hard light in terms of what our expected revenue is. The other is talent and adding to our portfolio. You've seen us take action in Europe. For example, with Lowe, when we needed to bolster our performance of Lowe in the U.K., we've added an acquisition of Delaney Lund, and that's performing well for us. And therefore, Lowe has been better positioned in the U.K. So we're also looking at talent. And Draftfcb, for example, recruited Nigel Jones from Publicis to head up global strategy. So we're strengthening our offerings in Continental Europe, and we're really positioning ourselves both from the cost side and from the talent side and our offerings to better position ourselves in that marketplace, and that'll include some tactical acquisitions as well. So it is 10%, but we are doing the best we can in terms of rightsizing it, and hopefully, we'll see some turnaround in that market, and we should benefit from that.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Just my question about the government shutdown, that should be, again, a headwind in Q4 as well or do you see...","Michael Isor Roth","Again, we don't know -- you tell me what the government's going to do in the fourth quarter. But fourth quarter involves a lot of project business, and some of that business is project-based. So it's going to be hard for us to project that. But potentially, there's an impact of that in the fourth quarter as well.","Operator","Your next question is from John Janedis of UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Michael, can you dig a little bit deeper into Europe? Your organic growth has been lagging a little bit here. What do you attribute that to? Have you had any leadership changes in those markets? And do you potentially have more exposure to slower-growing disciplines in the region?","Michael Isor Roth","Again, it goes to my point that I answered before, and that is our scale, since it only reflects 10%, changes in our client spend has more material effect on us than, frankly, some of our competitors. And that's a function of our clients. Some clients are spending more than others, and small cutbacks have a more material impact with us. I don't think -- in fact, recently, if you look at how McCann is doing in Europe and the strength, particularly in auto, I think it bodes well for us in terms of our performance. So on the vertical side, I don't believe we have any weaknesses in terms of our competition. I think it really comes down to that our size of our business there is more subject to variations due to fluctuations in local markets and some global spend [ph].","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up to Alexia, how big is the government for you? I don't recall it being a huge number. And when exactly did you start to see it? Was that like a late Q2 event? Or what was the timing of that?","Michael Isor Roth","Yes. In the U.S., our global business, on a global basis, like a little bit over 3%. But in the U.S., it's about 3% as well. And we started seeing some cutback in the second quarter, but clearly in the third quarter, we saw that directly. And I think you have to look at not so much the shutdown, but I think sequestration had an impact on that. Government spending was cut across the board, as we all know, as a result of sequestration, and that had a direct impact on our businesses there. And I think we are probably a little bit overweighted on the government side of the business, which is a good thing, but during this period, it adversely affected us.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And maybe, Frank, one quick one for you. You touched on the pressure -- or some of the pressure on the SRS line. You've historically said that you need revenue to see leverage, as we know. Given all you've done, would it be fair to say you need maybe a somewhat more globally consistent number in key markets? And would that number be like a 3% number or greater to see the leverage?","Frank Mergenthaler","Yes, John, you're right. We do need revenue, and we need revenue growth. And the impact on our SRS, again, we can keep pointing to Europe, but with such decline in the top line, it distorts all of your key SRS ratios, which we're seeing in the consolidated numbers. So it's not just 3% growth. We need to see stabilization in some of these markets that have been kind of killing us.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just on the expense side then, you've kept them modest. Will there be any catch-up when the revenue accelerates in any market outside of Europe or you're good there?","Frank Mergenthaler","I think we're fine. And we're scrutinizing it. But again, I think we're positioned well once growth comes into markets to leverage it, with the exception of Europe. It's a down roughly 6%, through the 9 months. Our headcount's only down 2% or 3%. So we haven't been able to keep up with the decline. And Michael pointed out, we came into the year thinking a year similar to last year down 2% to 3%. Down 6.5% through 9 months is something we've got to address. When you look at kind of sequentially in the quarter, the first 2 months of the quarter were in line with expectations. September, which is 40% of our revenue in that market, was down 6%, 7%. So that gave us cause to say, \"Okay, let's look at the fourth quarter and see what actions we need to take,\" and gave rise to the comment that Michael made in his opening comments.","Operator","Our next question is from David Bank of RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So I think we're all struggling a little bit to extrapolate beyond what we're seeing right now because there are so many moving parts. And I guess I'll ask a hard question that I'm hoping will make things a little bit easier, which is, one of 2 things has to happen in Europe, right? Things will get better or you will make these targeted expense costs -- address targeted expense initiatives. So given that you will do something or something will happen and given the limited visibility and what we could see right now for the fourth quarter, and frankly, for the year, how do you help us think about what the potential is for margin expansion the following year when one of those 2 things will happen, right? There has to be kind of a target in your mind at this point because you're not going to do nothing. So what can we expect in the current macro for margin expansion next year?","Michael Isor Roth","Well, I think the most significant impact in the margin expansion opportunity for us is when we get the current business wins cycling through for a full year in 2014. And given the fact that we should be able to convert that revenue at a 30% conversion, then that will significantly add to our margin expansion, okay? Obviously, we will do our best by year end to position ourselves going into 2014 to right-size our course profile against Europe. So if you think that Europe will continue to be a drag, then whatever actions we take in the fourth quarter should be able to position us in 2014 to put us back on a margin expansion environment out there in terms of Continental Europe. So I think the way to look at it is the fourth quarter will be telling on our impact of Continental Europe, not only for the rest of this year but for 2014, and how we take actions, whether it be talent, whether it be acquisitions, whether it be cost reductions and repositioning, so that 2014, we go into with a clean basis from a cost versus revenue basis so that the impact of the wins, not only from our new business wins. One of the interesting facts is that if you look at our top 20 clients, we've had good growth for them both through the quarter and through -- year to date. So our existing client base continues to be a source of revenue growth for us, and we hope that to continue in 2014 as well. So one way of looking at it is absent the back door, which has always been a concern of mine, opening up, we're very well positioned for 2014. In the fourth quarter, we will -- hopefully, we'll continue to manage our business to achieve our targets, but we will also keep whatever actions that are necessary in 2013 in mind to make sure 2014 is a solid year for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Chesler of Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So Europe's gotten a lot of air time this morning, but I wanted to just shift a little bit, maybe relieve you a little bit to talk about 2 other important markets for you. One would be India, which, if I heard correctly, you've said actually had decent growth in the quarter, maybe even double-digit growth. I wanted to hear a little bit about that outlook, as well as Brazil. Your LatAm number was up nicely. Maybe not up as high as I sort of thought it would have been given kind of the noise around some of the funky comp issues you've had in the third quarter in recent years. So with 2 large global events coming up, kind of what -- you had some instability in that marketplace. What's your expectations for Latin America as well?","Michael Isor Roth","Well, we actually saw double-digit growth in Brazil, India and China, which all bode well. And remember, we had very strong comps in all of those regions. So we're very pleased with results, and we're very pleased with our offerings. In particular in India, we have very strong offerings in all 3 of our global networks and our media business and our PR business. We just did 2 transactions in India, one on the media side of the business, interactive on the digital side and on the PR side of the business with respect to Weber Shandwick. So India, it will continue to be a very strong market for us. We're showing very positive results. We know there are some issues in terms of the government and the economic environment, but the results for the quarter showed a very positive impact. Of course, Brazil, given what's happening in terms of the Olympics and the World Cup, we already have some assignments on the World Cup in tow that will be addressed and we have already started to work on. So we're excited about what's happening in Brazil. And there, too, our offerings at all of our global networks are strong, as well as our media businesses. So I think those 2 markets will continue to be a strong driver of growth and profitability for us. What I'm really pleased about was our results in China. We have double-digit growth in China, and that's one area that if you look at our relative size, we have work to go. We're committed to growing organically our business in China, and we're encouraged to see positive results in the media side of the business, as well as our global network. So I think all of those markets bode well for our performance into the future, and we're quite proud of our people in all of those regions.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just from the standpoint then of trying to model a realistic forecast into next year. I just want to make sure I understand the message you're trying to send about kind of overall growth for next year. One is U.S. starts to ramp, new business coming through. Not quite sure what happens with Europe. It remains pretty tough, but you think you're positioned for better growth. Are there any of these other markets or any other deceleration in the business that you think you would want to highlight or just kind of waiting for the new business to come through in Europe to recover while the others chug along?","Michael Isor Roth","Sure. Well, if you just look at Lowe, just won the SEAT business, that one will ramp up. It was a very nice piece of business for Lowe, and it showed its global and integrated offering. So that's encouraging. I think the expansion that we're seeing at McCann, as I've called out, in terms of both our existing client base there as well as new wins, that's going to happen or happened in McCann. And we're kicking off Draftfcb with a new management team that has some strong clients in Europe. So we're going to really position Draftfcb as well in those markets. So I think our offerings will be up to speed to be competitive in Continental Europe. And as far as the emerging markets, I've already said, I think that's encouraging. One market that's been very strong for us is Australia, and we've seen a great growth in that market. We have very solid media offerings, as well as global offerings, and we're pleased with what we're seeing there. Turkey will be a growth market for us. We have strong offerings there. And Africa will be -- we have very strong offerings there. So those markets, we're positioned. We're going to continue to invest in those other markets other than the BRIC markets. But overall -- and of course the U.S. Let's not forget the fact that 57% of our business is here in the United States. And our independent agencies are performing well, as well as our global network. So I think from a cross-section of the world, we're very well positioned. Russia is a market that we're looking closely at. We have a partner in Russia. We've always talked about taking some sort of equity position in Russia, and we continue to pursue that. I'm cautiously optimistic that we'll be able to do something in that front. So I'm very pleased with where we are in terms of positioning all our offerings. And frankly, I think absent changes in the macro environment, we're very -- we're well positioned to move into 2014 and get on the margin expansion track that we've committed ourselves to.","Operator","Our next question is from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Frank, maybe on the cost side, which we haven't talked a lot about this morning, incentives and temp labor for 4Q, I'm wondering if you could help us if Q3 is a good run rate for those 2 and whether you have any expectations for above-average severance? It sounds like you might.","Frank Mergenthaler","Yes. On the temp labor, Ben, we've always said 3.5% of revenue was a good number. We've been tracking above that. I think most of that is attributable to a very active new business in 2013, but it's an area that -- especially in the project concentration businesses for the fourth quarter we have to try and manage. And on severance, yes, I think you're going to expect -- you're going to see an increase in severance, especially around actions we're taking in Europe.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And incentive in that low 2s that you saw in Q3 makes sense or...","Frank Mergenthaler","Well, we've been between 3% and 4% of revenue for the past years. That's where we target people, but it's all predicated on our results for the year. As we perform versus our targets, to the extent we fall short of our targets, that's going to impact incentives.","Michael Isor Roth","One of the impacts of our incentives was we have a long-term incentive plan. And one of the important things is that we are, as Frank said, a pay-for-performance model in terms of our incentive. So since 2012, we had a slight miss in 2012 that impacted our long-term incentive, which accounted for some of the decrease in our incentives that you've seen year to date.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I see. And Michael, I know we've all been kind of dancing around this 2014 story. I think everyone feels so bullish about you guys. I mean, at the risk of wildly oversimplifying your business, which is certainly what we do for a living, unfortunately, I mean, when you look at the client win rosters and the fact that generally people think GDP is going to accelerate next year, I just -- I think I struggle or we all struggle with how next year is an acceleration of the top line margin expansion and the buybacks continue. Anything that throws you off that sort of very basic logic that we're not seeing?","Michael Isor Roth","No. I mean, the only thing that throws us off on that one will be the back door, which is why we're spending so much time with our existing clients. And I'm very pleased with how we've been performing. I don't want to give myself a jinx here. But no, I think you're spot on. I mean, the logic is there, and that, frankly, is our game plan. And that is to convert the new revenue, focus on our cost, continue to grow from our existing clients, which are top rate on a world-class basis, and keep our heads down and service our clients. And unless, of course, something happens in Washington, there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to do that.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And then lastly, just anything on talent opportunities as it relates to the Publicis, Omnicom merger, which actually hasn't come up on this call yet, amazingly? I'm just curious.","Michael Isor Roth","I couldn't believe I wasn't going to get through a call without commenting on that. Let me just say, you know what, we've had -- added a number of talent additions in our company, and they coincidentally happen to come from those particular companies. I don't -- I wouldn't say it's exactly related to the transaction. Frankly, some of them, we were talking to before the transaction. But whenever you have a transaction like that, there's going to be some disruption and uncertainty, and people are looking to see where they're going to end up in that repositioning of the assets there. So it's logical to assume that there'll be talented people in the marketplace that are looking for an environment where opportunities are there. And certainly, we have a reputation that's positive and in line of talented people joining us on a long-term basis. So I think we are going to see opportunities. We have seen a number of candidates that are already looking. And I think you just continue to look at the senior team that we're putting together, whether it be at Draftfcb or additions on our media side of business, and we view this as an opportunity.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Dix of Wedbush Securities.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Just a couple things. You've called out the pitch expense, which have led to a lot of new business, obviously, this year. Any way you can give us a little more quantification? I mean, Frank, you mentioned the impact on the temp line. But just any more color on how much incremental expense that's added this year versus last year just so we can understand that?","Frank Mergenthaler","James, for the 9 months it's about 20 basis points.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","20 basis points on revenue for the 9 months, okay, great. And then secondly, now that Publicis and Omnicom has been opened up for discussion, any implications you think that has on your appetite for acquisitions? And I'm thinking in particular just beyond your kind of repeated strategy to look selectively in emerging markets and new media. But acquisitions outside of that, any potential for those acquisitions to make a material contribution to your margin expansion?","Michael Isor Roth","Well, whatever transaction we do, we have it as a precursor to us doing the transaction as margin expansion, okay. So we don't make a habit of doing transactions that are dilutive, although once in a while we do that only because it's a talent transaction more than an acquisition. But yes, we will continue as we did in 2012 and '13, look at digital transactions. Obviously -- and I don't think this is as a result of the merger. This is as a result of where the marketplace is demanding our expertise to be in. And although we have -- we're very comfortable with our standalone digital agencies, as well as our embedded digital capabilities of all our agencies, if there's a digital agency out there that can add talent, as well as capabilities to us, we're very much interested in talking. And we, in fact, have a couple in our pipeline that hopefully will come to fruition, as well as the emerging markets. We've been very successful in adding to our capabilities. I already discussed India, and we did the same in Latin America, on all our disciplines, whether it be PR, media, as well as, for example, the McCann in terms of the Washington transaction. So we will continue to be in the marketplace, looking for acquisitions. Do I think there's a silver bullet out there where we -- that would all of a sudden put us in the same position as the merged companies are going to be? Highly unlikely, but you never know if it's out there. But our game plan continues to be use the same amount of money, whether it be $150 million, $200 million in acquisitions. And that's what we budget for. That's what we keep in mind as a target. If something unusual comes up, we will consider it. We always look at enhancing shareholder value. But in the meantime, organic growth, coupled with strategic and tactical transactions, the way we've done it in the past couple of years, continues to be our focus.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Great. Just one last thing. Then I'll let you move on. Just regionally, I mean, do you think your performance in Europe is making it maybe more important strategically to add some scale there through an acquisition or acquisitions than perhaps you thought going into the year?","Michael Isor Roth","Well, what we want to take a look at is our competitive positioning. And I think Lowe has done a good job in terms of looking at opportunities, as I said, on Delaney Lund, for example, is one. And McCann, obviously, is doing well. We've tactically added to McCann in terms of acquisitions, and we continue to look at ways to bolt on some talent in some of the markets. And Draftfcb, I have to say, there's is a wildcard out there, and that is how are we going to bolster Carter and his team to compete on a worldwide basis. And therefore, we're going to look at opportunities along those fronts. So I think those are the areas that we'll be focusing on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Just going back to Europe, I wanted to ask -- I don't know if you can dimensionalize this, but is there a way to characterize what margin improvement would have been year-over-year if you excluded Europe? Any color, obviously, would be helpful on that. And maybe it's related, maybe not. I thought it was interesting that BPN, the third network inside of Mediabrands, is expanding, brought -- that they have established an affiliate in the U.K. with the7stars, which is very well-regarded independent media agency. I was curious what the economics of that kind of relationship are and how that contributes to and improves margins when you establish those kinds of affiliate relationships.","Michael Isor Roth","Well, first of all, I think I already addressed the issue of margin. If you just looked at Continental Europe, if we looked at last year's 2% to 3% decline versus this year's, we'll figure about a 50-basis-point improvement in margin, okay? We're not going to give our total margin for Europe. I'm just giving you the delta. So that will give you a range and magnitude of the impact of Europe for us. In terms of strategic alliances versus acquisitions, we still look for it to be accretive. And frankly, it's either accretive or it's providing an asset that we don't have on our own and it's a cost-effective way for us to do it. We always like to grow things organically, but if it's quicker for us to either buy it or rent it, that's how we go about doing it. And that's what you're seeing with BPN. We're very pleased with the -- it just celebrated its 1-year anniversary, and it's performed well in the marketplace. It's expanded globally, and we're excited about the opportunities. And the transaction you referenced is just one more example of how they're looking to grow their own market share. And it gives us a very competitive third global network on the media side, which I think is important for us as we compete in the marketplace.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Would you characterize those -- if the BPN wins a global account, do you think that, that contributes to -- is it really high-margin revenue then that if they cede [ph] an account to the7stars in this case, let's say -- or maybe even just speak generally how -- what's the margin profile of the win?","Michael Isor Roth","Whenever you share a client, you're not about getting the same amount of margin as you would if you didn't. But it still has to be economic for us to do it. We're not in the business of providing margin to other people other than ourselves. So you can assume if we do those kind of transactions, it's beneficial for us. It may not be quite as positive on the margin side, but our goal would be for it to get to the margin levels that we will require.","Operator","Our next question is from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","It's not a new theme that you guys have been more active in the M&A market the past few years, but Michael, it sounds like maybe there was a little bit more vigor in perhaps repeating the performance of Delaney to address some scale issues in Europe. You mentioned the challenges in retail. That seems like an area that there are some interesting opportunities out there. And then just balanced against share buyback, I guess my question is on what sort of areas might you look at and then what that balance is looking into 2014?","Michael Isor Roth","Well, when we talk about share buybacks, we always build into the needs of our business internally, as well as excess cash and returning capital to our shareholders. And I think we've done a pretty good job of balancing that. So when we do our plans, if we talk about $150 million, $200 million of acquisitions, that builds into it, obviously keeping in mind our dividend and our share buyback program. I think shopper marketing, as you pointed out, is an important market for us. We've done a lot of work in that, particularly on the Mediabrands side of the business and our global networks. So those are markets that we see expansion and enhancing our capabilities. And in some markets, it may just a creative agency, like I said, that adds to our talent. And it wouldn't be a big transaction, but it's basically recognizing a leadership requirement in a market, and maybe it brings clients with them or maybe it doesn't. But we've done well with that in the past. So when we look at transactions like that, we look at retention of talent, as well as servicing our existing clients in the marketplace. And sometimes it's easier for us to do that transaction rather than go out and hire a whole bunch of people to do it. So I think what you're going to see from us is the same kind of acquisition environment that we've had in the past. And nothing is causing us to go out and do some unnatural act in terms of a transaction where we bet the ranch on in terms of getting a much bigger scale. As I indicated, we're very comfortable with our scale across all of our markets. And frankly, we're not lacking any particular discipline. So tactical and strategic transactions within our capital structure will be the norm for us.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Would you consider another -- you mentioned -- just to follow up on the Europe question specifically, you mentioned that's an area where you'd like to have a little bit more scale. Is that an area where, like you said, not going out of your wheelhouse, so to speak, but an area that you might focus on to address that as that market starts to recover?","Michael Isor Roth","Yes, I mean, absolutely. That's what's I was referring to. Again, I think there are opportunities there, but they have to fit within our parameters. And they have to be able to provide the economic returns that we're looking for. There's no sense of us doing another transaction in Europe that's going to be a drag on our margin. So those transactions are harder to come by than small little creative shops that are looking for a buyout. So it's a fine line we have to manage, but that's the lens we look at these things through.","Operator","At this time, there are no other questions.","Michael Isor Roth","Well, thank you very much for participating in the call. Obviously, it's interesting times for us. But rest assured, we know what we have to do in terms of enhancing shareholder value, and we will continue to do our best in achieving that. Thank you very much.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your phones at this time."]}}
