After this presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this \u2013 that it's (00:38) being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Bergstein, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Joseph P. Bergstein - Vice President-Investor Relations and Treasurer","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the PPL conference call on first quarter results and our general business outlook. We're providing slides of this presentation on our website at www.pplweb.com.","Any statements made in this presentation about future operating results or other future events are forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from such forward-looking statements. A discussion of factors that could cause actual results or events to differ is contained in the Appendix to this presentation and in the company's SEC filings.","We will refer to earnings from ongoing operations or ongoing earnings, a non-GAAP measure, on this call. For reconciliations to the GAAP measure, you should refer to the press release, which has been posted on our website and has been filed with the SEC.","At this time I'd to turn the call over to Bill Spence, PPL Chairman, President and CEO.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased that you've joined us this morning. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; and the Presidents of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses.","Moving to slide three, our agenda this morning starts with a discussion of our 2016 ongoing earnings forecast, an overview of our first quarter 2016 earnings results, and an operational overview. Following my remarks, Robert Symons, Chief Executive of our Western Power Distribution subsidiary, will provide an update on expected U.K. incentive revenues for 2017 and 2018, which we are increasing today. And Robert will also provide a general update on the completion of our first year under RIIO-ED1. Vince will then review our segment financials and provide a more detailed financial overview.","Let's move to slide four for a discussion of our 2016 earnings forecast. As we note on this slide, we're reaffirming our 2016 forecast of $2.25 to $2.45 per share. The midpoint of this range, $2.35 per share, represents growth of 6.3% compared to 2015 earnings from ongoing operations. Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations, and we remain on track to deliver on this forecast despite the warmer-than-normal weather we experienced across our service territories to start this year.","The significant investments we continue to make to build tomorrow's energy infrastructure, coupled with our ability to begin recovering more than 80% of that investment in near real time, will drive our long-term sustainable growth. We expect to achieve compound annual EPS growth through 2018 of 5% to 6% off of our adjusted 2014 earnings from ongoing operations of $2.03 per share. We continue to expect strong EPS growth of 11% to 13% through 2018 from our U.S. operations, with 1% to 3% growth expected in the U.K.","Turning to slide five. Today we announced first quarter 2016 reported earnings of $0.71 per share, compared with $0.96 per share from our first quarter 2015 results. Adjusting for special items, first quarter 2016 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.67 per share, compared with $0.77 per share a year ago.","As expected, we saw a decline in earnings from ongoing operations in the first quarter as a result of lower earnings in the U.K. This stemmed from lower revenues due to the new price control period that began on April 1 of 2015. Higher domestic margins from rate increases at our Kentucky and Pennsylvania businesses were partially offset by lower sales volumes due to milder winter weather.","Vince will go into greater detail on first quarter results a little later in the call, including a discussion of the timing of our U.K. earnings. As Vince will discuss, we did expect variability between quarters, with increased earnings weighted towards the back half of this year.","Now let's move to slide six for an update on our utility operations. This month, PPL Electric Utilities energized its Northeast Pocono transmission line a year ahead of schedule. The project includes 60 miles of new transmission lines, three new substations and additional improvements focused on making the grid more reliable, resilient and secure. We're confident this line will deliver significant benefits for our customers.","Completing major transmission project like this one, or like the Susquehanna-Roseland line we completed last spring, takes expertise in construction and project management. It also requires working closely with the public and coordinating with various permitting agencies. We've shown our ability to excel in these areas and deliver successful outcomes for our customers and our share owners.","Turning to Kentucky, Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities continue to invest in environmental upgrades at existing generation facilities, while strengthening the diversity of our generation fleet. In late January, we filed environmental compliance and cost recovery plans with the Kentucky Public Service Commission, seeking approval and environmental cost recovery for $1 billion in upcoming environmental improvement projects. These projects are largely aimed at ensuring compliance with the EPA's new Coal Combustion Residuals rule, which took effect the last year.","The projects will involve capping and closing remaining ash ponds at our coal-fired power plants, building process water facilities and completing the second phase of a dry storage landfill project at our E.W. Brown generating station.","The application review process before the Kentucky Public Service Commission is proceeding as we would expect. We expect to begin investments in these environmental improvements in the second half of 2016, and those will continue through 2023.","In addition, we're on track to complete the final baghouse installation at our Mill Creek generating station by June. This follows previous installations of baghouses at our Trimble County and E.W. Brown generating stations.","We also expect to complete Kentucky's largest solar facility in June. The 10-megawatt facility under construction at our E.W. Brown generating facility represents a cost-effective way to expand the benefits of solar to all customers. While portions of the project continue, we began generating our first solar power from the facility on April 14.","Moving to the U.K., we continue to achieve strong performance against our RIIO-ED1 incentive targets, and Robert will now discuss that in more detail. Robert?","Robert A. Symons - Chief Executive Officer, Western Power Distribution, PPL Corp.","Many thanks, Bill, and good morning.","Moving to slide seven. March 31, 2016 marked the end of the first full regulatory year under RIIO-ED1, and we are pleased to be providing an update on our full year performance against the RIIO-ED1 incentive targets.","Before I go into the details, I would like to review a few key points of the incentive framework. The primary incentive mechanisms that contribute to incentive revenues include the interruption incentive schemes and the Broad Measure of Customer Satisfaction. Interruption incentive schemes include Customer Interruptions and Customer Minutes Lost.","The broad measure of Customer Satisfaction measures the performance of customer satisfaction on a scale from one to 10 against the targets Ofgem has established with customers experiencing interruptions, requesting a connection, or making a general inquiry. Both of these incentive mechanisms are designed to encourage DNOs to invest and operate their networks so as to reduce both the frequency and duration of power outages.","Turning to slide eight. On this slide, you will find our full year results against the performance targets set by Ofgem for regulatory year 2015 to 2016. WPD has improved Customer Minutes Lost and Customer Interruptions performance metrics by approximately 8% over the 2014 throughout 2015 regulatory year, which resulted in earning 77% of the maximum potential payout.","This year, our operational efforts contributing to this success included several major asset replacement projects, significant rural network automation, and outperforming previous years' reliability performance. As it relates to broad measure of customer satisfaction, WPD has also received reaccreditation to the U.K. government-sponsored customer service excellence standard and has once again achieved the highest level of compliance, which further demonstrates our continued commitment to excellent customer service.","As shown back on slide seven and based on our better-than-expected performance on the quality of service and customer satisfaction, we now expect to achieve $115 million in total incentive revenue in calendar year 2017, above our prior range of $90 million to $110 million for 2017. As a reminder, these incentive revenues, while earned during the 2015 to 2016 regulatory year, will be received in the 2017\/2018 regulatory year. These amounts are internal estimates until final determination is received from Ofgem in November 2016.","We expect these favorable results to continue into the next regulatory year. Even with targets that get progressively tougher, we are increasing our guidance range from $75 million to $105 million in incentive revenues in calendar year 2018, to $85 million to $115 million.","Overall, the first year of RIIO-ED1 is broadly in line with our published business plan as accepted by Ofgem. We are focused on delivering excellent customer service, achieving the outputs and incentives while delivering safe, reliable and sustainable network service. We've been also recognized by Ofgem for our innovative work on providing quicker and alternative network connections for solar, and we continue to hold stakeholder workshops reviewing our results from the first year of RIIO-ED1, while planning for the future by discussing long-term strategic priorities, such as reporting smart networks and affordability.","Vince will now walk you through a more detailed look at segment earnings. Vince?","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Robert. And good morning, everyone.","Let's move to slide 10. Our first quarter regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations decreased from last year, driven primarily by expected lower U.K. Regulated segment earnings as a result of the April 1, 2015 price decrease, as we began our first year under the RIIO-ED1 framework and the effects of foreign currency, offset by an improvement in the Pennsylvania Regulated segment. While the Kentucky Regulated segment and Corporate and Other remained flat compared to a year ago.","Let's briefly discuss domestic weather for the first quarter compared to last year and compared to plan. Mild temperatures during the first quarter of 2016 had an unfavorable impact for our domestic segment, a total of $0.04 compared to the prior year, with $0.02 in Pennsylvania and $0.02 in Kentucky. Compared to our plan, weather had a negative $0.02 impact, with a $0.01 impact in each of the domestic segments.","Heating degree days were about 11% lower than normal in the first quarter 2016 for both Kentucky and Pennsylvania. While weather in the U.K. was also unfavorable to plan and the prior year, with Q1 being the mildest winter in recorded history for the U.K., it was not a primary driver of our results for the U.K. segment. And as Bill mentioned in his remarks, despite this unfavorable weather for Q1, we remain confident that we will continue to meet our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.45 per share.","Let's move to a more detailed review of the first quarter segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on slide 11. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.14 per share in the first quarter of 2016, a $0.01 increase compared to the same period last year. This increase was due to higher distribution margins as a result of the 2015 rate case that became effective January 1, 2016, and higher transmission margins due to additional capital investments, partially offset by lower volumes due to unfavorable weather. Higher margins were partially offset by higher O&M, primarily due to higher support costs and maintenance related work, mostly attributable to timing.","Moving to slide 12. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the first quarter of 2016, flat compared to a year ago. This result was due to lower O&M, primarily due to the closure of the Cane Run and Green River coal stations in 2015, offset by higher financing costs due to higher debt balances to fund CapEx. Higher gross margins from higher base rates that went into effect July 1 of last year were offset by lower sales volumes, primarily due to the less favorable weather.","Turning to slide 13. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.39 per share in the first quarter 2016, an $0.11 decrease compared to last year, primarily driven by lower prices in RIIO-ED1 and the effects of foreign currency. In our plan, we had expected about a $0.10 decrease year-over-year for Q1, so the actual results are consistent with our expectations. I'll provide additional details on the shape of our 2016 U.K. earnings forecast after I walk through the quarter compared to last quarter's results.","The quarter-on-quarter decrease was due to lower gross margins resulting from lower prices as we transitioned to RIIO-ED1 on April 1, 2015 of about $0.08 per share, and unfavorable effects of foreign currency of about $0.03 per share, which included some 2016 restrikes executed during the quarter to hedge 2018 earnings. The other variances for the U.K. were not significant and offset each other.","So taking a closer look at our full year U.K. segment forecast. As noted on our year-end earnings call and the 2016 ongoing earnings update that Bill just provided, we are projecting a $0.01 decrease in U.K. segment earnings year-over-year. However, there is significant variability between the quarters with lower earnings in Q1 and Q2 and higher earnings in Q3 and Q4.","We expect lower margins in the first half of the year as a result of the RIIO-ED1 revenue reset. That revenue reset occurred at the beginning of the regulatory year on April 1, 2015. And since we report WPD on a one-month lag, we will still see some effect of that revenue reset continue into the second quarter, an additional $0.02 per share above the $0.08 for Q1.","This decrease is expected to be primarily offset by the price increase beginning April 1, 2016 and allowed revenues under the RIIO-ED1 framework, and from the recovery of prior customer rebates beginning April 1, 2016 through March 31, 2017, which will positively impact 2016 earnings by about $0.05. We also expect this revenue recovery to positively affect 2017 earnings by another $0.02 to $0.03.","In addition, we are projecting lower O&M expenses in the back half of the year, primarily related to higher vegetation management in Q4 of last year and lower expected pension expense in 2016. All of these factors contribute to the shaping of our earnings for the U.K. this year compared to last year.","Moving to slide 14. On this slide, we provide an update to our GBP hedging status for 2016, 2017 and 2018, including sensitivities for a $0.05, $0.10 and $0.15 downward movement in the exchange rate compared to our budgeted rate of $1.60 on open positions. First, we are 93% hedged for the remainder of 2016 at an average rate of $1.54.","For 2017, we're still hedged at 89% at an average rate of $1.58. And for 2018, we've continued to layer on hedges during the quarter and have increased our hedge percentage from 20% at year-end to 41% today, at an average rate of $1.56. You can see from the sensitivity table that there's minimal exposure in 2016 and 2017, and about $0.03 of exposure in 2018 for every $0.05 below our budgeted rate of $1.60.","As I mentioned during our year-end call, our business plan provided enough capacity to hedge about 50% of our 2018 U.K. earnings exposure through restrikes. However, at this point, we will refrain from adding additional 2018 hedges until after the U.K. referendum vote on June 23.","Moving to slide 15. On this slide, we are providing an update on RPI. Now that 2015\/2016 regulatory year has concluded, the final RPI rate was 1.1% and was based on the Office of National Statistics' average RPI index from April 2015 through March 2016.","If you recall, in the third quarter of 2015, we had incorporated a 1.3% RPI rate in our 2015\/2016 planning assumptions, compared to the 2.6% included in our tariffs. That true-up will flow through allowed revenues in 2017 and 2018, and has already been incorporated in our earnings growth projections. The additional downside from our budgeted 1.3% rate will not have a material impact on earnings in either 2017 or 2018.","Our planning assumptions for 2016\/2017, 2017\/2018 and 2018\/2019 have not changed since our year-end update. And as you can see, the current forecast from the HM Treasury for all periods are in line with our current assumption.","That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thank you, Vince. And thanks for everyone's participation on today's call. I'd like to first summarize by saying that we remain confident in where we're headed. We're solidly on track to deliver on our earnings forecast for 2016, and we expect to deliver compound annual EPS growth of 5% to 6% through 2018.","We're pleased the WPD team has had such a successful first year under RIIO-ED1, and have outperformed incentive expectations. As Robert mentioned earlier, we are raising our expectation for incentive revenues from $90 million to $110 million, to $115 million for 2017, and from $75 million to $105 million, to $85 million to $115 million for 2018. This level of performance is consistent with WPD's long history of operational excellence.","Across all of our businesses, we continue to invest in tomorrow's energy infrastructure, the strength and the diversity of our generation fleet, and to drive continuous improvements aimed at exceeding customer expectations and delivering power safely, reliably and affordably. And as I stated in my recent message to shareowners in the annual report, I am convinced that our best days are ahead, and I'm very excited about our future.","With that, operator, let's open the call to questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question will come from Paul Zimbardo of UBS. Please go ahead.","Paul A. Zimbardo - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Paul.","Paul A. Zimbardo - UBS Securities LLC","First, I just wanted to confirm that the U.K. environmental spending you discussed on the prepared remarks is included in the CapEx plan?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","In the CapEx plan that we have for U.K., there's very little that I would classify as environmental spending. You may be referring, perhaps, to the...","Paul A. Zimbardo - UBS Securities LLC","Sorry, that's KU. Kentucky.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah. So, within Kentucky Utilities, yes. The environmental spending for the plans, as articulated, really deal with the match rule (22:25) and a lot of the combustion ash disposal costs that we need to incur. It does not include any Clean Power Plan CapEx spending, which would be incremental, should that come back into play. But with the stay at the Supreme Court level of the CPP, we're not anticipating to update the capital at this time.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","But the billion that we filed is in the plan.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Paul A. Zimbardo - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then, turning to Compass, could you give a brief update on kind of the initial segment? And then, with respect to future segments, should we expect the in-service on those is ahead of this one with 2023, or longer dated?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. I'll ask Greg Dudkin, President of our Electric Utilities Group in Pennsylvania to address that.","Gregory N. Dudkin - President & Director, PPL Electric Utilities Corp.","Yeah. So where we are in Compass, we put together an interconnection request for the New York ISO on the 95-mile segment, I guess we call it mini Compass. So what we're waiting for is for the ISO to come back with an approval that all the specifications and reliability impact is positive and then we proceed with what's called an Article 7 (23:46) which is a siding application, basically. So that's where we are there. We're still, for that portion, at 2021 to 2023 timeframe. We're continuing to look at the other components of Compass. And at this point, it wouldn't be before 2021 or 2023, it would be during that time or maybe a little after.","Paul A. Zimbardo - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","William H.

We do have \u2013 as far as you can tell, operator, the lines are all open and available for questions, correct?","Operator","Yes. That is correct.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. I just wanted to verify.","Operator","Okay.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well, since there are no further questions, we'll assume that everything was crystal clear, and that we look forward to the second quarter earnings call. So thanks for joining us today on the call.

As is our normal practice, joining me on today's call is Paul Farr, PPL's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as well as the presidents of our 4 business segments. Following my overview remarks on earnings and operations, Paul will review the financial results in more detail.","Today, we're reporting strong earnings for both the second quarter and through the first 6 months of the year. Our quarter-to-date and year-to-date earnings from ongoing operations were driven by strong performance from our regulated utility businesses in Kentucky, Pennsylvania and United Kingdom.","Turning to Slide 4. Second quarter reported earnings per share were $0.63, up from $0.46 in the same quarter of 2012. Earnings from ongoing operations for the quarter were $0.49 per share compared with $0.51 per share in the same period last year. Earnings from ongoing operations on a per-share basis are slightly lower than 1 year ago because of the accelerated share recognition of the 2010 and 2011 equity units. That's a topic we discussed in detail on our last quarterly call.","For the first year -- half of the year, our reported earnings were $1.28 per share compared with $1.39 per share in the first 6 months of 2012. Ongoing earnings were $1.20 per share for the first half of the year versus $1.21 per share last year.","Our strong performance has enabled us to increase the midpoint of our 2013 ongoing earnings forecast to $2.32 per share from the previous midpoint of $2.27 per share.","On Slide 5, we provided updated forecasts for each of our segments. Specifically, we're increasing the earnings forecast from our U.K. Regulated segment to $1.28 per share based on its strong performance year-to-date. We're slightly decreasing the Supply segment forecast to $0.34 per share due to various items, including outage schedules for some of the generating stations.","Let's move to Slide 6 for a brief operational overview.","As we explained on our July 1 analyst call, WPD has submitted 8-year business plans for our 4 electric distribution networks in England and Wales as part of the RIIO process. In this process, we're expecting fast-track treatment, which would provide us a number of benefits, including early certainty regarding the outcome and additional revenue equivalent to 2.5% of total annual baseline expenditures. The regulator, Ofgem, plans to make an initial determination on which companies could be fast tracked in November. It is scheduled to publish a final determination on the fast-track companies in March of 2014. You can follow developments regarding this process on the Investors section of our website.","In an important development in Pennsylvania, the state public utility commission approved PPL Electric Utilities' request for accelerated recovery of certain distribution system reliability improvements. The Pennsylvania PUC had approved the company's 5-year $700 million long-term infrastructure improvement plan in January. The cost recovery mechanism will be adjusted quarterly, providing more timely recovery of necessary system improvement expenditures.","Construction work is continuing on Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line. We expect to complete the line and be in service by the summer of 2015.","Also on the Pennsylvania transmission front, we're increasing our capital spending plan for our Northeast\/Pocono Reliability project. The increased cost is primarily related to higher material and labor cost and additional scope due to revised construction standards.","Moving to Slide 7. You'll see that weather-normalized second quarter sales in Pennsylvania increased by about 1.5% over the same period 1 year ago. The Pennsylvania increase was driven by a 4.5% increase in industrial sales due to increased activity and customer billing adjustments from the first quarter. Commercial sales in Pennsylvania were flat in the second quarter, and residential sales increased by 1.3%.","In Kentucky, weather-normalized industrial sales were up 2.8% because of industrial customer expansions and increased production levels at certain of our customers' facilities. There were decreases, however, of 3.8% in the residential category and 5.5% among commercial customers, influenced by regional economic conditions. On a 12-month trailing basis, weather-normalized sales are up about 0.5% in Kentucky and down just slightly in Pennsylvania.","Turning to Slide 8. We've completed outages on both units at the Susquehanna plant as we address turbine issues that have affected plant operations over the past 2 years. The units are currently running at normal levels, and we continue to monitor and evaluate the turbine performance data since our outages were completed. We have not observed any blade cracking thus far.","Turning to the Western fleet. As you may have seen, we issued an 8-K in July providing information on repairs that we're making to the Colstrip 4 generator in Montana. While we expect repairs to take at least 6 months, the estimated total pretax economic impact is between $5 million and $10 million and will not be material to the company.","In summary, we're pleased with our year-to-date results and feel good about our ability to deliver strong results for the full year. We're effectively managing major construction projects in Kentucky and Pennsylvania and have completed the Rainbow hydroelectric expansion project in Montana. We have submitted excellent 8-year business plans in the U.K. with the goal of receiving fast-track treatment under RIIO. And we're continuing to earn very high marks for customer service. In the past quarter, our competitive energy supplier, PPL EnergyPlus, and our Pennsylvania delivery company each earned J.D. Power awards for customer satisfaction. In total, PPL companies in Pennsylvania and Kentucky have earned 36 J.D. Power awards, far more than any other company in our sector. And our U.K. electric distribution networks hold 4 of the top 5 rankings in the country for quality of customer service.","Our proven ability to execute on our plans and deliver superior service to our customers gives us every reason to be optimistic about our prospects for growing value for our shareowners.","I look forward to your questions, and now I'm going to turn the call over to Paul Farr. Paul?","Paul A. Farr","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone.","Let's move to Slide 9. PPL's second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased over last year, driven by improved earnings at all 3 regulated segments. The Supply segment experienced an earnings decline, as expected, primarily due to lower hedged wholesale power prices.","Per-share earnings from ongoing operations declined slightly in the second quarter due to more than 80 million additional shares being included in our share count year-over-year, which equated to an impact of $0.04 per share for the period. On the first quarter call, we discussed at length the change to if-converted accounting for the shares to be issued under the convert securities.","Let's start the segment review with Kentucky results on Slide 10. Kentucky earned $0.08 per share in the second quarter, a $0.01 increase compared to last year. This increase was driven primarily by higher margins due to new base rates that went into effect January 1 of this year, partially offset by lower volumes driven by more temperate weather this year.","Moving to Slide 11. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.35 per share in the second quarter, a $0.04 increase over last year. This increase was due to higher utility revenues primarily driven by the April 1, 2013, price increase and higher volumes due to weather. These positive earnings drivers were partially offset by higher depreciation, higher income taxes and other expense, which was primarily driven by exchange rates, and dilution of $0.03 per share.","Turning to Slide 12. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.07 per share in the quarter, a $0.02 increase compared to last year. This increase was the result of higher delivery margins primarily due to new rates that went into effect January 1 this year and increased transmission investment, lower O&M and dilution of $0.01 per share.","Moving now to Slide 13. Our Supply segment earned $0.01 per share in the second quarter, a decrease of $0.07 compared to last year. This decrease was primarily the net result of lower Eastern energy margins driven by lower baseload energy prices, partially offset by higher capacity prices and increased baseload unit availability, lower Western energy margins primarily due to lower wholesale energy prices and higher depreciation. These negative drivers were partially offset by lower O&M at Susquehanna and lower outage costs at the Eastern fossil and hydroelectric plants.","That completes the more detailed financial overview, and I'll now turn the call back over to Bill for the Q&A period.","William H. Spence","Okay, operator, we're ready for the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Eggers at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First question. The -- when I look at the weather-normalized load trends, obviously there were some signs of good and not so good in the second quarter, but the year trends are not as bad as we've seen elsewhere. When you guys kind of dig further into the data and you look at usage trends, are you seeing kind of structural improvements once you kind of parse away weather issues? And where do you see bright spots and concerns right now?","Paul A. Farr","Sure. I would say, Dan, overall it's a slightly better situation than we've seen probably seen over the last few years. So there is some improvement when you parse through all the data. Having said that, I think our long-term view is still that, that growth would be somewhat less than 1% on a longer-term run rate based on some of the energy efficiency programs that are out there and just customer usage as we've seen it through the past cycles over the past 5 years. So I can ask the folks to comment more specifically and maybe provide a little bit more color. But Vic, why don't you talk a little bit about Kentucky and what you're seeing there?","Victor A. Staffieri","Well, our industrial load continues to grow and reinvestment is being made. So we have -- and as you can tell from the statistics, our industrial load is growing nicely. Where we're seeing some issues is in the commercial side, which really is being affected by the economy. And I do think there are some efficiency gains in our residential customers. But I have to tell you that our housing starts were up materially, year-over-year '11. Total of '11 was about 16%, and year-to-date, we're probably 18% higher than we were last year. So we're starting to see a little bit of momentum now probably driven by our unemployment, which is down. So I think, by and large, we are okay. It's not robust, but I think we're moving smartly ahead and driven by our industrial load, frankly.","Paul A. Farr","Craig?","Craig Hart","Yes, so in Pennsylvania, I would say that year-to-year, this year compared to last year, we'll probably be almost flat. And then our long term, we're looking at about 0.5% CAGR. So we don't see too much of a big opportunity for load growth in our area. What we're seeing by rate class is that we're starting to see some growth in the residential market. I believe that's due to starting Construction, kind of like what Vic said. Our small C&I has been relatively flat, and the large C&I is down year-to-year about 1%.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And...","Victor A. Staffieri","Yes.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess just can we get to maybe, Bill, turn the conversation to Supply. With power prices down again this quarter with RPM results pretty disappointing out in '16 and '17, are you guys rethinking where you expect trough to come out from an earnings perspective on Supply? And kind of where you think that business is going to bottom out given what you know today?","William H. Spence","Well, our focus remains as it has been, which is to maintain a slightly positive to flat earnings profile for the Supply business, meaning not -- the target is to not allow to go negative from an EPS perspective. That has not changed. We certainly understand the challenges the competitive generation sector faces and the expectations on declining profitability. Because of the strong growth in the utility businesses, we're obviously able to offset a lot of the declines that we've seen in the supply, and we still believe that the 2014, '15 time period is likely to be the trough, assuming that market conditions don't worsen. The management team, as you know, has had a clear track record, in our view, of insightful analysis of the -- those challenges, and we've taken decisive actions to create and defend shareowner value over the years. We do think there's inherent value in the Supply business, and we're very focused on our shareholders getting the benefit of that value.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And I guess one last question just kind of on the U.K. tax rates coming back in. Is there -- with this court decision, is there any more structure where it's going to run at a lower repatriated rate than would have expected? Or is this kind of unique to the period and will catch up?","Paul A. Farr","Are you referencing the windfall profits tax, Dan?","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes.","Paul A. Farr","Yes. No, that's a -- it came through as a special item of credit in the period and has no effect on ongoing repatriated tax expense.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kit Konolige at BGC.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Just to follow up a little at the Supply business. I wonder if you could give us some color on what your guys thought of the capacity auction in May. What they saw as drivers there, if there are any structural things that you'd like to see changed, et cetera.","William H. Spence","Sure. I'll comment first and then -- and ask Dave DeCampli to provide a little bit more color. Overall, it came out a little lower than we had expected. If you'll recall on our last earnings call, we indicated that we expected it to come in slightly lower than the previous auction. It came in a little lower than that. So fundamentally, pretty much in line with our expectations, again just a little bit lower. As we've kind of parsed through the results from the last auction, Dave probably has some comments he'd like to make on what our insights were there. Dave?","David G. DeCampli","Yes, thanks, Bill. Can I -- I'd say that in the end, when we look back, we'd say the pricing that came out of the auction was rational given flat demand growth and increases in supply from both imports and new generation that were a little bit of a surprise. And going forward, it's just difficult for us to model since we have such limited transparency in this process with issues like the imports without firm transmission and moreover [ph] seeming to continually be changing. So anything -- absent anything else to move capacity prices, we expect they may be somewhere in the same general area the next auction around. We'd like to see some progress in PJM's intent or plans to reform their limits and speculative arbitrage between the BRA and the incremental auctions as well. So we're hoping and supporting in the stakeholder process some of these changes as we go forward.","William H. Spence","Okay, Thanks, Dave.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And one other question on the RIIO process. It sounds like you're expecting that all 4 of your units would get fast-track treatment. Is that a fair read of your comments? Or would you not want to go that far?","William H. Spence","No, I think that's correct, Kit. When we look at the performances of those businesses in the U.K., they're clearly the superior performers in that structure. And we think if anyone deserves to be fast tracked, it would be our 4 distribution companies.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Chin at Merrill Lynch.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A follow-up question on the fast track. For the Draft Determination in November, how final is this determination? Is there any sort of precedent for Ofgem changing its view from draft to final in prior deliberations? And in the event we don't get fast-track status in the draft versions, what processes can we follow to help change that draft view towards a better finalized view?","William H. Spence","Sure. I'll ask Rick Klingensmith, President of our Global Business, to respond to that question.","Rick L. Klingensmith","The initial determination that Ofgem will make in the November time frame in identifying the potential companies that could be fast tracked is one that they will then follow through with that process so that if you do not make the list of a potential to be fast tracked in that November consultation, then there is not a chance for you to revise your business plan and then try to influence Ofgem in a, way to get your company on that list to be fast tracked. So they will identify those business plans that they believe are well justified and will continue through their evaluations till the March time frame, where they will then either accept all the companies that they had initially determined could be fast tracked or even narrow that list down a bit when their final determination comes out in March.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Understood, very clear. And then if I could just ask one separate question on Supply. We've seen some of your peers talk about how the ARR and FTR issues, how pricing of that has been dislocated from real-time congestion issues. Are you guys seeing any similar issues this year on ARR and FTR dislocations versus congestion?","William H. Spence","Dave, why don't you take that question?","David G. DeCampli","Sure. We've seen that approaching, Brian. And from a kind of a strategy point of view, we've significantly reduced our utilization of FTRs as a hedge because of the lack of any real resolution around the whole underfunding issue that's going on with those. So we backed all that into our plan. And for us, that's all delivering in accordance to plan this year. So it's disappointing, and we certainly hope that PJM would come up with a suitable solution so we can resume in earnest these -- the use of these tools as an effective way to mitigate basis risk.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Patterson at Glenrock.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just some quick things. First of all, I'm sorry, I missed in Kentucky what the environmental -- I'm sorry, the economic conditions were that led to the decrease in commercial and residential.","William H. Spence","Go ahead, Vic.","Victor A. Staffieri","This is Vic Staffieri. We have -- it's just the natural economy. We have not seen a comeback in our commercial. An offsetting impact of some efficiency gains in our hospitals and educational institutions. So that's where we're seeing some of the runoff in our commercial. And I'll tell you it's really pure economics, and I think there are some efficiencies going on in the commercial sector. We have gotten, as I said before, progress in our industrial sector. We are getting reinvestment by Toyota, by Ford, by General Electric, and that is helping our employment picture. And it should spill over eventually to our residential and, ultimately, our commercial customers, but it's going to take some time.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So it sounds like it's pretty good. It just sounds like, for some reason, we are just seeing decreases in that area that are sort of because they get efficiencies. Is that the way to think about it?","Victor A. Staffieri","I would say there's a lot of efficiency going on. When you look at our largest commercial customers, they are doing a pretty good job in getting more efficient and making the investments that make sense. You can see it in our hospitals, as I say. You see it in some of our educational institutions. And then, of course, you're seeing the economic impact spending, retail spending, on some of the malls and those kind of commercial customers. But Kentucky's economy never really busted and never really boomed. And so we've been steady as you go. Housing starts, as I indicated earlier, are up. They've been up for 2 years now after a real period of low. So I have some reason -- some cautious optimism that we're on the path to recovery, but it's not as robust as -- obviously, as we'd like.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then on Slide 21, it looks to me like the projected regulated rate base growth is up a couple -- like 7.9 versus 7.7. Just anything in particular there? Or just sort of what's going on?","William H. Spence","Sure. I think Paul has the detail on that.","Paul A. Farr","Yes, Paul, we just -- we updated that slide to reflect RAV pursuant to the RIIO filing that we did on July 1. And so you'll see the numbers in green on the bottom a little bit more robust. So that's really effectively the only change that we made. We're still in the throes of our normal business planning process, and so we'd expect -- and I don't expect there would be any material changes, but modest changes as we get through that. That's probably in Q3 or in the year-end call.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then the U.K. has had some headlines not really associated with distribution as -- at least as I read it, but more or less associated with the wholesale market and issues of transparency and issues of cost. And there was a report from Parliament and what-have-you. Is there any concern that, that might in some way sort of spill over into the distribution regulatory setup, if you follow me? I mean, is there -- I mean, I'm sure you guys are familiar with it. Just any thoughts about how -- or just how that may or may not relate to you guys?","William H. Spence","We are familiar with it. And thus far, we don't see any risk of a spillover. I think the distribution side is very transparent with the process that the U.K. regulator has there. And thus far, that has not even been raised in any publications or any discussions we've seen thus far. So I don't think it will have an impact at all.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, great. And then just finally, trading. What was the numbers for this year? I mean, what was the contribution this year, this quarter -- 6 months and yes, year-to-date and for the quarter? And just any outlook with [indiscernible] to that?","William H. Spence","I don't have the year-to-date figure in front of me, but our plan for this year is about $50 million in total, which is similar to last year's plan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neel Mitra at Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","With the DSIC mechanism now implemented in Pennsylvania, roughly what percentage of your distribution CapEx now is covered through a tracker you get a contemporaneous recovery with?","William H. Spence","Sure. Let me ask Greg Dudkin to comment on that.","Gregory N. Dudkin","Yes, I would say it's probably around 30% to 40%. So it's -- the DSIC is focused on reliability-related investments, so it's in the 30% to 40% range.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then second, on Kentucky. Can you kind of comment on the supply-demand situation post-2015 when the coal plants retire from that? Is the Cane Run CCGT enough to fulfill the load? Or would you envision building new plants or possibly acquiring some of the coal plants that have come up for sale in your service territory?","William H. Spence","Go ahead, Vic.","Victor A. Staffieri","Let me comment on that. We -- you may recall we issued an RFP for a generation supply. That begins in about 2017, 2018. And we're in the process of evaluate -- about 30 bids come in, including from Western Kentucky, Big Rivers, and we're in the process of evaluating those things. It appears to us that we begin to show a deficiency in -- by 2018, so we'll put something in place to meet those requirements. As we say, we're evaluating the RFP, results from the RFP, against self-build option as well. But then now, since it's not complete, we have a little time before we have to do that. We'll probably be in a position to talk about that by the end of the year.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And so you would foresee new capacity coming online in 2018 as kind of the first year as [indiscernible]?","William H. Spence","I'm sorry, could you repeat that?","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Sure. Is 2018 the first year that you would need the additional capacity after Cane Run? Or would you need it prior to that?","Victor A. Staffieri","About 2018 is when we would begin to show a deficiency off of our -- we have a reserve margin of about 15%, and that's when we begin to show a deficiency in the reserve margin. That's the period of time we're focusing on right now.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then one last question on Supply. How are you looking at hedging longer term now that we're seeing some of the Marcellus gas dislocate versus Henry Hub? And obviously, that kind of sets the price of power for your Pennsylvania plants. Are you looking to hedge a little farther out? Or is it just too early to tell?","William H. Spence","I would say overall, our hedging program, generally speaking, has not changed. We have been, as you know, very aggressive in hedging the output, which has resulted in significant benefits to shareowners. And as we look at our fundamental analysis, that kind of guides us as to how aggressively we want to hedge or not hedge. Dave, do you want to provide any other comments on our hedging?","David G. DeCampli","Yes. I'd add -- I'll just a supplement, Bill. We have, at this point, no plans to change the percentage targets we have put out in the past for future years, starting with 2015 in this case. So really, no change intended at this point in time.","William H. Spence","And I think to some degree, we're -- we have constraints with liquidity in the market. So even if we wanted to hedge 3 to 5 years out, let's say, the liquidity just doesn't exist to allow us to effectively do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Gordon at ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have actually been answered, but I wanted to circle back to a comment that you made about being focused on the idea that there is value in your generation fleet and you're trying to make sure that's preserved so that your shareholders benefit from it. You've clearly done that through hedging well, but do you think that your fleet is scaled? And do you think that one of the ways that you might preserve and create value in the long run would be to seek to become a more scaled entity that would benefit more from an ultimate recovery in power markets or the flip side being at least capitalize the benefits of being able to have more sustained reduced costs?","William H. Spence","Sure, a fair question. And as I have mentioned on previous calls, in Supply our focus has been and will continue to be on aggressively controlling both our O&M and capital costs. And we'll continue to evaluate other options that could increase value. But that's really nothing new in terms of our approach and how we've thought about strategic options over the years. So I think we continue to explore options for all the businesses that would maximize value.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lapides at Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions, a little bit unrelated. First, there's been some discussion out of D.C. regarding some tax code-related changes, and one of the things that always comes up is the potential impact -- the potential treatment of offshore cash that gets repatriated. Can you just give high-level comments about how much cash you maintain offshore? How much of it you could actually bring back to the U.S. if that tax code were -- if there was a tax code change versus what you need to keep offshore to be able to fund CapEx in the U.K.?","William H. Spence","Sure. Paul?","Paul A. Farr","Yes, there's not -- we don't -- given the growth in investment in the U.K., don't maintain significant offshore cash balances. And we've kind of said in the past that if we find ourselves in a situation where we've got cash there in excess of our targeted cap structures and in excess of planned reinvestment, we sweep that cash back to the States, irrespective of tax outcomes. And given the way that we very efficiently tax-structured the acquisitions, there's not any material U.S. incremental tax that comes with those repatriations for the intermediate term. At times, if you look at the P&L and you would see cash balances there, it's because we do benchmark fundraising. So we'll over time eat into our liquidity facilities, do a benchmark transaction and then use that to fund 1 year in our multiyear set of investment options there. So there's not room in the cap structure to lever up, and there's not significant excess cash sitting on the ground.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. A follow-up for you, Paul. If you just look at the balance sheet in your earnings release, the balance of short-term debt at the end of the second quarter is almost, I don't know, roughly 80% to 90% higher than it was at the end of 2012. What's the plan?","Paul A. Farr","Transactions, GBP 400 million transaction later this year in the U.K., and then we've got $250 million to $300 million FMBs at both KU and LG&E. We did a transaction in July as well. When you look at the quarter-end statements, we did an FMB at Electric Utilities as well. So the utilities, much like the comment that I just made about the U.K., where we have liquidity facilities that we use and eat into and then replace that with longer-term debt balances, we cycle through that, especially -- you'll see bigger movements with the big construction programs, then you would see a normal run rate where you've only got kind of maintenance CapEx kind of a cycle. So nothing concerning on that front at all, and you'll see some more capital markets debt transactions as we make our way through the balance of the year.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then last item. You all talked in the prepared comments about an increase in the Pocono transmission project. How big of an increase? What's the driver? And kind of what years does that impact?","William H. Spence","Sure, let me ask Greg Dudkin to respond to that.","Gregory N. Dudkin","Yes, so the increase went from $200 million to $335 million. The 3 categories were material and labor. Combining those, that was about $45 million of the change. And the scope -- and when I say scope, so when we put together the original estimate, we hadn't finalized on the path. So it's finalizing on a path, increase right away. We changed the construction standards. So the remainder is in that area. This project basically is scheduled over the next few years all the way through to 2017. So the increase is basically throughout those years.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. I was just curious because when I was looking at the CapEx slide, I think it's Page 20, I didn't really see much of a change in the kind of that red bar in Pennsylvania transmission, so I didn't know if you were cutting somewhere else.","Paul A. Farr","Yes, no, there's no cuts. I had made the comments earlier that we hadn't fully updated that to reflect the business planning changes, which the increase in this transmission project would fall into. So you'd see those updates from us later in the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith at UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So first question here. We've kind of talked about it a little bit, but on the Marcellus and gas basis, obviously that's kind of taken an acceleration of late. What are you seeing just with respect to PJM West pricing? Obviously, your cousins to the east were fairly good in the quarter. But for yourselves, how are you seeing this play out given spot prices as low as they are on gas?","William H. Spence","Well, I think overall, I wouldn't say there was a significant change from our plan. And of course, we came into the year very highly hedged. But overall, we understand the impact. We're following the basis very closely, and it has been slightly negative thus far which, again, was consistent with our thought coming into the year. Dave, I don't know if you have any further comments.","David G. DeCampli","Yes, we -- well, Julien, we expect that to persist into the future and are enveloping that into our plans for 2014 and beyond. So essentially, we're accepting reality here and just incorporating into our forward-going plan.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then secondly, could you talk a little bit about the change in U.K. guidance? Just I suppose pushing it back around after kind of a couple of different changes here, if you will?","William H. Spence","Sure. Rick, why don't you comment?","Rick L. Klingensmith","Sure. We've experienced a number of small, favorable variance in a number of our income statement line items like interest expense and depreciation and maintenance expense, with probably our largest variance in revenue. And that's really due to favorable price and volume variances, including weather, as Paul had mentioned in his remarks earlier. And so our revised forecast for the year incorporates this higher level of revenue that we'll see for the remainder of the year in both pricing and the past volume variances that we've realized already on a year-to-date basis.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Interesting. And what had pushed it down initially, if you can remind us?","Rick L. Klingensmith","I'm sorry, the question again, Julien?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","What had pushed the outlook down, if you will, initially?","Rick L. Klingensmith","Well, the outlook had -- went down was due to the revised share count that we had at the end of the Q1. So, yes, at the beginning of the year, it was higher, but the entire change was just due to the reflection of the share difference at the end of the Q1. There was no operational effects that resulted in that difference in forecast at the end of Q1.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fleishman at Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Follow-up on that last question. The -- should we think that some of the drivers that raised the '13 guidance for the U.K. would benefit the '14 guidance you gave as well for the U.K.? Or are they more specific to this year such as weather?","William H. Spence","Go ahead, Rick.","Rick L. Klingensmith","A big part of the positive variance that we're seeing for this year was weather, and that's probably $0.03 a share that's in our numbers on a year-to-date basis. That is more of a onetime item because in the U.K., we may have volume variances within the year, but those get normalized over the long term. And so some of that will get -- be given back in tariffs in the subsequent year. At this stage, it's hard to identify all the changes that'll take place in our tariff calculation. And so we have not changed our forecast or guidance for '14 as it relates to the U.K. Regulated segment.","William H. Spence","And Steve, we set the business plan late in 2012. Some of the positive things that we had been seeing, we factored into the numbers that we provided in July. We had the benefit of 6 months of experience at that point in time versus when the plan got finalized. So some of that was based in there as well.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","That's right because so you did raise the '14 when you did the update in July, as I recall a little bit. Okay.","William H. Spence","Yes.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","And my other question, and this is just a clarification, Bill, when you talk about kind of a trough in earnings, '14, '15, are you referring specifically still to just the Supply business or the overall PPL [indiscernible]?","William H. Spence","Really, what we -- I was really speaking to the overall PPL consolidated EPS, which, obviously, some of that is driven by the fall-off on the Supply earnings.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell at Jefferies.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just 2 quick housekeeping issues. On Slide 21, you give there projected regulated rate base growth. Are those average or year-end totals? And the second thing, I know you talked on a percentage basis. But for your incentive revenues for the U.K. businesses, were you assuming in millions of dollars in like '16 and '17?","William H. Spence","Okay. So on the slide, those are year-end numbers. And Rick, why don't you comment on the incentives?","Rick L. Klingensmith","Yes. So as we showed on our July 1 presentation, there was an incentive slide that was baked in. And to give a bit more detail, we have estimated $100 million in incentive revenue that we have earned throughout the rest of this regulatory period. But given the regulatory lag and how you recover those revenues, those will then slip into '16 and partially into '17 for our recovery period. But that's our forecast for the incentive revenues for that period.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Gregg Orrill at Barclays.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just wanted to ask about coal transportation costs to your PJM fleet. And kind of longer term, what you're seeing in terms of trends there and how you're addressing it?","William H. Spence","Sure. On the coal transportation front for our major rail supplier, we had renegotiated a longer-term contract that I think was either -- I think it was late year before last. And that contract goes out still a number of years yet. And so, in terms of our trend, it's really just following the contract terms as we negotiated it. I don't know that I have any more color on where the trends are today. So we're happy with the contract, and it's performing pretty much as we expected it to perform.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani at Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a question on the U.K. operations. Can you talk about what it takes to get fast tracked and what impact having good customer service has on that?","William H. Spence","Sure. Rick?","Rick L. Klingensmith","The fast-tracking process is one that Ofgem will look at how has companies performed in the current rate period with regards to what you had promised to deliver. And promising to deliver is the investment plan that had been set forth in this current 5-year period, as well your performance against the regulatory metrics, including customer service and reliability, safety and a number of other items. And so, how you have performed is a key factor that goes into the fast-track decision. The other side of that decision is then providing a well-justified business plan, a justified business plan that is backed up by cost-benefit analyses, technical analysis of what you need to spend over the next 8-year period, a review of all your cost bases to ensure that there's levels of efficiency in your cost base, as well as then having your business plan influenced by a significant stakeholder engagement program. And we have an extensive stakeholder program where we've had over 4,200 different stakeholders, a number of working groups that have been spread out across our territory to get input from our customers, to get input from our stakeholders with regards as to what do they deem to be most important in the delivery of the service that we provide them. And then we take that input and include it into the business plan determination and prioritizing our investment that is consistent with our stakeholder views. And so that's an important factor that the regulator will review as well. So it's performance in the current period and a well-justified business plan that we believe then sets us forth to be fast tracked through the process.","William H. Spence","Thanks, Rick.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And then just a question on the Supply business. Can you talk about your commitment to infuse equity into Supply just to improve the balance sheet and help pay down some debt, particularly in the light of what we've seen in the markets? And maybe some better opportunities elsewhere within the company as far as regulated investment, et cetera?","William H. Spence","Sure. Paul?","Paul A. Farr","Yes, we've got significant capital in terms of equity coming into the company. We had the $1.150 billion convert at the beginning of the third quarter here, we had the equity forward conclude itself and convert over to shares in Q2. There is new equity coming, $978 million, April of next year from the converts issued to finance the U.K. acquisition. We did -- at the beginning of the quarter, we had a maturity in Supply of $300 million that got paid off. We're, again, in the throes of our business planning process. There's not a -- you use the term capital commitment where we are trying to target and expect to achieve investment-grade credit ratings across the enterprise. We've eliminated equity on a going forward -- need on a going forward basis. So with the very robust capital spending plans of all 3 of the utilities segment, the capital is called for and spoken for at this point in time. But we do massage things as we move through time, and we're cognizant of the statement that Bill made earlier about looking at all the options to try to increase share value, and that'll factor into our financing plans as we finalize those as part of normal business planning.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining the PPL conference call on third quarter results and our general business outlook. We are providing slides of this presentation on our website at www.pplweb.com.","Any statements made in this presentation about future operating results or other future events are forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from such forward-looking statements. A discussion of factors that could cause actual results or events to vary is contained in the appendix to this presentation and in the company's SEC filings.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Spence, PPL Chairman, President and CEO.","William H. Spence","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. And thanks for dialing in. Joining me on the call today are Paul Farr, PPL's Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer, as well as the presidents of our 4 business segments, who will participate in the Q&A session today. To get started, I'll provide an overview of our third quarter results and a few operational highlights. Then Paul will provide more details on our segment performance for the quarter. We will try to keep this call brief and focus primarily on the events of the quarter, as I know your day is full of earnings calls and we'll see many of you next week at EEI.","But before turning to earnings, I'll update you on the impact of Hurricane Sandy. The hurricane caused considerable damage in parts of Eastern Pennsylvania served by our PPL Electric Utilities affiliate. This was the largest storm to hit PPL Electric Utilities-serviced territory, causing outages to over 500,000 customers. PPL Electric Utilities assembled the largest workforce in its history, more than 5,000 people, to undo Sandy's damage. By Sunday night, power had been restored to 99% of the affected customers, the remaining work wrapped up on Tuesday. Some of our neighboring utilities closer to the coast fared significantly worse. We have sent contractor crews that have completed work for PPL Electric Utilities to New Jersey and New York utilities to assist in the rebuilding of their devastated communities.","I know this was a very trying time for our customers, and I'd really like to thank them for their understanding and patience as we work diligently to restore their power. The PA Governor's Office and PUC showed strong leadership in working with the utility industry to ensure we had solid communications and very well coordinated assistance, especially through FEMA and community emergency management organizations. I'd also like to recognize the hard work of PPL employees from Pennsylvania to Kentucky, as well as workers from out-of-state utilities, who assisted us in our restoration efforts.","So now let's move onto earnings. Today, we announced third quarter reported earnings of $0.61 per share compared with $0.76 in the same quarter of 2011. Earnings from ongoing operations for the quarter were $0.72 per share versus $0.76 per share in the same period a year ago. For the first 3 months of the year, our reported earnings were $2 per share, up from $1.91 per share in the first 9 months of 2011. Ongoing earnings were $1.93 per share for the first 3 quarters of the year versus $2.02 per share in the same period last year.","Our results in the third quarter and through the first 9 months of the year are strong evidence that we are delivering on the promises of our transformational acquisitions in 2010 and 2011. As expected, our rate-regulated businesses are providing financial stability as we continue to effectively manage through challenging wholesale market power crisis. I'm very pleased with both our financial and operational performance, given what the markets and Mother Nature have challenged us with.","Now turning to Slide 5. Strong earnings from the U.K. utilities and the ability of our supply group to manage outage challenges at our Susquehanna  nuclear plant have put us in a position to raise the midpoint of our 2012 earnings forecast. In fact, we're updating our 2012 forecast range to $2.30 to $2.40 per share and earnings from ongoing operations, making the midpoint of our guidance $2.35 per share.","Before we move to Paul's comments, let me take a few minutes for an operational overview. Starting in Kentucky. Now that we've signed contracts with various vendors, we've updated our estimate of capital spending necessary to complete our previously discussed environmental compliance projects. We now estimate these projects will come in closer to $2.5 billion, a reduction of $500 million from our original forecast. We're able to deliver these savings to customers in Kentucky because we proactively addressed EPA regulations and were able to secure bids before others. These savings will contribute significantly to our objective of reducing equity needs over the next few years. Paul will provide more details on this effort in a few moments, including other CapEx reductions, higher dividend flows from the U.K. and O&M savings.","Despite the capital spending reductions, we expect our rate base in Kentucky to grow at a compound annual rate of over 8% through 2016. In addition, it's likely we will need to deploy capital in the 2016 and 2017 time frame to replace the Bluegrass facility and potentially other coal-fired generation capacity. But we'll clearly have the internal cash flow to support such investments at that time.","As for the rate case proceedings in Kentucky, we are moving along as planned. A settlement conference has been scheduled for November 13 and 14 with public hearing scheduled to take place later this month. We continue to anticipate an order from the commission in late December or early January with new rates effective shortly thereafter.","I've mentioned on previous calls that our management team in the U.K. has dramatically improved the customer service performance of our Midlands utilities. This improved performance continues to translate into benefits for WPD customers, as well as PPL shareowners. I'm pleased to report that WPD is forecasting for the regulatory year ended March 31, 2012 to have earned over $80 million in performance bonuses for the 4 U.K. utilities, most of which comes from the Midlands businesses. This was due to our ability to deliver reliability to customers at front tier-level performance. These bonuses will be reflected in our revenues in the 12-month period starting April 1, 2013. We can say with pride that our 4 network utilities are now among the best customer service providers in Great Britain.","Turning to the domestic operations in Pennsylvania. In early October, PPL Electric Utilities received final approval from the National Park Service to route the Susquehanna-Roseland Transmission Line through the park. This was the final permit required for this major grid upgrade that will improve electric service for millions of people in the Northeast, saving consumers more than an estimated $200 million per year and creating about 2,000 jobs during its construction. The rate case in Pennsylvania is proceeding, headed towards a final commission decision in December. We're of course disappointed by the ALJ's recommended decision that would produce an allowed return on equity of 9.74%. The ALJ recommendation would result in a $64 million increase in distribution revenues compared with the $104 million increase we had proposed when we filed our case. Today, we are filing detailed exceptions to this ALJ recommendation. We remain hopeful that the PUC's final decision will reflect a higher return on equity than this recommendation, especially in light of our need to continue replacing aging infrastructure and our strong customer service record.","At our supply segment, we resumed generating electricity from Unit 1 of the Susquehanna nuclear plant yesterday. We shut down the unit October 20 to inspect the Unit 1 turbine. The inspection confirmed data obtained from diagnostic equipment we installed earlier in this year to monitor for conditions that could lead to turbine blade crash. This is good news because it confirms the root cause analysis and enables us to move forward with a long-term solution. During the just-completed outage on Unit 1, we replaced a small number of cracked blades. Based on similar data from the diagnostic equipment on the Unit 2 turbine, we plan to shut that unit down for inspection and replace any cracked blades we discover. We're finalizing our plans with a vendor on a long-term solution that we believe will resolve the cracking issue and can be implemented starting in the first half of 2013. We're revising the estimated after-tax financial impact of these inspections to $25 million to $30 million, as we've been able to complete them more rapidly than initially expected.","On Slide 7, we provide updated detail on the competitive supply segment hedges. We've adjusted our expected output levels for 2012 to reflect the actual results through September 30 and our forecast for the remainder of this year. The decline in our expected Eastern baseload generation is primarily driven by the Susquehanna outage. For 2013, we've reduced our coal hedges in the East as we continue to manage our coal levels by working with coal suppliers to defer, renegotiate or buy out existing coal contracts. We've also provided our 2014 hedge details for the first time as we've layered on additional power hedges and have hedged now approximately 1\/2 of our 2014 baseload output. By the end of 2012, we would expect to be 60% to 90% hedged for 2014.","In conclusion, we're very pleased with our results through the first 9 months and confident this business mix is producing the shareowner benefits we expected. The Midlands acquisition continues to prove to be highly successful. The supply segment continues to perform well and manage through the current market and operational challenges. And our domestic regulated segments are progressing through the rate proceedings and executing on the rate base growth opportunities. I'll look forward to your question following Paul's comments.","Paul?","Paul A. Farr","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move the Slide 8 to review our third quarter financial results. PPL's third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were lower than last year, primarily driven by lower earnings at the supply segment as a result of lower energy margins, higher O&M and higher depreciation, which were partially offset by higher earnings in the U.K., primarily driven by higher delivery revenue.","We've outlined on Slide 9 the Kentucky regulated segment earnings drivers. Our Kentucky regulated segment earned $0.12 per share in the third quarter, a $0.01 decrease compared to last year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower retail margins as a result of lower residential consumption, partially offset by higher industrial load compared to a year ago.","Moving now to Slide 10. Our U.K. regulated segment earned $0.28 per share in the third quarter, a $0.06 increase over last year. This increase was due to higher earnings at WPD Midlands and higher delivery revenue at WPD South West and South Wales, primarily driven by higher prices. These positive earnings drivers were partially offset by higher pension expense at the 2 legacy companies and less favorable currency exchange rates.","Turning to our Pennsylvania regulated segment on Slide 11. This segment earned $0.06 per share in the quarter, a $0.01 increase compared to last year. This increase was primarily due to higher transmission and distribution margins and lower financing costs, partially offset by higher O&M.","Moving to Slide 12. Our supply segment earned $0.26 per share in the third quarter, a decrease of $0.10 compared to last year. This decrease was driven by lower Eastern energy margins, primarily due to lower hedged energy prices; lower Western energy margins, primarily due to lower volumes; higher O&M; higher depreciation; and higher financing costs.","Turning to Slide 13. We have updated our CapEx plan to reflect the changes for the lower projected ECR capital spending in Kentucky. As Bill discussed, this represents a $500 million reduction for 2012 to 2016 from our original plan. We are still finalizing our business planning process, but have identified an additional $200 million to $300 million of supply CapEx that can be eliminated over the next several years that is not currently reflected in this chart. These capital reductions will provide additional financial flexibility while we continue to manage through a low commodity price environment.","Turning to Slide 14. We have updated our rate base growth projections with the only change being the reduced ECR spending in Kentucky. We now project to more than $7.5 billion in increase in rate base from 2012 to 2016 resulting in a 7.5% compound annual growth rate. We realized the reduced capital spending in Kentucky has an impact on future EPS, but this is significantly offset by the elimination of the equity needed to fund those investments. Obviously, the almost $700 million to $800 million in reduced CapEx in supply and Kentucky is a major driver to eliminating equity needs beyond our DRIP issuance. We also expect to repatriate an additional $30 million to $50 million per year above our previous expectations from the U.K. driven by our forecast of strong annual revenue bonuses and performance ahead of plan on cost synergies. We continue to evaluate our level of O&M spending and have made progress on that front. But Fukushima-related costs and the need for additional outages at Susquehanna over the next few years to implement the permanent fix for the blade cracking issue are expected to absorb that benefit in the near term. Beyond this time frame, we do see opportunity to reduce supply O&M.","Given the significant attention dividends have received during this earnings season, let me end with our commitment to the dividend, which we view as an extremely important piece of our total shareowner return. The current dividend level represents a 61% payout ratio based on the midpoint of our revised 2012 earnings forecast and is much more than covered by our rate-regulated earnings. As we have been indicating, we expect modest increases to the dividend through the low parts of the commodity cycle and as we deploy significant capital on our rate-regulated utility businesses. This intention is reflected in the dividend increase that we announced earlier this year. Our dividend is secure and we clearly see added flexibility for future growth as we execute on our rate-regulated growth strategy.","With that by way of review, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bill for the Q&A period.","William H. Spence","Thank you, Paul. And operator, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Paul Patterson.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","On the nuclear cost side there, you mentioned some -- could you just give us a little bit more of a flavor? I mean, you said $25 million to $30 million for the inspection. But what kind of costs are we talking about with respect to the actual repair of the blade cracks and any of the sort of Fukushima -- or any other basic costs that you're seeing? The other sort of question related to that is that Exxon mentioned on their call that they were looking at annual refueling cycle potentially to at least some of their plants, I think, help out with their fuel expense. I was just wondering what your thoughts are about that with respect to Susquehanna.","William H. Spence","Sure. I don't think we would change our refueling outages at this point or the timing of them. Related to cost for Fukushima, we're still in the process of determining that. But as we've mentioned on previous calls, we think the capital costs will be very manageable and the real question or open question at the moment is whether the industry would be required to install filtered nets on the units, and that would be a little bit more costly. But again, I don't think in the overall context of PPL that those costs of capital would be unmanageable. As for your first part of your question on the costs to replace the blades and the ultimate fix, on the replacement side, the costs for the O&M associated with the outage, as well as the replacement costs, those have been already factored into the numbers that we have provided today, that $25 million to $35 million after-tax. In terms of the fix, we're still determining exactly what those costs would be. But again, I don't think that they're going to be unmanageable for us.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then with respect to the filtered venting issue, what kind of -- I mean you mentioned it's manageable for you guys. Is there any sort of sense as to roughly speaking what the impact could be there?","William H. Spence","I'll ask Dave DeCampli to comment on that.","David G. DeCampli","Yes. First of all, we believe the commission, NRC, will be wrestling with this issue shortly, probably by the end of the month, as to whether that filtered vent will be included in the package of improvements or changes we'll have to make at the unit. Filtered vent, though we do not have a solid enough estimate on it at this point in time, we do have an estimate for the balance of the other changes we believe will be necessary, and that's somewhere between $60 million and $85 million.","William H. Spence","Yes.","Paul A. Farr","Of capital.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","But that doesn't include the vents. Is that right?","William H. Spence","That's correct. That's right. And I think...","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Well, my understanding was that the staff was going to be maybe issuing a recommendation for these filtered vents. And I'm just sort of trying to get a sense as to what the impact of those would be.","William H. Spence","Sure. Yes, I think we'll know more obviously by the end of the month, once we find out exactly what they're looking for and the time frame they're looking for.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And these are sort of capital expenses. Is O&M considerably more or less or a big factor in all of this?","William H. Spence","Yes. It really wouldn't factor in any meaningful way. It would be capital.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just on industrial sales in Kentucky. It looked like they've been very strong. What's going on there?","William H. Spence","Sure. I'll ask Vic Staffieri to comment.","Victor A. Staffieri","Our capital -- our sales on industrials are up 9% quarter-over-quarter and about 6% for the year. And that's just -- we've just had some good, robust industrial sales in the automotive sector and in the North American stainless and the return to service of a facility that was out of service last year. So we've had good, steady industrial sales growth in Kentucky this year, 6% over last year.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And just in terms of trading, just to revisit on that, how is the outlook for trading in your forecast now looking with your current experience and just what you're seeing out there?","William H. Spence","We're right on plan. I don't think there's any change.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just finally the Kentucky case. It looks like you guys are going to be having settlement discussions pretty soon. Any sense as to how those are shaping up or the outlook for those?","William H. Spence","The settlement, the hearings are scheduled to begin next week, and it will be too early for me to speculate. We haven't had a chance to sit down with interveners yet. The big issues, as you might imagine, are return on equity and there's some depreciation, a little bit of skirmishing around O&M expenses. But it's really the return on equity.","Operator","The question will come from Kit Konolige.","Kit Konolige - Konolige Research, LLC","So a couple of questions. Paul, I think in the past, you've talked about your belief that earnings from the supply business would not drop below 0 at the bottom of the cycle. Is that still the case as you start to hedge out into '14 now?","Paul A. Farr","Yes. As I think about the hedges that we've layered in and I think about the balance of the business plan, which again is getting close to final, we continue to believe that we can keep the supply earnings at that neutral to positive for the tougher years of the cycle that you're referencing.","Kit Konolige - Konolige Research, LLC","Okay. Excellent. And on WPD then, you said that $1 million [ph] in performance bonuses. This is the relative to the -- I think, in the past, you've talked about $60 million or better that you expected here. That's the kind of data point that we're following here?","Paul A. Farr","Yes, that's correct.","Operator","Your next question will come from Justin McCann.","Justin C. McCann - S&P Equity Research","A question for Paul. What is your current projection of average outstanding shares for '13 and '14 and also your expected effective tax rate both for the U.K. and on a consolidated basis for those years?","Paul A. Farr","Yes. On a consolidated basis on the ETR for '12 and '13, we are around 28% to 30% for '12 and '13 and that goes blending [ph] across all of -- actually, a little lower than that, closer to 25% for '12, 28% to 30% for 2013. And let me pull the share amounts for it. 2012 weighted average around 586 million. We'll get back to you on the '13 number.","Operator","Your next question will come from Julien Dumoulin.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So congratulations again on the U.K. here. It just seems like it never stops. I'd be curious to what extent are the year-to-date benefits or above plan that you recognized in your guidance? Are those going to go forward? Or is this really driven by kind of a one-time tax benefit this year? If you could kind of parse that apart, I'd appreciate it.","William H. Spence","Sure. I would say it's really a combination of great operational performance, good customer service, and reliability that's going to drive some of the performance on a go-forward basis, and then there are some tax benefits. But I think basically, it's small and it's really driven by the fundamentals of the business, not any one-time items.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then secondly on supply, kind of going back to the first question there on the nuclear costs, if you could just -- in aggregate, what kind of cost increases are we talking about? And then secondly, just flagging I suppose to the extent to which on a go-forward basis '12, '13, '14, what kind of costs are we talking about? At what point will we recognize this O&M benefit?","William H. Spence","Sure. Well, on the cost for Fukushima-related, as we mentioned, the first part of it is pretty well known. And that's making changes to everything but the filtered vents, the items that the NRC and the industry is on the same page with, which will allow us to respond a bit better in an unlikely event of a challenge to off-site power in particular, as well as maintaining proper levels and understanding where the water levels are and the spent fuel pools, as well as the temperature. So those instrumentation changes are relatively small and low capital cost items. So all of that, as Dave mentioned, I think in the $50 million to $60 million kind of range. The bigger unknown is around the filtered vents, which as I commented earlier, we don't have a good estimate yet because we're not exactly sure what the NRC maybe looking for. When it comes to the turbine blades, the majority of our expense to do the permanent fix will probably come next year. That will come with some unscheduled outages, so we're going to have on the units, it's not in the refueling, we'll have a special outage to put in the permanent fix. And then the scheduled outage may -- hopefully wouldn't take much longer, but it could be a little bit longer. So O&M for 2013 will be a bit higher now. As I mentioned on the last call, we have a number of initiatives underway to trim our O&M and capital expenses, particularly in the supply segment. And there, we would expect some of the O&M savings for 2013 would be offset by the increased outage that we have to take next year. So that's kind of a rundown of where we see the supply business from an O&M and capital perspective.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Excellent. And perhaps a last quick one here, more strategic. On the supply business overall, how are you thinking about it from an ownership perspective, particularly given some of the comments from some of your peers of late?","William H. Spence","Sure. We still like the business mix that we have. We have no plans to make a strategic change with the supply business. And we're happy with its performance through the good part of the cycle, and we'll manage it well through the down cycle.","Operator","Your next question will come from Jonathan Arnold.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just on the additional CapEx cuts, I think, Paul, you mentioned in your speech $200 million to $300 million of additional CapEx you might take out over the next several years. Are you saying that you're planning to go through with these? Or that's something you have sort of obviously to manage through prolonged down cycle? Or is that something we're going to actually see you do?","Paul A. Farr","Yes. I would say that as we look at the -- responding to the lower commodity environment, that those are actions that make economic sense to take. We would try to take those in the final business plan that our board will approve later this year. So I don't think [indiscernible] the margin.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So that's something that's going to be in the plan, but just wasn't on the slide?","Paul A. Farr","Correct. We typically only update the chart in full of CapEx on an annual basis, and then provide you -- throughout the years as we make changes, we provide you the deltas. We'll reassess whether or not we actually go ahead and update that going forward just so you have it all in one spot.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then you talked about -- I think it was about $500 million of lower spending on environmental CapEx and because you've moved early on getting this stuff moving. To what extent was it a function of the final rules being less severe than maybe the initial proposal? Was that a piece of it or not?","Paul A. Farr","No, that was a very small piece. It was $30 million to $40 million of the total spending to optimize around gas. But it was heavily driven by the mercury rules, so not driven by that at all.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So you're just being more conservative about what you assume it would cost?","Victor A. Staffieri","I'm sorry, this is Vic Staffieri. I would say it's not a question of conservatism. We had a plan that we laid out with the regulatory commission in Kentucky. We applied pursuant to our environmental cost recovery mechanisms. We had projections of what we thought the compliance costs were. And we were just very fortunate that with the commission's support, we were able to get out early, get our estimates in, get it all bid, everything was bid here, including all the commodities. And all of these bids have come back very favorable, and that's really the genesis of the $500 million in savings.","Operator","Your next question will come from Anthony Crowdell.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question on you had, I guess, there's additional dividends being repatriated from the U.K. properties. I mean, is that additional -- is that going to be absorbed by the higher expenses that you have at the other business units?","Paul A. Farr","No. I would say that, that's a straight increment in terms of additional cash flow that we've got in the U.S. that we're then able to deploy to the regulated utilities, primarily here that have the equity needs as they're growing rate base so strongly. So yes, we don't have a forecast out for '13. So I don't want to talk about things on a net basis per se that, that's not being absorbed and is incremental to the cash we have to invest in the domestic rate-regulated.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","All right. And lastly, it looks like you have the potential to wrap up the cases early -- late December, early next year both in Kentucky and in Pennsylvania. I mean does the company think they could earn your allowed return in these 2 jurisdictions once these rate proceedings are finished? Or there'll still be lag where you'll still underearn?","William H. Spence","Well, since we're still in a pretty heavily capital-intensive building program infrastructure and replacements, there's going to be immediately some type of lag. But we can manage some of that hopefully through O&M and other levers that we have to try to keep it close to or near the ROE. But I think as we've said in the past, with the type of the spending we need to do on a traditional general rate case basis that we'd be probably looking at needing to file every few years. Now I would probably just remind you that a lot of the spending that we are planning to do has real-time or near-real-time recovery, particularly in Kentucky with the environmental spend. Of course in the U.K., it's all returned off and on immediately as we spend it. And then in Pennsylvania, we have a new law that was passed early this year that will allow us to file for some of the capital, about 1\/3 or more of the capital, that had we planned to spend under a new ratemaking mechanism, which will allow more timely recovery. So I think overall, we feel good about our ability to keep the returns close to the authorized level because of the ratemaking constructive arrangements that we have in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky.","Paul A. Farr","The other thing I'd chime in with is -- the other thing that's a driver that's a bit going against us is Pennsylvania, we're dealing with still with Act 129, and that's corrupting the kilowatt hour sales growth that would more organically be there. We talked about strength of industrial in Kentucky, but we've seen some soft residential. So a lot of our ability to stay out for longer periods will be dictated by how strongly the economy recovers and getting back to more normal load growth profiles as well.","Operator","Your next question will come from Paul Ridzon.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Do you have any recourse to the vendor on the turbine blades? Are they going to share some of this cost? Or is it all going to be expensed by you?","William H. Spence","At this point, we have not made that determination. I think we are both focused on ensuring that we know the root cause and putting in a permanent fix. And in terms of the commercial sharing of the cost, that will come at a later date. But I think we're very focused on just making sure that we get the permanent fix into the unit as quickly as possible.","Operator","Your next question will come from Michael Lapides.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to make sure one thing. Am I following -- are you expecting multiple years of higher nuclear O&M and capital cost of suppliers? Or is this more of a one-time thing related to Fukushima, meaning a 1 year where you'll see higher expense, and then things kind of normalize beyond that?","William H. Spence","We would be looking at this as a one-time expense. We're hopeful that for the Susquehanna turbine outage blade-cracking issue, we can accomplish much of what we need to do in 2013. We'll know better by the end of the year. But yes, we would look at these as one-time events.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just want to make sure I follow, the potential CapEx reductions at supply are not on the slide deck that you put out. That's not on the slide deck you put out today, but maybe something you put out when you give guidance for '13, as well as any potential O&M reductions you do at supply.","William H. Spence","Exactly right, yes.","Operator","Your next question will come from Steve Fleishman.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. First on the hedging strategy, you guys ramped up a lot of hedging for '14 the last 2 quarters. Are you kind of planning to do more ratably hedged from here on because you left open it for a while, ramp it up? Is it kind of back to more ratable hedging from here?","William H. Spence","I think probably because we're getting closer to the period in which we'd want to have 2014 more highly hedged, it will probably tend to be more ratable, Steve. But just as we've done in this last rally, we're going to look to pick our spots as to when we hedge. So I would say we're kind of leaning in that direction to be more ratable, but we're going to certainly take advantage of any market opportunities as we see them. I'd also say that we just completed our own internal fundamental analysis. And I would say the team is more bullish on '14 and '15 than they've been for a while now. So that would tend to have us leave it open a little bit more than we otherwise would. But again, as we drive closer and closer to '14, we'll want to have a pretty heavily hedged book by then.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. One other question on Susquehanna. Is the outage cost expected to be similar to this year? Or is it just kind of uncertain?","William H. Spence","Go ahead, Dave. Why don't you answer that?","David G. DeCampli","Yes. The cost this year included -- will include 3 additional outages, really. We had a refueling outage. But in addition to that, we had an inspection outage for the other unit in the spring plus the outage we just accomplished plus a short upcoming outage to the other unit soon to start. So this year, we experienced 3 what we'll call maintenance or inspection outages to deal with the turbine [ph] rate issue. We expect just 1 of those next year in addition to the refueling outage. So next year's O&M cost would be about 1\/3 of what they would have been this year.","Operator","Your next question will come from Brian Chin. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Raymond Leung.","Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just Paul, can you just give us an update on the latest thoughts on the equity proceeds from the equity units? I think you talked about down streaming again down to supply in terms of reducing that there. Any updates on thoughts, given that you've been able to sort of maybe potentially reduce some cost and CapEx. Does that change your view there?","Paul A. Farr","Yes. It really doesn't change the view there, per se. It lightens up -- in '13 and '14, the equity needs a little bit in Kentucky, but we have around 700 -- north of a $700 million refinancing that was otherwise due at supply next year. So we'll downstream cash for that. We will equitize appropriately Kentucky and PPL Electric Utilities to help finance those rate base growth plans. So I wouldn't say really anything has changed with respect to that. To the -- sorry to hijack the question. But the individual that asked about the 2013, the weighted average share count of 614 million shares for that year. But Ray, I wouldn't expect that we'd be changing the plan materially. And again, those cuts are coming across a 4- to 5-year window so in any given year, they're not all that significant.","Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just a sidebar question. Can you talk a little bit about PPL Montana and what's going on down there? I think one of the agencies changed the outlook the other day. Is it just all margin pressure and lack of contracts?","Paul A. Farr","Yes. If you read the S&P report, it's reduced levels of contracting as we go out over the next couple of years. So very heavily hedged this year and next year, less hedged in '14 and '15. And those are the years like we see with respect to the entire supply business, where we do see some pressure on it. And given the project finance nature of that sale-leaseback, they've put a negative outlook on the BBB-.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from Ashar Khan.","Ashar Khan","I just wanted to -- I guess, Bill, you mentioned in the beginning of your comments that there might be some more additional CapEx at Kentucky in '16 and '17. Could you just tell us the amount and when will that be firmed up? I guess it's not in your projections right now.","William H. Spence","It is not in the projections right now, Ashar, and we don't have a preliminary number yet. But maybe Vic can talk to what we're thinking about it in terms of projects.","Victor A. Staffieri","We're in the process now of an RFP. We just got the offers in last week to meet [indiscernible]. We have some capacity requirements in '17 and '18. We've had the Bluegrass turbines originally we were going to use to meet that. We haven't done that. Those capital savings were reflected in 2012. And until we evaluate the bids that we just received and we will also take into account any self-build options for '17 and '18, still early for us to make an estimate on what those capital requirements might be.","Ashar Khan","Okay. But when will you get to know? Is it like a year down the road? Or when should we expect you having a clearer idea of those?","Victor A. Staffieri","Well, I think we could handle it by the first quarter of next year when we're done with the evaluation of the RFPs.","William H. Spence","Okay. Operator, if there are no more questions in the queue -- apparently not. Okay. Well thanks, everyone, for joining us today. And we'll see many of you at EEI. And safe travels.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions). Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Bergstein. Please go ahead.","Joseph Bergstein","Thank you, Amy. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the PPL conference call on first quarter results and our general business outlook. We are providing slides of this presentation on our website at www.pplweb.com.","Any statements made in this presentation about future operating results or other future events are forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from such forward-looking statements. A discussion of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ is contained in the appendix to this presentation and in the company's SEC filings.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Spence, PPL's Chairman, President and CEO.","William Spence","Thanks Joe and good morning everyone. We are glad you are able to join us today. On the call with me are Paul Farr, PPL's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and the Presidents for our business segments.","Moving to slide 3; the agenda will start with an overview of quarterly earnings and operational results and a discussion of the 2013 earnings forecast, which we raised this morning. After my remarks, Paul will review our segment financial results. When Paul has concluded his remarks, we will open the phone lines to your questions.","Turning to slide 4, today we announced reported earnings of $0.49 per share for the first quarter, a decrease from $0.65 per share on the first quarter of 2013. Adjusting for special items are earnings from ongoing operations or $0.80 per share, an increase of 13% over last year's first quarter of ongoing earnings of $0.71 per share.","Each of our three regulated segments outperformed first quarter 2013 results and Supply segment earnings were the same as the first quarter of 2013. These strong results show the value of our ongoing investments in regulated infrastructure and a strong performance of our competitive generating plants during the unusually cold weather we experienced this winter.","Moving to slide 5; today we updated our 2014 ongoing earnings forecast to $2.15 to $2.30 per share, with a midpoint of $2.23 per share. As reflected in the table, our strong first quarter enabled us to increase the guidance range for each of our four business segments from the original forecast.","Slide 6 identified some of the Q1 operational highlights of our regulated business segments. We received confirmation in late February that all four of our Western Power Distribution subsidiaries in the United Kingdom were accepted for fast tracking of their eight year business plans by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets, or Ofgem. Our subsidiaries were the only four distribution network operators, whose plans were deemed suitable for accelerated consideration. We are very pleased with the great work of our U.K. team, which worked extremely hard to produce high quality plans, acceptable for fast tracking. We also appreciate Ofgem's confidence in our ability to provide cost effective operations, while providing frontier performance in customer service and reliability.","In Pennsylvania, we made further progress on PPL's portion of the Susquehanna to Roseland transmission line, and remain on-track for our June 2015 in service date, despite the difficult weather conditions this winter.","In late February, we energized a new 230 KV section of the line through the Delaware water gap, and we finished our overhead work in the national park in March. With the milestones that have been completed in the first quarter, PPL's portion of the project is now about 75% complete.","On slide 7; you will see that our domestic utility sales benefited significantly from the unusually cold weather. On a weather normalized basis, sales were essentially flat in Kentucky quarter-over-quarter, as lower commercial sales were offset by higher residential and industrial sales. Kentucky commercial sales declined in the Louisville metro area, and KU's Eastern Kentucky region. Small businesses in the Eastern part of Kentucky have been hit especially hard, by the challenges facing the coal mining industry. Industrial sales in Kentucky increased slightly, as some of our larger customers maintain higher production levels, with shorter maintenance outages and some expansions.","Weather normalized sales in Pennsylvania were higher across all three primary customer segments, with industrial volumes experiencing the greatest improvement, continuing an upward trend we have experienced over the last 12 months. The cement and steel sectors reflected the highest growth at a positive 16% and 8% respectively, and we saw modest growth among most other sectors, except mining.","Moving to slide 8; our supply segment performed very well operationally in the first quarter. Our flexible, intermediate and peaking units delivered excellent results in the quarter, due to the high prices experienced in the PJM region, despite running at lower capacity factors than a year ago. The lower capacity factors were driven by planned outages at our Ironwood and Lower Mount Bethel plants, and higher natural gas prices, which impacted plant dispatch. Our baseload coal units also provided some upside on high demand days, by operating at capacity factors that exceeded our expectations.","At our Susquehanna nuclear plant, we completed a turbine inspection outage on Unit-II in March, and installed modifications that are designed to reduce blade vibration and minimize the potential for blade cracking.","We are currently, in a plant refueling outage on Unit-I, that began on April 12, and are making similar modifications to those turbines. We believe these modifications will enable the units to run for their full two year operating cycles.","Finally, the announced sales of the PPL Montana Hydroelectric assets to Northwestern Energy, continues to be reviewed by regulators. In March, the federal energy regulatory commission, approved the transfer of operating licenses to Northwestern, with the exception of the Kerr Project, which is still pending. The separate FERC application for the dispositioning of the assets is also still pending. We did just this week receive FTC approval for the Montana asset sale. The Montana Public Service Commission continues its review and remains on-schedule to issue a final order in the fall of this year.","Overall, we had a great first quarter and start to 2014, providing us with the confidence to increase our guidance range for the year. We are executing at a very high level on all objectives we set out at the beginning of the year, and we expect to continue that momentum heading into the summer.","Finally, we continue to believe the value of our Supply business is understated in our share price. We are committed to realizing appropriate value from that business, and are continuing to focus on this objective.","I look forward to your questions, and now I will turn the call over to Paul Farr. Paul?","Paul Farr","Thanks Bill and good morning everyone. Let's move to slide 9; our strong first quarter results reflect higher earnings from each of our three regulated segments, and flat earnings from our Supply business, compared to the first quarter of 2013.","Now let's move over -- start with a detailed review of Q1 segment earnings driver, starting with the U.K. on slide 10. U.K. regulated earned $0.41 per share in the first quarter, a $0.04 increase over last year. This increase was primarily due to higher utility revenues, driven by the April 1st, 2013 price increase, partially offset by lower volume due to weather, and lower pension expense. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher depreciation.","Moving now to slide 11; Kentucky earned $0.16 per share in the quarter, a $0.02 increase compared to last year. This increase was due to higher gross margins, primarily due to higher retail and off-system sales volumes, driven by the unusually cold weather Bill mentioned, and higher earnings from environmental CapEx, partially offset by higher O&M.","Turning to slide 12; our Pennsylvania regulated segment earned $0.13 per share in the first quarter, a $0.03 increase versus last year. This increase was due to higher distribution margins, driven by higher sales volumes due to the cold weather, and the benefit from a change in estimate of a regulatory liability, as well as higher transmission margins.","Finishing with Supply on slide 13; this segment earned $0.11 per share in the quarter compared to last year. This result was primarily due to higher Eastern energy margins, driven by higher capacity prices, and a net benefit from colder weather, partially offset by lower hedged, baseload energy prices, and lower nuclear generation off-grid, due to the timing of planned outages, and lower financing costs. Now this was offset by lower Western energy margins, driven by lower coal and hydro unit availability, and higher income taxes.","That's the end of my prepared remarks, and I will turn the call back over to Bill for the Q&A period.","William Spence","Okay. Thanks Paul and operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Good morning guys.","William Spence","Good morning Dan.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","There has been a lot of press commentary in the last few days, in particular, about Supply and may be where that's headed. I know you guys are trying to find the best way to extract value for their business or so the value of it. Do you have a view may be on timing of when will [indiscernible] or when you guys will come to a reasonable conclusion of how that fits into PPL on a long run basis?","William Spence","Dan, there is no specific timeline, but I would say, it continues to be a key priority of the company.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Okay. And then on -- in Kentucky I guess, kind of the munis stepping back on the renewal, their contracts, and the reevaluation mill [indiscernible], can you just talk about what that process looks like, and maybe thought process around that plant?","William Spence","Sure. I will ask Vic Staffieri to answer that.","Victor Staffieri","We see no application from none of our municipals, it is about 300 megawatts or so that they'd like to get out of their contract in about five years. That has led us to we think -- the timing on a new combined cycle plant at Green River. So we have filed with the Public Service Commission and put that in advance. We are talking to the municipals, and that will play out over time. But the only impact frankly would be, perhaps a delay in the in-service date of the next combined cycle plant.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Vic, to put that in context I mean, a delay by -- is kind of a two year delay, three year delay, I mean, how long were you guys [indiscernible] in?","Victor Staffieri","It could be -- there are other things that could compel us to move a little -- to keep it. It may not just below that makes us decide to move that plant back -- we might want to move it for load purposes back to the three years. We might decide to keep it only one year, depending upon some of the environmental concerns. That could give us a nice diversification opportunity, and we want to be mindful of the environmental requirement, particularly the pressure on coal.","So you could say from a load perspective, you could move back as far as three years, but there might be other consideration that allows to move it up. We are looking at that right now, which is why we made a bonding with the Public Service Commission to put that proceeding in advance of 90 days, as we think through the implications.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Okay. And I guess one last question, there has been some issues in the quarter around kind of coal ash, and coal ash remediation in the region. Can you just give us an update where you guys are, both at Supply and in Kentucky, as far as compliance plans and your perspective spending, to make sure you don't have any issues.","Victor Staffieri","Sure. On the competitive coal front in Pennsylvania, the majority -- actually all of our plans at this point are all dry ash facilities and they are all beneficially using the dry ash. So we have really essentially closed all of our wet ash compounds quite some time ago. So most of those have been remediated. When we look at, on a go forward basis, our major concern as with the entire industry, is ensuring that coal ash does not become a hazardous waste. And that's our number one priority I think as a company and as an industry.","And we think that can be avoided and should be avoided, and when you drop back to the additional oversight that we may see, I think its just a question of degree, and how much more would we have to do at some of the facilities, particularly those that are wet ash facilities.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","And then in Kentucky, what is [indiscernible]?","Victor Staffieri","In Kentucky, we do still have some wet ash ponds. We are moving towards landfills. We are in licensing, proceedings at Trimble County and [indiscernible] and other places, to remove our ponds over time. We are confident, we have done the kind of analysis that need to be done, to ensure that we hopefully don't have the problems that have plagued others with respect to these ponds, but we are moving towards the landfills in almost every occasion.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Do you have a ballpark on how much money that's going to require and maybe timing to get that result?","Victor Staffieri","It would be over the next decade or so. Remember, part of the problem is we don't have the bottom [ph] regulations yet out of EPA. Once we get those, we will be in a better position. But we do have some money in our budget over time. I think it's in the order of $300 million to $400 million, probably in our long term capital budgets to reflect that.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Great. Thank you guys.","William Spence","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question comes from Kit Konolige at BGC.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners","Close enough. That's okay. So couple of different areas. So first of all, should we be projecting anything forward in earnings level for the company from the increase in 2014? In other words, is this all due to weather at Supply -- basically at Supply and distribution companies? Or is there stronger earning power than we had thought so far?","William Spence","I think when we look at our business plan, clearly weather in the first quarter was a significant factor, and I will let Paul comment on the details of how much of the outperformance was weather driven. But fundamentally, we had very good performance as well from all the regulated segments.","I think what I would say is that we are very well on track with our regulated business on a weather adjusted business. We continue to perform at a high level, and may be Paul, you can comment on the specific numbers for the quarter?","Paul Farr","Yeah Kit, weather in total was only about half of the $0.08 increase to the midpoint of the forecast. So we were significantly ahead. We were about $0.04 in total for the Supply business ahead of plan and forecast. And then the utilities were kind of a push. We were $0.03 positive domestically offset by $0.03 negative in weather in the U.K. So when you look at that -- a big component of the increase was weather, but that only made up about half of the total.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners","Okay, that's great. How about in the U.K., what can you tell us about FX effects compared to what we might have thought before, and about the cash repatriation process? Are you on-track with all of those compared to prior guidance?","Paul Farr","Yeah, Kit we are. Obviously the currency has been a little bit stronger, but as you may recall, we are fully hedged -- nearly fully hedged coming into this year. So really net effect is that we are on plan. In terms of repatriation, I don't think there is any new news there. I think again, its on track as we would we expect, and so again, we are right on plan, right where we would like to be at this point in the year.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners","Okay. And last area on the future of Supply. Are you or potential counterparties waiting for any further news on the market front in particular on the RPM auction coming up, and in general, can you tell us anything about your perception of how higher prices in PJM this year have affected the value of supply?","William Spence","I would say generally speaking, neither the capacity auction nor the price action that we have seen, based on the significant increase that we saw on our prices in PJM in the winter, would impact our strategic thinking around the supply business. We continue to have, as our number one priority, the aggressive cost control and optimizing the dispatch of our plants, while of course maintaining safe and reliable operations. At the same time, we do continue to consider other options that could enhance value.","There is no particular data point or view point of forward prices that we are waiting for or that would substantially impact our thought process around strategic options for that business.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners","Okay, that's great. Thanks Bill.","William Spence","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith at UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Good morning.","William Spence","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Bill, quick question if you can talk about the supply side a little bit more. As you think about strategic options, how important is control of any eventual structure, that you might conceive of?","William Spence","Well as I mentioned, we are considering other options that can enhance value, or remain committed to creating value from the Supply business for shareowners, and we are going to keep focused on this effort. There is not a particular structure or ownership or objective that we have, along those lines, that would be of the table. I think we are looking for the best opportunity we have, to create shareowner value. So whatever form that may come in, we are considering.","So as I mentioned, we don't have specific timeline. We are being disciplined about the process, and it is a key priority of ours.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Excellent. And then looking at the Supply side, I suppose, we have seen some recent rise in Maryland around NOX. I'd be curious, as you think about your Pennsylvania portfolios, Brunner Island doesn't have an SCR. Is that something that you guys are thinking about down the line, or how you think about environmental CapEx, just from a conventional perspective?","William Spence","I think at this juncture, we don't see a lot of incremental CapEx required on the environmental front, for either Brunner Island or Montour stations in Pennsylvania. I think we are in fairly decent shape. There is some related to the math. Really, folks more around mercury control than it is around SOX or NOX. So at this point, I don't see any significant addition that we would need to make.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Great. And then lastly, on the 2016 outlook. I know you haven't talked about it. But we have obviously seen a pretty big move in the supply mark-to-market. Are we talking about still kind of targeting breakeven or positive EPS, or were we better than that in the long term here and thinking about 2015 and 2016?","William Spence","Yeah, when we think about the forward curve and looking at our supply business, we expect that it will continue to be in positive EPS territory. I think our comments in the past were, that we would do everything that we could, to ensure that it stayed in positive territory; and with the cost cutting, that Dave DeCampli and his team have already embarked on, and where we see forward prices, we would expect that it will continue to be in positive EPS territory.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Excellent. And then lastly, if you don't mind, on the RPM side. I know, you just got a question there. But expectations on that, and then also, just with regards to new gas generation entrants if you will?","William Spence","Sure. I think as we look at this RPM in particular, there are a lot of moving parts, a lot of modifications have been made. There is a lot of kind of noise out there around the residual auctions and so forth. So I think for this year at least, we are not going to put out an expectation around where we expect RPM prices to settle out, because there is a lot more uncertainty, in our view, coming into this auction than we have seen in past auctions. So I think it's just really difficult to nail this one down in any precise manner. So we are going to really avoid making any prediction at this point.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Patterson at Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Good morning. How are you?","William Spence","Good morning Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Just to sort of follow-up on that last question. Do you want to talk at all about may be directionally where you think RPM might be going with respect to last year's auction? I mean, I hear you on the substantial modifications, but when you are adding them all up and subtracting, any thoughts there?","William Spence","No I think again it could be significantly volatile, so I think its really difficult to know, and I think based on upcoming retirements, other factors, I think the bidding strategies of companies could be substantially different this time than last, and I think that could influence the outcome, more so than maybe some of the planning parameters that have influenced prior outcomes. So I think for that reason, we are really having a difficult time, even directionally predicting where we think this could turn out.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay, great. Then on the WPD line loss? What was that exactly? I am sorry to be stressful on it. What caused that?","William Spence","Yeah, no problem. Let me ask Rick Klingensmith to come in on that.","Rick Klingensmith","Sure. Good morning Paul. On the line loss aspect that we had, where we increased the liability for this quarter, related to that activity. The line loss aspect was one that was in the regulatory period in the 2005 to 2010 timeframe. And the regulatory structure was such that, there was incentives and penalties that Ofgem had established around electricity and line losses for that period of time. And as we went through the process, there were certain incentives that had been earned and certain penalties that had been incurred by the distribution network operators. But there was not a significant amount of accuracy in the metering and the data that was being received that ultimately calculated what the line losses were. And so Ofgem has been working since the end of that rate review period, to determine a formulaic approach to how best to address that data issue, and determine what would be the appropriate formulas to determine incentives and penalties.","We had up to this point, up to this quarter, assumed that anything that we had received as incentives would ultimately be given back to customers and suppliers, and as the ultimate final determination came out of Ofgem this quarter, it was actually an increase in our liability, a penalty that was to be assessed, and so we needed to increase that liability by $65 million in the quarter. It was an item that was treated as a special item in the quarter, because it primarily related to the midlands businesses prior to our acquisition of those in 2011.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","So going forward though, you would now expect this to be an item we should be thinking about?","Rick Klingensmith","That is correct.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay. And then just back to -- I think it was Kit who had asked this. I am sorry if I missed it. What would you say was the total weather impact across the company?","Paul Farr","The total net weather impact, Paul, was $0.04 for the first quarter.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Thanks again.","William Spence","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neel Mitra at Tudor, Pickering.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Hey good morning. I was wondering if you could tell us kind of roughly, where your hedge percentages for supply in 2016, and where that's tracking versus ratable?","William Spence","Okay. Dave DeCampli, do you want to comment on that?","David DeCampli","We haven't published those in the past. We are still in that band of kind zero to 30% for year three. Until we -- historically, till we have gotten those hedge levels up to something that's more meaningful, we haven't provided those. We are in the band, and we are cognizant of the benefit that we have seen in the first quarter from rising prices. Some of the things that we have been forecasting to happen around higher heat rates, rises in gas prices, the incremental volatility that's showing up as a result of the winter weather. In certain instances, we are probably more at the lower end of our ranges, given some of the fundamentals actually starting to come through. So we are sticking to the three year strategy at this point.","William Spence","And we will provide that on the Q3 call for sure.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Got it. Thank you. And then the expected generation from the baseload fleet for 2014 has gone up roughly, a little bit over three terawatt hours since the last call. How much of that is due to this quarter, Q1 and can you comment on how the coal fleet ran in general, and then how much of that three terawatt hour increase is due to the rest of the year and the forward prices?","William Spence","Sure, Dave?","David DeCampli","Yeah. The majority of the increase is actually in the balance of the year. Not much of it was in the first quarter. The coal units were expected to run a good part of the winter. So what you're seeing is majority of that in the second half of the year. Dark spreads have improved. Most of that is going to be in the off-peak in the shoulder months where we hadn't originally planned to run those units. So with pricing as we are seeing, we expect that generation to occur in shoulder months at all peak, primarily. What was the other part of your question, there were two parts to it?","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","In capacity factors, how did the coal fleet run in the first quarter versus the first quarter of last year?","David DeCampli","Yeah. The fleet ran very well. We had just one outage in the -- one forced outage, back in early January, that lasted for 24, 26 hours. But beyond that, the coal fleet ran at capacity through all the periods it was called for.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Okay. And then, to add to the questions about looking at the options on Supply, may be I can ask it a different way. It seems like a lot of the value which you can receive from a third party would be from, possibly synergies or cutting O&M costs. So when you look at the various options, do you prefer a spin or a partnership, versus an outright sale? What's the best way to actually participate in some of the synergies or O&M cuts, which could substantially add value to supply?","David DeCampli","My only preference is to seek the highest value for the shareowners. Whatever form that comes in, it would be our objective. So I am reluctant to comment on any particular type or style of objective there, because there are various options, and we are open to considering the ones that are going to create the highest value.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Okay. Thank you very much.","David DeCampli","Sure.","Operator","Next question comes from Paul Ridzon at KeyBanc.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Just a real small question. What was the impact in Pennsylvania, the change in estimate?","Paul Farr","Paul, the change in estimate was reversal of storm costs accrual that we put on the books last year, that we got positive results from the commission. 11 of the 12 months we had accrued last year, we were not required to refund to consumers, so it was just adjusting that liability down.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Can you quantify it?","Paul Farr","A penny.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you very much.","Paul Farr","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question comes from Michel Lapides at Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Hey guys. Congrats on a good quarter. Two questions, a little bit unrelated after the more complex one first. I want to pay you a compliment, and that you are one of the only companies back in 2010-2011 timeframe, who made via corporate actions, meaning via M&A, a call on your view of, at least a three to five year view on merchant power, when you bought both the Kentucky businesses and you bought the U.K. business. In other words, kudos for making that call. It showed insight that I think a lot of other folks didn't show in terms of a three to five year view on merchant power in general.","I now want to ask, if you look three to five years and then look longer term, in general, what's your near term or medium term view on merchant power and then long term view?","William Spence","Sure. On the near to mid term view, I think its more or less unchanged from what we said on prior quarters, which is that we did not believe that forward prices were truly reflective of the supply and demand fundamentals, and the looming coal retirements that we had anticipated. And I think this winter highlighted how tight the supply and demand could be, when you remove some of that coal from the dispatch stack. So the movements that we have seen in power prices in the forwards now, essentially reflect our fundamental view that we have held for quite a while now. ","If you look longer term, I think strategically, you still are going to have a fairly volatile complex in the power and natural gas sectors. So I think as you know, natural gas is a significant driver to the power markets, and we continue to see a lot of uncertainty in the gas markets which will drive uncertainty in the power market. So I think our view, while it has improved, it has improved towards our fundamental view, A. And B, perhaps it has improved even beyond that, and may be things will be significantly better than we are all anticipating in the longer term. However, its still going to be, I think, a volatile ride in our view, and one that you just have to ensure that you are prepared to survive.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Do you guys have a view whether its for purchasing gas -- do you have a view on gas basis differentials, kind of in and around your part of PJM? I am just kind of looking at what's happening at TETCO versus NYMEX over the last -- really over the last six or nine months, both in the spot market and in the forward markets, where TETCO or Marcellus gas had been in a sizeable discount, is actually trading a little bit about Henry Hub?","William Spence","I think our view would be shaped by the timing of a lot of the pipeline expansion projects that are attempting to deliver the Marcellus shale and the other Eastern shale into the key markets, namely the mid-Atlantic and northeast markets. In terms of a specific view on MMBTU in basis, we don't really have a particular viewpoint, a strong viewpoint I should say, on that.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Last one, unrelated to the merchant markets. When you look across your businesses, which ones do you think have the greatest opportunities over a multiyear period for O&M cost management, and which ones will be a little harder to implement O&M cost savings?","William Spence","I think there's opportunities across the board, but I don't know that any particular group is easy or more difficult than another. So we attempt to be as efficient as we can across the board. So I don't know that I can specifically say that there is one group or another that's any more equipped or better prepared to embark on significant cost cutting. I think our number one priority in terms of aggressive control of costs is really around the supply business as it needs to be.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Okay, thanks guys and congrats on a good quarter.","William Spence","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Gregg Orrill at Barclays.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital","Thank you. I was wondering if you could touch base on Kentucky and what your thoughts there are in terms of the timing of rate case filing?","William Spence","Okay, sure Greg. Vic, why don't you?","Victor Staffieri","I think its likely that we will make a rate case filing by the end of the year.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Steven Fleishman at Wolfe Research.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Trahan","Yeah hi. Good morning.","William Spence","Good morning Steve.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Trahan","Hey Bill. So just a question on hedging. It look like you added a decent amount of hedging for 2015, and the average hedge price in the East came down a decent amount. Is that just kind of the prices you hedged and may be a bit early in the year, is there something else that occurred, that would explain that?","William Spence","Dave can provide some color around that.","David DeCampli","Steve its primarily -- the focus of our hedging recently has been on off-peak hour, and we got aggressive there, that's why you see the pull down in price.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Trahan","Got you. So would you say that the 30% that's still open for 2015 is very weighted towards peak?","David DeCampli","Actually, it has gotten fairly close to even at this point.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Trahan","Okay. And then, sorry to ask a PJM question, but just, one of the things this year is, there is a PTL zone that has been created. I mean, do you think that there is a decent chance that that zone separates, and why was it created?","William Spence","Well I think it was probably created around the challenges that coal plants in particular face, and looking at the region around our Brunner Island station, I think PJM felt that it may be there is a need there to send the price signal. But its really hard to judge Steve, whether that zone will break out in this auction or not. So we don't really have an expectation necessarily that it will. But again, a lot of volatility in the parameters coming into this auction compared to others, and then, as I mentioned on an earlier question, the bidding behavior, we are expecting to be probably different than it probably has been in the past.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Trahan","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani at Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just talk about the excess leverage investment capacity you have today, and hypothetically, if you were to exit the merchant power business, what that does to that capacity, just given lower business risk?","William Spence","Paul, why don't you?","Paul Farr","Hi Rajeev, this is Paul. I guess the way I would think about things is, we are at our targeted credit metrics across the complex. The internal cash flow that we generate is basically going to from all of the business and Supply is obviously a cash flow positive contributor, is going towards rate base growth and maintaining equity ratio at the utilities, as they deploy that significant amount of CapEx that we have in the schedule and in the appendix, and going to pay the dividend, which we recently announced an increase on.","So I don't feel uncomfortable with where we are at from a balance sheet perspective in any way. If there was a structural separation of the Supply business, I don't want to pre-judge what the rating agencies would do as they evaluate that. But clearly, to Bill's earlier comment, you'd be taking out the most volatile risky component of the enterprise, and the remaining pieces that are left, should be able to live with, lower -- at that point, consolidated FFO to debt metrics.","Obviously, the Supply business is high for a reason, it reflects that volatility. In pre or post, some type of structural event if you will, I think the company is in very good shape.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then a follow-up on the U.K. side, can you just talk about some of the pluses and minuses around your guidance that you have provided before? I think it was for 2015, 2016 and may be where you are within those ranges, or even outside of them?","William Spence","Okay. Rick?","Rick Klingensmith","Sure. Good morning. We had provided back, July 1 of last year, when we submitted our business plans into the RIO-ED1 process, some outlooks associated with 2015 and 2016 ranges. And as we went through the RIO process, gotten through the final determination. Got through the effects of the cost of equity changes, incorporated the fast track benefits that we are getting from that and updated our spending and our pension expense and currency hedging programs, we expect that the earnings are within the ranges that we had provided, but likely at the higher end of the ranges in 2015 and 2016.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley","Great. That was it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Greg Gordon at ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","My question was just asked and answered. Thank you.","William Spence","Great. Amy, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay. Then our last question will come from Brian Chin at Merrill Lynch.","Brian Chin - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Hi good morning.","William Spence","Good morning.","Brian Chin - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Just a minor one, on slide 16, the projected CapEx, there was a small uptick in corporate CapEx versus the last set of slides, just what is that?","Paul Farr","Rounding. Its just extremely minor, typically in that bucket, its primarily IT expenditures for corporate platforms that get spread across the enterprise. So just very small modifications to how we see the timing of certain projects.","Brian Chin - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Got you. Great. That's it. Thank you very much.","Paul Farr","Thank you. Sure.","William Spence","Okay operator, thank you very much; and PPL, as we just talked about, had a very strong quarter, and we continue to execute on all fronts. We thank you for joining us today, and look forward to talking to you on our Q2 earnings call.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. Now I'd like to turn the conference over to Joe Bergstein, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.","Joe Bergstein","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the PPL conference call on second quarter results and our general business outlook. We are providing slides of this presentation on our website at www.pplweb.com.","Any statements made in this presentation about future operating results or other future events are forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from such forward-looking statements. A discussion of factors that could cause actual results or events to differ is contained in the appendix to this presentation and in the company's SEC filings.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Spence, PPL Chairman, President and CEO.","William H. Spence","Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. With me on the call this morning for the first time is Vince Sorgi, PPL's new Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Welcome, Vince. Also on the call to answer your questions, are the presidents of our 4 business segments. As I noted with the talent announcement, Paul Farr has assumed the role of President for PPL Energy Supply through the transition process and will become CEO of Talen, post spin.","Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning starts with an overview of second quarter earnings and operational results and an update on our 2014 earnings forecast, which we have raised for the second time this year. After my remarks, Vince will review our segment financial results, then Paul will provide an update on the progress of the supply spinoff. We will then open the phones to your questions.","Turning to Slide 4. Today we announced reported earnings of $0.34 per share for the second quarter, a decrease from $0.63 per share in the second quarter of 2013.","Adjusting for special items are earnings from ongoing operations were $0.53 per share in the quarter, an 8% increase over last year's second quarter ongoing earnings of $0.49 per share.","Strong performance at each of our regulated utilities with stronger margins from our competitive Energy Supply business led to very solid results through the first half of the year. Year-to-date, reported earnings were $0.83 per share, compared to a $1.28 per share in the first half of 2013.","Earnings per share from ongoing operations for the first half of the year were $1.33 per share, compared with $1.20 per share in the same period a year ago. The strong year-to-date increase in ongoing earnings was driven in part by a combined $69 million from our domestic utilities, driven by returns on additional transmission investments in Pennsylvania and on power plant environmental projects in Kentucky.","Let's move to Slide 5 for an update on our 2014 ongoing earnings forecast. I'm pleased to say that today we are increasing the forecast to $2.20 per share to $2.40 per share. As you can see in the segment information on this slide, the forecast increase is primarily driven by strong performance from our Supply segment, which is driven largely by expected margin improvements from our baseload assets.","As noted in our news release this morning, we benefited from unrealized gains on certain forward commodity positions during the first half of the year, primarily in the second quarter. However, we expect the majority of this to reverse in the second half of the year and have incorporated this reversal into our updated forecast. We also see a slight uptick in the U.K. Regulated segment.","Now let's turn to Slide 6 for an update of our regulated operations. For the third year in a row, PPL Electric Utilities has ranked highest amount large electric utilities in the Eastern United States for residential customer satisfaction in a study by J.D. Power. The award is the Utilities' 22nd from J.D. Power and the 11th for residential customer satisfaction alone. With this award, PPL's domestic companies, PPL Electric Utilities, LG&E, KU and PPL EnergyPlus have won a total of 38 J.D. Power awards, more than any other company in the country.","And in the U.K., our 4 operating utilities capture the top 4 spots for customer service and satisfaction in the regulators' rankings for the year ended March 31, 2014. This exemplary record of customer service continues to provide benefits for our customers and for our shareowners.","In another key development, PPL Electric Utilities filed a plan with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission on June 30, seeking approval to replace existing electric meters with new smart meters that will improve service to customers and fully comply with state metering requirements. The project will cost about $450 million, of which about $300 million has been reflected in our capital expenditure forecast, included in the appendix of today's presentation. Under our proposal, installation would begin in 2017, with all new meters in service by the end of 2019.","Also this morning, we announced a PPL Electric Utilities proposal to PJM, as part of the competitive solicitation process under FERC Order 1000. As currently proposed, the 500 kV transmission line would run about 725 miles from Western Pennsylvania into New York and New Jersey, and also south into Maryland. The project is in the preliminary planning stages. The new line would improve electric service reliability, enhance grid security and enable the development of new gas-fired power plants in the shale gas regions of Northern Pennsylvania. The proposal would create savings for millions of electric customers by delivering lower cost electricity into the region and reducing grid-congesting cost. According to preliminary estimates, the cost of the project, which is not yet included in our CapEx projections, would be between $4 billion and $6 billion. Because of the magnitude of this proposal, there is a good chance we may enter into partnerships to develop and build the project. The preliminary timeline envisions completion of the project by 2023 to 2025, assuming all necessary approvals are received and construction begins in 2017. Approvals are needed from various regulatory and regional planning entities. We'll keep you posted on any further developments.","Moving to Slide 7. You'll see that weather-normalized sales for the quarter in Pennsylvania and Kentucky were in line with our 0.5% load growth forecast.","In Kentucky, we're starting to see some improvement in our commercial sales, and our industrial sales continue to grow, driven by expanded production from the steel and auto industrial segments. On the residential side, weather-normalized sales were lower for the quarter, but were offset on an actual basis by weather effects, given a significant increase in cooling degree days in May and June, compared to 2013.","In Pennsylvania, residential customer use increased due to higher customer accounts compared to a year ago, and higher use per account. Industrial sales also continue to show improvements over 2013, as the steel and cement sectors posted solid increases in demand. The commercial sector slowed a bit in the quarter after a strong first quarter, which leaves weather-normalized growth flat year-to-date.","Moving to Slide 8. Our Supply segment performed very well in the second quarter with improved capacity factors versus last year at almost all of our major Eastern facilities. Our Eastern coal units operated at an average capacity factor of 64%, which was a 9% increase over the second quarter of 2013. This was driven by an unplanned outage at Montour last year and improved demand in PJM. The combined cycle gas units also ran very well achieving an average capacity factor of 98%, a significant improvement over last year, due to a planned maintenance outage at Ironwood in 2013. Finally, Susquehanna Nuclear's capacity factor improved for the quarter by 17%, due to the timing of outages in the first half of 2013 compared to 2014.","On the turbine blade issues, we have installed newly designed blades this spring on Unit 1 at Susquehanna during its scheduled refueling and maintenance outage. Early results have been positive, as we've seen a significant reduction in blade vibration on the turbine that received the new shorter blades. We will continue to analyze the unit's performance over the course of the year. Pending the results of a full analysis and the vendor's final assessment of a root cause, our plan is to install the newly designed blades on Unit 2 during its scheduled refueling outage next spring. In the meantime, we will continue to monitor blade vibrations and appropriately inspect potentially cracked blades and replace them as necessary, as we've done safely and effectively operate the facility in the past.","Moving on to the pending sale of the Montana hydro facilities to NorthWestern Energy. Regulatory review of the transaction continues. The Montana Public Service Commission continues its review and recently completed its hearings as scheduled. And just last week, FERC approved the transfer for the Kerr Dam hydro license, which had been pending since March, when all of the others had received FERC approval to be transferred to NorthWestern. We do not expect the sale to close before the fourth quarter of 2014, and as a reminder, PPL will retain the proceeds from the sale.","We're also making very good progress in our spinoff of our Energy Supply business, which we announced in early June. We've completed nearly all of the required regulatory filings and we have transition teams up and running. We remain on track to complete the transaction, which will create a new publicly traded company call Talen Energy in the first or second quarter of 2015.","Finally, we continue to execute at a very high level and remain focused on delivering value for shareowners. I am very pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date results, which allows us to increase our earnings guidance again and we continue to target at least 4% compound annual growth in earnings per share, excluding Energy Supply. I look forward to your questions and I'll now turn the call over to Vince.","Vincent Sorgi","Thanks, Bill. And good morning, everyone. Great to be with you on my first earnings call.","Let's start with a more detailed financial review on Slide 9. PPL's second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased over last year, driven primarily by improved earnings at our Supply segment and at both of our domestic utilities. The U.K. Regulated segment was $0.02 lower than 2013, with weather being a contributing factor.","Let's move to the detailed segment review with the U.K. results on Slide 10. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.33 per share in the second quarter, a $0.02 decrease from last year. This decrease was due to higher U.S. income taxes from a positive adjustment in 2013 related to a favorable IRS ruling on prior year's earnings and profits calculation. We had higher depreciation from assets placed in service and higher financing costs from higher debt balances. The decline in earnings was partially offset by higher utility revenues due primarily to the net result of higher prices and lower volumes due to weather. We also had lower O&M driven by lower pension expense.","Moving to Slide 11. Kentucky earned $0.09 per share in the second quarter, a $0.01 cent increase compared to a year ago. This increase was driven by higher margins from additional environmental capital investment, partially offset by higher O&M due to the timing of coal plant maintenance and higher storm expenses.","Turning to Slide 12. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.08 per share in the quarter, a $0.01 increase compared to last year. This increase was primarily the result of higher transmission margins, driven by additional capital investment.","Moving to Slide 13. Our competitive generation segment earned $0.06 per share in the second quarter, an increase of $0.05 compared to last year. This increase was primarily the result of higher Eastern energy margins, driven by improved baseload availability from Susquehanna and also our coal fleet, both primarily driven by outage timing. We also had higher capacity prices and $0.04 of unrealized gains on certain forward commodity positions. These positive drivers were partially offset by lower hedge baseload energy prices.","On Slide 14, we provided an update to the U.K. earnings projections for 2014 to 2016, reflecting a significant improvement from expectations in July of 2013, when we filed our real business plans with Ofgem. For 2014, our strong U.K. performance is incorporated into the increased guidance that Bill mentioned in his remarks. Our 2015 midpoint of $1.36 was communicated in June, when we announced the Supply business spin and provided our 2015 earnings forecast for PPL, excluding the Supply business.","For 2016, we are showing an $0.11 increase from the midpoint provided last July, primarily driven by lower projected O&M cost, including lower network maintenance expenses and lower pension expenses, as well as the projected improved currency exchange rate, which is based on an average rate of $1.67 per pound compared to $1.58 assumed last year. These benefits are expected to be partially offset by lower revenues from the final RIIO-ED1 revenue determination, as well as higher interest expense.","On Slide 15, we show the updated projections of cash repatriations from WPD back to the U.S. for the 2014 to '16 time period. We continue to expect strong cash flows from WPD, as we transition from the current regulatory period to RIIO-ED1 beginning in April of 2015.","That completes the more detailed financial overview. And I will now turn the call over to Paul, for a brief update on the progress being made on the Supply spinoff. Paul?","Paul A. Farr","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. My update today will be pretty quick. We've been extremely busy since the June 9 announcement.","And on Slide 16, we outlined some of the major milestones and activities currently underway. Last week, we received commitments for a new $1.85 billion 5-year revolving credit facility for Talen Energy, that will be available when the transaction closes.","Earlier this month, Riverstone successfully executed its planned $1.25 billion bond offering to refinance the project-level debt at Raven, Jade and Sapphire. This debt will be assumed by PPL Energy Supply when the generation businesses are merged. The bonds carry a 5-year maturity and a 5.125% coupon subject to a 50-basis-point step down, if Talen achieves certain targeted credit ratings at the time of the merger.","Finally, we completed 3 of the 4 planned regulatory filings this month. We filed a Section 203 application with FERC, citing 2 separate market mitigation proposals, an application with the NRC for the indirect transfer of the Susquehanna nuclear licenses and an application with the PaPUC here in Pennsylvania for the change of control of the IEC pipeline utility just yesterday. The DOJ filing is on schedule for the fall this year, given their review process.","This progress keeps us on schedule for an expected closing of Q1 or Q2 next year, as Bill mentioned. And we'll keep you updated along the way. With that, I will turn it over to Bill for the Q&A session.","William H. Spence","Thank you, Paul. And operator, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Kit Konolige with BGC.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to follow a little bit on the new guidance with respect to Supply. Can you go into a little more detail about -- I am not sure I completely understood the second quarter showed gains on mark-to-market that reverses later this year. But the net is still better for the year, if I understand it. And then can you also address what kind of hedging actions you took looking forward during the second quarter.","William H. Spence","Sure, but you're absolutely right. We expect some of the gains that we experienced in the second quarter, there were -- in the middle of the year. But still it would be a net positive. Vince can probably provide a bit color on the exact numbers there. So...","Vincent Sorgi","Sure, Kit. Thanks for the question. Yes, the Supply, $0.06 is really -- you could think of it, half of it is just improved margins from the baseload, $0.03. And the other half is improved M&T margins, $0.02 of which is coming from the unrealized gains.","William H. Spence","Yes. Okay. And Paul, do you want to cover the other part of the question?","Paul A. Farr","Yes. Kit, when you look in the back, in the appendix, that it looked like our hedges decreased in 2015. That's primarily because on a economic dispatch modeling basis, with the improved prices that we saw in the second quarter, more generation was economic. And so, there just simply more generation. Given our target hedging program, kind of 1 year forward to be about 75% hedged, looking forward to the transaction, we're pretty much on schedule with those hedge levels. So we weren't doing a significant amount of hedging for '15. We did do some for '16, though, on that 25% year-to-mark.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","And well, just to follow on that a little bit, do you expect the new Talen hedging strategy to be similar to that or will that be a whole new ballgame?","Paul A. Farr","Yes, that will be pretty close to that at 75%, 1 year; 25%, second year. We're also doing 100% of the retail in utility load following hedging out of the generation book, which is a little bit different. And one way to think about that is, we'll just simply be constrained from a liquidity perspective. We're basically increasing the amount of generation that has to be hedged by about 50%, with a 50% reduction between the size of liquidity facilities and cash that we've got. So it's just -- it's a liquidity-targeting exercise. Just like it was when it was Energy Supply, but we had bigger facilities and a smaller fleet.","Operator","And the next question comes from Dan Eggers with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Bill, can you maybe get a little bit more into this transmission project today? I guess, kind of how the process works from announcing, looking at something to where we'll see action. What kind of dollars you have to spend upfront? And then, if you look at the challenges you guys had with Roseland and other folks have had in the past, trying to build these new Pennsylvania East type of transmission lines, how you guys think you're going to approach it to make it a higher chance of success?","William H. Spence","Sure. So the processes itself is one that's not been well traveled in the past, as you know. It's a relatively new process. So we'll continue to work with all the stakeholders to make sure that we do everything in our power to make sure that we get this approved on a -- as timely a basis as we can. Maybe I'll ask Greg to take you through kind of what we understand to be some of the key milestones and processes we have to do to make this a reality, so, Greg?","Gregory N. Dudkin","Yes, thanks. So first off is the filings. So PJM had a window that just closed recently. So this project, Project Compass, was filed as part of that window. As far as the approvals are concerned, so this project not only is part of PJM, but also goes into the New York ISO, still need approvals from both entities. Also we'll need state approvals, as well as utility commission approvals. So for me, what increases the probability of success is just the compelling nature of this project. When you think about what's happened in the industry over the past year, the polar vortex, substation security being a big issue, coal retirements being a big issue. This project really pulls all those issues together and provides significant benefits to the consumers in the region. So I think it's the compelling nature of the benefits of this project that will help the project move forward. We are putting together an outreach plan. In fact, I've started this morning to get people that will be involved in the project, up to speed and be looking to work with others to make sure that this is a success.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So we should -- this will be, I guess, probably a little quiet from our perspective for -- in a period of time, while you get your ducks in a row. Is that kind of how we should think about it?","Gregory N. Dudkin","Yes, I would say so. Because of all the entities we have to work with my sense is that we have a better idea about the timeline as far as approvals probably by the end of this year. But it should be fairly quiet from your perspective.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then the money you guys are putting into it now, is there a route for recovery if this is not successful or is this money you guys are burying on PPL for the time being?","Gregory N. Dudkin","Yes, this is something that is not recoverable. So we'll -- if it doesn't go forward, then we'll just had to eat that.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess just, Paul, just a logistical question, but with the work that's actually done on Susquehanna is still next year and the timing of the IPO, how have you guys arranged to source the funding on the capital both for the outage and also for the work that's got to get done?","Paul A. Farr","Yes. So when we signed the transaction documents with Riverstone, basically at that time, the 2 companies are pretty much economically tied at the hip. From the standpoint of the cash that's generated by the business, except for the payment of shared services, taxes and a fixed dividend stream, the cash stays in the business. So it's the cash that will be there at close. It's cash from the mitigation with whichever of the 2 packages we pursue and sell those assets. It's the liquidity facilities that we have in place. So there's very ample liquidity to fund an outage. And remember, all of the capital expenditures that relate to equipment replacement are under warranty with Siemens, and that's on their nickel and not ours.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, just -- can you remind what the process is going to be determine which package of assets gets chosen for sale and what we should watch the timeline for that happening?","Paul A. Farr","Well, we requested 2 different packages. So just to remind everybody, the first package is the Sapphire. Most of the Sapphire portfolio from Riverstone and the Ironwood plant. The second package is than same Sapphire portion of the portfolio, the Crane facility in Baltimore and the Holtwood Wallenpaupack facilities here in Pennsylvania. We will be approaching the market even in advance of receiving approvals to gauge investor interest and we'll move forward with both packages and determine which of those has the best outcome from a share and value perspective for Talen shareowners. They look at the relative level of EBITDA and cash flow that the asset portfolios generate versus sale proceeds that we think we can secure in an auction process.","Operator","And the next question comes from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So the U.K., the guidance range in the U.K. to now at $1, was it $1.30 to a $1.42, and the final guidance range was $1.17 to $1.33. I think the last comment you made was that you'd be at the high end of that prior guidance range. So what can you tell us in terms of how we should think about where you'll fall out in 2016 within the $1.30 or $1.42? What are the key drivers that would swing you towards the low end or the high end there?","William H. Spence","Okay, let me ask Rick Klingensmith to respond to that question.","Rick L. Klingensmith","Sure. In 2016, the midpoint of the range is $1.36. And as Vince mentioned, significant drivers that get us there have been lower revenues, but offset by O&M reductions as well. But it's been predominantly tax planning has helped us, currency has helped us as we're now forecasting $1.67 per pound versus $1.58 per pound, and lower pension expense has helped us as well to keep us within the high end and actually surpass the range that we provided you last July to where the ranges are today. And so it would really be changes in those assumptions that would drive us to the high or low end of the range that you see for 2016, around that $1.36 midpoint. So those are the major factors that were driving that.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Have you substantially hedged the position on currency or is that just sort of a mark-to-market?","Rick L. Klingensmith","In 2016, we're about 56% hedged at a rate of about $1.66. And so the unhedged portion, about half of it remains as an open position for currency in 2016.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Do you have a sensitivity on the remaining position?","Rick L. Klingensmith","On the remaining position of sort of a $0.05 change in currency, it's about approximately $12 million change in earnings.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I also noticed that the rate base slide -- the rate base numbers for the total regulated side of the business are up substantially, but that's all on the U.K. side of the business?","Rick L. Klingensmith","That correct and that's all currency driven. So the change in assumption from that $1.58 to $1.67 is the change in the dollar value of those. There has been no change in the pound component of the RAV or the CapEx.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. And a question for you, Paul. As we look at Talen, you're one of the generating companies that's the most exposed to a widening basis in the Northeast, both positive and negatively lead to the negative. Can you tell your investors sort of what's the strategy? Are you going to run substantially open in that business in order to not -- in order to capture volatility and avoid having to sort of hedge in at these weak current forward curves? I mean, how do we think about it, if we're trying to value that entity and we're using the forward curve as a base case? That's not a very good base case, so how do we get comfortable that there's a good business proposition there, given current market conditions?","Paul A. Farr","Where we're sitting, I mean, on a peak basis at least, do you focus on '15 or '16. We're sitting pretty much right between where we started the year and the peak of the prices kind of that we saw in the June type time frame. We're still seeing on a gas-basis perspective some of the benefits from the polar vortex in the winter period. In the summer period. If you look at gas, it's a bit softer, whether you look at TETCO or whether you look at Marcellus base numbers, we have not simply not had. So we had extraordinary weather in January, and we've had literally no summer yet. So we've had no -- while no summer here and we're just starting to have a summer in Texas. So I think when you think about the pricing, I still think that the low 50 -- 50 to 52, 53 on a peak basis numbers are achievable. I think we'll see another rally as we get towards winter, as we typically do in that time of the year. We are, as you said, not compulse to hedge. And as I mentioned, when I answered an earlier question, simply on a liquidity basis, our targets are much lower than they were when inside PPL and trying to derisk that as much as we could. We simply won't be able to given that we'll have lower liquidity to post as collateral against the hedge positions. And we do want to run more open, as you indicated, to take advantage of price improvements when they come.","Operator","And the next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So with regards to divestment process. I'd be curious, why more than 1 gigawatt? I mean, I suppose, is this just driven by your analysis about what's necessary? Or was there kind of any market view there about trying to get rid of portfolios in the entire of the year, just -- any other reason there?","Paul A. Farr","Julien, this is Paul. There really is -- there's no change. When we talked about it on the day of the announcement, we talked about a 1,000 megawatts of baseload equivalent. When you look at the Sapphire portfolio, which is simple cycle and combined cycle, it's less efficient combined cycle plants, oil and gas in Jersey. When you look at Ironwood today, as Bill indicated, at 98% capacity factor, has more baseload. The Crane plant has a very low capacity factor on an annual basis. And then the hydros are 55% to 60% run on river plants. It's just when you do the math, that gets you each of them to a 1,000 megawatts of baseload equivalent. They happen to be roughly the same in terms of total megawatts at 13 50-ish but, but it's really the equivalency that, that we're trying to get to.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Excellent. And could you talk a little bit to your coal hedging? I mean, that seems to switch around a little bit here, but perhaps that might be due to the generation?","William H. Spence","It's generation related, that's correct.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. Excellent. And just to clarify here in terms of what you were saying before, the CapEx changes entirety are due strictly to the FX change, right? There is nothing fundamental underlying that at all, right?","William H. Spence","That's correct.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. Excellent. And just to be clear as well, when you're thinking about the process, I suppose there's a little bit of uncertainty there. You wouldn't expect that the change as the rest of the process of those who were not fast-tracked ultimately get their decisions out. The CapEx is not likely change at that point either?","William H. Spence","No, there would be no change.","Operator","And the next question comes from Neel Mitra of Tudor, Pickering.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Question on the transmission project. It looks like the map you provided, the starting points are really kind of where the new CCGTs, that are announced for PJM in '16 and '17, are being built. Is the -- is kind of the economic reason for the project that some of those gas plants that are going to be built right on top of the shales, they just don't have enough transmission capacity to get to where they need to, to provide reliability? Or is there another real economic benefit that I'm not seeing?","William H. Spence","Well, there's a number of potential benefits, and I'll let Greg describe some of those. But that clearly could be one of them, but there are others as well.","Gregory N. Dudkin","Got it. And so, I would say when we are -- when potential generators come to us, one of the issues is they need to obviously connect to our transmission. And in some cases, that can be very, very high cost. So part of the thinking on the economics is if we sited through the region, the cost to connect for those generators would be much less. So again with potential coal retirements, we think there's economic advantage for that on a going-forward basis. And we use pretty conservative assumptions around generation retirements. But beyond that, there are reliability benefits. Again, we talked about substation security. There are benefits that, actually, we didn't really factor in the economics. But I think there'll be a significant economic benefit there, reduced congestion. So all that, when you factor all those together, it is a significant positive economic benefit to the consumers.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then a question for Paul. With Talen, I think, you mentioned that you'd want to expand in west PJM in Texas, and wanted just to question on how you think about timing for acquiring assets? Would you do it before the spinoff? And what's -- when you look at the market, what's the optimal time to be buying assets? Would you rather be buying right now with what's up for sale? Or would you rather wait till next year?","Paul A. Farr","Well, we're following all the processes that are going on right now. So we know everything that's on the market. We think we know what's coming on the market in fall and in spring. So we're actively following it, and if there was something that was compelling, there wouldn't be anything, provided we reached a consensus around that. With Riverstone, there wouldn't be anything that would prevent us from approaching the market right now. So I think anything that's in PJM that would have the potential to complicate any aspect of the regulatory approval processes, especially when we've got known market power issues to deal with, it probably wouldn't be a high probability. But as we move through time and we secure those approvals and they agree with the mitigation plans provided that the area of PJM we'd be buying in, wouldn't further complicate that, there'd be no problem there. So we're actively watching that, as we said, right now. But as I said, we've got the hydro sale process underway in Montana. We're looking at some other potential noncore asset disposals. We've got the mitigation processes that we're going to be evaluating as well, so the deal team has quite a bit on the plate already, as well. So we'll be judicious.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","So when you talk about not complicating the divestment process, would West PJM complicate that? Or would that be separate from 10 of the Central East PJM divestitures you're looking at?","Paul A. Farr","Yes. I mean, as long as we're well west of 50 or 4 50 or 5, then I think that wouldn't complicate things. So yes, we wouldn't be against it if the right opportunity came along.","Operator","And the next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a question. I think when you announced the Talen spin, you talked about an aspiration of growth out of the ongoing PPL of at least 4%. Can you talk about the new transmission projects in the context of that? And are you -- are there other things you're working on that might be kind of closer at hand than this? This is obviously a fairly long way out that might enable you to give us a bit more clarity around sort of where in that north of 4% range you'd expect to be over some reasonable period of time?","William H. Spence","Sure. I would say that the 4% minimum that we articulated upon the announcement of Talen spin for the regulated businesses did not reflect anything of the magnitude of this type of project that we're talking about here. So this would certainly add to that growth trajectory, if you will. Should it be approved and ultimately started, of course. It is, further out on the horizon. Relative to where the growth will come from, I think, it's -- there's nothing, I think, magical about where's it going to come from. It's really executing the business plans we have. We've provided today, as you know, some updated guidance on the U.K., which is improved from previous guidance. And then, we'll continue to execute, I think transmission and distribution opportunities in Pennsylvania, as well as a lot of our environmental CapEx spending in Kentucky, all of which, I think is pretty transparent and visible in the CapEx plans and the rate base growths that we've articulated. So I think we have a very good plan to achieve the minimum 4%. I don't think it requires a lot of heavy lifting or Herculean assumptions for us to get there. I think it's a very achievable plan and one that we're committed to.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Bill, can you just remind me what -- did you articulate a specific base from which that was? We should think about that?","William H. Spence","Yes, we did. The base was on 2015, so -- I'm sorry, 2014, x Supply, so we provided the numbers there. And so it's off that base.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, just on -- I think you just -- I think in another question, you gave the answer to how hedged you are on U.K. currency for 2016. How about 2015?","William H. Spence","2015, we're at 98% hedged at an average rate of $1.63.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then just one final thing on there. You guys have typically excluded mark-to-market type moves in the Supply business. What's the reason for leaving in this $0.04 this quarter?","Paul A. Farr","Yes, let me take that one. This is Paul. So we've done financial transactions supported by third-party generation in the past. This one just simply didn't meet the accounting designation for carve-out in that policy for us. And so just based on our internal accounting policies, it flows through. But as Vince said, there is only a very small amount of it that is in the forecast for the end of the year. And as things have come off from a price and smart-grid perspective, even in the July-type time frame, some of that benefits already been reverted out since June.","Operator","And the next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","A lot of my questions have been answered. But just -- and I know it's some way off in the future here, but when the transmission line is built, what do you expect it to do to the market? Is there any basis differential or any sort of impact you could sort of suggest, that sort of in the ballpark, that would happen as a result of these major projects.","William H. Spence","Yes, as you can imagine, because it is so far out and there's so many moving pieces, coal retirements, how many new gas pipelines may be built to move shale gas away from the constrained areas, and so forth, that we really don't have a forecast that we could point you to suggest which way prices would move as a result of this transmission project.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And no part of the project is going to be really done before 2023, is that correct?","William H. Spence","That's our target. So with it, the earliest would be 2023.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just on the tax valuation. I'm sorry if I missed this. What actually sort of drove that impact? What happened there?","William H. Spence","Sure. I'll let Vince take that one.","Vincent Sorgi","Sure. What happened was we have net operating loss carryforwards for tax assets related to those sitting at the parent company of Energy Supply. And the earnings of Energy Supply were really supporting those assets on the books. And so when we announced the spin, it no longer -- we can no longer assert that those earnings would be able to support those deferred tax assets. And so we took the valuation allowance against those.","Operator","And the next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just real curious. Can you talk about PPL Corp.'s cash tax position for 2014 and maybe the next couple of years going forward through 2015, 2016, meaning how much of the cash taxpayer you expect to be relative to GAAP taxes? And does the Talen transaction impact that at all?","William H. Spence","Yes, Vince wants to take that.","Vincent Sorgi","Sure. So on a federal basis, our estimated tax position there would be basically 0, as a result of NOLs. And bonus depreciation still carryover effects from that, so it's very little.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And when would you expect to become a cash taxpayer again at the PPL Corp. level, post Talen spin?","Vincent Sorgi","I would say in the '17, '18 time frame.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. So cash taxes, a pretty big source of cash flow. How do you think about allocating that, meaning do you anticipate you would likely be utilizing that cash flow to help pay for rate base growth of some of the subs, to delever as well? I'm just trying to kind of think through that, because that's kind of a big number when you start getting to the out years.","Vincent Sorgi","Yes, so the cash flow -- that cash flow position just goes into our sources and uses of funds. And the largest use of our funds is our CapEx program and our rate base growth. And so, those -- that cash is being used to fund that growth.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Bill, just curious, when you walk across the different segments, what's your thought process just in terms of rate case timing at the U.S. Regulated businesses?","William H. Spence","Yes, so maybe I'll ask Greg and then Vic to talk about Pennsylvania and then Kentucky. Greg?","Gregory N. Dudkin","Yes, so as far as timing for Pennsylvania, we don't at this point, obviously, see a need for a rate case in '14, and we're looking at the possibility in '15.","Victor A. Staffieri","And in Kentucky, I think I've said before, we would anticipate some kind of rate case filed by the end of the year. And then, as we continue with our capital construction program, we would anticipate filing cases, probably every other year, thereafter. But we never -- much of our recovery of our capital expenditures is through our environmental recovery mechanism, so I'm talking about base rate cases here.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And Greg, in Pennsylvania, you're thinking just sometime in 2015 potential file of forward-looking test year for 2016?","Gregory N. Dudkin","That's correct. We haven't made a final determination, but if we do file, it would be a forward-looking test year.","Operator","And the next question comes from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Bill, a couple of questions. First, the updated guidance for '14. How are you incorporating the kind of mild July and it looks like maybe mild August, if at all, is that in there? Or are you using normal?","William H. Spence","I would say, we're predominantly using normal, but I don't think -- it remains to be seen what August is going to be at this point. But July, I don't think is going to have a meaningful impact on the range at this point.","Paul A. Farr","This is Paul. One other quick thing, remember, we're so heavily hedged this year, that to the extent that we see below normal weather, that's actually been a benefit for us, because instead of generating from some of our plants at higher prices, we're buy -- having the opportunity to either buy it from the market or run our gas plants, as cash gas has been so low. So around a number of ranges and assumptions of whether we feel really good about the supply numbers.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay, great. Second question is -- I'm not sure you can provide this, but just, is there any way you can give us any sense of kind of mark-to-market update numbers for Talen, given what's happened with pricing, for '15?","William H. Spence","Yes, let me ask Paul.","Paul A. Farr","Yes, that's -- it's really hard for us to do. We've given you in the appendix the updates to the hedge positions on fuel and on power. Due to any trust restrictions, we're not able to have access to the Riverstone side of the equation. So until we get to very close to close, we won't be able to provide updates relative to their base there.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. Understood. And just, in thinking about the utility growth rate, so the U.K. that you gave here is kind of flattish, '14 to '16. That 60% of your earnings, roughly, I think. So that mean the other 40% need to grow around 10% to get the 4%, overall? And I think you have a rate base growth to do that, but I just wanted to kind of make sure if I'm thinking about that right. And you feel good, you can get to that at the non-U.K.","William H. Spence","No, you're thinking about that exactly, correctly. And that's factored into how we get to the 4%. I mean, obviously, if we look at the domestic utilities, they're growing significantly in terms of EPS over the period. And we've got that flattish growth in U.K., that dilutes that a bit. But this still keeps us, I think, squarely in the ballgame in terms of many of our peers with the 4% minimum growth target for EPS. So we do feel good about our capability to achieve that even given the U.K. mix.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Just in the context of the peer regulated company going forward, you'll get that money in. Obviously, I think the U.K., otherwise funds itself. And then, you need to fund these rate base growth and the dividend. Can you just kind of talk about the overall utility funding plan without having any access to cash from supply?","William H. Spence","Sure. Vince, go ahead.","Vincent Sorgi","Sure. So I don't want to go too far out because obviously a lot of things change in terms of year-to-year cash flows and assumptions. But putting financing going into the next couple of years, we're pretty much set for 2014, domestically. We're not expecting any additional debt issuances there. Our funding plans do include the $1 billion of proceeds coming in 2014 about 900 coming from the Montana hydro sale, and then we just received in July the $108 million treasury grant from Holtwood. Both of those proceeds are staying with Corp. [ph], so they helped to fund that CapEx plan significantly going into '15. We have about $1 billion of debt coming due next year in the domestic utilities. And 900 of that is in Kentucky, another 100 of that is in EU. The Kentucky debt is 400 up at wholesale level. We'll just pay that off. And then we have 250 at each of the opcos first mortgage bonds. We'll just refinance those with first mortgage bonds down with the utilities, and the same thing with the $100 million at Electric Utilities, we'll just refinance with first mortgage bonds. So we'll do as much financing down at the opcos, as we can. If we need to adjust the cap structures, we'll do that up at cap funding, as we have been doing. And then we'll just maintain the credit metrics that we need to keep our investment-grade credit ratings really what we expect to come out of the uptick that we expect to get coming out of the Talen spin. No concerns from a financing plan assumption going forward.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we do have a question from Rajeev Lalwani from Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My first question is on the transmission project that you announced. Can you provide some insight on any competing projects that PJM is also looking at?","William H. Spence","At the moment, we're not aware of any competing projects. This is a very unique project, that I'm very proud of the team here that came up with the concept and the forward thinking to put something of this nature in front of PJM. So we're not aware of any competing projects. And the requests that PJM have had, have been smaller projects to basically address some relatively small reliability concerns. I think there 4 or 5 of them. And this project and I response to some of those, but it goes well beyond that. Again with something that we think is very unique and compelling from a stakeholder process -- perspective.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right. And just a question on the U.K. side. You've provided guidance through '16, and you've got relatively flattish earnings growth. Can you talk about beyond that period as you get into, I guess, the new rate cycle? What do you think growth can do there?","William H. Spence","Yes, we haven't provided forward growth estimates for the U.K. that far out at this point. But as you can imagine, there is a point at which the earnings will grow again, once we get through the dip, if you will, in this period, as the old rates roll off and old incentives roll off, and then as we begin to build the rate base, we'll see earnings growth further out in the plan. So there will be a dip and then a recovery over time. But we'll provide future guidance at a future date, but for right now, that's just generally speaking kind of the trajectory.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just lastly, kind of a higher-level question. You talked about M&A on the Talen side. Can you talk about M&A on this standalone or future standalone PPL side, whether you're looking to be an acquirer or maybe an acquiree? Just some thought there.","William H. Spence","Sure. While we would continue to look at opportunities to grow PPL post-Talen spin on the regulated side and think there will be opportunities over time whether we're successful or not, obviously remains to be seen. I think we have a very solid business plan that will, I think, improve earnings, as well as our stock price over time. So I can't really comment on whether we're a target or not and if we are, I think, we have a very solid plan and the best thing we can do is execute the plan and continue to meet expectations, which we've got a very solid track record of doing, so. But certainly, we would consider M&A. We don't want to maintain our relative size at a minimum to maintain our relevancy in the sector as a large cap electric utility. So I think, generally speaking, that is probably all I can say at this point.","Operator, we're approaching our time limit. And I know it's a busy day of earnings for everybody, so we'll take one more question.","Operator","And that comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Okay, so I have 3 questions. One is, could you comment about your power hedges for the PPL Supply beyond '15. Did you add any hedges to your '16 or '17 positions?","William H. Spence","Paul?","Paul A. Farr","Yes, I did mention earlier that we didn't do a lot of hedging activity in the quarter for '15, but we did layer in positions as we saw the strength in power prices in the quarter for '16. I mentioned a 25% target there and we're meaningfully on our way to getting to that level.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Perfect. Separately, on the utilities, could you talk about your dividend growth prospects after the other spinoff of PPL to buy?","William H. Spence","Sure. So when we announced the Talen transaction, I mentioned on the call, that we would continue to maintain the current dividend and look for opportunities to grow it over time with the expectation that meaningful growth could come after we get through the large CapEx spending plans that we have over the next several years. But our perspective on the dividend and it's growth will not change from where we have been to where we will be post Talen spin.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","So roughly, the pickup in the dividends, we shouldn't expect until what? '17, later than 2017?","William H. Spence","I think. Probably out in that time frame is the right way to think of more meaningful growth potential, for the dividend and then in the meantime, we're going to continue to maintain and probably grow it slightly between now and then.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Okay. And lastly on the transmission project, I know it's many years out, but just looking at how the Susquehanna-Roseland went and the 3-year delay to cross, what, a 3-mile stretch through the Delaware Water Gap even though there was an existing right of away. I mean, obviously, we don't see exactly how this proposed line goes, but should we expect similar issues with siting of the transmission line?","William H. Spence","Greg, do want to take one?","Gregory N. Dudkin","Sure. Thanks. So certainly, when you're talking about a 725 mile line, siting is going to be a big issue. So we will work with all the stakeholders. We've had success, actually Susquehanna-Roseland is a great example. So it took us a while, but we were building through a national park. And I think it had been very successful. I think the folks there appreciate the care we took of the park, and so I think our reputation is good in that area and that's why I think we'll be successful.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","So this proposed line doesn't go through any national parks or any environmental -- that shouldn't face any environmental issues?","Gregory N. Dudkin","No national parks.","William H. Spence","Right. Okay. Thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. And have a good rest for the day.","Operator","Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your line. Have a nice day."],"17311":["PPL Corp.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Andy Ludwig, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Ludwig, please go ahead.","Andy Ludwig - PPL Corporation","Thanks, Anita. Good morning. Thank you for joining the PPL conference call on second quarter results as well of our general business outlook. We're providing slides of this presentation on our website at pplweb.com.","Any statements made in this presentation about future operating results or other future events are forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from forward-looking statements. A discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in the appendix to the presentation and in the company's SEC filings.","We will refer to earnings from ongoing operations or ongoing earnings, a non-GAAP measure, on this call. For reconciliations to the GAAP measure, you should refer to in the press release, which has been posted on our website and furnished to the SEC.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Bill Spence, PPL Chairman, President and CEO.","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased that you've joined us for our second quarter earnings call. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin and Paul Thompson, the heads of our U.S. utility businesses; and Phil Swift, Head of our Operations at Western Power Distribution in the UK.","Moving to slide 3, our agenda for this morning begins with highlights of our 2018 second quarter results and a brief review of regulatory developments in the UK. Vince will then review our second quarter 2018 segment earnings results. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions.","Turning to slide 4, today, we announced strong second quarter reported earnings of $0.73 per share, resulting in a total of $1.38 per share through the first half of 2018. Adjusting for special items, primarily related to unrealized gains on our UK earnings hedges, second quarter earnings from our ongoing operations were $0.55 per share, up about 6% from $0.52 per share a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by higher earnings in our UK segment.","On a year-to-date basis through June, ongoing earnings were $1.29 per share, up about 13% from a year ago, driven by higher domestic earnings. Given our strong year-to-date results, we've narrowed our 2018 guidance range to $2.25 to $2.40 per share, raising the midpoint to $2.33 per share from $2.30 per share. In addition to delivering strong financial results, we also took the necessary steps to strengthen our balance sheet to mitigate the impacts of U.S. tax reform.","In May, we completed a $1.7 billion equity forward, which positions the company well by strengthening PPL's future credit metrics. This further supports our solid investment-grade credit ratings, which Moody's reaffirmed with a stable outlook in June. Through these actions, we expect our FFO to debt to increase from the low to mid-12% range post-tax reform to about 13% by the end of 2019 with continued improvement through our planning period. In addition to disciplined financial execution, I would also highlight that each of PPL's utilities remain strong, among the very best in the regions they serve.","In the U.S., both PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities received J.D. Power awards for residential customer satisfaction in July, achieving the highest overall marks in their respective categories and regions based on customer surveys. I'm proud of our team's track record in achieving such great customer service excellence. Our focus on meeting and exceeding customer expectations is one that is shared and emphasized every day across all of our operating companies. In fact, overall, PPL's domestic utilities have now won 47 J.D. Power awards.","At the same time, in the UK, our Western Power Distribution businesses achieved the top marks for customer satisfaction and stakeholder engagement for the seventh year running. This excellent operational performance underpins our confidence in our ability to achieve 5% to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2018 through 2020, measured against our original 2018 ongoing earnings midpoint. Looking ahead, PPL remains well-positioned to deliver competitive earnings growth and a secure and growing dividend for our shareowners.","Turning to slide 5, PPL's success and customer satisfaction begins by delivering power reliably for those who count on us each day. In that regard, our utilities continued to strengthen reliability for customers by investing in a smarter, more resilient grid. Over the past seven years, which marks the time period that we have owned and operated the current portfolio of regulated utilities in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and the UK, we've made significant improvements in reliability across each of our service territories.","PPL Electric Utilities recorded its best year ever for reliability in 2017, and the average number of outages per customer was down over 35% since 2011. LG&E and KU also posted their best year in more than a decade in 2017, with the average number of outages per customer down also 35% since 2011. And WPD continues to perform well against its reliability benchmarks. Power interruptions dropped 30% over six years from the 2010-2011 performance period to the 2016-2017 period, which is one of the reasons WPD's four distribution network operations have achieved the top 4 rankings in customer satisfaction since our acquisition of the Midlands' operations in 2011.","The substantial improvement in reliability is one of the driving factors leading to our continued improvement and success at achieving the customer service awards we are accustomed to at PPL. These achievements across our utilities reflect our ongoing commitment to operational excellence and our strategy for growth and success.","Turning to slide 6 for a UK regulatory update, last week, Ofgem released its decision on the overall RIIO-2 framework, which has defined some of the high-level aspects of the next price control, which will begin for us in 2023. The results of Ofgem's consultation were largely in line with our expectations and we continue to believe based on this framework that WPD will have the opportunity to deliver exceptional value for both customers and shareowners alike in RIIO-2.","One of the determinations Ofgem made is that RIIO-2 will be a five-year price control period, a reduction for the eight-year period we're currently in for RIIO-1. While we certainly prefer the stability and benefits to customers afforded by an eight-year period, we have no concerns with a five-year price control period. We previously had five-year price controls and performed well under that framework.","Ofgem also decided to change the inflation index used for calculating RAV and returns from using RPI to CPIH in an effort to more closely match the impact of inflation on actual cost. Importantly, Ofgem has made a commitment to keep investors and customers neither better nor worse off in net present value terms as a result of shifting to CPIH. All else equal, this would mean that the return profile and cash flows for companies in the near-term would increase, while RAV growth and recovery would be lower over the longer term.","Another important point Ofgem confirmed last week was the use of economic asset lives for RAV depreciation. Currently, we are transitioning to a 45-year economic asset life for new additions through our RIIO-ED1 business plan. We expect the 45-year economic asset life will remain the same in the next price control period based on Ofgem's very extensive review of asset life in RIIO-ED1.","Ofgem also noted that while fast-tracking would not be available for the majority of subsectors, the option to utilize that mechanism would remain on the table for electric distribution companies for consideration in RIIO-ED2. As a reminder, WPD's four networks were the only electric distribution companies to be fast-tracked under RIIO-ED1.","Ofgem has also reaffirmed their commitment to enhancing stakeholder engagement in RIIO-2. One of the aspects highlighted in the framework is the requirement of each company to develop customer engagement groups designed to provide the regulator with perspectives of network users.","WPD had already embraced stakeholder engagement as a substantial part of their RIIO-ED1 business planning process, and Ofgem structured some of the RIIO-2 framework using WPD as a model. Therefore, WPD is well ahead of the curve and well-positioned for success in this aspect of the next price control.","Lastly, I wanted to touch on the concept of competition that Ofgem intends to expand beyond transmission for projects that are new, separable and of high value. We're not concerned that this would negatively impact our plans as we currently do not have projects that would meet those conditions as even the largest investment projects tend to be well below the \u00a3100 million threshold set by Ofgem.","In summary, we believe Ofgem has made progress in developing another price control that can deliver real value for customers and fair returns for shareowners. And we will remain engaged throughout the other subsector reviews in preparation for the electricity distribution consultation, which is expected to begin in the spring of 2020.","We remain confident that WPD is well-positioned, given our continued superior reliability, customer service and cost efficiency. Ofgem continues to highlight that those companies delivering high-quality customer service at a low cost will be rewarded in the future and we intend to continue to deliver top quartile results into and throughout the next price control.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview. Vince?","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corporation","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone.","Let's begin on slide 8 with an overview of second quarter segment results. Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.03 over the prior year. The UK Regulated segment improved by $0.05, while our domestic utilities were flat compared to 2017. Corporate and Other was slightly lower by $0.02, primarily due to the timing impact of recording annual estimated taxes in 2017. We saw a $0.02 improvement for the second quarter compared to the prior year due to domestic weather, primarily in Kentucky.","Looking at the first half of the year, higher adjusted gross margin at our U.S. segments and higher currency rates in the UK are the primary drivers of our strong performance versus the first half of 2017. On a year-to-date basis, weather has contributed about $0.07 of favorable earnings versus the prior year and about $0.05 favorable earnings compared to budget. As Bill mentioned, the solid quarter performance gives us confidence to increase our earnings guidance for 2018.","Let's move to a more detailed review of the segment earnings drivers, starting with the UK results on slide 9. Our UK Regulated segment earned $0.36 per share in Q2 2018, a $0.05 increase compared to a year ago. The increase in UK earnings was primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2017 as the realized weighted average exchange rate increased to $1.33 from $1.21 per pound, higher adjusted gross margins due to higher volumes and the April 1, 2018 price increase and higher other income due to pensions. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher income taxes and dilution of $0.01 per share.","Moving to slide 10, our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.12 per share in the second quarter of 2018, flat versus a year ago. Higher adjusted gross margins from higher base electricity and gas rates effective July 1, 2017, and higher sales volumes due favorable weather were offset by higher O&M expense due to timing and scope of generation maintenance outages and higher depreciation. Note that there is an offsetting $0.04 variance in the second quarter due to the estimated income tax savings for customers from U.S. tax reform reflected in Kentucky's adjusted gross margins and income taxes.","Moving to slide 11, our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.11 per share in the second quarter of 2018, also flat to prior year. Similar to our Kentucky segment, there are offsetting variances for the quarter in the adjusted gross margin and income tax line items of approximately $0.02 due to tax reform.","Excluding those offsetting variances, our Pennsylvania segment delivered higher adjusted gross margins, new higher transmission margins from additional capital investments and higher distribution margins from increased electricity sales volumes. These positive drivers were primarily offset by higher depreciation from utility plant additions.","That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","Thanks, Vince. In closing, we had another strong quarter as we continued to execute on our strategy for growth and operational excellence. We delivered solid financial results in line with expectations and have increased our annual guidance driven by the strong first half of 2018. We also executed on our financing plan and positioned the company well post-tax reform.","Our excellent customer service and reliability was once again recognized by our customers. Finally, we received some positive data points looking ahead to RIIO-2 and remain optimistic about the opportunities for WPD in the next price control.","I'm confident that PPL's focus on providing best-in-class operational performance, investing responsibly in a sustainable energy future, maintaining a strong financial foundation and developing our people will deliver value to our customers and our shareowners.","With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question today comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Durgesh Chopra - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning, Bill and Vince. It's actually Durgesh on for Greg.","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","Good morning.","Durgesh Chopra - Evercore Group LLC","Two questions for me. First, can you just give us an update on the rate case expectation in Pennsylvania, when would you expect to file a general rate case there?","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","Sure. I'll turn that question over to Greg Dudkin, President of our Electric Utilities here in Pennsylvania.","Gregory N. Dudkin - PPL Corporation","Yeah. So, right now, taking a look in the next couple of years, we don't have plan to going up for a rate case. While, obviously, we continue to take a look at that as we go forward, but right now, next couple of years, we don't have any plans.","Durgesh Chopra - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. So to 2020 looks like you're not looking to file a rate case under the current assumptions you have in the plan.","Gregory N. Dudkin - PPL Corporation","Correct.","Durgesh Chopra - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. And just a follow-up for Vince, in terms of the hedges, so there's no update from the first quarter, I think if I'm wrong, the percentages and the rates are more or less the same. So, how are you thinking about 2020 increasing the hedge percentage there? What are your thoughts? And then, 2021, when could we expect that you start logging in 2021?","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corporation","Sure, Durgesh. So, you are correct, we've not layered on additional hedges during the quarter for 2020. I think as we talked last quarter where \u2013 given how heavy the hedge book was set at that time, we were kind of working our way back into the normal hedging program, which had a declining hedge ratio over the following three years. And given that \u2013 our breakeven for 2020 is a spot rate of about $1.27 with a forward rate of about $1.31, so we feel very comfortable with where the book is today and we'll start to layer those hedges in starting Q3 and Q4. 2021, we haven't specifically talked about 2021, but that'll follow our normal hedge program and we'll probably start that at the beginning of next year.","Durgesh Chopra - Evercore Group LLC","Awesome. Thank you. Good quarter, guys. Thanks.","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","Thank you very much.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corporation","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corporation","Good morning.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning. Bill or Vince, as you think about the transition to RIIO-2 in 2023, there are a couple of fairly known headwinds that we can look at. Ofgem has been very clear that they are planning to lower the cost of equity when the new pricing regime comes in. You all have also mentioned to us that you expect your pension to be fully funded in the UK by the time RIIO-2 rolls in. And so, the income from that could be \u2013 won't be booked at the same rate as well. So, as you think about those sort of, what I would call, known headwinds, are you thinking that 2023 is a transition year, we may see a drop in earnings and then grow from there or are there obvious offsets that would allow you to grow 2023 and beyond as well even with these kind of changes coming?","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","Yeah. Very good question. So, under the framework, one of the positive aspects, as we look at it for RIIO-2, it does do allow us to access some of the avenues for potential growth that we talked to you previously about. And I'll ask Vince to cover a couple of those, but I think those are important and I'm glad you raised that question because I think it's important to keep that in context of how some things may be dropping off, but other things could come into play. So, Vince, why don't you cover a couple of those key aspects that we've talked about before?","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corporation","Sure. So, Ali, I think maybe to start, I would say that we didn't see anything in the RIIO-2 Ofgem decision document that would necessarily impact the levers that we talked to you all about in the past. So, that's good news there coming out of the decision. Those levers included, right, adjusting the Fast Pot, Slow Pot split. Currently, we're at 80\/20, 80% going to RAV, 20% going to Fast Pot. We've talked about additional CapEx as a result of the electrification initiatives in the UK and that's been reaffirmed by the UK government with the Road to Zero initiative.","We also \u2013 we talked about this briefly, but the move from RPI to CPI will actually help near-term cash flows and earnings, but it will slow the longer-term growth as a compounding effect of a lower inflation index builds up. CPIH is generally viewed as about 100 basis points less than RPI. So, Ofgem has indicated that they still need to work through how they would transition from RPI to CPI. But as we think about how that would look, that should help near-term transition earnings and cash, but again slow long-term growth.","You mentioned pension deficit funding. So, we are collecting about $180 million to $200 million a year in pension deficit funding. We do expect using reasonable assumptions for the pension plans that the plans will be fully funded by the end of RIIO-ED1. So, our expectation is that we will not need to (00:22:42) collect that amount of revenue from customers in RIIO-ED2. That creates a lot of headroom in terms of customer rates to help fund some of these other levers and the additional CapEx that we would look. And then, of course, we have the profiling that is part of any business plan process where we can shape the revenues over the what looks to be a five-year period going into RIIO-2.","So to specifically talk about 2023, I think we probably need some additional clarity on some of the items that Ofgem has not concluded on in the consultation. Some of those may get resolved in transmission and gas distribution consultation, some of them may not get resolved until the RIIO-ED2 consultation, which would be in the 2020 time period.","So it's hard to say right now if we would see 2023 as a transition period for earnings. I would say that the pension deficit funding, while it does generate GAAP earnings, does not generate cash from operations, because the cash we're collecting there goes right into the funds. So on a cash basis, I think we clearly could see actually higher-cash flows from the UK business in RIIO-2 than we're seeing in RIIO-1, but, again, I still think we need to get through a lot of these items. And then on earnings, we'll have to see how much of these offsets we can we can generate on a GAAP earnings basis.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. Second question, there's been some positive overall news flow for regulatory and otherwise for you guys, mid period review came and went. You've done the equity that you needed to get that overhang out of the way, yet your stock valuation is still at a significant discount. You're not getting the value for the UK assets. You've talked about that before. And you've also, I think, mentioned to us in the past, obviously management board is not very happy with where the valuation is. Could you just give us an update on your latest thinking on that? And is there anything proactively that you can do or should we just hunker down and let the issues play out over the next four, five years? How should we be looking at that from your perspective?","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","Sure. I think just a couple comments around that. First, I would say the management team and the board is very open minded on strategic options or alternatives that will create additional shareholder value. And if there was a clear and compelling path to drive additional value, we would certainly consider it as we've always done. And I think our track record shows that we're not afraid to take bold action if we believe shareowners will benefit in the long-term.","I think the regulatory and political uncertainty in the UK is probably the single drawback or what's holding the stock back. I think in the near-term, what we can control, I think we're doing exceptionally well, which is to continue to drive value per customers and continue to operate all the businesses exceptionally well.","In terms of what could we do, I'm not going to comment on the specifics and so forth. But what I would say is that, in the near term, certainly, the yield is very strong and there's kind of a \u2013 you're getting paid to wait if you want to look at it that way. But what I can say is that we're not sitting on our hands and just saying that we're going to stay the course. We're going to continue to assess our strategic options. And if there is something that could create additional shareowner value, we're certainly going to look at that. So, that's probably what I'd have to say on that topic.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Fair enough. Last question, the rate base CAGR you laid out for us 2018 through 2022 equates to about a 4%, 5.4% CAGR. Is that in a very, very big picture perspective a good proxy of how EPS growth should also look like over that period?","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","Vince, you want to take that question?","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corporation","I mean we haven't provided guidance beyond 2020, Ali. I would say, in general, we are expecting continued earnings growth beyond 2020. But at this point, we haven't provided official guidance beyond 2020.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Fair enough. Thank you.","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","Thank you.","Operator","The next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. So, let me just follow up with a little cleanup on some of the questions here from the last one. Can you just elaborate a little bit on what the offsets would be to the pension deficit funding, again, from the earnings perspective? I know, as you describe it, it's clearly a net positive from a cash flow. But just can you elaborate a little bit on those opportunities, as you see it today, sort of what the net decrement positive increments might be?","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corporation","Sure. So, moving from RPI to CPI will help offset that. The Fast Pot, Slow Pot, shift could help that. The sensitivity we provided on that, at least in RIIO-1, where TOTEX was $1.4 billion a year, that equated to about $130 million, $140 million a year for every 10% shift. And then, additional CapEx that we expect to be spending, so we'll be earning a return on that.","I think the other important aspect that we talked about in the past is based on the way we're recovering debt from being fast-tracked, it's using a 10-year historical average as opposed to the slow-track companies using a 20-year average. We were actually horned (29:04) as a result of that compared to the slow trackers to the tune of about $300 million, $325 million over the whole eight-year period. We would expect that to get chewed up as we go into RIIO-2. So, that would also provide both cash and earnings uptick going from 1 to 2.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And can you elaborate a little bit on the requalifying for fast-track? I mean, I know we're relatively early here, but obviously distribution remains one of the unique segments within the Ofgem structure potentially to allow for fast-tracking. And obviously, you all have historically qualified for it. How do you see that benefit potentially at least thus far? And what are the metrics that we should be tracking from your perspective to see whether or not you might qualify this next go around? How is that process evolving, maybe asked differently?","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","Well, I think that's a work in progress at the moment. We're not clear on exactly how the process would work. But just thinking back to what Ofgem did in RIIO-ED1, what they basically were looking for were what they call well-justified plan. So, I think companies that had a positive track record of doing what they said they were going to do, so if they said that they were going to deliver X value to customers and they delivered that, that's a positive going into your business plan in that case for RIIO-ED1.","As we look ahead to RIIO-ED2, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the customer engagement piece, which is somewhat new, we had already put that into our plan for RIIO-ED1, which I think help justify that ours was a well-justified plan that had input from a broad group of stakeholders.","So, I think those are the types of things that Ofgem would look to see from a company. And if I look at how we're performing against RIIO-ED1 outputs in our current business plan, we're performing very well and consistent with what Ofgem, I believe, would expect from us. So, I think we'll be well-positioned again to hopefully get the opportunity, should we choose to take it to be fast-tracked.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And last quick clean-up, there's no benefit from the legislation passed in Pennsylvania of late, given, I suppose, decoupling, et cetera. That's not something you're looking at given the timeline for the next rate case or are there any other benefits or angles we should be thinking about? Just following up.","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","Well, in the short \u2013 yeah, in the short term, as Greg Dudkin mentioned, we're not planning to go in for a rate case. Having said that, depending on how the Public Utility Commission takes the legislation and puts it into action into their docket, we would obviously closely follow that. To the extent that there were opportunities to do creative things like performance-based rate making maybe akin to what we have in the UK, we would certainly want to study that hard and see if we wouldn't want to take advantage of that option. I think decoupling is an option and an alternative that we'd want to also carefully consider. But I think until the PUC really finishes their work, hard to know whether and how we would take advantage of any of those options.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you all very much.","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Congrats on the solid quarter.","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","Thank you, Paul.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Can you quantify what's the EPS step down when the pension is fully funded in the UK?","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","Vince, do you want to...","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corporation","So just for that item, it's $180 million, $200 million. So, that \u2013 what's that about $0.15 about, EPS.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And Bill, when you talked about you're exploring strategic options, are you thinking about getting bigger or smaller?","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","Well, I'm not going to comment on any specific ones, but what I can tell you is that we considered a very wide range of strategic alternatives. And that's probably all I should say without getting into a lot of detail. But, again, we're not afraid to consider any options, whether that's getting larger or smaller, l think as long as there was a clear and compelling path to drive additional value, we would certainly consider it as we always have.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And in the UK, has Ofgem had any commentary around back leverage?","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","Nothing significant to my knowledge. Phil, anything that you're aware of? No. Okay.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's all my question. Thank you very much.","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Association (sic) [Glenrock Associates]. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning.","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","Good morning.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just a few quick follow-ups. On the strategic options and what have you, how should we think about sort of following up sort of on Ali Agha's question, so the timing in terms of when you guys might feel \u2013 will there be sort of a point in time where you would sort of lose patience with the valuation as it is, and how should we think about that?","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","Paul, just maybe two points on that. As I mentioned, we're continuously assessing options that could create value for shareowners. That being said, I don't think it'd be in the best interest of shareowners to set an artificial timeline for any decision or action. Clearly, the markets are changing and are fairly dynamic. So I think the best we can do is just continually assess those options and then, it would be up to the board to determine if the time was right or not. But that's how I think we are thinking about it.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. That makes sense. And then, with respect to the stability in the UK, pardon me, but it's sometimes hard to sort of follow, and I was just wondering if we should \u2013 sort of what your timeline sort of is in terms of where you see the political situation becoming more stable?","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","Sure. Well, Brexit is clearly driving a lot of the political instability, which is having and has had a knock-on effect in several ways to the regulator, Ofgem in this case. And we would look to, early next year, there is a summit coming up in October, maybe we'll have some readout from the negotiation between the UK and the EU in October. But I do believe that it's still going to be a pretty rocky road for them to get to a final deal. And so that will create some political noise, I'm sure, around that. But that's one data point.","In terms of being patient, I think if you recall back several years ago when PPL Electric Utilities here in Pennsylvania was coming off of rate caps, and there was a lot of political noise around that, there were certain shareowners at that time said we should sell off our Pennsylvania business and now that Pennsylvania business is our highest-growth utility option and opportunities. So things have a way of turning themselves around over time.","So, I think we want to be prudent, patient, but also continually assessing what options could create additional value. And as I indicated, we're not afraid to take bold strategic action if we think it's in the best interest, long-term, of the shareowners.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Yeah. I know you guys have demonstrated that over the years. So, okay, thanks so much.","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Just wanted to check in a little bit actually on the Pennsylvania business. I'm just curious, what do you think the run rate or the sustainability longer term for the amount of transmission CapEx that you're investing in that business is kind of going forward? Do you view this as kind of \u2013 the next couple of years as kind of close to peak levels or do you view this as a new normal type of run rate?","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","Greg, did you want to make a comment on that?","Gregory N. Dudkin - PPL Corporation","Yeah. So, I think in the deck we have what our current view is as far as transmission investment. And so, basically, what we're putting into the \u2013 or what we have in that current plan is somewhat similar levels of investment in 2018, 2019, and 2020 and then, starting in 2021, that transmission investment starting to decrease over time.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So, in other words, you're viewing this as kind of not peak-ish, but high end of the cycle and kind of 2021 and beyond is more normal, or is 2021 kind of more abnormal, and longer term, you'd kind of see closer back to where we are today?","Gregory N. Dudkin - PPL Corporation","No, I'd say it's probably longer term, it would be lower.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. The other question is Kentucky. Kentucky is one of the states in the Union where there's really not a lot of renewable penetration. How are you thinking about the Kentucky business in terms of the potential for sizable amounts, if any, of new wind or solar and the accompanying transmission need that might be necessary along with it?","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","Sure. I'll make a general comment and then I'll ask Paul Thompson to supplement. Generally speaking, we have put together some specific programs for customers that want to avail themselves of solar in particular. And we do have the largest solar \u2013 commercial solar operation going so far in the state, but we're continually looking at options. But, Paul, do you want to talk about maybe the longer term how you look at solar and wind?","Paul W. Thompson - PPL Corporation","Certainly. If you think about the state itself or the geography where you might put renewables, work we've done in the past would suggest that the wind profile is not as strong and as good as you would have in other areas. And so, if we were to go down that path in the future, it would likely entail transmission to other states. But for now, we just don't see that in the near geography of our service territory.","Solar, on the other hand, has certainly the potential going down the road. We've put in a 10 megawatt facility at the Brown Station to begin to experience. We're having results of that plant very congruent with what we had planned. So that's a very good thing. As Bill mentioned, we've got some other options for customers. All of this in a period of our load growth is not projected to be strong. And therefore, the need for generation will be something that filters in over the course of time, not in any large segments in the near-term. So, we're open to all of that, trying to provide customer adoptions. But that's how I'd quickly describe renewables for us.","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","And I would just say from a competitive solar perspective, the low rates \u2013 relatively low rates in Kentucky have not made it very attractive for competitive solar providers to-date.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So just \u2013 sorry to go back to the strategy question, but I'm a little confused about the message you're giving here. Are you saying, Bill, that you've reviewed all the obvious options recently and you don't think any of them make sense right now? But in the meantime, if something else comes along that you maybe haven't thought of, you'd be open to considering it? Or are you \u2013 I'm just \u2013 it's just not quite clear whether...","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","Yeah. No, that's a good summary. Sorry, if I was not clear on that, but, yeah, that's a good summary.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So you've sort of undertaken a process that you do every year, I think, but you're not ruling out...","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","Yeah, we're not ruling anything out. It is an ongoing process. We do a deeper dive once or twice a year. But, yeah, there's \u2013 if there is a clear and compelling path, we would certainly consider it, as we always have.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","But we should take that to mean you don't see such a path today, but you're open to looking at whatever else you might not have looked at recently?","William H. Spence - PPL Corporation","That's correct.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thank you for that.","William H.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Andy Ludwig, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Andy Ludwig","Thank you, Jay. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the PPL conference call on third quarter 2019 financial results. We provided slides for this presentation and our earnings release issued this morning on the Investors section of our website. Our presentation and earnings release, which we'll discuss during today's call, contain forward-looking statements about future operating results or other future events.","Actual results may differ materially from forward-looking statements. Please refer to the appendix of this presentation and PPL's SEC filings for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements. We will also refer to earnings from ongoing operations or ongoing earnings, a non-GAAP measure on this call. For reconciliations to the GAAP measure, you should refer to the appendix of this presentation and our earnings release.","I'll now turn the call over to Bill Spence, PPL Chairman and CEO.","Bill Spence","Thank you, Andy and good morning, everyone. We're pleased that you've joined us for our third quarter earnings call. With me today are Vince Sorgi, PPL President and Chief Operating Officer; Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin and Paul Thompson, the Heads of our U.S. utility businesses; and Phil Swift, Head of our Western Power Distribution business in the U.K.","Moving to slide 3. Our agenda this morning begins with highlights of our 2019 third quarter earnings results and a brief review of operational and regulatory developments. Joe will then provide a more detailed review of third quarter earnings as well as an update on our foreign currency hedging status. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions.","Turning to slide 4. Today, we announced third quarter reported earnings of $0.65 per share resulting in a total of $1.89 per share through the first nine months of 2019. Adjusting for special items, primarily related to unrealized gains on our U.K. earnings hedges, third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.61 per share compared with $0.59 per share a year ago.","On a year-to-date basis through September, total ongoing earnings were $1.88 per share, which was even with last year on a per share basis and in line with our expectations. Based on our solid financial results through September, we have narrowed our 2019 guidance range to $2.35 per share to $2.45 per share maintaining our midpoint of $2.40. In addition, we remain on track to invest $3.3 billion in infrastructure improvements during 2019.","Looking beyond 2019, today we also reaffirmed our projection of 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth rate per share through 2020 measured against the midpoint of our original 2018 earnings forecast of $2.30 per share. In addition, we maintained our 2021 earnings forecast of $2.50 to $2.80 per share.","We continue to monitor macroeconomic factors for potential impacts on our earnings projections including impacts on currency, exchange rates, inflation in the U.K. and interest rates.","Shifting the focus to operations. PPL continues to modernize and reshape the grid investing in infrastructure and technology that will further strengthen grid resilience, improve service to customers and enable the transition to a cleaner energy future.","In the third quarter, PPL Electric Utilities neared completion of a multi-year advanced meter replacement project in Pennsylvania. This $470 million project involves the installation of 1.4 million advanced meters. These meters enable us to respond more quickly and efficiently to customer requests by remotely connecting and disconnecting service.","They also provide customers with more detailed usage information to help them make wise energy decisions. They also alert us when power is out enabling us to respond more quickly, to notify customers when they're not home and to better pinpoint problem areas. In addition, they help us to monitor power quality and better identify and address potential problems before they impact electric service. We expect to complete the project this year. It's yet another example of our ability to execute large-scale capital projects on time and on budget.","Additionally, PPL Electric Utilities was recognized in October by the Association of Edison Illuminating Companies for groundbreaking technology that safely and automatically cuts power to down power lines, protecting the public first responders as well as employees. Safety is paramount to our everyday operations and we're very proud of our team for developing this innovative technology that will enhance the safety of our distribution network.","We expect to have this technology deployed in about 1,500 locations, across our Pennsylvania service territory by the end of this year. In Kentucky, meanwhile Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company continued to look for opportunities to economically add clean energy for our customers.","The company has completed construction of a new community solar facility in late July. This 1,400-panel array is the first of eight plan Solar Share developments that will provide an option for customers to support local solar energy without installing equipment on their properties.","We are very close to beginning the installation of the second Solar Share array as response from customers has been strong. In addition, Kentucky Utilities announced an agreement to build, own and maintain a solar array at the Maker's Mark bourbon distillery operation in Loretto, Kentucky as part of the utility's Business Solar Program.","The company expects to complete construction by the end of the year. Our continuous investment in our reliable electricity system in Kentucky also enables us to continue to pursue these efforts of economically advancing renewable generation in the state of Kentucky.","Shifting to the U.K. and a brief regulatory update, as we noted on our second quarter call, Ofgem formally kicked off the consultation process for the RIIO-ED2 price control in early August. We've since reviewed Ofgem's open letter, which outlines its approach to setting the next price control. And we've submitted responses on behalf of all stakeholders of both Western Power Distribution and PPL Corporation including our shareowners.","In PPL's response, we highlighted the real value that RIIO-ED1 has delivered and continues to deliver for our U.K. customers. For example, customer interruptions are down 11% on average. Outage durations have fallen by 9%. Customer service scores are very strong with distribution network operators earning on average an 8.7 out of 10 rating from our customers.","Meanwhile DNOs have continued to invest in network improvements and innovation. Four years into the RIIO-ED1 price control, customers are receiving high levels of service and performance. And in our view, the focus in RIIO-ED2 should be building upon the success of RIIO-ED1 and refining the framework where needed.","As stated in our comments, we welcome the opportunity to support U.K. decarbonization and electrification initiatives that will play a critical role in achieving the governments target of net zero emissions by the year 2050. We forecast that a significant amount of capital will be required to be invested in the distribution networks to advance these objectives.","We believe it's critical that RIIO-ED2 provide DNOs fair and reasonable returns that will attract and sustain the investment necessary to achieve this transition to a low-carbon economy. And we believe the incentive scheme in RIIO-ED2 must drive both innovation and outputs that create long-term value for our customers and enable top performers like WPD to earn strong returns.","Much of these concepts have been echoed by our investors and we provided Ofgem with a summary of that direct feedback as well.","In WPD's comprehensive response to the consultation questions, we've highlighted areas for improvement and offered ideas on how Opgem can achieve its objective of continuing to drive efficiencies while preparing the network for the future.","Ofgem is expected to issue its framework decision by the end of the year. As we said on our last call, we believe Ofgem agrees that distribution networks are critical to enabling the shift towards a more sustainable energy future. We expect that Ofgem will produce the framework necessary for DNOs to support decarbonization objectives and incentivize the level of investment required to do so. And we believe Ofgem will be focused on differentiating returns among electricity DNOs providing substantial opportunities for outstanding performers like WPD as we enter into RIIO-ED2.","With that, I'll turn it over to Joe for a more detailed financial overview. Joe?","Joe Bergstein","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to slide 5 for an overview of third quarter segment results. As Bill mentioned, PPL delivered third quarter 2019 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.61 per share, which was $0.02 higher compared to the third quarter of 2018 and in line with our expectations. Our strong results more than offset $0.02 from share dilution and over the quarter there was $0.01 benefit from weather-related variances compared to the prior period. Weather was about $0.02 favorable compared to our forecast for the third quarter of 2019, primarily in Kentucky where cooling degree days were about 30% higher compared to normalized levels.","Turning to our segment results. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.28 per share, a $0.01 decrease compared to the same period a year ago, excluding the impact of dilution. The decrease in the U.K. earnings was primarily due to lower sales volumes and lower realized foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2018 with third quarter 2019 average rates of $1.26 per pound compared to $1.34 per pound in the third quarter of 2018. These factors were partially offset by higher prices due to the April 1, 2019 price increase and higher other income due to higher pension income.","Moving to the Pennsylvania segment. Our PA Regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the third quarter of 2019, which was even compared to the third quarter of 2018. Higher adjusted gross margins, primarily due to returns on additional capital investments in transmission were primarily offset by higher operation and maintenance expense and several other items that were not individually significant.","Turning to Kentucky segment. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.20 per share in the third quarter of 2019, a $0.03 increase compared to the third quarter of 2018 excluding the impact of dilution and weather. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, which reflect higher retail rates approved by the KPSC effective May 1, 2019 and lower operation and maintenance expense, primarily due to lower storm costs. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to additions to PP&E and higher depreciation rates.","And finally, Corporate and Other remained relatively even compared to the same period a year ago. As Bill noted, we narrowed our 2019 forecast range due to our strong third quarter performance, which positions us well to achieve our earnings forecast for this year. And for your convenience a walk of the year-to-date results is available in the appendix.","Before I turn the call back over to Bill, let me provide an update on our foreign currency hedging status which is on slide 6. For the balance of 2019, we continue to be 100% hedged for our ongoing earnings at an average rate of $1.45 per pound. For 2020, we increased our hedge percentage by 7% and our 2020 ongoing earnings are now 70% hedged. The average rate for 2020, reflecting these new hedges remained at $1.46 per pound. We were able to maintain these average hedge rates by optimizing our hedge portfolio given the recent uplift in currency rates, following the momentum surrounding Brexit and to strengthen our 2019 results to date. We continue to utilize options in our hedging strategy that preserve upside to the current market rates with about one-third of the 2020 hedge portfolio being option-based.","And we remain opened in 2021. As Bill mentioned, we'll continue to monitor Brexit developments and fluctuations in currency exchange rates, while we evaluate potential impacts for earnings projections. The flexibility in our hedging program enables us to take an opportunistic approach as we continue to assess the dynamic political situation. We believe we're well positioned to manage this uncertainty in the near-term through our hedge position. And we are optimistic that the market will rationalize the currency rates higher than we see today and continue the recent upward trend as the U.K. moves closer toward a Brexit resolution.","That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?","Bill Spence","Thank you, Joe. In closing, our third quarter results exemplify our continued commitment to delivering outstanding operational performance. We remain solidly on track to deliver on our 2019 earnings guidance.","As we continue to invest in a sustainable energy future, as we strengthen grid resilience. And reshape electricity networks, to enable a low-carbon future. I'm very proud of the direction we're headed, as we look to close out 2019, with continued strong performance.","With that, operator, let's open the call up for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha","Thank you. Good morning.","Bill Spence","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha","Good morning. Bill, first question, can you give us an update on your latest thinking around your U.K. operations? And any strategic actions you may take, to address the investor concerns and valuation discounts that, you're seeing in your stock?","I know, there's been some new stories out there, but anything you can share with us. Anything new opportunities or anything that you can -- you're looking at today?","Bill Spence","I appreciate the question. But as I'm sure you can understand, we don't comment on market rumours or speculation. And that's consistent with our long-standing policy.","As for the overall strategy, we've discussed our thoughts extensively on past calls, and nothing has changed from that perspective. And as we said, the company continues to operate exceptionally well. And we believe the current business mix and plan will generate long-term shareowner value.","Ali Agha","I understood. Fair enough. Second question, as you mentioned, you're expecting the framework decision from Ofgem later this year. Can you just highlight for us from your vantage front, what are the sort of the important data points you expect to get firmed up in this decision, as it relates to your business. And thinking about RIIO-2 et cetera?","Bill Spence","Sure. I'll make a general comment. And then, I'll turn it over to Phil, to maybe give you a highlight on some of the specifics that we're looking at, as we go into the framework discussion with Ofgem.","Since the process just kicked off, there's no major update at the moment. But we do remain encouraged by our continued dialogue with Ofgem, as they recognize, that the distribution networks are an integral part, of the future of the U.K. energy goals to decarbonize the country.","And we're going to continue to remain engaged with Ofgem. And all stakeholders as we establish this framework for the next price control review. As for the specifics we're looking at, Phil did you want to make a couple of comments there?","Phil Swift","Yeah. I mean, I think, the key thing is it's very early days at the moment. The actual sector methodology consultation is actually next year, when we get more detail on the financial package and everything else.","Right now our position is very much around focusing Ofgem on the fact that ED1 is working incredibly well. And therefore, ED2 should be a progression from ED1 and not a sort of a step change away from it.","Bill alluded to that in his opening remarks, in terms of outcomes for our customers. The interruptions on minutes are dramatically down. And our availability of electricity is running 99.99%.","In terms of customer service we continue to drive that upwards with WPD now, at or around over 90%. And the whole sector has moved up to around about 87%. So our key messaging with Ofgem has been very much around progressing into ED2 with a good incentive package reflecting the decarbonization agenda.","And we see that as the main adjustment going forward. But in terms of decisions in terms of cost of equity and everything else we won't see that until next year.","Ali Agha","Got you, last question, Bill, the $15 billion of CapEx that you've highlighted for us through 2023, can you give us some sense of -- as you look at customer needs et cetera, what kind of potential upside there could be, particularly in the outer years when you receive that drawdown?","And is that 4.7% rate base CAGR really realistic at the end of the day?","Can you give us some sense of where -- what kind of opportunities are out there, on the CapEx front?","Bill Spence","Sure. Well, the capital plan that you have in front of you today reflects only identified projects. And there are certainly opportunities that could arise as we execute the plan, particularly at the back-end of the plan as you know. Those potential opportunities within that five-year time horizon could come from a couple of sources. One would be further grid resiliency efforts in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky; future AMI deployment in Kentucky which we've talked about in the past; potential renewables expansion I would just say in general across the board; perhaps other generation modifications in Kentucky that could be required by any new environmental regulations.","I think as you probably know our capital plans in the U.K. are essentially set until the end of RIIO-ED1. And we do expect beyond that timeframe beyond RIIO-ED1 that there could be very significant capital investment opportunities to meet the required electrification initiatives to allow the U.K. to achieve its recent commitment of a net zero emissions by 2050. So, that's -- those are the areas that I would probably highlight at the moment.","Ali Agha","Yes. Bill I know -- I mean not all of it comes to fruition but just a sense of the size of that bucket as you're looking at these opportunities?","Bill Spence","Well, I would say that they would certainly be in probably $100 million versus the tens of millions of dollars. So, I think particularly as it relates to the U.K. we're looking at something that could be several hundred million dollars incremental per year depending on how aggressively Ofgem would like to go for the carbon reductions that the country has already established as a target.","Ali Agha","Thank you.","Bill Spence","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Ryan Greenwald","Good morning guys. This is actually Ryan Greenwald on for Julien. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning.","Bill Spence","Good morning. Sure.","Ryan Greenwald","Can you guys just give a little more color on the hedging strategy in the current environment? It seems like you guys are being pretty patient. Can you just kind of elaborate there given the improving currency as of late?","Bill Spence","Sure. I will ask Joe to comment on that.","Joe Bergstein","Sure. There's been no real significant change to our hedging strategy. We are being patient and we continue to monitor Brexit situation and potential impacts from the pending U.K. elections and the January Brexit deadline with the prospects of a no-deal Brexit greatly reduced. Current probability sit at 90% for a deal or no Brexit at all. Both of those would be positive to the pound.","So, current forecasts point to upside relative to the current FX rate into the $1.35 $1.40 area. So, we'll again continue to wait and see how these events play out over the next several months and opportunistically layer on hedges if the opportunity presents itself.","Ryan Greenwald","Got it, that's helpful. And then how real do you guys perceive nationalization risk given the latest development?","Bill Spence","Well, I think that risk well we have always said we believed it to be extremely low has gone even lower. The Labor Party has really dropped in the polls. Their manifesto could only be really achieved if they win at outright majority in the election. That is very unlikely.","Their best shot would be to form a coalition government and very likely the coalition partner that they align with would not be probably likely to want to sign on to a renationalization manifesto. So, we believe that things from our perspective are moving in the right direction that that risk continues to go even lower from a pretty low starting point to begin with.","Ryan Greenwald","Got it. Thanks for the time.","Bill Spence","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will be from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Praful Mehta","Thanks so much. Hi guys.","Bill Spence","Good morning.","Praful Mehta","Hi. So, maybe just on the foreign exchange side and the hedging that you talked about. You reiterated your guidance for 2021. Can you just give us a sense of what's built into that in terms of the range on the foreign exchange side for 2021?","Joe Bergstein","Yes, we're using -- Praful its Joe. We're using the forecast that we had for FX rates at the time we gave that guidance which was $1.35 to $1.60.","Praful Mehta","Got you. So, the lower end of that is $1.35 depending on where that goes. Obviously, the estimates can move as well I guess?","Joseph Bergstein","That's correct.","Praful Mehta","Got you. All right. And then secondly, in terms of the strategic sign, I'll ask a more generic question if that's okay. What I'm trying to get a sense of is, I know that in the past you've looked at the U.K. strategically and said that the tax leakage has been a challenge. If there is somebody who can help offset that tax leakage using tax assets of their own, is that something you see as valuable as a strategic opportunity? Or do you not really consider that as an opportunity from your perspective?","Bill Spence","Well as I said, I'm not going to speculate on the strategic front. We have mentioned in the past that we continuously look for opportunities whether they're tax-related or not to take strategic action that could certainly improve the shareowner value as we've done over the past decade. So from that perspective nothing has really changed.","Praful Mehta","And just following up on that. Do you see -- from an buyer interest perspective, on the strategic options in the U.K., would you consider now to be a good time? Or do you think that there's just so much uncertainty on Brexit that if you had to do something you're really not -- that nobody's got really good clarity on it? Or do you see that or that -- is there a different perspective on timing around something to do with the U.K.?","Bill Spence","Well I would say that we have not tested the market on an outright sale of our U.K. businesses at this time. And I think to your point, this may not be the best of times given we're very close to seeing the outcome of Brexit. And I think it's clear from our perspective relative to Brexit that either way the general election turns out, we think the pound is going to strengthen once the uncertainties of Brexit are removed. And it will be clear I think. If you believe the polls and if they ultimately prove correct the Conservatives will win an outright majority and it's very unlikely the Labor Part you could achieve a majority. And as you also probably know that one of the overhangs on all the utility businesses in the U.K. has been on the threat of renationalization, which as I indicated earlier is dropping pretty significantly in our view.","Praful Mehta","Got you. That's super helpful and congratulations. Thank you.","Bill Spence","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Greg Gordon with Evercore.","Greg Gordon","Hey, good morning.","Bill Spence","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon","You guys -- I'm noticing that you're talking about in Kentucky on the margin they're embracing more renewable energy alternatives. It's been a call centric state. Can you talk about what your short- medium- longer-term plans might look like maybe not in this next rate case, but maybe as you think about the mid- to late-2020s with regard to aspirations to continue to push the green agenda in that state and what it might mean for rate base growth?","Bill Spence","Sure. Paul, do you want to comment on kind of the landscape in Kentucky and what you see on the ground there?","Paul Thompson","Certainly. Again, this is Paul Thompson. We have a inventor -- I mean a integrated resource plan that of course we do tri-annually and it still has coal as our least cost resource going out into the late 2020s early 2030s when we might see some more change. But aside from that, we're looking at the market all the time and as Bill said earlier looking for economic advantages for the customer. So one of the things that we're doing now as we've commented on is going to test the market with an RFP for renewables. We put that out in February. That was for upwards of 200 megawatts.","We're still processing that. But based on that we expect to see some filings to move forward on some more renewable energy that is economic to the customer set. So things like that in the near term, we're going to continue to do. When you get out into the later 2020s and as we had in our climate assessment report, we talked about as coal becomes not economic for whatever reason or ages to the point of not being able to be economically retrofitted, et cetera, we will likely be looking at renewables and\/or gas as the economics may dictate. So I think we're trying to stay on the forefront of what's economic to the customer. And some of this renewal certainly can be and that's what we're going to try to keep doing in the state.","Bill Spence","I would just add Greg that I think that what we're seeing based on some modeling, we're doing and other things is that, it may not be that we actually shut down some of these larger coal stations, but we supplement them with renewable energy such that the output -- coal-based output may drop, but it could be that for the customer as Paul mentioned, could be still economic to kind of pair that base load generation with some of this variable generation. And that could be I think a win-win for the customers.","Paul Thompson","Yeah. A good way to balance the reliability against the cleaner resources.","Greg Gordon","Thank you very much guys.","Bill Spence","Okay, Greg. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson","Hey, good morning.","Bill Spence","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson ","So like all my questions have been answered, but there was this discussion you guys made about this innovative technology regarding down power lines and cutting off the power to it. And I think you guys were talking about in the context of first responders and stuff. But what does this mean for the potential of wildfires? Or is there any application there at all? Is it proprietary? Is there more to this maybe than what it sounds like? I'm just curious.","Bill Spence","Yeah. Good question. Very good question. I'll ask Greg Dudkin, who heads up our PPL Electric Utilities to make some comments.","Greg Dudkin","Yeah. So, just very quickly about the technology, what we're using is, we're using information that comes back of a power line that hits the ground or taking information from our relays to determine, a, we may have a power line down on the ground and we can automatically de-energize it.","So as you said, the first application is to protect the public and its application. I think it could be used in areas of -- at risk of wildfires. So that could be a potential application in the future as well.","Bill Spence","And how about the proprietary nature of it?","Greg Dudkin","So we've applied for a patent on it, but we don't expect to get rich on it. But -- and we'd be more than happy to talk to other utilities that use.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Just -- when you say a grounded -- power line that hits the ground, what about if a tree hits the power line? Does that have the same impact?","Greg Dudkin","So we are now taking a look at that as well. This application is more around where you have live conductors that are on the ground. But we are taking a look at -- because actually they -- I'll call it the signature is similar to be able to identify when a tree hits a line as well.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Well, thanks a lot.","Greg Dudkin","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","The next question will be from Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please go ahead.","Gregg Orrill","Yeah, thank you. Just in the U.K., where do you stand in terms of returns and achievement of performance incentives versus your plan?","Bill Spence","Sure, Gregg. Generally speaking, we're right on track with the plan in terms of executing the capital and the O&M that was approved in our fast-track application in the very beginning of the process or the rate period. At the operating company level, so at the four distribution network operations companies, we've been in this roughly 9% to 10% return on regulatory assets in that range. I don't know Phil, if you want to comment more specifically, but we've been kind of low -- just below about 10%.","Phil Swift","Yes, that's correct Bill. So, we continue to execute in line with the plan as you said. And in terms of incentives, we maximize incentives on customer service. We're close to maximizing -- maximize on two of the licenses on interruptions. Stakeholder engagement, we were ranked the best in the sector again for the eighth consecutive year with the highest level of incentives in line with plan possibly slightly better.","Bill Spence","And that roughly mid-9% is on a real basis. As you recall in the U.K., we start with the nominal and then we book to the real based on incentives and inflation et cetera.","Gregg Orrill","Thank you.","Bill Spence","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho.","Anthony Crowdell","Hey, good morning. Hopefully two quick questions. One is -- and I don't know if you can answer. How far along '20 -- how far along in 2020 would you go with keeping 2021 completely exposed on the hedge status?","Bill Spence","Sure. I'll ask Joe to comment on that.","Joe Bergstein","Hi, Anthony. I think it -- again, to my earlier points, we want to monitor the events as they occur in the U.K. over the next several months with respect to the general election in mid-December and the end of January Brexit time line. So, I think I don't have a date specific, but we'll monitor those events. Again, we would think based on information we have today relative to those events, the pound would move higher. So, we'll wait to see what happens then and see how the pound materializes over that time and book hedges sometime in 2020 or 2021.","Anthony Crowdell","And then, switching gears to -- the credit agencies have typically viewed -- view U.K. regulation I guess as maybe a credit positive or a premium jurisdiction. Has that changed at all as you've seen the other segments get potentially lower returns?","Joe Bergstein","So we've had conversations with rating agencies and I think they've made comments with regard to this. But in our conversations with them, they don't view the U.K. differently at this point with respect to electric distribution. RIIO-ED1 goes through the end of March 2023. So, we have quite a bit of time and certainly in cash flows to do that. And I think they'll continue to monitor the U.K. and development through the rest of ED1 and how that may impact RIIO-ED2 before they make any decisions. But I think they continue to view the U.K. positively.","Anthony Crowdell","Good. Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Joe Bergstein","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bill Spence for any closing remarks.","Bill Spence","Okay. Thank you, operator, and thanks for all that participated today and I look forward to seeing many of you next week at the financial conference.","Operator","And thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"17635":["PPL Corp.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Bergstein. Please go ahead.","Joseph P. Bergstein - PPL Corp.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the PPL conference call on first quarter results as well as our general business outlook. We're providing slides of this presentation on our website at www.pplweb.com.","Any statements made in this presentation about future operating results or other future events are forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from such forward-looking statements.","A discussion of factors that could cause actual results or events to differ is contained in the Appendix to this presentation and in the company's SEC filings. We will refer to earnings from ongoing operations or ongoing earnings, a non-GAAP measure, on this call. For reconciliations to the GAAP measure, you should refer to the press release, which has been posted on our website and has been furnished with the SEC.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Bill Spence, PPL Chairman, President and CEO.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased that you've joined us this morning. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer, and the presidents of our U.S. and UK utility businesses.","Moving to slide 2, our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our first quarter 2017 earnings results, a discussion of our 2017 earnings forecast and a brief operational overview.","Following my remarks, Robert Symons, Chief Executive of our Western Power Distribution subsidiary, will provide an update on our UK incentive performance. Vince will then review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial review, then we will take your questions.","Turning to slide 3, today, we announced first quarter 2017 reported earnings of $0.59 per share compared with $0.71 per share from our first quarter 2016 results. Adjusting for special items, first quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.62 per share compared with $0.67 per share a year ago.","This reduction in earnings was driven primarily by lower foreign currency exchange rates as expected, partially offset by an April 1, 2016 price increase in the UK. An unusually mild winter in Kentucky also negatively impacted earnings. The State of Kentucky, in fact, experienced its warmest February on record. I'm pleased with our first quarter results and despite the abnormally warm winter, we are off to a strong start to the year and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2017 earnings guidance.","Let's move to slide 4, which highlights our 2017 ongoing earnings forecast. Today, we are reaffirming our 2017 forecast of earnings from ongoing operations of $2.05 to $2.25 per share, with a midpoint of $2.15 per share.","Looking beyond 2017, we remain confident in our ability to deliver overall compound annual EPS growth of 5% to 6% from 2017 through 2020. As we have highlighted on the year-end call, we expect 4% to 6% compound annual growth in our U.S. utilities from 2017 through 2020 and 6% to 8% growth in the UK. The drivers of this growth are summarized in the appendix on slide 21 and are consistent with the growth drivers discussed on the year-end call.","We have significantly reduced our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates through our ongoing hedging program, as we've increased our hedge levels even further during the first quarter. While the British Government formally began its exit from the European Union, we are well-positioned to deliver our long-term growth even if exchange rates were to fall well below today's current levels. However, the pound to dollar exchange rate has been very stable since the UK officially began the Brexit process on March 29. In fact, the exchange rate has actually strengthened some, with current rates around $1.29 per pound.","Vince will provide you with an update to our hedge status during his remarks. But I will highlight now that with the additional hedging we did since year-end, we can achieve at least the low end of our 5% to 6% compound annual EPS growth range even if the pound falls to $1.05. Delivering on our commitments really comes down to execution, and that is something that we have demonstrated over the years, which is a clear strength for PPL.","As we've discussed in the past, we have a very straightforward business plan, which we believe is low risk. And as noted on the slide, we continue to target annual dividend growth of about 4% a year from 2017 through 2020, having delivered on that commitment earlier this year by increasing the annualized dividend in February from $1.52 per share to $1.58 per share. Overall, we continue to maintain one of the strongest dividend yields in our sector while maintaining our investment-grade credit metrics.","Now, let's move to slide 5 for an update on our utility operations. In Kentucky, our rate review before the Kentucky Public Service Commission continues to move forward as we reached settlement agreements in April with all the parties involved. The settlements are subject to approval by the Kentucky Commission. If approved, it will result in a total annual revenue increase of $122 million for our Kentucky utilities.","The settlement also includes other adjustments that relate to the timing of cost recovery such as depreciation rates. The settlements provide for the ability to invest in intelligent control equipment that will enhance reliability and enable faster restoration of service. It also will give Louisville Gas and Electric the ability to improve natural gas safety and reliability by replacing the aging natural gas steel service lines with new plastic lines that run from the street to our customers' homes.","As part of the proposed agreement, the companies have agreed to withdraw the current request for a full deployment of advanced meters, and we will establish a collaborative with the interested parties to address issues raised with that proposal. This will result in the removal or deferral of just over $300 million in total capital expenditures from the 2017 through 2019 capital plan.","The settlement proposal includes an authorized 9.75% return on equity using our filed capital structure. The agreement gives us the ability to enhance our reliability and continue providing safe and reliable service to our customers.","A public hearing on the rate review is scheduled to begin on May 9. And order in the case from the Kentucky Public Service Commission is still expected on or around June 30, with new rates going into effect on July 1 of this year.","In Pennsylvania, PPL reached a new five-year labor agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1600. The agreement ratified by bargaining unit members in March will take effect May 22. It continues our long-standing practice of providing competitive wages and benefits for our employees. We believe it is also in the best interest of PPL shareowners and our customers.","In the UK, as I mentioned earlier, Article 50 was invoked on March 29, which formally began the process of the UK exiting the European Union. That process is expected to take up to two years to complete. As we've discussed in the past, we expect no changes to our UK operations as a result of the exit.","I will now turn the call over to Robert Symons to provide an update on WPD's performance against our RIIO-ED1 incentive targets. Robert?","Robert A. Symons - PPL Corp.","Many thanks, Bill, and good morning. Leading to slide 6, March 31, 2017 marked the completion of second regulatory year under RIIO-ED1. And on the next two slides, I'll provide an update on our full-year performance on interruption incentive schemes and the broad measure of customer satisfaction.","Let me start by saying WPD has had another successful year in achieving its outputs. We focused on delivering excellent customer service and once again have been ranked the top four Distribution Network Operators in customer satisfaction.","We also continue to focus on restoring power promptly as interruptions occur. Clear management attention on supply restoration and commitment by staff at all levels has led to significant performance improvements. Network reliability is a high priority for WPD.","Over the eight-year RIIO-ED1 period, we've committed to reducing the number of power cuts that customers experience by 16% compared to 2013-2014 levels, restoring supply 23% quicker when power cuts occur and ensuring that a minimum of 85% of customers have their power restored within an hour of an HV fault occurring.","As a result of our efforts, our performance for the regulatory year 2016-2017 is estimated to result in $95 million of incentive revenues for the interruption incentive schemes and the broad measure of customer satisfaction, which is slightly better than the midpoint of our prior guidance.","Now turning to slide 7, on this slide, you will find the detail of our full-year results against performance targets set by Ofgem. Our strong performance this year will result in receiving 82% of the maximum payout. This year, our operational efforts contributing to this success included: an unwavering staff effort at all levels on speedy supply restoration; a thorough inspection of maintenance work program; several major asset replacement projects; and increased investment in network automation and improved network sensing.","As it relates to the broad measure of customer satisfaction, we're proud to have maintained our top four positions for customer service and stakeholder engagement, and we are committed to continuing this level of service over the course of RIIO-ED1.","As shown back on slide 6, we've increased our calendar year 2018 incentive potential from between $80 million and $100 million to between $95 million and $105 million. This increase is driven by our 2016-2017 performance and now includes about $6 million for the Time to Connect incentive. The Time to Connect incentive is intended to encourage distribution network operators to reduce the overall time to connect smaller low-voltage connections to the network. These amounts are our internal estimates and to a final determination is received from Ofgem in November 2017.","Overall, we have performed in line with our expectations.","And as we begin the new regulatory year, we expect performance closely in line with the prior year and project $95 million to $115 million in calendar year 2019, with a similar expectation for 2020.","Vince will now walk you through a more detailed look at segment earnings. Vince?","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to slide 9 for a more detailed review of our first quarter earnings. First quarter earnings from ongoing operations decreased by $0.05 over the prior year, driven by lower earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment of $0.02 and $0.02 from the Kentucky Regulated segment.","Corporate and other was lower by $0.07, primarily due to the timing impact of recording annual estimated taxes. For those on the call that are well-versed in tax accounting, this is just the result of the quarterly APB 28 adjustment, which will reverse over the remainder of the year. These lower earnings were partially offset by an improvement in the UK Regulated segment of $0.06.","Before I get into the segment details, let's briefly discuss the impact domestic weather had on our results compared to last year and compared to our plan.","Compared to last year, mild temperatures during the first quarter of 2017 had an unfavorable $0.02 impact for our Kentucky segment, with heating degree days about 27% lower than normal in the quarter. The impacts of weather in Pennsylvania were relatively flat year-over-year. Compared to our plan, domestic weather had a negative $0.03 impact.","Let's move to a more detailed review of the 2017 segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on slide 10. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.12 per share in the first quarter of 2017, a $0.02 decrease compared to the same period a year ago. This result was due to higher operation and maintenance expense due primarily to timing and higher depreciation due to asset additions.","Higher transmission margins from additional capital investments were offset by lower peak transmission system demand in 2017. However, transmission margins for the full year are still forecasted to be in line with our original expectations.","Moving to slide 11, our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.14 per share in the first quarter of 2017, a $0.02 decrease compared to the first quarter of 2016. This decrease was due to lower gross margins as a result of lower sales volumes due to the unfavorable weather that I talked about earlier.","Moving to slide 12, our UK Regulated segment earned $0.45 per share in 2017, a $0.06 improvement compared to a year ago. This was primarily due to higher gross margins, driven mostly by the April 1, 2016 price increase. In addition, lower results from lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017 compared to 2016 were offset by a decrease in O&M, primarily from lower pension expense and the timing of network maintenance expense and lower income taxes as a result of pre-funding pension contributions into our various UK pension plans.","Part of the reason for the pre-funding of the plans was to take advantage of tax deductions at the higher statutory rate of 20%, which was effective through March 31 versus 19%, which became effective April 1. These positive tax results enabled us to re-strike $0.04 of 2017 earnings in the first quarter, adding additional UK earnings hedges in 2019, without impacting the midpoint of our 2017 earnings guidance of $2.15 per share.","Moving to slide 13, since our year-end call, we continued to layer on additional hedges. We are now contractually hedged 100% for 2017 at an average rate of $1.21 per pound, and we are 99% hedged toward 2018 and 2019 at average rates of $1.41 and $1.32 per pound, respectively.","As a reminder, every penny in the FX rate above our budgeted rate of $1.30 represents about $0.01 in earnings per share. So just for 2018 and 2019, we have about $0.13 of additional hedge value above our budgeted rate. It's that additional hedge value that gives us so much confidence in our ability to meet our earnings guidance targets even though 2020 is still contractually unhedged.","And just to reiterate what this bottom table shows, if we were to use all the additional hedge value, we could still achieve our minimum 5% growth rate through 2020 even if market rates drop to $1.05 for pound. However, at current exchange rates, we would not need to use all of this value to achieve our earnings growth targets. And, in fact, the EPS growth rate would be at the high end of our 5% to 6% growth range and the additional hedge value would be available for other purposes.","The hedge program we've developed was designed to protect us against the downside risk of the pound losing value, but it also provides us with a lot of upside opportunity if the pound remains at current levels or even strengthens. Based on the current hedge levels, our view is that this risk reward proposition is now skewed much more to the upside than to the downside.","Moving to slide 14, we've provided an illustration of the high, median and low currency forecasts from up to 17 financial institutions. These forecasts do not represent PPL's internal forecast or our planning assumption. But you can see from the chart, even the bearish view is around $1.40 per pound for 2020 and the bullish case is much higher.","And as I said, to the extent exchange rates remain at current levels or move consistent with these estimates, the additional value created in our plan will not be needed in 2020; it could be used for a variety of purposes, including mitigating potential tax reform or hedging future years beyond 2020.","And finally, turning to slide 15, we show our updated RPI forecasts. In recent months, we have seen RPI rates strengthen above our business plan assumptions. We believe RPI now represents some upside potential to the plan. But as you can see from the sensitivity table, it's not likely to be too significant.","That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Thank you, Vince. In closing, I'm confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to customers and shareowners. And as I said in my opening remarks, we're very pleased with the strong start in the first quarter.","As we look ahead, the state of our business is strong and our strategy for growth is clear: We will deliver industry-leading customer service and reliability, we will invest responsibly in a sustainable energy future, we will continue to execute on our infrastructure plans, we will maintain our strong financial position, and we will engage and develop our people. That's our focus each and every day as we work to provide safe, reliable and affordable service to our customers, while growing value for shareowners.","Thank you for joining us on today's call. And with that, operator, let's open the call to questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from Greg Gordon at Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Hey. Good morning.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","How are you guys doing? Good?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Very good.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Busy morning. So I've got two quick questions. One, I know that you resolved in Kentucky then the (20:43) AMR rollout, but the capital expenditure budget looks like it hasn't changed. Is that because other things have moved into that slot or should we assume that we should make a modest negative adjustment there?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Sure. I'll let Vince take that question.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Yeah. Greg, we're awaiting for formal approval from the Commission before we adjust the capital plan.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","So you can \u2013 yeah, you can adjust accordingly.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay.","Gregory N. Dudkin - PPL Electric Utilities Corporation","But we also should be mindful that as part of the settlement, we agreed to go into a collaborative. And so, it's likely that the result of that collaborative may be included in our next rate case. So maybe a delay in the funding as well. So until we get final determination from the commission and the outcome of the collaborative, I think it may just be a delay in the capital expenditures rather than complete elimination.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. And a lot of distractions this morning, so I apologize. I wasn't 100% listening to your scripted remarks, but obviously the pound has definitely gone in your way. You talked about \u2013 I heard you talk about that and the way that you've hedged. You've indicated that you're pretty confident now that you could be at the high end of the earnings guidance range, but I eyeball those numbers, aren't there certain scenarios where you could even be modestly better than that?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Sure. If the pound continues to strengthen or even stays at the current forward rates, we would probably be slightly above the 6%, which is the upper end of our guidance. And it really depends, Greg, on how we utilize the value that's sitting in 2018 and 2019 and whether we push that out further into the future years or we add it to kind of current years. But clearly, if we were to just maintain it in the current years and the pound stays where it is, we would be at or above the 6%.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","That's great. Thanks, guys. Take care.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question is from Shar Pourreza at Guggenheim Partners.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Good morning, guys.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Good morning.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","So just real quick on WPD. It's obviously one of the best-in-class distribution businesses. I'm kind of curious on \u2013 if you could just discuss a little bit on how you didn't attain the top end of sort of the incentives and how you kind of maybe fell short. And when we're thinking about the forward look, are the benchmarks relatively high to achieve the top end? Or whatever you worked on a current year could be rectified where you could potentially hit the top end? I'm just kind of curious to see where that delta was.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Sure, and I'll ask Robert to comment on that. But just as a reminder, even though we didn't hit the maximum rewards, we still came in above our projected amount, the estimated amount that we had in the business plan. So we're very pleased with the outcome, but I'll ask Robert to comment on what it would take to achieve the maximum rewards.","Robert A. Symons - PPL Corp.","Well, over the years, targets become more difficult. So if we look at South West and we look at Wales, regulators won't let customers pay for something that they've already got. So targets become more difficult over time. So I would say it was not possible to get to the maximum levels in South West and Wales because the target is very, very tough compared to perhaps some of the poorer-performing companies in the UK.","In terms of Midlands and East Midlands, certainly within our grasp and certainly, we've achieved it this year. So dealing with, if you like, incentive revenues associated with reliability, we can make small improvements each year and keep pace with the increasingly more difficult targets as we work towards 2023.","Broad measure survey, you asked what was the severity, what's the scores have you sort of going to get in order to, if you like, top of the table. Certainly, you got to be in the 9 out of 10 area in terms of how customers view you in order to achieve a top ranking. And we've managed to do that for the last five years and I see no reason why we won't do that for the rest of the period.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Yeah. Shar, this is Vince. Let me just add to Robert's comments. So in the first regulatory year, we obtained about 77% of the maximum incentive. In the second regulatory year, we've earned 82% of the maximum. So, while we don't think we can achieve 100% of those, clearly we're moving in the right direction in terms of the amount of those that we're collecting.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then just a follow-up question on the currency hedges. Can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about waiting and seeing the pound sort of recover or monetize in the money portion and roll it forward into 2020? So how should we think about the timing of that decision and what sort of is the timing and the inflection point of when you decide to roll or not?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Sure. Well, as we've talked about before, we have a three-year kind of rolling-forward hedge program. And as we get into the midpoint of this year and the year-end, we would then look to layer on additional hedges for 2020.","Again, we would probably look at where the pound sits at that time compared to our $1.30 planning assumption and either if the pound is above it, we'd probably be a little bit more aggressive with the hedging. If it's below and we'd see reasons for upside, we may delay a bit. But overall, I think it would be probably at the earliest, midpoint of this year, we'd start layering on anything for 2020.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Got it. Thank you. And then just one last question, if I may, with more from a strategy standpoint and how you're thinking about the U.S. growth business with WPD's growth now kind of far exceeding the U.S. business. Can you just talk a little bit about the appetite to continue to see WPD become a larger piece of the business? Is there an appetite for that or are you looking at organic or acquisition opportunities to maintain sort of that current business mix?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Yeah. Couple thoughts there. One is we are not looking at acquisition opportunities to maintain the mix or change the mix at all. I think we're happy with the organic growth opportunities we have in the U.S., and so we're focused on growing our U.S. businesses through deployment of capital.","And as you're aware right now, we're essentially spending about $3 billion a year in capital. $2 billion of the $3 billion is in the U.S., and $1 billion in the UK. So over time, even though the UK EPS-wise is growing faster, we're deploying more rate base on the U.S. business side.","Relative to other opportunities, we've obviously been very focused on making sure that we protect against the currency fluctuation. So that has been a major focus of making sure that we meet our 5% to 6% EPS growth. And as we indicated, we're very pleased with where we sit right now.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","That's it. Thanks, guys. Congrats.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith at UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good morning.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. So I suppose I just want to be very clear about this. It seems that you have latitude given the FX and hedge position. To the extent to which the CapEx is being delayed, and I know you haven't formally effectuated that change yet, I suspect your comments about being at the top end of the range would still apply. Just an affirmation of that.","And then, secondly, clearly you haven't delayed the CapEx yet. How are you thinking about and are there any levers that you can pull at this point on the capital side to replace that, maybe not necessarily in Kentucky, but in other jurisdictions?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Sure. Well, first off, I would say we can still hit the top end even with some delay on the capital. The $300 million that we talked about is really in the grand scheme, not that meaningful to the EPS growth story. And as Vic commented, it's possible that that could come back in, albeit maybe on a delay.","Well, once we get to the point where we know the outcome of that particular capital program, we'll look at other opportunities, whether it's in Kentucky or elsewhere, where we could see some potential future growth. So we'll wait and see, but as I said, I don't think that $300 million is really that meaningful to the growth story at all.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","And actually, since you bring it up, what are those considerations that potentially bringing it back into the picture in a subsequent filing in short?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Yeah. I'll let Vic comment on that.","Victor A. Staffieri - PPL Corp.","Hey, Julien. This is Vic. It was just the \u2013 there were 15 parties to the settlement negotiations and just some of the parties were concerned, they didn't understand the mechanics of the process. There is still some reluctance in Kentucky to move forward with smart meters and that we just couldn't resolve it into settlement fashion.","So we decided to put it into collaborative and try to deal with some of those issues \u2013 privacy issues, access issues, when we turn people off \u2013 those kinds of things through automation. Those are the kinds of issues that were surrounding the discussions and based upon that, we just decided we'd get into a collaborative and pull it out in this proceeding.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Excellent. Thank you.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Jonathan Arnold at Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, guys.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Good morning, Jon.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I have one on Compass. I think you said that there was a review going on by the New York ISO and it was delayed a bit by Indian Point closure, but you thought that that review would be done by March. Is there any update there?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Yeah, there is an update and I'll let Greg Dudkin take care of that.","Gregory N. Dudkin - PPL Electric Utilities Corporation","Thanks, Bill. Yeah. So the update is that we had filed a feasibility study with New York ISO and that's been completed and come back positive.","The other study that we had that New York ISO do is quota carrier study, which is basically economic review, what's the economic impact of the project. We got the preliminary results back, they're confidential, but I would say they're very positive. So everything we've gotten back from New York ISO has been positive.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So is that \u2013 you've said the estimated in-service is 2023 if the project was to move. What are the next steps and is that still the timeframe?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Yeah. So the next steps are we are proceeding with the Article VII process. We will have to do a system reliability impact study. We've ticked that off. And then, we have to basically select an approval process whether it's a public policy project, which would have to be opened by New York ISO, or there's another separate process under CARIS, which is the economic project. So, we still feel confident with the 2021 to 2023 dates.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","When you say 2021, will that be in-service or start construction?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Start construction.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, if I could, just on the UK incentive slides, I was just looking at the column where you give the data for the performance levels you have to achieve to hit the maximum rewards, and they seem to have changed versus last quarter and in some cases, quite a lot. Is there anything \u2013 what would have caused the performance trigger levels to have changed?","Robert A. Symons - PPL Corp.","The performance levels that you see for maximum reward include planned outages as well as unplanned outages. I think the ones we gave you before, which are unplanned, but the actual performance is measured against unplanned outages and half the quantity of planned outages.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","There was a slight change in how you showed us the numbers.","Robert A. Symons - PPL Corp.","That's correct.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's all. Thank you.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Okay. Thank you.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","And I think seeing no further questions in the queue, I want to thank everyone for joining us on today's call and we will talk to you on the second quarter earnings call.

Joe Bergstein, you may begin your conference.","Joe Bergstein","Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining the PPL conference call on first quarter results and our general business outlook. We are providing slides to this presentation on our website at www.pplweb.com.","Any statements made in this presentation about future operating results or other future events are forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

A discussion of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ is contained in the appendix to this presentation and in the company's SEC filings. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Spence, PPL Chairman, President and CEO.","William H. Spence","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Appreciate you joining us this morning. Here with me today are Paul Farr, PPL's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as our 4 business segment presidents who will participate in the Q&A session later today -- later on the call. To kick off the call this morning, I'll provide an overview of our first quarter results, some commentary on our 2013 earnings forecast and an operational overview. Following my remarks, Paul will provide a more detailed financial overview.","Turning to Slide 4, I'm pleased to report that we delivered strong growth in each of our regulated segments in the first quarter. Combined, the regulated businesses delivered a growth of 40% in earnings from ongoing operations. And earnings per share from ongoing operations increased by $0.01 despite lower earnings in our Supply business, as well as the impact of accelerated share recognition from the 2010 and 2011 equity units. This is a topic I'll discuss in more detail in a minute.","On a net income basis, earnings from ongoing operations increased about 11% in the first quarter versus the same period a year ago. Reported earnings were lower than last year, mainly due to net mark-to-market adjustments on economic hedges in the Supply segment and foreign currency hedges we have in place on future U.K. earnings.","Now, let's turn to a discussion of our 2013 earnings forecast, which you'll find on Slide 5.","We're updating our forecast to reflect the impact of accelerated share recognition from the equity units we issued in 2010 and 2011, in connection with our Kentucky and U.K. acquisitions. Our original guidance only reflected a partial year impact of the shares related to the 2010 equity units that settle midyear 2013. Late in the first quarter, we finalized our financing plans for the required remarketing of debt securities related to these equity units, allowing us to hedge our interest rate exposure for both equity units at attractive rates, rates that improved as we moved through the quarter. Those activities caused us to reflect the full expected impact of common stock underlying both series of equity units in our calculation of earnings per share effective January 1 of this year.","The accelerated share recognition impacted first quarter ongoing earnings by $0.06 per share and is expected to impact full year 2013 ongoing earnings by $0.10 per share.","As a result, we're adjusting our ongoing earnings forecast to $2.15 to $2.40 per share. We also announced this morning, a reduction in future equity needs of approximately $100 million per year. We believe we can maintain our rate base growth plans and targeted credit metrics even in light of this equity reduction. We clearly view both actions as positive for share owners. I want to stress that our view of 2013 net income from ongoing operations remains unchanged since our original forecast, and we feel very good about the forecast after delivering a very strong first quarter. Paul will provide additional details on what I just covered in a few minutes. But first, let me highlight a few operational things on Slide 6.","Moving to Slide 6, our U.K. subsidiary is preparing for a price control review under a new regulatory approach called RIIO. WPD is finalizing detailed business plans for each of our 4 distribution networks, and we'll submit those plans to Ofgem, the regulator, by July 1. Our objective is to be selected for fast-track consideration by Ofgem, which would enable us to conclude WPD's price control review early in 2014. This would provide greater certainty in base revenues and financial incentives. You can follow key developments and filings in this process on the Investor section of our website.","In January, PPL Electric Utilities filed a request with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission for accelerated recovery of certain distribution system reliability improvements. We expect the decision from the PUC later into spring, with implementation of the DSIC cost recovery mechanism beginning July 1. Also in Pennsylvania, construction work continues on the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line. We've updated our cost estimate to $630 million based upon final contract costs.","In March, PPL Electric Utilities began construction of the 500 KV Lackawanna Substation, a critical component of the project. We continue to expect the line will be completed and in service by the summer of 2015. This project is a major part of our regulated infrastructure investment program that will improve regional electric reliability, create jobs and provide a significant regional economic boost.","Moving to the sales volumes for the quarter on Slide 7, in Kentucky, weather normalized sales increased about 1.5% for the first quarter of 2013 compared to 2012. The increase was primarily driven by residential sales, which were up more than 5% due to customer growth and improved economic conditions.","Industrial sales were slightly higher in the first quarter of 2013 as several large industrial customers in the chemical and automotive industries experienced increased volumes. In Pennsylvania, weather normalized sales declined slightly on increased energy efficiency, energy conservation and a challenged industrial sector. However, we did see a 3% increase in residential sales over 2012, driven by increased customer usage and a small increase in customer count.","Turning to the competitive Supply segment on Slide 8, in April, we began a scheduled refueling and maintenance outage on Unit 2 at our Susquehanna nuclear plant. During this outage, we will replace the turbine hose to improve airflow and reduce blade vibration. In addition, we are installing new blades to have stronger metallurgical properties. We expect this to provide a long-term solution to the turbine blade issues that have affected Susquehanna operations over the last 2 years.","Later in the spring, we plan to take Susquehanna Unit 1 out of service for the upgrades needed to address its turbine blade issues.","On a final nuclear note, we had excellent performance from both Susquehanna units during the first quarter with 100% availability. In April, we also reached commercial operation on the upgraded Rainbow hydro electric plant. The project increased generating capacity of the Rainbow plant by 70% and spurred considerable business activity in the Great Falls area of Montana. In summary, we're off to a very good start in 2013 with solid financial results that keep us firmly on track to meet ongoing earnings. We continue to take proactive steps to efficiently finance our growth plans by locking in low interest rates and reducing our equity needs, while still maintaining our targeted credit metrics. We also remain very optimistic about our ability to execute on the major construction programs, delivering solid results for customers and growing share owner value. I look forward to your questions and now, turn the call over to Paul Farr.","Paul A. Farr","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my remarks by providing some additional color on the EPS impact we are reporting in Q1 and that will impact our full-year 2013 EPS related to the 2010 and 2011 equity units. The decline in interest rates we observed during the quarter incented us to finalize remarketing plans for the $2.1 billion debt component of the equity units. After finalizing the plans, we hedged about 90% of the treasury, interest rate exposure and locked in what we consider attractive rates with a weighted average duration that is somewhat longer than we had originally planned. The combination of our financing plan and the significant downward movement in interest rates since the equity units were originally issued, caused us to change from the treasury stock method to if-converted accounting in calculating diluted earnings per share. This change affects EPS beginning in the first quarter of this year, and no prior periods are affected by the change in accounting.","Further, the terms of the equity units have not changed and the actual issuance of the common stock still are scheduled to occur July 1 of this year and May 1, 2014, for the 2010 and 2011 equity units, respectively. The accelerated share recognition only impacts the 2013  calculation of diluted earnings per share, and our underlying net income forecast has not changed as Bill just indicated.","Let's move to Slide 9, where we show the combined impact year-on-year share count for the change in equity unit accounting and the decision not to issue common stock to fund our DRIP in management comp needs in 2013 and beyond. We've outlined both our original projection of weighted average common shares outstanding as provided on the year-end 2012 earnings call and our revised estimates.","The net impact on 2013 is approximately 50 million of additional shares included in the weighted average share count. Our original projection basically had a half year impact from the 2010 equity units that will settle midyear this year and no impact from the 2011 equity units due to the treasury method treatment we had used in the past. You can see that there's no net impact on 2014 versus our prior projection, and the outright increase over 2013 is primarily driven by a full year impact of the equity forward that settles in Q2 of this year. The elimination of approximately $100 million per year in planned new share issuance clearly benefits 2015 and beyond as 10 million fewer shares are outstanding starting in 2015.","Let's now move to Slide 10 where we have provided an updated 2012 to 2013 earnings walk reflecting these changes. The net $0.10 decline from our original 2013 EPS guidance is driven by $0.18 from the impact of additional shares for the if-converted treatment of the equity units, partially offset by a $0.07 adjustment in the earnings per share calculation for the interest expense associated with the debt component of the equity units under if-converted accounting, and a $0.01 benefit from the removal of new issuance for DRIP and management comp from our 2013 financing plan. Again, our forecast of underlying net income and the EPS forecast is unchanged.","Now, let's move to Slide 11 to review our first quarter financial results. PPL's first quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased over last year, primarily driven by substantially improved earnings at all 3 of our regulated business segments. This was partially offset by lower earnings in the Supply segment, primarily due to lower hedged wholesale power prices. Let's begin our segment review with the Kentucky regulated segment on Slide 12.","Kentucky earned $0.14 per share in the first quarter, an $0.08 increase compared to last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher margins due to new base rates that went into effect on January 1, higher retail electric volumes as a result of colder weather in 2013 and additional revenues from environmental investments. O&M was lower primarily due to the timing and scope of scheduled generation outages for 2013. Partially offsetting these positive drivers were higher depreciation and dilution of $0.01 per share.","Moving to Slide 13, our U.K. regulated segment earned $0.37 per share in the first quarter, a $0.06 increase over last year. This increase was due to higher utility revenues, primarily driven by higher prices, and lower U.K. income taxes driven by a slightly lower effective tax rate. These positive earnings drivers were partially offset by higher O&M and dilution of $0.04 per share.","Turning now to Slide 14, our Pennsylvania regulated segment earned $0.10 per share in the quarter, a $0.04 increase compared to last year. This increase was the result of higher delivery margins, primarily due to new rates that went into effect on January 1, and higher sales volumes due to mild weather in 2012, lower O&M and lower interest charges. These positive earnings drivers were partially offset by dilution of $0.01 per share.","Moving to Slide 15, our Supply segment earned $0.11 per share in the first quarter, a decrease of $0.16 compared to last year. This decrease was primarily the net result of lower Eastern energy margins driven by lower baseload energy prices, partially offset by increased baseload unit availability, higher capacity prices and higher margins on intermediate and peaking units. Lower Western energy margins, primarily due to lower wholesale energy prices, higher depreciation, higher income taxes, primarily due to a 2012 state tax rate adjustment, and dilution of $0.01 per share. These negative drivers were partially offset by lower O&M due to lower outage costs.","That completes the more detailed financial overview, and I'll now turn the call back over to Bill for the Q&A period.","William H. Spence","Thanks, Paul. Operator, we're ready for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  Your first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just on the Supply side of the business, can we maybe talk kind of beyond 2014? I know on the last call, you guys suggested that '14 represent the trough. But can you maybe shed the light on where hedging is right now for '15 and beyond, and maybe kind of what pricing trends you're seeing in those numbers to give confidence to a better outlook there?","William H. Spence","Sure. I'll make a couple of comments, then I'll turn it over to Dave DeCampli, who's President of our Supply business. Clearly, 2014 prices and '15 have improved over the last few months, along with heat [ph] rates kind of. But I think overall, our view of the 4 power fundamentals remains pretty much as it has been, which was we continue to see upside of $3 to $5 per megawatt hour in the '15, '16 timeframe, mostly driven by MATS compliance cost, as well as retirements. They're expected to begin in that type of timeframe. I think overall, we continue to see the strength. It's shown itself a little bit here in the quarter, but I don't think quarterly movements are all that indicative per se. I think we'd still rely predominantly on our fundamental views. With that being said, Dave, do you want to provide any other color commentary?","David G. DeCampli","Well, sure. Dan, on the hedging strategy, our target range for 2015 is to be between 0% and 30% hedged. We're sitting between 10% and 20% right now. We've benefit -- we're on the lower end of that actually. So that's where we sit today. Bill's comments on forward prices, we're still viewing the market as being having $3 to $5 upside in it for 2015 at this point. That's what our fundamentals are dictating.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess just with RPM closing in, what are your expectations as you guys look out at the market today?","David G. DeCampli","Now, all the parameters are out now. So we are viewing that as -- so we're sticking to our assumption that it will come in lower than the previous auction. The parameters have not yielded any material changes in our opinion on that, so we're seeing that 16, 17 auction being a bit lower than the previous 1.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, Bill, can you just share your thoughts on dividend policy? With the -- you're going to cut back on the DRIP and that sort of thing, the decision to raise less equity rather than maybe more of that money toward a dividend increase on a sustainable basis?","William H. Spence","Dan, I really don't think that decision has any impact on our ability to grow the dividend. I think we're still very comfortable with growing the dividend as we grow the Regulated segment earnings.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So when do you guys expect to -- if you sit down with the board and talked about the strategy of when you revisit, what is the next point [ph]  where that discussion comes up and what do you think the board needs to see? Is there a level of confidence in the U.K. outlook with the RIIO process that has to get done before they feel like the growth trajectory is fully confident to cement in the dividend?","Paul A. Farr","Yes, Dan, this is Paul. Yes, we normally -- the board normally entertains the annual dividend adjustment early in the year. So we just went through that process in the January-type timeframe for the April 1 increase, and everybody's kind of seen that. What we have said is there are large commitments to growth from a regulated rate base perspective. And so as we look forward, as Bill indicated, I wouldn't look at the $100 million new issuance reduction as impacting what we can do from a dividend perspective. It's really the capital call on the capital that we got and our ability to massage the balance sheet. So I would still expect that we'd be able to deliver modest dividend increases as we make our way through the meatiest part of the CapEx rate base growth plan, primarily in transmission in Pennsylvania and the environmental investments in Kentucky. Those -- as you can see on our 5-year CapEx slide that's in the deck, those really start to trail off after the '13-, '14-, '15-type timeframe, and that would provide more flexibility starting in '16 and beyond as it relates to the dividends.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So first quick question here and I apologize. What are the projected new average share counts, if you will, especially for '13 here? Has that changed? Or I imagine it has, obviously.","Paul A. Farr","Yes, Julien, this is Paul. There is a -- right in front of my comments in the deck on Page...","William H. Spence","Slide 9, I think.","Paul A. Farr","Slide 9. There's -- we go from 615 million weighted average for '13 to 665 million. 2014 is unchanged, 670 million the old [ph] forecast, 670 million revised. And for 2015, the original was 680 million shares and now, it's down to 670 million shares. So really, after the -- you get the full weighted average effects from the forward that settled in Q2, there's no change in the share count going forward.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And I presume the '15 changes, that's just because of the lower equity issuance comments earlier?","Paul A. Farr","That's correct. That's the cumulative effect of basically 300 million in lower issuances, 100 million each of '13, '14 and '15.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. Second question here. In RIIO, you alluded to a potential Fast-Track. Is this -- is there any potential for the individual utilities to get Fast-Tracked or would this be an all-or-nothing kind of thing?","William H. Spence","It would be the individual DNOs would each have the opportunity to be Fast-Tracked. So conceivably and hopefully, we can have all 4 of the DNOs Fast-Tracked.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then moving back to the Supply segment for a quick second. You alluded to your fundamental view on upside, but obviously, DAR [ph] expense have really improved here. What is your view on coal? Obviously, you haven't locked in too much from what I can tell. How do you think about those pricing trends from here?","William H. Spence","Sure. Dave, do you want to take a shot at that?","David G. DeCampli","I would say overall, if I look at where the coal market has been, it's been relatively soft here in the short term. I would expect, with the retirements, it's going to continue to be somewhat challenged then. And so we have not taken a lot of steps to hedge forward beyond '14. I mean, we're still pretty heavily hedged in '13 and '14. But I think we're waiting to see how things settle out on the forward coal price side. But I wouldn't expect that our forward view on coal markets would have changed that much. I haven't looked at it lately, but I think we're pretty much in the same ballpark as where we were previously.","William H. Spence","Yes, and in the shortest term, we've seen material improvements within the quarter from a dispatch perspective on both coal-fired and our combined cycle units. So we saw strong performance at Susquehanna, about a 20% increase in capacity factors from coal and very strong performance from the gas units as well.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then just a little nuance here. When you talk about '14 being the trough, is that really based on your market view or your fundamental view?","David G. DeCampli","Well, right now, because we're well over 60% hedged in 2014, so it's a combination in '14 of where we are already hedged, as well as our kind of mark-to-market view of where the forwards are today. When you get out to '15, I think the mark-to-market is less relevant for us and we really switch over -- begin switching over in '15 to more of a fundamental view.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","But still, on a mark-to-market basis, you would still be higher at '15 versus '14, correct?","David G. DeCampli","I think it will be closer to flat, '14 to '15, if you looked on a mark-to-market only basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Neel Mitra with Tudor Pickering.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","A question on the U.K. In your projections, you still use exchange rate of $1.58 per pound. That's obviously been moving around a little bit. What are you embedding kind of in '15 and beyond for the exchange rate? And then more philosophically, how do you look at hedging that?","Paul A. Farr","So from a forward perspective, our business -- our internal 5-year business plan would use a relatively constant rate of that $1.58. We are about 90% hedged in 2013 earnings, and 60% to 70% hedged on next year's earnings, and we started to layer some hedges in the following year. That's our normal 3-year approach to things, very similar, again, to the way that we hedge the generation from the plants. So I'd expect that we continue on that. I would say that our hedges for both '13 and '14 are slightly ahead of that $1.58 number. '15 and beyond is a little bit down off of plan, but nothing material at this point.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then moving to the Supply side, the $3 to $5 uplift versus the forwards in '15 and beyond, how do you look at all those new builds that are being announced in -- or in Pennsylvania on top of the Marcellus? And what's your view on the probability that those get built and how they would actually impact the forward curve?","William H. Spence","Sure. Well, I think first off, it will be interesting to see if they clear in the capacity market auction firstly. And I think that will dictate for some of those units if they move forward or not. I think secondly, when we look at the economics of new builds, we still can't get there in terms of the numbers. So I think you have to have a pretty aggressive forward view on a significant recovery in power prices and a pretty good view on capacity prices to really clear what we think would be reasonable hurdle rates. But that's PPL's view. So we're continuing to follow that, we continue to follow the PJM rule changes that we believe are necessary to make sure that all generation is being bid in on a level playing field, and meaning no subsidies. So we're continuing to follow that very closely.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then one last quick question. Has your view on basis changed? Is it still flat going out or we've seen some basis moves this quarter obviously. What are your thoughts on that?","Paul A. Farr","For 2013, we have built into our plan about $1 negative basis for our units. I get -- I think we expect that to continue until a lot of the transmission work in PJM gets done, which would really take us out to the 2015 timeframe. And then we would expect some improvement on a go-forward basis from there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I just want to clarify, what drove the accounting change to or from the treasury method?","Paul A. Farr","A combination of the types of securities that we actually ultimately plan to issue to, call it, refinance the remarketing or to do the remarketing and the decline in interest rates. But the test that we have to use for accounting measurement purposes keep us in a relatively tight band of net present value of cash flows and the combination of the decline in interest rates outright across all tenors, plus the tenors we selected ended up having us breach those bands and not let us defend them, and pushed us into having to use if-converted accounting.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then what drove your ability to take $100 million of equities? Did you just -- blocking and tackling and a little finer detail work on the credit metrics?","Paul A. Farr","That's correct. Yes, we're getting ready to start our annual business signing process for the year, and the treasury and business planning team looked at the numbers and we felt good about our ability to be able to remain strong FFO metrics and be able to accomplish the growth plan without the equity. And so as we've kind of been telling you guys for at least a couple of years, we're very not just committed to that, but incented to try to reduce that because we don't think that the share price reflects full fundamental value of the generation. So again, every time we were out needing to issue shares with that value not reflected, it was diluting the value that we think will show up for the current share base. And so we've been doing everything we can to try to whittle that issuance down. We started at 300, we moved to 100, and now, we've been able to eliminate it in full.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","But was it a change in the fundamental outlook? I mean, did you see FFO improving or was it a combination of things?","Paul A. Farr","No, I think it's just our ability to manage other operating cash flow line items to be able to accomplish similar objectives in FFO.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And lastly, any update on whether you consider the Western assets still to be core?","William H. Spence","As we've said in the past, we don't comment on those types of activities, so we won't start today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Just a question. First, a detailed question on Supply. The -- it looked like your expected generation in '13 is down like 1.3 million megawatt hours versus year-end plan for baseload?","William H. Spence","Yes, that's correct.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","What's driving that?","William H. Spence","Dave?","David G. DeCampli","Yes. Primarily, a couple of forced outages, which were minor, but the primary drivers, the transmission construction activity and economics have pushed a couple of our coal plants offline a little bit more than we expected in the first quarter. And that is the difference.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. So that already happened in the first quarter?","William H. Spence","That's correct, yes.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And with respect to -- if I recall, you guys did a lot of like option hedging, generally, in your collars?","William H. Spence","We have in the past, yes...","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Is that -- I guess did prices move enough that you're -- it doesn't look like you're really -- your hedge price has really moved. Is that because prices didn't move enough within the collars or they did move and it just kind of gets averaged -- rounded out?","William H. Spence","I think it's really, probably a combination of both, depending on when we put those collars in place, Steve. But yes, I think generally speaking, that's the case.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And then just -- I know you can't comment on the Montana assets directly, but just in thinking -- in the update on the equity issuance plans that you gave today, did that incorporate any view of potential strategic action there or is that just status quo as you are?","Paul A. Farr","As status quo as we are, that's really just fine-tuning our financing plan and looking to be as effective and efficient on the balance sheet as we possibly can. And so just trying to be proactive, it's not embedded anything new on the strategic front into those forward numbers.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And then one last quick question. Just the view that RPM is going to be down, is that just -- could you just give a little more color why you think that's the case? Is it just new generation, MISO generation, what are the drivers?","Paul A. Farr","I think there's probably multiple drivers, but I think the ones that kind of I could tick off my head, and then Dave can comment, would be probably a lower demand for a while than we had previously expected overall; a little bit more supply coming in the stack and I think possibly, a little less retirements in that timeframe. But I think those would be the drivers. And DSM continues to be, I think, a factor as we get to the saturation point probably here in this next auction. But I think it's still a factor in this auction. So those would be the drivers.","David G. DeCampli","Plus, we would expect some participation from price responsive demand, recently approved by FERC. And we -- for modeling purposes, here, we're assuming a range of somewhere between $136 and $148.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just some -- and this may be for Paul, some broader questions regarding the balance sheet, capitalization ratios and cash flows. Once the converts convert, meaning the actual transactions happen, so the second one coming in May of 2014, what do you think that does to your debt to cap? Meaning right now, your total debt to cap is around 60%, but how do you think about what your capitalization ratios will be once the conversions play out?","Paul A. Farr","Michael, I don't focus as much on capitalization at corp. Clearly, from the perspective of the cap ratio that the utilities, the 65% that's wrapped [ph] in the U.K, the 51% to 52% in PA, the -- a little over 53% in Kentucky in both opcos, none of those get changed by the court decision on the share issuance or by the converts converting. When that additional cash shows up, we will, as we said in the past, defease off a bit of debt that's maturing at Supply. But a substantial amount of that will go into EU and into LKE for the 2 operating companies in Kentucky to be able to finance the growth plan. So from a corporate FFO metric change perspective, if you will, I don't see that. We got the equity credit really upfront in those. This is just now fully showing up on the GAAP balance sheet. So I -- I don't think if I'm -- sorry if I'm not answering your questioning perfectly, but we don't really think about it from a capitalization perspective at corp. We concern ourselves most with the FFO metrics at the subsidiary, and then FFO consolidated, obviously, for S&P.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And when we think longer-term, meaning past 2014, like if I look at your CapEx slide in you earnings deck today, so CapEx in '15 is $1 billion less than 2013.","Paul A. Farr","Right.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And your depreciation, I assume, will start making a sizable step-up after -- I mean, you'll be putting a lot of this CapEx in the service, and therefore, D&A will be up. So let's say the swing is $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion range. That is a good amount of the incremental capital that you're currently deploying that will now turn into cash flow available to you. How do you think about sources and uses of that cash flow over time really beginning in 2015, 2016 timeframe?","Paul A. Farr","Yes, that was the -- that goes back to the comment that I made about the dividend question earlier and that Bill made about the dividend question earlier in that -- and your relative order of magnitude of the math is correct. We have really both of the sets of domestic utilities going from huge capital consumers [ph] to -- at least in the instance of Kentucky, Greg will still be consuming capital in his distribution rate base reliability plan. But we go from -- they go from relatively large consumers to either being flat or positive from a cash flow perspective. That's what creates that capability to look at the dividends more, not aggressively, but more, call it, more constructively, more -- increase it at a higher rate than we're likely going to be able to over the next several years. That's really where that cash flow starts to show up after we get through the meatiest part of the CapEx growth plan.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But I mean that's a sizable swing in cash, $1 billion plus swing? Are you also planning significant de-leveraging either at the holdco or at Supply using some of that incremental free cash flow?","Paul A. Farr","Yes, I think it depends upon what we see as our investment alternatives at that point in the regulated utilities. Yes, I guess we see a capability potentially in the future to have additional maybe calls on the capital. But to the extent that it's surplus to the needs, I would expect the capability to do a combination of de-leveraging and stock buybacks to be able to support the balance sheet and the targeted credit metrics that we have today. So if we can find things to invest in that provide a greater return than returning the capital or shrinking the balance sheet a bit, we'll do that. And if not, we'll return it, either through bigger dividend increases or buybacks.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Meaning come 2015, 2016, you could actually be in a position to shrink the equity component of the balance sheet?","Paul A. Farr","It's really in the '16-type timeframe and forward, correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So when I look at the -- at Slide 7 of your handout, you guys posted a pretty strong weather normalized sales growth in Kentucky. And not so good in Pennsylvania, but when I compare that to your commentary from the fourth quarter call, it looks like you're ahead of what you would've expected in Kentucky but sort of on plan in Pennsylvania because you said in the fourth quarter call, you were looking at a decrease of about 0.5% year-over-year on a volume basis in Pennsylvania, growth of a little under 1% in Kentucky. So can you go through, in more granular detail, what's driving outperformance or underperformance versus your plan in each segment?","William H. Spence","Sure. I will start with Vic in Kentucky, provide a little bit of commentary.","Victor A. Staffieri","Kentucky, you see the residential up 5.2% weather normalized. And I think economic conditions in Kentucky are improving slowly but surely. Our unemployment is down, our new housing starts, '12 over '11, were up 16%. And I'm pleased to say, in the first quarter of 2013, they were up 12%. So we're starting to see the better housing starts, housing prices are going up, unemployment is coming down. And there might even be some spillover from our industrial growth because we're getting more reinvestment now in the Commonwealth. You may have heard Toyota has -- is going to put some more money in there. General Electric has just opened another line. Ford is running at full capacity now. So there were spinoffs from the industrial as well. There are jobs, there are ancillary businesses that are deploying. So -- from -- and I would say the fourth quarter and now, the first quarter have been just very good to us. And so we have some reasonable optimism that the economy in Kentucky is progressing nicely. I should point out though that in the past, Kentucky has kind of -- it hasn't come down as quickly as the rest of the nation, and generally, it doesn't go up. It's a little more steady as you go, and I suspect we're seeing that here now kind of coming back slowly but steadily, particularly on the industrial side. And we're getting some benefits now from unemployment decreases and new housing starts on the residential side.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","But not to debate you here live, but what you're showing here in the first quarter is not slow and steady, it's double your expectation for the year.","Victor A. Staffieri","I'll have a better view on this after the third quarter if it continues, Greg. How does that sound?","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Fair enough.","William H. Spence","Greg, any comments from Pennsylvania?","Gregory N. Dudkin","Yes, just on Pennsylvania, I'd say there's -- on the residential side, we are, I'd say, outperforming. And what we're seeing, really, the first time fairly [indiscernible], average use per customer has actually increased. So some nice trends on the growth there. On the small C&I and industrial side, I think the economy is still hurting us there. And that's why we're a little bit underplan on those areas.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","You were down 7.8% in the first quarter on industrial. Is that like one big customer that went out or a series of things? Is that like a lumpy item or is that indicative of a trend?","Gregory N. Dudkin","Well, I guess similar to what Vic said, we're going to be taking a look at that over the next quarter. I don't think that'll continue, but we'll have to see.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Raymond Leung with Goldman Sachs.","Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Greg actually asked my question on the sales growth, but could we talk a little bit about your financing plans? You show a pretty large negative free cash. Can you sort of elaborate on your thoughts on the remarketing and equity units and how you will fill in the blanks on the financing plans?","Paul A. Farr","Yes, Ray, the -- when you're looking at the charts that I think you're referring to in the cash flow chart in the back, we've got $1.150 billion that obviously shows up in the second quarter to early third quarter as new cash flow. We've got the equity forward that settled in the second quarter, which is -- it was originally $250 million. We actually net settled about $50 million of that to handle the DRIP and the management comp that actually went out in the first quarter. But that shows up as new cash flow, and then the retained earnings from the company net is where the equity sources of cash come from to finance the utilities.","Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Any thoughts on debt financings? You have the remarketing, we know, and then I know you did hybrid earlier this year. But what are you thinking for the balance to cover up the shortfall?","Paul A. Farr","I would expect that we're doing -- we'd be doing a significant number of first mortgage bonds at LG&E and KU. We've got one planned for Greg's team as well at Electric Utilities. Again, as they ratably grow their balance sheet, they'll be financing at those 53% and 51%, 51.5% equity ratios, and the balance comes from new debt issuance. I think we have one issuance planned later in the year for Supply, like $300 million or $400 million. But that would be it other than, again, all of that cash showing up midyear from the converts converting and this equity forward settlement that happened in Q2.","Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And that's -- on terms of Supply financing, that's somewhat new. Is that sort of impartial refinancing that 750 maturity?","Paul A. Farr","A big chunk of that will actually get absorbed by or defeased off by $1.150 billion that shows up. So the issuance is right around, I think, $300 million for later this year in Supply. It's not all that significant.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just a lot of questions have been answered, but just back to sort of the RPM. I guess the MOPR decision on the revisions, you don't expect that one way or the other, at this point in time, to have an impact on the auction results, is that right?","William H. Spence","Yes, Paul, we're not expecting that. As every day ticks by, it's less likely. So the range, the sensitivity range I mentioned earlier, is not inclusive of that outcome.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And if it were to happen today, it still wouldn't be able to impact it. Is that the way to think about it? Or are you hearing more from -- I'm just trying to get some sense on that, I'm sorry.","William H. Spence","No, I think you have it right.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then in terms of -- there was a mention of price responsive demand having impact on the RPM Auction. And I was wondering, I think of that as more of an energy product if I'm looking at the same thing you are. Why does it have an impact on the RPM auction? If you could just help me out with that.","William H. Spence","Well, it's capped for the BRA, but we think that it would actually lower the demand in the auction, which would tend to lower the clearing price. So it would have an effect on the demand.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So you think that price responsive demand will lower the demand from -- in terms of the RR curve or how should we think of that? Maybe I'll follow up after, offline.","William H. Spence","Yes, that -- why don't we do that? It's a pretty technical type of question, so let's go...","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Do you see price response demand, since it's sort of an energy thing, do you see that -- this year versus last year, any changes you see with respect to that, just your outlook or expectation?","Paul A. Farr","No, not really. Not from last year to this year, Paul.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium.","Ashar Khan","I just wanted to say congratulations, and Paul, I really like this move of getting the dilution out of the way and clearing it for the stockholders. I think it provides a good trajectory for growth going forward. And I think that's a brilliant move, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Goldenberg with Luminus Management.","Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management, LLC","My questions have been asked and answered.","Operator","We have no further questions.","William H.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Bergstein, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Joe Bergstein","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the PPL conference call on third quarter results and our general business outlook. We are providing slides to this presentation on our website at www.pplweb.com.","Any statements made in this presentation about future operating results or other future events are forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from such forward-looking statements. A discussion of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ is contained in the appendix to this presentation and in the company's SEC filings.","This time, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Spence, PPL Chairman, President and CEO.","William H. Spence","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. With me on the call are Paul Farr, PPL's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and the Presidents of 3 of our 4 business segments. Greg Dudkin, President of PPL Electric Utilities, is not able to join us today. I'll start today's call with an overview of third quarter and year-to-date results, briefly review operational highlights, and then I'll discuss the increase to our midpoint of the 2013 earnings forecast that we announced this morning. Following my remarks, Paul will review the financial results in more detail.","Today, we're reporting solid earnings for the third quarter and year-to-date. Quarterly earnings from ongoing operations increased by 3% over 2012 on a net income basis, driven by continued growth in our regulated business segments in the United Kingdom, Pennsylvania and Kentucky. Through 9 months, earnings from ongoing operations are 6% higher than a year ago.","On Slide 4, you'll notice that on a per-share basis ongoing earnings are slightly lower than 2012 for both the quarter and year-to-date, primarily due to the increased share count associated with the 2010 and 2011 equity units, which we've discussed in some detail in previous calls.","I'd also like to note that third quarter and year-to-date 2013 earnings were negatively affected by $0.06 per share due to a noncash adjustment deferred tax asset. Paul will address this item in more detail shortly. Excluding those items, ongoing earnings per share from our regulated business segments are up by 23% year-to-date compared to the first 9 months of 2012. The regulated business segments represent almost 90% of PPL's ongoing earnings on a year-to-date basis.","Moving to Slide 5. Today, we're announcing an increase to the midpoint of our 2013 earnings forecast as a result of the continuing strong performance of our regulated business segments. Specifically, we're increasing the midpoint of our ongoing earnings forecast to $2.35 per share from the previous midpoint of $2.32 per share. The increase is driven primarily by a $0.04 improvement in projected earnings from our U.K. Regulated segment. Our U.K. business continues to deliver superior results both financially as well as operationally.","Let's move to Slide 6 for a review of some of the operational highlights of the quarter. We recently received work from the U.K. Office of Gas and Electricity Markets that it expects to announce its initial business plan assessment and fast track draft determination on November 22. In that announcement, we will learn whether any of our 4 U.K. subsidiaries will receive accelerated consideration of their business plans under the RIIO-ED1 process. Subsequent to the submittal of our business plans on July 1, we have met with Ofgem staff and the committee of its board in accordance with Ofgem's schedule, and we continue to believe that our well-justified plans support the fast tracking of all 4 of our distribution network operators.","Another recent highlight for our U.K. Regulated segment was the determination of the 2012 and 2013 annual incentive awards for WPD. Beginning April 1, 2014, we expect to collect about $110 million in bonus revenue due to our strong operating metrics, which is a 30% increase to what we received for the 2011-2012 regulatory year. Included in that award was more than $10 million for customer satisfaction measures, an element of the annual perform metrics where customers are surveyed regarding outages, connections and general inquiries. And in the current regulatory year, our outstanding performance has continued as the WPD subsidiaries hold the top 4 positions in Ofgem's broad measure of customer satisfaction.","Moving on to our Kentucky Regulated segment. We recently completed an evaluation of bids for future energy supply needs. Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities plan to file for Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to build a 700-megawatt combined-cycle natural gas power plant and a 10-megawatt solar energy facility. We expect that filing to occur by the end of the year. These 2 projects totaling about $725 million will provide our Kentucky customers with reliable, low-cost generation that meets the latest Environmental Protection Agency regulations.","Finally, in Pennsylvania, we continue to execute our major initiatives to upgrade the transmission system for safety and reliability. We are more than 50% complete on the $630 million Susquehanna-Roseland project and reached the construction milestone just this week. By energizing a 17-mile segment of the line. We continue to estimate completion of the Pennsylvania portion by June of 2015.","Also, we recently received good news for the $335 million Northeast\/Pocono transmission project. The Pennsylvania PUC administrative law judge issued a recommend decision concluding that PPL met its burden on all issues and recommended that the commission approve the siting applications, 2 zoning petitions and the remaining eminent domain applications. We expect to final PUC order in the first quarter of 2014.","Turning to distribution sales on Slide 7. You will see that weather-normalized sales in the third quarter were down slightly in both Kentucky and Pennsylvania from a year ago. In Kentucky, weather-normalized residential sales were lower in the quarter but remained higher for the 12-month period ending September 30. Although Kentucky commercial sales were up almost 1% in the quarter, the 12-month period reflects the struggles of small businesses in the Louisville area and the economic impact of the mining industry downturn in Eastern Kentucky. Kentucky industrial volumes decreased, primarily reflecting planned maintenance shutdowns and lower production from some of our largest customers.","In Pennsylvania, improved economic conditions led to higher weather-normalized sales in the commercial sector in the quarter, which were offset by reductions in the residential and industrial sectors due largely to customers implementing energy efficiency measures. On an actual basis, the more temperate summer weather in the quarter compared to 2012 led to lower kilowatt hour sales in both regions. We expect total electric sales for both Kentucky and Pennsylvania for 2013 to be relatively flat year-over-year.","Now turning to Slide 8 for an update on the supply business. In September, we announced an agreement to sell PPL Montana's 11 hydroelectric plants to NorthWestern Energy for $900 million. The agreement is subject to regulatory approvals, including the Montana Public Service Commission and FERC and is expected to close in the second half of 2014. The net process of about $623 million will enable us to reduce financing needs for our future capital investment in our rate-regulated businesses.","In the East, we recently completed a turbine blade inspection outage on Susquehanna Unit 2 at the Susquehanna nuclear plant. Based on our engineering analysis of the Unit 1 turbine in Susquehanna, we're not planning any outage until its planned refueling in the spring of 2014.","In the appendix of today's presentation, we provided an update to our forecasted generation and hedge disclosures, including the addition of our 2015 hedge levels.","Lastly, we're encouraged by 2 recent favorable decisions from the federal courts, invalidating state attempts to subsidize new generation in PJM. In these cases, federal judges agreed with us that New Jersey and Maryland unconstitutionally infringed on FERC's exclusive authority to regulate the wholesale power market. These decisions, in our view, reinforce the integrity of competitive generation markets.","In closing, we're pleased with the earnings growth from our regulated business segments and the ability of our supply business to manage through challenging power market conditions. The efforts to the entire organization and our expectations of continued strong perform enabled us to increase our 2013 earnings forecast. We remain very optimistic about our prospects for growing shareowner value through strong operational performance, disciplined financial management and superior execution of our regulated growth opportunities.","I look forward to your questions, and now we'll turn the call over to Paul Farr. Paul?","Paul A. Farr","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 9. PPL's third quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased over last year, driven by improved earnings in all 3 regulated business segments. The supply segment experienced an earnings decline as we expected, primarily due to lower hedged wholesale power prices. On an earnings-per-share basis, earnings declined in the third quarter due to additional shares included in our share count year-over-year. The higher share count impacted ongoing earnings per share by $0.08 for the period.","Let's start the segment review with Kentucky results on Slide 10. Kentucky earned $0.14 per share in the third quarter, a $0.02 increase compared to last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher margins due to new base rates that went into effect January 1 and increased environmental investments partially offset by lower volumes driven by more temperate weather this year. Kentucky's positive margins were partially offset by dilution of $0.02 a share.","Moving to Slide 11. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.31 per share in the third quarter, a $0.03 increase over last year. This increase was due to higher utility revenue, primarily driven by the annual price increase on April 1 partially offset by an accrual for overrecovery of current year revenues and lower volumes due to weather. Income taxes are lower, primarily as a result of the decrease in corporate income tax rates in the U.K. These positive earnings drivers were partially offset by higher network maintenance expense and dilution of $0.03 per share.","Turning to Slide 12. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.08 per share in the quarter, a $0.02 increase compared to last year. This increase was the result of higher delivery margins, primarily due to a new distribution rates but went into effect on January 1, as well as the increased transmission investment. The margin improvement was partially offset by dilution of $0.01 per share.","Moving to Slide 13. Our supply segment earned $0.14 per share in the third quarter, a $0.12 decline compared to last year. This decrease was primarily the net result of lower energy margins, driven by lower baseload energy prices and lower baseload generation partially offset by higher capacity prices, higher O&M, higher income taxes primarily resulting from a noncash adjustment to deferred tax assets that Bill mentioned previously.","During the third quarter, we conducted a preliminary assessment of our ability to utilize Pennsylvania net operating loss carryforwards. Our long-range forecast of taxable income has declined since last year, reducing our ability to utilize these NOLs in the future. In prior years, we had recorded adjustments to this deferred tax item in the fourth quarter, and we will perform a final assessment in Q4.","Finally, dilution impacted supply earnings by $0.02 per share.","That completes the more detailed financial overview, and I'll now turn the call back over to Bill for the Q&A period.","William H. Spence","Thanks, Paul, and operator, we're now ready to take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Kit Konolige of BGC.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Couple of different areas. First of all, just on the sale of the hydro plants in Montana, you didn't sell Colstrip at the same time. What's the future of Colstrip at this point? Do you expect to hold that indefinitely? Or is that something you'd like to sell if you could? Or can you give us a little color on what led to the transaction taking that shape?","William H. Spence","Sure. Well, I'd say, relative to Colstrip, they are well-run environmentally compliant assets, and they do provide both positive cash flow, as well as positive earnings to the corporation. So we're happy to continue to run them in a safe and cost-effective manner. In terms of the sale to NorthWestern, I think, in that case, it was just a mutual agreement that, that made sense for them, provide a good value to PPL. So we were able to strike what we think is a very fair deal for both parties. So we'll continue to evaluate Colstrip, but for the time being, our plan is to continue to run it.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if I could, Paul, could you go through a little bit more that the issue with the use of the NOLs? I didn't quite catch -- did you say the projection of future earnings, is that earnings at supply is expected to be lower than previously thought?","Paul A. Farr","Yes, most of that impact of the $0.06 does hit the supply segment. About $0.04 of the $0.06 was at supply. The other $0.02 was at corp. As we project, margins, look at cost for running the business, that's declined year-over-year. And this is a 20-year forecast, basically of utilizing these net operating loss carryforwards. And again, based upon where capacity prices cleared at, where we see forward energy prices, year-on-year, things have come down a bit, and so that valuation adjustment impacts not just book earnings, the taxable earnings as well. And that's just decreased our ability to use the net operating losses versus what our view was last year.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Does the guidance still stand that you don't expect supply to report EPS contribution below 0?","Paul A. Farr","Yes, that's correct. That's correct.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one final other area, on the -- to follow a little bit on your mention of the court victories regarding the state subsidies for new power plants, I think pretty clearly that -- but I'd like your feedback. I don't think that should affect the auctions over the next -- certainly, the next couple or 3 years. And can you give us a rough view of your thinking on kind of early outlook on next May's auction, whether you expect it, let's just say, to be up or down relative to this last auction?","William H. Spence","Yes, so on the wins in New Jersey and Maryland, at the federal level, those outcomes will be challenged. So it will take some time to go through the next phase of those proceedings, but we think we have an extremely strong case and that those early outcomes will be upheld. I think that it will -- and I think already has discouraged, both the states and potential suppliers from proposing new projects or new mechanisms, so I think it's had an effect already and will continue to have a positive effect as it relates to the competitive markets. On the future of the RPM for the next auction, there are a number of changes, I think, that you're aware of that PJM is considering along with feedback from many of the market participants. And those changes include reassessing import capabilities, how much demand response should be allowed into the auctions and other modeling changes potentially. So it's really hard to say, at this point, how all that may play into the next auction since we're still early in that process, if you will, of looking at potential changes. I think, the positive from my perspective is that PJM is listening to the market participants that have concerns and making sure that their focus continues to be on their #1 priority, which is a reliable supply for the grid. So I think they understand that role that they play and take it, obviously, very seriously.","Operator","The next question is from them from Dan Eggers of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just kind of maybe following up on supply and decision to exit Montana hydro, can you just maybe share your current thinking on the future of supply in this totality for you guys? And as that business gets smaller, there's a lot of overhead associated with it. Is there a cost-cutting opportunity or a need to get more scale to help optimize the structure?","William H. Spence","Well, I think, there is a cost-cutting opportunity, and we continue to execute that on. Dave DeCampli and his team have done a great job, thus far, and they continue to find opportunities there. As we answered one of the call -- or the questions previously, our current plan for 2014 and 2015 not only does it reflect the current forwards as they were at the end of the quarter, but we still see our supply business as an EPS positive contributor to the corporation overall. So I think I have also mentioned that we're always looking at opportunities to enhance the value potential for each of the businesses, as well as shareholder value for PPL as a whole. And we've proven that through the strategic actions we have taken over the past several years. So those actions allow us the flexibility to fully assess our position without having to make rushed decisions. In supply, our focus will continue to be on aggressively controlling both O&M and capital costs. But we're going to continue to evaluate other options that could increase value, but that's nothing new, quite frankly, in terms of our approach.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, just on the U.K. with the higher incentive revenues and continued better performance probably than we had expected, is that going to have any bearing on the outlook for earnings with the REO process completion relative to what you guys outlined this summer when you filed the REO case?","William H. Spence","I don't -- yes, I don't think it would have a substantial impact on it, I think, other than to continue to show to Ofgem our capability to meet and beat their metrics and prove that, hopefully, that we are worthy of fast tracking of all the 4 distribution network operations.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, just one more. If you jump back to Slide 20 in your deck where you guys show the -- your kind of a fading CapEx outlook in '15, '16, '17, Bill, as you look out, are there opportunities to spend more capital or more projects that could layer into that number to lift up the grow rate, to lift up that level of reinvestment and what's in the bars, things like the Kentucky generation investment and that sort of stuff that we'll see these reinflate over coming quarters?","William H. Spence","Yes. I think there will be opportunities, Dan. Specifically, I think in Pennsylvania, there will be transmission opportunities that aren't in the current forecast. I think in Kentucky, there'll probably be further opportunities as we go through time. So yes, I think there will be of those opportunities, and we'll just assess where do we best place the capital, the incremental capital that we want to spend and put it in the right spots.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And I mean, do you see that being generation driven in Kentucky? Or is there more transmission distribution work that need to get done that maybe has gotten crowded out, for lack of better word, as you've had to spend a lot of money on generation?","William H. Spence","Let me have Vic respond to that question.","Victor A. Staffieri","The generation -- the new generation that we announced and Bill referenced in his earlier comments are reflected in the capital budgets that you see on Slide 20, I guess. Yes, there probably are some additional transmission and distribution opportunities out there, but the other thing that will drive us, frankly, will be new environmental requirements. Landfill, who knows what's going on with the EPA? And so I think you'll see us -- again, as we have done in the past, move forward on environmental expenditures. I would expect changing laws will create new opportunities for us on the capital side for our generation portfolio.","Operator","The next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So perhaps just following up on Dan's question on the U.K. here, it looks like very robust expectations for 2013. Congratulations on that. Just kind of looking forward even here prior to the next reset, in '14 here, would you expect at least some of the benefits from this year to at least roll forward to next year? I mean, your guidance, I suppose, from the midpart of this year had $1.32 at the top end of that range, if you could just speak to that a little bit, particularly in light of the added revenues from the bonus side?","William H. Spence","Sure. I think some but not all would carry over into next year, but let me ask Rick Klingensmith to give you a little more color on that.","Rick L. Klingensmith","Our range in forecast for next year was $825 million to $875 million, and we still forecast to be within that range. As Bill mentioned, we will see some benefits continuing into next year. The incentive revenues that we had announced here this morning helped in next year's performance, especially -- it's a partial year, so you'll get some of that benefit, and that will be mixed in with the $82 million that we had earned the previous year. And so that would be a nice blended element for us for next year. But you also have to recall that, over the years, volume does get normalized. So we don't have upside or downside related to volume, although we may see that within a year and that we're seeing that this year. If you recall back in our first 2 quarters earnings calls, we had mentioned that the long cold winter has benefited us this year. We will need to get some of that back next year in the tariff reset that occurs April 1. So when you kind of mix the carryforward of some of the good items that have occurred this year and net that with some of the tariff adjustments due to over recovery this year, we find ourselves still within that range of $825 million to $875 million for '14.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Excellent. Much appreciated. And then turning back to the supply business if you could, just on the Unit 1 at Susquehanna, just perhaps, do you -- is it that you don't perceive there to be issues at that first unit to the extent to which you did the latest testing? Or is it more that it is sufficiently safe to continue operating until the next refueling outage? Just give us an update overall on the blade issue?","William H. Spence","Sure. It's really the latter rather than the former. But specifically, what we're -- we've been doing is monitoring the unit very carefully, and we have very strict parameters within which we're planning to operate the unit. And once we go outside the margin that we have identified as a safe margin, we would then have to look to make decision whether to bring unit offline. But so far, we're steady with the blade vibrations. And our outlook is that we're going to be able to continue to run the unit safely and reliably until the refueling outage in the spring of next year.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then quickly, in terms of maintenance CapEx, I mean, there's a lot of focus of late, obviously, on supply. Just what's a good run rate number there to think about for that business? I mean, obviously, a $400 million to $500 million in your disclosure's a bit just kind of on a run-rate basis.","Paul A. Farr","Yes. It's $400 million to $500 million on the disclosure, but that also includes around $160 million to $170 million of nuclear fuel each year. So you have to back that off those numbers, so Julien,it's probably close to something in the $300-ish million range. It'll go up and down based upon major outages that we've got at the coal plants.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. And last quick clarification, when you were talking about supply contributing positively to the corporate -- corporation in its entirety for the foreseeable future, just wanted to clarify that, that is prior to any contemplated cost cuts because I heard that, the same paragraph there.","William H. Spence","That would include cost cuts that are either in play now or that would be impacting 2014 and 2015. But we have identified specific areas where Dave and his team believe we can get additional cost out. But we're very confident in those actions. They're doable actions and things that we've done in the past and believe we can do in the future.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. And okay, one more clarification. That is excluding or assuming the sale of the Montana business, correct?","William H. Spence","Yes, that is. Correct.","Operator","The next question is from Neel Mitra of Tudor, Pickering.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","A question on supply. Where would you say you're tracking on your hedging plan relative to your ratable strategy? It seems like you're about half of what you were hedged going into EI relative to last year. Is that something consistent with your past or maybe taking a view on the market in '14 and '15?","William H. Spence","I think it's relatively consistent. We don't have, per se, a ratable program. We have more ranges that we look at in years 1, 2, and 3. Having said that, we're a little bit lighter hedged in 2015 than we might have been that third year, if you will, than we have been in the past. And some of that's just due to the lower floor prices that we're seeing and the view that we have that there will be opportunities between now and then to hedge at more favorable prices. And so for example, you saw 2015 prices hit the upper $40 on-peak range earlier this year. We took advantage of that, layered in a few more hedges. And we expect, with the volatility we have seen in the past in gas prices and power prices, that we'd continue to probably see those opportunities pop up from time to time, and we'll take advantage of those. So that's really what goes into our thought process when we look to hedge that far out.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then could you maybe give us your updated thoughts on what the basis is between your plans and PJM West now that we have some cheap Marcellus gas pricing impacting your zone?","William H. Spence","Sure, maybe I'll ask Dave DeCampli to comment on that.","David G. DeCampli","Sure. Obviously, we're constantly monitoring TETCO M3 to Henry Hub discount. We take advantage of that basis differential on a number of ways. One, our -- of course, our gas plants benefit from that. Secondly, if economically we do end up having to curtail operations at a coal plant and buying back, that's a good thing for us as well, particularly in a year in which we're well hedged. On the downside, that impact, of course, continues to depress overall energy prices. But our diverse portfolio, we're able to work around that and take advantage of that situation.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","So longer term, I think, you guys said that you would be flat going forward maybe after 2015. What's your long-term base assumption?","William H. Spence","Yes. I think we would continue to see it as being flat, and I think if some of the proposed pipelines taking gas from the Marcellus to other markets actually come to pass in that 2015-2016 time frame, I think that would be a reasonably good prediction if you will, but there are so many factors that play into basis differentials, as you know, that it is very difficult to predict those things.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just one last question. Paul, how much debt at the parent supports the supply business right now?","Paul A. Farr","Yes. I wouldn't say any really debt at the parent supports the supply business, I think the debt at the parent was primarily issued to finance. The acquisitions, I think about it more on a total balance sheet perspective. We're targeting the investment-grade credit ratings across the complex. S&P looks at us in a total asset flow to debt basis. Moody's looks at the individual registrants and then steps back and looks at it in entirety as well. So I'm not clearly uncomfortable with the level of debt that's there. We're paying down debt and supply this year a bit, a little bit currently in the plan for next year as well. That plan was put into place well before we had an agreement to sell the Montana assets and to realize the almost $630 million in after-tax proceeds that Bill talked about. So the plan will get modified, if you will, and is fluid as we move through time and experience things like asset sales as well. So -- but I wouldn't look at it that it's there to support supply. I think it's really the 90%-ish of regulated earnings and those cash flows, as well as anything that really, if you want to call it supporting supply, that's really supporting the risk profile, the entire organization which supplied the benefit from.","Operator","Our next question is from part Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just on the NOLs that forced an impact, how does that work out going forward? I mean, is that -- it means -- how should we think about the tax rate and how the $0.04 -- how we should see that sort of showing up next year and what have you?","Paul A. Farr","Yes. So, Paul, you might recall back to 2010, we had a relatively significant release of tax reserves in that year. It's around $70 million, $75 million. We've rolled back a few cents of that each in the last 2 years. And with this $0.06 impact this year, there's only $0.01 remaining in terms of total exposure on the balance sheet that could get rolled back in if we saw a further decline. Basically, we'll have fully reserved up the NOLs and you wouldn't see a balance sheet exposure for us and, therefore, there wouldn't be future negative EPS exposure either.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So it's sort of a one-timer.","Paul A. Farr","Correct. And that's kind of how we highlighted in 2010 as well. We, historically, haven't carved out or special item-treated tax items, unless it's a tax law change like the statutory rate decrease in the U.K. So we call those out for you when we experience them, but it's not -- it doesn't impact ongoing -- as I said in a response to some of these earlier questions, this is a 20-year forward-look at and looking at the useful life of these NOL carryforwards, and so it's relatively small movement that can have somewhat of a material impact, but it is noncash and not ongoing, if you will.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, great. And then, when we look at the -- what are the NOLs net of reserves that you guys have left on your balance sheet?","Paul A. Farr","So on this PA NOLs, the state-based NOLs, it's around $1 billion. Again, that's fully reserved up. On an NOL, I call it an NOL equivalent basis, so in excess of $1 billion that we purchased effectively in the Kentucky acquisition, all of this bonus depreciation that's been -- that's been impacting us for the last several years were a little under $3 billion in NOL equivalent value that we, on a federal basis, that we got warehoused. That's one of the reasons, for example, why there is no cash tax paid on the sale of Montana asset is we can shelter that with the NOLs.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. With the sales growth outlook now given the last couple of years what we've seen and what have you, what do you guys think now going forward?","Paul A. Farr","Sure. On an overall basis, looking at Kentucky and Pennsylvania, we would see sales being flat to slightly positive on an ongoing basis. And it's going to be clearly reflective of the strength that the economy is as we get to '14, '15, '16. But we do think that our expectations should be more conservative compared to where they were a couple of years ago, because all of the energy efficiency conservation, other impacts to demand that I think are more systemic than just purely economically driven.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Great. And then you were talking about the RPM Auction and all the things that are happening there, and you also mentioned sort of transmission opportunities, which made me think about this recent IPSAC meeting at PJM regarding mark-to-market congestion between MISO or another market -- between MISO and PJM and sort of transmission opportunities. And I was wondering what your thoughts are with respect to sort of dozens and dozens of projects sort of aimed at alleviating the mark-to-market congestion. This is outside the rule changes that they're potentially talking about with DFAX and everything. I'm talking about just the efforts to sort of resolve that physical constraint, the seams issues, so to speak, and what it might mean for the long-term outlook for supply and whether that's figured into your EPS positive outlook?","Paul A. Farr","Sure. It is figured in to the extent we know about the projects, and many of them we do because they take so long to plan and engineer and then construct. So we have pretty good visibility I think into those projects. I think in terms of the transmission opportunities side, it's really a question of will those congestion pockets, if you will, continue into the future and how long into the future. Some of the congestion or negative basis that we've seen is driven by the transmission projects that are underway today. So as we experienced outages on a grid to take care of some of these congestion issues, it's creating what I would say are temporary congestion sometimes in a different direction than we've seen in the past. So I think you have -- taking all that into account, I don't know that there is a material impact in the next several years on our supply business output. Longer-term, difficult to say.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just finally on the environmental, you guys mentioned that there was a potential additional environmental CapEx associated with, I guess, coal ash and what have you. And I was wondering is that sort of regulated like in Kentucky? Or is that sort of non-regulated or any sense as to where you're looking at those CapEx issues?","Paul A. Farr","Yes. That would be on the regulated side in Kentucky that we were discussing earlier. And really, I think in response to what may come out of greenhouse gas initiatives by the EPA for existing units, of course they made some proposals on new units but, as Rick also mentioned, there's still, I would say, debates and discussion around 316(b) water issues as well as coal ash handling and storage issues.","Operator","Our next question is from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Could you guys give some sort of a sense of how you see the net impact of the Montana sale and the reworking of the Colstrip lease in terms of earnings?","Paul A. Farr","Sure. We would expect the transaction to be modestly accretive to earnings and cash flow.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So that's on a -- starting in 2014 basis, Bill?","William H. Spence","Probably 2015 would be the first full year. 2014, we would expect the transaction to close some time in the second half. So I would look at the first full year of impact would be 2015.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And could you guys kind of give us a little more insight into the components of that analysis?","William H. Spence","Paul, do you want to...","Paul A. Farr","Yes. It would come from kind of multiple perspectives. When would you look at on a forward basis, where the margins minus the O&M and depreciation were in the assets, we worked hugely positive on that front. And then from an outright financing perspective, with the payoff of the Colstrip lease and basically refinancing that future obligation at much lower rates factor everything in, as Bill said, both cash flow earnings positive for us.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Since it's kind of neutral on the hydro contribution and then gets positive on the refinance on the lease, basically?","Paul A. Farr","Yes. Really, all of Montana, as we were getting -- as were intimating and keeping all of supply positive, the West was not any materially different than the East in terms of the flat to slightly positive earnings going out into the future. So those were Runner River hydro assets, very good assets. That earnings profile of that subset of supply was -- looked just like supply in entirety so.","Operator","Our next question is from Shahriar Pourreza of Citigroup.","Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Two questions just focusing on the U.K. With the initial assessment being potentially being released at the end of November, is there still an opportunity for you to make the final determination if you don't make the initial assessment in what would Ofgem use as a prerequisite to potentially add you, in case you don't make it?","William H. Spence","I'll ask Rick to comment on that.","Rick L. Klingensmith","Yes. If you don't make the initial assessment on the fast-track draft determination, it is a not possible for you then to make the fast-track determination. In essence, so Ofgem will be creating a short list of those that could be fast tracked and continue through the process to get that final determination in February of 2014.","Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it, got it. And then just one question on the U.K. policy, there's been a lot of chatter as far as trying to curtail electricity rates. And a lot of what you're hearing is everything from government intervention to windfall taxes to potential tariff freezes. And a lot of it has just, for now, been really focused on generation. The question is, can you see that being secant to the distribution and transmission business? Or do you think a lot of what you're hearing from the Labour Party is really focused on generation?","William H. Spence","You're correct. It has been focused on generation and marketing companies as well. It has not thus far been on the infrastructure itself. And Cameron's recent comments around his look at the picture, what's really focused on some of the green initiatives and the incremental cost in the tariff of the green programs. So thus far it has not been a focus for our segment of the business. And as you can imagine on the total bill side, the distribution component of the bill, is literally one of the smallest pieces of the bill. So it's probably reasonable to assume that they would focus on where the greatest portion of the bill is coming from.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of items, supply and then bigger picture stuff. First at supply, I noticed that the 2015 coal -- delivered coal price is actually down from the '13 and '14 levels. Just curious, is that rail or is that the actual cost of tonnage?","William H. Spence","Sure Michael. Let me ask David DeCampli to comment on that.","David G. DeCampli","It's primarily actually the cost of the coal itself.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. Second, have you ever quantified the potential for O&M cost management and supply?","William H. Spence","We -- Yes, sure. We have -- Dave, do you want to talk about some of your targets and...","David G. DeCampli","Yes, sure. In supply, we -- of course, we have 2 streams of O&M cost in the business. One is those within supply then the corporate services cost. We got initiatives in play to reduce cost in both sides of the formula and had good success over last year and in the forecast plan as well. In reducing cost, it's also affected operations. We've been able to take O&M growth to 0 at our nuclear facility, for instance, through streamlining and cost-cutting initiatives. Of course, our coal fleet has taken a good brunt of those reductions with it seeing some reduced operations, installed efficiencies and things like that. But we're not leaving any stone unturned in the business or for those who support our business.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So I mean, when you think about O&M at supply in x Montana, like apples-to-apples comparison, up, down, flat, neither, something else kind of just big picture directional over multi-years.","Paul A. Farr","Well, very slightly with Montana. It will be a little bit of a push up in overhead over the remaining assets. We'll still be operating our marketing operation in Butte. We'll still need some of the overhead support for Colstrip and Corette, as long as we run Corette. There will be a little bit of the pick-up impact there, but I wouldn't call it material. We'll be able to able to handle that. So overall, it's probably safe to say that our target, our plan is to maintain cost at or below where they currently are today.","William H. Spence","Including inflationary impact...","Paul A. Farr","Yes. That's right. So net-net, the direction would be flat to negative.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Real quick, Paul, you commented a little bit on cash taxes. Do you expect to be a full noncash taxpayer? And if so, for how long?","Paul A. Farr","I wouldn't expect that we will be paying taxes at the federal level until 2018, at the earliest.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So you see kind of tax -- the delta between GAAP taxes and cash taxes as being kind of a sizable cash flow benefit.","Paul A. Farr","That's correct, that's correct. And we obviously don't know yet on our corporate tax reform basis what they're going to do, if you will. If they're going to extend any of the current 50% bonus, that's not been necessarily a benefit to this sector. Anyway, I don't think it's driven $1 of incremental spending, but we need to see how that plays out as well. If they extended any of that, that could push it out even further.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And finally, Bill, when you look across the industry and think longer terms, I mean, you guys were one of the -- only a handful of companies who I think made very transformative M&A-related transactions that literally changed the shape of the company. When you look now, a couple of years removed from those transactions, how are you thinking about where the opportunity sets, if any exists across regulated, nonregulated U.S., non-U.S. electric and gas or other businesses, kind of how are you thinking about what you want the shape and where the opportunities lie, if any, in regards to long-term M&A?","William H. Spence","Sure, I will. We're fortunate that with all of our 3 regulated entities, U.K., Kentucky, Pennsylvania, we have great internal growth opportunities, so organic growth, if you will. We can see that through our CapEx spending plans that we discussed earlier on the call. We don't see that as something that's going to, all of a sudden, just hit a cliff. So I think there's going to be ongoing opportunities just within the businesses themselves to grow on a reasonable basis. In our case, we have one of the higher growth rates in the sector, almost an 8% CAGR. So we would continue to see that. I think in the supply area, our guess is that there's going to be more consolidation if gas prices continue to stay, and power prices, at the low levels that we're seeing them in the forwards and today. So I would fully anticipate more M&A in that area of the industry than I would in the regulated side. Not to say that there couldn't be M&A on the regulated side, but as you're well aware, those premiums that are required to engage in an acquisition can be difficult to overcome through synergies when many times you have to give some of that synergy back to the rate-making process. So that can be difficult to accomplish on an accretive basis. So beyond that, clearly, there is a potential in the country with low gas prices to see more industry coming to the areas that have the lowest cost natural gas prices. And we we're seeing some of that. I guess how much of that we see is going to be depended on a lot of things, including taxes, local market conditions, labor, et cetera. So we'll see how that all transpires. We do see a trend, I guess, in people converting vehicles to natural gas. So I mean, that's a trend that we would expect to continue. Same on the electric side with electric vehicles, not necessarily in our territory per se, but overall we see that as a trend. So that's just a couple of general thoughts.","Operator","The next question is from Rajeev Lalwani of Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just -- the first question is on the U.K. In the event you're not fast tracked, would it be possible -- or not fast tracked entirely, would it be possible, just based on how you filed your business plans for at least some of the utilities there to be fast tracked? And then a follow-up on the supply side.","William H. Spence","Sure. It is a possible one or more of the distribution network operators could be fast tracked. It doesn't have to be -- it's not an all or nothing.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just based on how you filed the actual business plan, is there much of a difference between the various utilities there?","William H. Spence","There is not. I think all the initiatives across the network are very common and the spending is also pretty levelized across the companies.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then just on the supply side, it seems like you've done a great job with finding costs to offset the weakness in gas prices. But just generally, as you've seen prices come down, how has it changed your view in terms of the -- your strategic thinking around those assets longer term?","William H. Spence","Well, it certainly places a higher risk level on the assets and the business overall than we might have expected going back a couple of years. However, we recognized that we need to be resilient and flexible in our approach and that's what I think you hear us saying. When I look at every opportunity and as Dave DeCampli has said he's going to leave no stone unturned in terms of finding additional value in the business. So as I mentioned in previous remarks, we're going to continue to look at opportunities in the business to make it leaner and as profitable as it can be. And other opportunities and even options we'll continue to look at as well. Anything that could increase the value we're going to look at.","Operator","The next question is from Steven Fleishman of Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","My questions are answered.","Operator","The next question is from Gregg Orrill of Barclays.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was wondering if you can talk about your performance in the recent U.K. storms?","William H. Spence","Sure, Greg. I'll let Rick comment on that.","Rick L. Klingensmith","Yes. The St. Jude storm that we saw at the beginning of this week was probably the most severe storm that has affected England in over 10 years. Over the storm period, we experienced wind gusts up to 75 miles an hour and we saw power outages for about 53,000 of our customers. In all, about 200 of those customers were restored within 12 hours and all customers were restored within 18 hours, which is the Ofgem standard for this type of event. The damage and the effects of the storm were much more severe in South and Southeast England versus in our territory. And we were able to provide over 100 staff to help restoration efforts in the U.K. power networks territory.","Operator","The next question is from Anthony Crowdell of Jefferies.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just 2 quick questions, a follow-up on a debt question earlier, I just want to know what the level of debt at the parent is. I guess you said there's some debt at the parent that helped finance the whole organization. If you can tell me something the level of that debt. And the second question is related to the regulated utilities. What's your earned ROE at your Pennsylvania, Kentucky and, if you had, for the U.K. utilities?","William H. Spence","Sure. On the Pennsylvania side, it's probably in the upper 9% range on a regulated basis, on the kind of the regulatory filing basis. Vic, do you want to...","Victor A. Staffieri","The Kentucky, this year, will be between 9% and 10%.","William H. Spence","And the -- in the U.K., Rick?","Rick L. Klingensmith","Yes. Though in the U.K. we're about 18% including the effects of goodwill in that formula.","Paul A. Farr","And at the parent company, there's roughly $2.5 billion of that -- $2 billion, $2.1-ish billion that came as a result of the acquisitions: the $1.150 billion for Kentucky; and a little less than $1 billion, $988 million, $987 million for the U.K. acquisition; and then we've got a deeply subordinated deal that we did earlier this year that was around $400-ish million.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Great. And this is like a follow-up on the U.K. ROE, the -- just I'm not sure, how does the goodwill impacting? I mean, is the goodwill -- you're saying you're earning off the goodwill portion, is it like in RAV? Is it-- am I thinking that the right back?","Paul A. Farr","No, we're not. And none of the jurisdiction is goodwill an assets that you can earn or return on, so that's basically all equity-financed and you see that driving the, I'll call it the \"with goodwill\" ROE down.","Operator","The next question is from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","I have 2 questions. First, on the supply business, your hedge disclosures continue to include the hydro assets. If I were to strip them out, is there going to be any meaningful change as far as the percentages of hedged volumes and prices for the baseload west?","Paul A. Farr","Yes. That would come down somewhat of the roughly 8 million megawatt hours a year that we get in Montana, about 3 -- what, maybe 3.2 now with the rain [indiscernible] upgrade of the hydro system.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","But how about prices hedged?","Paul A. Farr","There will not be a differential in the in the hedged price. And if you recall, one element of the agreement with Northwestern is that at close of the transaction, we would just let settle any mark-to-market so that they did not end up with extra length in their book to serve customers. So that'll get -- that'll come down to the extent that there are material hedges with them outstanding at that point in time.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Okay. And now back to the U.K. I mean, your RIIO is still a new mechanism, and if I understand correctly, the fast track, the approval of the fast track means that your request, as far as new revenue levels is basically accepted as is? And if I compare your applications to applications of other utilities in the U.K., it seems like you're asking about slightly higher returns than your peers. So I mean, how do you -- do you think that, that more aggressive of a filing might impact the or ability to actually get -- to get fast tracked?","William H. Spence","Well, first part of your question, if you're fast tracked, it is accepted as is, so that your plan as filed is deemed to have been fully justified. But we are not requesting a different ROE than anyone else. It's a generic make up of the debt and equity in the rate-making process there. So the cost to capital is kind of plain vanilla. And everyone really is measured on the same basis. And I think we're required to file on per the instructions of Ofgem.","Paul A. Farr","I'll just add, the filing that we had made was for a 6.7% real cost of equity and I believe the majority -- maybe all but one have that same request for that return on equity.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","But how about incorporating all other incentives -- performance incentives, et cetera, et cetera? Wouldn't that actually give you a slightly higher margin your operations versus what we can see in other filings?","William H. Spence","Well, the other filings were not necessarily incentives included. There are targets for your levels of performance into the future and you may have the opportunity to surpassed those targets in the future, but there's no specific values associated with the incentives that you'll see in RIIO plan.","Paul A. Farr","Yes. It's not in the base revenue that you see in the plan.","Operator","Our last question today will come from Nathan Judd -- I'm sorry, Judge of Atlantic Equities.","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP","I just wanted to ask a little bit more on the disclosure supply. You have brought back your generation expected generation from -- in the east. Can you just give me why that's the case? Is that Susquehanna, or what's driving that?","William H. Spence","Sure. Dave, you wan to...","David G. DeCampli","Yes. There's 2 primary drivers. One, of course, was the line outages at Susquehanna, and we also had an unexpected outrage in our Brunner Island station that affected it as well. Those are the 2 prime drivers.","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP","Going forward in 2014 and '15?","William H. Spence","Could you repeat your question for '14 and '15. please?","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP","Sure. So I believe when you presented last -- you had a presentation which showed 50.4 million megawatt hours with 41.8 terrawatt hours in the east. And you're looking for kind of 40.6. And I'm just kind of wondering why you're bringing down your projected forecast for output in 2014 and '15?","William H. Spence","Yes. It's the extension of these turbine blade outages intended for Susquehanna that is the primary driver for the lowering of that for 2014 and '15 at this point.","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP","When I look at how your coal plants have performed year-to-date, your production from those coal plants are obviously down from last year, how are you seeing, given the low power price, and how do we think about the variability in the coal production?","William H. Spence","Well, the -- if there is a -- the variability is primarily driven by our choice to economically take them out of service. At times when prices would dictate, we're able to take advantage of that buyback from the market and do well that way. I think you should be able -- you should expect that type of variability in the future. We can't always predict what those periods exactly will be. So expect a little bit of volatility in those numbers as the years unfold.","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP","So that -- your hedging...","William H. Spence","Sorry. So that reduction that you referenced between the previous forecast and the current does reflect both our forecast of coal plant output, and onetime, based on economics and with lower gas prices, you're going to see a little bit less run time and also changes at Susquehanna. So those 2 things combined are really driving the lower output on a period-to-period basis.","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP","How much [indiscernible] can you take that down given your core hedges? 77%? I mean, at certain point, you've got to run your coal plants. At what point do we see economic losses begin to be realized?","William H. Spence","I don't think in the forecast we would even get close to that type of a situation. And we have built into some of our coal contracts' flexibility. And to the extent that the flexibility is not already built-in, we've been successful at working with our coal suppliers to manage our inventories and our burn. So I think this far, we don't see that as a potential problem. Okay. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. And we look forward to our next quarterly call.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Bergstein, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Joe Bergstein","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the PPL conference call on fourth quarter and year-end results and our general business outlook. We're providing slides of this presentation on our website at www.pplweb.com.","Any statements made in this presentation about future operating results or other future events are forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from such forward-looking statements. A discussion of factors that could cause actual results or events to vary is contained in the appendix to this presentation and in the company's SEC filings.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Spence, PPL Chairman, President and CEO.","William H. Spence","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your participation in today's call. Joining me on the call are Paul Farr, PPL's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as the Presidents of our 4 business segments who will participate in the question-and-answer session. To get started, I'll provide an overview of our fourth quarter and year-end 2012 results, as well as a few operational highlights. Then Paul will provide more details on our segment performance for the fourth quarter and for the full year.","Let me start by highlighting this morning's announcement of a dividend increase beginning with the April 1 payment. The new annualized rate will be $1.47 per share, up from $1.44 per share previously. This increase represents the 11th increase in 12 years and reflects a 177% increase over that period. Turning to earnings. Today, we announced year-end 2012 earnings that exceeded our forecasted range. Reported earnings for 2012 were $2.60 per share compared with $2.70 per share in 2011. Earnings from ongoing operations were $2.42 per share compared to $2.73 per share a year ago. Reported earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.60 per share, down from $0.78 per share a year ago, and our ongoing earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.49 per share compared with $0.71 a share a year ago. Our year-over-year decrease in ongoing earnings was driven predominantly by lower supply business margins as a result of falling power prices. We're pleased with these results as each of the segments performed better than their forecast midpoints, with the U.K. achieving the strongest outperformance at $0.04 per share. Keys to our success is a strong focus on business plan execution by the people in each of our business and service groups. As I'll discuss shortly in my operational overview, 2012 was a very busy year in which we accomplished significant milestones that position PPL well over the next several years.","Now let's turn to a discussion of our 2013 earnings forecast, which we also announced today. We're forecasting 2013 earnings of $2.25 per share to $2.50 per share resulting in a midpoint of $2.37 per share. This 2013 forecast reflects the combination of high revenues from our 3 regulated businesses following recent rate proceedings and automatic adjustments resulting from prior proceedings and lower energy margins from our supply business as our higher price hedges are rolling off. The forecast also includes an additional scheduled outage at our Susquehanna nuclear plant as we have accelerated our plans to implement a long-term solution to the turbine blade issues. In addition, our forecast includes dilution of $0.11 per share associated with common stock issuances, which were related to the company's 2010 equity units and the 2012 forward stock sale.","Even though 2012 is now in the rearview mirror, I'd like to review a number of key accomplishments from last year, which set us up well for 2013 and beyond. In Kentucky, we reached a very positive settlement on rate cases that resulted in an allowed return on equity of 10.25% and annual revenue increases of about $100 million. The new rates went into effect January 1. In the United Kingdom, our management team successfully completed the integration of the Midlands operations dramatically improving the customer experience in that region, and we believe that level of performance will continue. Under the regulatory rules in the U.K., this improved performance translates directly into benefits for PPL's shareowners. WPD earned more than $80 million in performance bonuses for the 4 U.K. utilities, most of which comes from the Midlands business. These bonuses will be reflected in our revenues in the regulatory year starting April 1, 2013. The 4 network utilities operated by WPD are now among the best customer service providers in Great Britain.","Turning to our Pennsylvania utility operations, we received a favorable decision on our rate increase request. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission granted an allowed return on equity of 10.4% and an increase in annual revenues of $71 million. At that level of return on equity, we expect to be able to make significant distribution investments over the next several years to replace aging infrastructure, which is going to result in more jobs, greater levels of local tax base and improving levels of reliability for our Pennsylvania customers. Also just last month, PPL Electric Utilities filed a request with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to implement a distribution system improvement charge to accelerate recovery of about $700 million in new capital investments that will improve system reliability over the next 5 years. PPL Electric utilities was the first Pennsylvania electric company to file for this mechanism after having our long-term infrastructure improvement plan approved just last month.","2012 also marked a year of operational excellence for PPL Electric Utilities. The utility received its 18th J.D. Power award, ranked highest among large utilities in the Eastern U.S. for residential customer satisfaction, and just recently, PPL Electric Utilities received another J.D. Power award for business customer satisfaction, bringing the total to 19 awards. In addition, PPL Electric received very good reviews for its effort in restoring service to more than 500,000 customers affected by Hurricane Sandy. We thank both our Pennsylvania and Kentucky employees for their exceptional performance in the restoration process. The total cost for the storm repairs was about $66 million.","Finally on the transmission front, the 145-mile Susquehanna-Roseland Transmission Line project received its final approval in 2012, and PPL Electric made a Pennsylvania PUC filing for approval of a new project called the Northeast\/Pocono transmission project. This involves construction of 3 new electrical substations and a new 230 kV power line.","Turning to our supply business, we've significantly adjusted operations of our coal-fired plants in the Northeast and in Montana to meet the challenging market realities. Our gas-fired plants in the Northeast are performing very well and are running as baseload units with 2012 capacity factors of 70% at our Lower Mount Bethel facility and 75% at the Ironwood plant. At Susquehanna nuclear, we have plans in place to address the turbine blade issue, and we're currently running smoothly following our outages at Unit 2 in the fourth quarter. The ability to overcome the challenges in 2012 exhibits supply's effective portfolio optimization and our ability to aggressively respond by leveraging our diverse generating assets.","Before turning to Paul, let's talk about PPL's key focus areas for 2013. At supply, our primary focus will be instituting operational and regulatory improvements at our Susquehanna nuclear facility. As I mentioned earlier, we plan to address turbine blade issues on both units this spring. The extension of the Unit 2 outage and the maintenance outage for Unit 1 are estimated to have an after-tax earning impact of about $0.05 per share, which is now included in our 2013 forecast. Dave DeCampli, President of our supply group, and his team will also be working to reduce costs throughout the fleet, developing the best strategy to steer PPL's supply business through the current down cycle.","In the U.K., we'll be working closely with Ofgem, the electricity regulator, on its new rate setting process, which is scheduled to go into effect in 2015. Under the new process, network operators would have their base revenues established for an 8-year period. One primary objective this year will be to provide Ofgem with a solid, well-justified business plan for each of the 4 U.K. network businesses in order to become fast tracked. This is a process that concludes up to 9 months ahead of the standard timetable.","In Kentucky, we'll be focused on executing the various environmental projects that have been approved by the Kentucky Public Service Commission and will be recovered through the ECR mechanism, as well as the construction of a new combined-cycle gas plant that should be available for service in the spring of 2015. We continue to expect compound annual rate base growth of almost 9% in Kentucky through 2017.","In Pennsylvania, we expect to make significant progress on our distribution infrastructure projects approved through the DSIC mechanism, as well as our Susquehanna-Roseland Transmission project. In March, we'll begin a major step in the Susquehanna-Roseland project with construction starting on a 500 kV Lackawanna Substation. We continue to expect this $560 million project to be in service by mid-2015. As we make these substantial investments in our U.S. utilities, Greg Dudkin and Vic Staffieri are focused not only improving the earned returns but also on improving reliability and customer service. We believe this is critical to achieving successful regulatory outcomes as we saw in 2012. Each of our objectives for 2013 will require the type of superior effort that is the hallmark of employees throughout the PPL family of companies. Our success depends on an excellent understanding of the business, attention to detail and a commitment to operational excellence. And on the basis of that knowledge, I feel very confident that we're well prepared for another successful year in 2013.","I look forward to your questions following Paul's comments. Paul?","Paul A. Farr","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 8 to review fourth quarter and year-end 2012 results. Our fourth quarter results include lower supply segment earnings driven by lower energy margins, higher O&M and higher income taxes. Full year 2012 earnings from ongoing operations benefited from strong financial performance by our U.K. utilities, but the U.K. results were more than offset by the combination of lower supply segment energy margins and higher O&M depreciation and income taxes in our 3 domestic segments. This year's results include dilution of $0.14 per share resulting from the common stock issuance Bill mentioned earlier.","Let's move to the Kentucky regulated segment earnings drivers on Slide 9. Our Kentucky regulated segment earned $0.33 per share in 2012, a $0.07 decrease compared to 2011. This decrease was due to lower retail margins primarily due to unfavorable weather during the first 4 months of 2012. Higher O&M driven by increased scope of scheduled generation outages in 2012, higher depreciation, higher property taxes, losses from an equity method investment and dilution of $0.02 per share.","Our U.K. regulated segment earned $1.19 per share in 2012, a $0.32 increase over 2011.","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this is the operator. We are experiencing technical difficulties. Please standby.","William H. Spence","Okay, we seem to experience some technical difficulty. We apologize for that. I think we were \u2013 got cut off somewhere in the middle of Slide 10. So we\u2019re going back to Slide 10 on the U.K. regulated segment earnings drivers. So Paul, go ahead.","Paul A. Farr","Okay, let me start back over at the beginning of Slide 10. Again, apologies, folks. Our U.K. regulated segment earned $1.19 per share in 2012, a $0.32 increase over 2011. This increase was due to 4 additional months of earnings contributions from the Midlands Utilities, a full 12 months versus 8 months in 2011. Higher utility revenue primarily due to higher prices partially offset by higher depreciation, higher income taxes, higher financing costs, a less favorable currency exchange rate and dilution of $0.07 per share.","Moving to Slide 11, our Pennsylvania regulated segment earned $0.22 per share in 2012, a $0.09 decrease compared with 2011. This decrease was the net result of higher O&M primarily due to a greater amount of maintenance work compared to 2011, higher vegetation management costs, higher PUC reportable storm expense and higher support [indiscernible] costs, higher depreciation primarily due to capital investment and higher income taxes. These were partially offset by higher transmission revenue and lower financing costs due to the redemption of preferred securities. Segment results also included dilution of $0.01 per share.","Turning now to supply on Slide 12, this segment earned $0.68 per share in 2012, a decrease of $0.47 per share compared to the prior year. Lower earnings were primarily driven by lower energy margins as a result of lower Eastern energy and capacity prices; lower Western energy margins, primarily due to a contract termination related to the bankruptcy of a Southern Montana electric co-op; higher O&M at Susquehanna as well as on our gas, coal-fired and hydro-electric stations and higher shared service costs; higher depreciation; higher income taxes and higher financing costs as well as dilution of $0.04 per share.","Turning now to Slide 13, as Bill had previously mentioned, we are announcing our 2013 earnings forecast range of $2.25 to $2.50 per share with a midpoint of $2.37 per share. This slide shows the change in earnings looking at the key drivers for each segment. A dilution impact of $0.11 has been isolated from the segment earnings. In addition, you'll notice a new nonoperating category that we refer to as Corporate and Other. As we have evolved our business mix to a much more regulated focus, our future financing strategy will include utilization of securities issuance from PPL capital funding, which will be the primary driver of this category, as well as certain other corporate costs not directly allocable to the operating segments. The 4 operating segments will continue to be Kentucky regulated, U.K. regulated, Pennsylvania regulated and supply.","Moving to the specific 2013 drivers. We expect higher earnings from the Kentucky regulated segment primarily due to electric and gas base rate increases that went into effect January 1, higher expected retail loan growth and returns on additional environmental capital investment. Partially offsetting these positive earnings drivers is higher O&M. We expect higher earnings in the U.K. primarily driven by higher prices and lower income taxes, partially offset by higher O&M, higher depreciation and higher financing costs. We expect higher earnings from our Pennsylvania regulated segment as a result of higher distribution revenue from new base rates that became effective on January 1 and higher transmission revenue as a result of increased rate base, partially offset by higher depreciation. We expect lower earnings from our supply segment primarily due to lower energy margins as a result of lower energy prices and hedges rolling off, partially offset by higher capacity prices and higher nuclear generation output, higher O&M at our Eastern and Western fleets, higher depreciation and higher financing costs.","Let's move to Slide 14. Given the difficulties some of you have expressed in modeling the U.K. segment, we are providing updated modeling parameters related to future earnings. We will use the segment income statement format provided in the MD&A of our SEC filings as the basis of our calculations. Since the 2012 10-K has not yet been filed, we provided the ongoing numbers on this slide and a reconciliation to GAAP numbers in the appendix to today's presentation.","Let's begin with revenues, which are projected to increase by an average of 3.5% per year plus inflation for the balance of the price control review period that ends on March 31, 2015, plus annual incentive awards. This revenue increase includes regulated revenues that increase at 5.5%, as well as revenues driven by pass-through costs such as transmission charges, low carbon network fund charges and other nonregulated revenues. While most of our operating costs, excluding pension expense, increase with inflation, we will have additional O&M in 2013 due to higher tree trimming and maintenance expense to continue our recovery from pre-acquisition spending levels related to the Midlands businesses. We do expect this spending will be supportive of our continued ability to outperform on customer service and reliability metrics that generate bonus revenue potential.","Pension expense is expected to be GBP 20 million in 2013. Pension expense in 2014 will obviously be driven by return on plan assets in '13, discount rate changes, as well as other factors. Until those drivers are finalized, we have assumed the pension expense remains at GBP 20 million in 2014 in these numbers.","Depreciation expense will increase about 11% per year due to planned levels of capital investment. In calculating interest expense, most of our debt is fixed rate except for about GBP 380 million that is inflation linked. In addition, we anticipate a new debt issuance in the fall of this year of about GBP 400 million. Finally, we expect the 2011 equity units to convert in April of -- in 2014, and the underlying debt will be remarketed at prevailing rates at that time. And for the remainder of the price control period, our consolidated effective tax rate is expected to be about 22%.","Combining all these drivers with the foreign currency translation rate, you should be able to reasonably estimate the U.K. regulated segment's future earnings contribution. These modeling parameters should result in approximately $770 million of ongoing earnings for 2013, consistent with the midpoint of our 2013 forecast for the U.K. regulated segment. For 2014, we are providing an ongoing earnings range for the U.K. regulated segment of $825 million to $875 million.","On Slide 15, we provide updates on our free cash flow before dividends. Our actual 2012 free cash flow before dividends was $556 million higher than the 2012 projection we provided last February. The primary drivers for the increase were lower capital expenditures at our Kentucky regulated and supply segments, totaling about $630 million, which we have discussed on previous calls, as well as higher earnings at our U.K. regulated segment. Partially offsetting these drivers were funding for the purchase of Ironwood and lower cash from operations primarily due to higher pension funding by all segments.","The largest driver of 2013 free cash flow before dividends is projected capital expenditures of $4.5 billion primarily in our rate-regulated businesses. The details of our projected capital expenditures and rate base growth can be found in the appendix to today's presentation. Cash from operations reflects strong earnings from all of our rate-regulated businesses and the impact of noncash expenses such as depreciation. Cash from operations also reflects projected pension contributions of about $550 million this year.","Finally, turning to Slide 16, our board approved a 2% increase in our common stock dividend, increasing it to $1.47 per share on an annualized basis, as Bill mentioned, effective with the April 1 dividend. This dividend level represents a 62% payout ratio based on the midpoint of our 2013 earnings forecast. This chart shows the security of our current dividend in that projected ongoing earnings per share from our regulated businesses much more than covers our increased dividend level.","With that by way of review, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bill for the Q&A period.","William H. Spence","Okay. Thank you, Paul, and operator, we're ready for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Justin McCann of S&P Capital and IP.","Justin C. McCann - S&P Equity Research","I have 2 questions for Paul and 1 for Bill. For Paul, what -- the effective tax rate for the U.K. is expected to be 22%. What will it be for the consolidated?","Paul A. Farr","On a consolidated basis for '13, between 27% and 28% for 2013.","Justin C. McCann - S&P Equity Research","Okay. And after the exchange of the 2025 8.857s for the 2021 4.6s, what is your current weighted average cost of capital? And where are you targeted for by the end of '13?","Paul A. Farr","The -- from an interest expense level, we'll basically end up with the same level of P&L interest expense on the converted note but a higher par balance than we were sitting on with the notes that were at Ironwood. Your question on weighted average cost of capital is at what segment or our corp we're at?","Justin C. McCann - S&P Equity Research","Yes, corp.","Paul A. Farr","I don't have that number off the top of my head right now. Using a market-implied rate across all of the segments and blending that and looking at the average debt levels, especially with the holdco leverage that we've got in the U.K. and in Kentucky and the bit that we have at cap funding, that includes the convertible securities, it's going to be in the 7% to 8% range.","Justin C. McCann - S&P Equity Research","Okay, okay, and for Bill, what kind of impact do you now see the MATS-related plant retirements by 2015, having on forward power prices? And when do you see this taking place?","William H. Spence","Sure. I would say in terms of forward prices, we haven't yet fully seen the MATS impact reflected. We do believe that, that impact should be in the range of $3 to $5 per megawatt hour in addition to where forward prices are today. From a overall coal plant retirement perspective, we would expect, based on the MATS, as well as the care and CSAPR, EPA rules that you may get up to the 60,000 to 70,000 gigawatt retirement levels overall. So -- and I believe that's about 20%, a little over 20% of the U.S. coal fleet could be impacted ultimately by MATS. So I think the real question is one of timing. We would expect somewhere between the 2015 to 2017 time frame that all those units that would ultimately be impacted would announce retirements in that range.","Operator","Your next question is from Dan Eggers of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Paul, could you just give an update on where you guys are standing kind of on the cost reduction and the capital reduction programs and your kind of -- how that's fitting the plan? And what are kind of the major buckets where you're seeing benefit right now?","Paul A. Farr","I think when you look at the CapEx chart that we included in the presentation that we've reflected the -- it's about $250 million of reduction for the supply segment. Most all of the major projects that are sitting in Kentucky have been fully contracted at this point in time, so I would not expect that we would see much variability in that forecast. The U.K. is always pretty right on. Greg and his team at EU are always pretty right on, so it would really take another downward movement in power prices before we would have to address CapEx in an even more significant way than we've already taken over the last 2 or 3 planning cycles to cause that to go down. On the O&M front, as Bill mentioned in the upfront remarks where we've included in the plan a $0.05 impact roughly for extra outages and extended outage in the refuel for Unit 2 at Susquehanna and a planned outage now for Unit 1 as well. We had said back in fall that the combination of potential additional outages, plus the Fukushima-related work, was really going to absorb some of the cost-reduction measures that we had already been putting in place at our shared services units. Some of the spending increase that you're seeing coming through the plan this year, as I indicated for the EU, was being driven by really trying to continue the outperformance on the customer service metrics and to get the condition of the network back to the level that it should have been at had the prior owner been spending where they should have been spending. In addition, Vic and his team cut somewhere around $50 million of O&M last year just to respond to what we were seeing from really bad weather at the front end of the year, so there is a restoration of some level of spend there as well. So in the very short term in 2013, I think there are some things that happened in '12 and that are going to continue into '13 that will have an impact. We're always focused on trying to operate the business in the most cost-efficient manner that we can, and we'll continue to strive to find ways to do that. I don't think that I would expect -- that you should expect to hear from us a larger scale O&M reduction downsizing effort at least as we look at our business prospects right now.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, just on Susquehanna, if you guys look at the 2 outages planned for this year, is this -- what is your level of confidence this will kind of fix the ongoing issues and [indiscernible] this plant back to a normal operating level going forward?","William H. Spence","Sure, Dan. I think we are highly confident. We have a very detailed root cause analysis that we have worked on for the last year in conjunction with the vendor. We believe the equipment changes we're making will, in fact, fix this for the long term, so we're very optimistic that this can be put in place in the spring outage and take care of us on a go-forward basis.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can I just -- one last question just on demand growth trends and what you guys are seeing. Power demand, weather normalized, is down in part last year, what are you guys expecting kind of in guidance and then looking forward into the CapEx program for volume gains for, yes, '13 and maybe a long-term outlook?","William H. Spence","Sure. For the plan in 2013 in the Kentucky utility business on a weather normalized basis, we're looking at a little more than 0.5% growth so around 0.7% growth. In Pennsylvania, because of energy efficiency requirements in the state, we're actually looking at a decrease of about 0.5% on a volumetric basis, again weather normalized. So that's for 2013. On a longer-term basis, we would expect growth in about the 1% range on a year-over-year basis on a go-forward basis.","Operator","Your next question is from Kit Konolige of BGC.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Question, I guess, this would be for Paul. With regard to the cap funding entity, so as you indicate, you'll be breaking that out separately. Can you give us an indication of -- I think you raised $400 million at that level last October. What was the use of those funds? And can you give us an idea of what kind of level of funding you expect at that entity going forward?","Paul A. Farr","Okay. Well, I -- again, as the models kind of transition here a little bit, if we go back to even a couple of years ago when we did the Kentucky transaction, the reason that we used Kentucky holdco as financing was it was cheaper to do it at that level than it was given the relative business mix at that time, given the steps that we've taken over the past couple of years, we're now comfortable with replacing the Kentucky holdco financing with a single holdco at PPL Cap Funding, which comes with a PPL Corp. guarantee. The $400 million issuance last year was actually originally planned at supply, and so we primarily used that level of financing to delever the supply business. I would expect that as we remarket convert securities, the piece of which -- the $1.150 billion that we'll convert in June will remarket at that level, and then the $977 million, $978 million that'll convert in April of the following year, will also be remarketed at that level. Those are existing outstanding securities, and then I would look again as we kind of grow the balance sheet. And as we're trying to maintain target credit metrics at the opcos, it won't be an overreliance on cap funding, it'll be the right balance between on the domestic front primarily first mortgage bonds, some modest level of holdco issuances, all to kind of keep the targeted credit metrics and cap structures at the regulated utilities, plus the investment-grade credit rating at corp.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Right. And one other -- somewhat related to that, Paul, so on supply segment reported earnings, you've talked in the past about wanting to ensure that earnings at supply don't go negative as a segment. Is that still the outlook? And what year would you expect the bottom to be? And would you be -- if we included this $0.04, that looks like it arguably could be a sign to supply. Would that also be the case?","Paul A. Farr","That would be the case and I would -- as we think about kind of the business planning horizon, as we look at our numbers, 2014 looks like the trough period for us. We need to kind of see obviously as we continue our hedging program and execute on our retail and other platforms. We kind of see -- need those --  need to see those forwards play out. So there's more work to do, if you will, but yes, we will continue to see those levels.","William H. Spence","And I think the good news there, Kit, is that with all the strategic acquisitions that PPL's done over the past few years, we've really significantly shielded ourselves from commodity market volatility. So I think as we look forward, we have a very stable and predictable platform of earnings drivers that I think really position us well.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","And so just to follow -- just to be clear, Paul, so you're saying EPS segment reported at supply would not go below 0 as you see it at this point?","Paul A. Farr","Correct.","Operator","Your next question is from Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Paul, can you just remind -- can you remind us what your expected '13 and '14 share counts are?","Paul A. Farr","Yes, they're actually in the appendix to the material...","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, I'll dig them up.","Paul A. Farr","Okay. No problem.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then with the maturities coming due, have you taken any proactive steps to hedge out any interest rate risk around those refis?","Paul A. Farr","We actually have a very active hedging program around both interest rates and FX, and we're right on in terms of where I would expect those hedge levels to be around expected issuances. We actually are most active in kind of on the interest expense side inside the 24-month window but definitely 1 year out, which we -- we're active so...","Operator","Your next question is from Neel Mitra of Tudor, Pickering.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Question on supply, now that you're running your coal plants less, are you looking to blend some PRB or lower-cost coal into the northern add [ph] mix? And how would that affect your current coal contracts and transport agreements?","William H. Spence","Sure, I'll ask Dave DeCampli, President of our supply group to take that question.","David G. DeCampli","Yes. Neel, we are experimenting with the use of lower quality coal in some of our coal units. We need to determine technically the impact on the boilers over the long term. So during the year, late year 2012, we were doing a lot of test burning. We do expect to be able to burn some lower-spec coal going forward. And that is reflected in a little bit of an increase in our expected baseload generation from the coal units, and it's priced in as well. With regard to PRB coal, with the transportation cost, we just don't anticipate that being much of a player for us.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just additional question on the Susquehanna outages. The way I understand it is that you have 2 planned outages in the spring, and one's a refueling outage, and you're going to try to do the work on the unit during the refueling outage. So should we expect that there could be a possible additional outage in the fall? Or do you expect to be able to get all the work done in the spring?","David G. DeCampli","Yes, the -- actually, you know there's -- there are 2 outages scheduled for the spring. One is the refueling outage that's -- was previously scheduled, and we'll couple onto that the modifications or the initial modifications to that unit. Within the same time frame, with 1 week of overlap, we're going to take the second unit off and do the same modifications to it. So we expect to be done in the spring period with both units coming out of service. Again, one for refueling plus modification and then the other unit just for modification.","Operator","Your next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First question, going back to the U.K., if you will, I just wanted to get a little bit of a sense. I know you talked about 2014. Obviously, you've been outperforming thus far and going forward. How do you think about 2015, the rate review, just, again, earned ROEs, et cetera? How do you think about that in the context of the new rate design here as well and revenue profiling rate specifically as well?","William H. Spence","Okay. I'll ask Rick Klingensmith, President of our Global and Energy Services Group, to take that question.","Rick L. Klingensmith","As we look at 2015 and the RIIO approach to the regulatory framework as we reach to that period of time, there really are a number of factors that are -- come into the determination of what our revenues are going forward. You mentioned profiling, which is the way the revenues have been shaped during this rate review period will likely be different as to how we see, perhaps, a more unprofiled approach in the next rate review period. That element is just one variable, but there will be other variables that will come into play as well, including the weighted average cost of capital, incentive revenues, our capital expenditures and our cost plans going forward into that next 8-year period. We are still working on our business plans at the moment to put all those variables together, and we'll be submitting those to Ofgem in July of this year. So hard to say what the ultimate outcome will be from that RIIO effect, but we will have a better idea of the various parameters and its effects with our business plans the middle of July.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then in terms of the, I suppose, early notification, the accelerated business plan or what have you, if you were to get that, shall we say, would we have a better view on '15 earlier shall we say?","Rick L. Klingensmith","Well, you may have a better view of '15 as Ofgem has announced that they would come out in October of this year with an assessment of the business plans that have been filed and an assessment of were any of those business plans of sufficient justification for them to be fast tracked through the process. To the extent we are fast tracked through the process, and that is our goal, to have each of our 4 distribution operating companies fast tracked through the process, that it would be in February '14 that we would have a final determination, a set of final proposals from Ofgem, for the fast-tracked entities. That would be about 9 months sooner than the normal process that would happen toward the end of '14.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And sorry, just to clarify, just to ask you directly, what kind of earned ROE are we talking about at the utility last year -- U.K. utility?","Rick L. Klingensmith","Well, the U.K. utility was in the 17% range as far as the earned ROE for the last year.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And that's at the holding company basis?","Rick L. Klingensmith","That's in the U.K. If you were to look at our U.K. regulated segment, which incorporates the interest costs associated with our equity units, you would find that and some extra costs that are allocated here on the domestic side, you would find our U.K. regulated segment ROE, as we've reported, to be about 16%, 16.1% in 2012.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And Paul, just one clarification from the last question there I think Neel asked. The kind of coal, Dave, that you're experiment with, that is not PRB. It's Illinois Basin? I'm sorry, just wanted to clarify on behalf of Neel here.","David G. DeCampli","Well, we're working with a couple of suppliers for lower-spec coal but not PRB.","Operator","Your next question is from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","What is your realized ROE for Kentucky embedded in your midpoint of the '13 guidance?","Paul A. Farr","It's -- on a regulatory ROE basis, it would be about 9.5%, so that would exclude the goodwill and some other things that, in the purchase accounting, that wouldn't be embedded in a normal calculation. But around [indiscernible] ...","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Okay. And if you were to include it, is it like closer to -- is it below 9%?","Paul A. Farr","It will be below 9%. It would be closer to 8%. There's roughly $1 billion of goodwill on Kentucky.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Okay. That's fine. Secondly, could you -- I mean, I know that you're not showing us any power hedges for '15, but can you give us at least a sense if you have any hedges in both on power and the coal side?","William H. Spence","Sure. We typically will report on that forward year, that third year, if you will, later this year based on past practice. So we don't have a lot of hedges out there in 2015 at this point. We're probably in the 10% to 20% type range right now, which is very typical where we would be at this point in time for a year like 2015.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","So the comment that the '14 is an earnings trough for supply, so '15 seeing some pickup is just purely a function of forward power curve.","William H. Spence","Predominantly, yes.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then lastly, you are showing a slide with the share count, with the average share count. It seems to me, at least, that it's a little bit higher than what we heard from you during the third quarter earnings call. Am I mistaken?","Paul A. Farr","No, it should be right -- pretty much right on top of those numbers because at that time, we knew that we would be able to constrain the future equity issuances after the equity forward settles here at the end of Q1 and then the 2 converts, they're basically just driven management comp. So that was embedded at that point in time as well. It should be very close to those numbers.","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First on O&M at the non-regulated PPL supply business, just we've seen a lot of your peers, whether it's Exelon, whether it's FirstEnergy, several others, some of the IPPs talk about kind of increased focus on O&M cost management given kind of a multi-year down cycle. We've seen you reduce capital spending costs, and we know that 2013 is a little unusual because you have the Susquehanna outages. Just curious how you're thinking kind of second half of '13 or for the next few years about your -- I guess, the actions you're likely to take given the power market conditions.","William H. Spence","Sure. I think as I mentioned in my opening remarks, Michael, we are very focused on managing the O&M as we look at the next few years in particular. And Dave, why don't you comment on some of the specific things we are doing.","David G. DeCampli","Yes, Michael, in 2012, on the fossil and hydro-side of the business, we were able to reduce O&M about $40 million. Some of that was offset in 2012 due to the Susquehanna outages, and you commented that will -- some of that will occur in 2013 as well. We continue to work through the whole fleet and very, very carefully work through a whole number of items to trim O&M costs going forward. I would expect level or slightly reduced O&M in the plan for the next 5 years.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. Another thing, you mentioned pension cash contributions in the $550 million range. What's the impact of bonus depreciation across your segments and at the entirety of the business?","Paul A. Farr","The impact from what it does from a cash perspective?","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Cash and which segments could it be an offset to rate base.","Paul A. Farr","Okay. We have -- based upon the level of spend for next year plus some carryover from the prior years, it would be about a $400 million deferred tax asset. Now remember that we purchased north of $1 billion of net operating losses from the Kentucky acquisition that we have not been able to use at this point in time given the number of years that we've now been having bonus depreciation. So we were not going to be a tax -- a federal-level cash taxpayer until 2016 without the incremental bonus depreciation we've been given. That now pushes us out into at least 2017. So we would not have had cash taxes planned prior to the gift of bonus depreciation that we got right at year end here, but it will push out another year before we're a cash taxpayer.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then finally on Susquehanna, the $0.05, is that mostly O&M? Or is that lost megawatt hours? And then when we think about the future years, should we back that out? Or do you expect to see future recurring, higher nuclear O&M costs?","William H. Spence","It is a combination of both O&M as well as lost margin due to the days that we're planning to be out. And on a go-forward basis, the level of adjustment, if you will, on O&M should be minimal, meaning that we should come back to more or less a normal run rate with just our planned outage schedules, and any follow-up work that we need to do on turbine blade-type modifications, we would do in the context of scheduled outages as we go forward.","Operator","Your next question is from Andy Bischof of MorningStar Financial.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you'd just give a little more guidance around the incentive awards in the U.K. business. And kind of looking at this year's level, is that a pretty good range for a run rate going forward and opportunities for further incentives?","William H. Spence","Sure. As we noted, we were able to generate a little over $80 million. I believe it's $83 million in incentives in the last regulatory cycle, which would kick in April 1 of this year. And maybe Rick, you could comment on how we look at the future in terms of incentive bonus.","Rick L. Klingensmith","Yes, as we look out at the future, as Bill mentioned, for the regulatory year that ended in March of 2012, that we will get recovery starting in April 1 of this year for the 12 months following April 1 of this year. It was about $83 million, and about 80% of that incentive revenue was earned at the Midlands business. 20% of our legacy business is in Southwest and South Wales. As we look into the future, we are expecting and forecasting at least that same level of outperformance here over the next 2 years, relatively in Q4 heading into our real period when the metrics are reset at that point in time. So we are confident that we'll be able to earn at least that same level of $83 million in bonus revenues going forward.","William H. Spence","So the net income -- the new net income guidance that we provided for 2013 and '14 reflects the $83 million of bonuses that we expect to continue.","Operator","Your next question is from Jonathan Ronald (sic) [Jonathan Arnold] of Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","My question on the U.K., just that you talked a little about this fast-track process. Could you just describe a little more when you would expect to know if you will be going down that path and how that works?","Paul A. Farr","Yes, as Rick mentioned, I think, on one of the previous answers to the question, it was in the October time frame in '13 with the final knowledge in February-type time frame of 2014. [indiscernible]","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Sorry, I missed that. And then I wanted to clarify on one of the other answers you gave on another question. You talked about '14 being the bottom obviously and cyclically in the power business for you, but you also said you needed the curves to cooperate or something along those lines. So you're saying that '14 is the bottom of today's forward curve or '14 is the bottom assuming your view of the curve, which might be different?","Paul A. Farr","Yes. At that point in our 5-year plan, we wouldn't have a significant blending yet of a PPL fundamental view. So there might be some modest expectation in there of some recovery, but it's much more towards years 4 and 5 of our plan where we would clearly expect to see recovery and heat rates and the retirement of the units that Bill had talked about, so not anything significant. It's pretty much the market [indiscernible] .","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So it's for -- so you see '15 as an up year based off the curves that are on the screen today?","Paul A. Farr","We would expect to clearly see by '15 some level of correction in terms of things getting more rational.","William H. Spence","And there is, even in the forward curve for '15, now a slight increase; '14 to '15, there's already built in, in the forwards, some increase there already. So I think what Paul is saying is that our current plan and outlook for '14 and '15 really reflect the forward prices that are posted out there.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. But I'm still not clear if '15 is an up year based off the actual market curve.","William H. Spence","It is. Yes, it is, slight increase.","Operator","And your next question is from Bill Appicelli of ISI Group.","William Appicelli - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Most of my question have been asked, but just one clarifying point. The -- I think you talked about your -- the ROE you expect to have earned in or will earn in Kentucky for 2013. What about Pennsylvania?","William H. Spence","Sure. I'll ask Greg Dudkin, President of our PPL Electric Utilities, to answer that.","Gregory N. Dudkin","Similar to what Paul answered for Kentucky, based on our regulated rate base, for the distribution business, we expect about a 9.3% ROE for the distribution business, and then on a GAAP perspective, including both our transmission distribution business, we'll probably be around 8% and the difference being that we have non-earning regulatory assets, primarily deferred taxes or deferred storm costs and cash working capital.","William Appicelli - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So if you -- I guess, if you strip that out, just look more on an apples-to-apples basis on how you view the distribution, how would you look at that ROE then?","Paul A. Farr","The 9.3% I think, you'd call. On a regulatory basis, how you would look at it, it would be in the low 11% range around transmission.","Gregory N. Dudkin","Right, yes, so the 9.3% equates to the 10.4% that we were granted in the Turner [ph] rate case.","William Appicelli - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right, but if I think about all the Pennsylvania assets on a regulatory basis, so you're saying 9.3% on the distribution side and closer to 11% on transmission. Is that fair?","Gregory N. Dudkin","Correct, yes.","William Appicelli - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then in terms of the rate case schedule, I know you just resolved cases in both jurisdictions this past year. But would you expect again to file in '14 for new rates in '15 in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky?","Gregory N. Dudkin","[indiscernible] yet.","Paul A. Farr","With the low levels of low growth that Bill referred to earlier and the level of capital spend that we've got, not all of which gets a tracker-based recovery on it, especially and including the combined cycle units that's under construction now in Kentucky, we would expect in every other year, so 2015, new rates would be effective, correct.","Operator","Your next question is from Anthony Crowdell of Jefferies & Company.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Two questions. One is on the U.K. You talked about what you guys earned or realized ROE in 2012, and you've given out parameters until the end of '14. But when I try to model '15 beyond, do you think Ofgem has an ROE target where when you bake in incentives and everything else, and you add it all in that they're comfortable with? Or is it just if you get incentives and you could earn 16% or 17% or 18%, that's fair game?","William H. Spence","Go ahead, Rick.","Rick L. Klingensmith","This is Rick Klingensmith. As you look at what they've done in the past, the upside potential was there because, ultimately, the ability to outperform also is helping customers. And so in the past, Ofgem has not been concerned about the outperformance that might be available for your levels of performance because it's ultimately benefiting customers. As we move into RIIO, that will likely be the case, but they will also look at the weighted average capital that's required for the business to finance the capital investment and the costs going forward. So they will reset sort of all the revenues based upon that finance ability of our business plan going forward. But I do believe that their process around outperformance will remain in the RIIO time period.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. And just quickly on supply, I know people are beating up the '14 and '15, whether to trough or not. I'm just wondering are you seeing enough liquidity in the power markets right now to lock in on '14 or '15 or increase your hedges? Any comment on liquidity of that market?","William H. Spence","Well for '14, there's liquidity. I think when you get out to '15 and '16, that's when you start to see pretty thin markets there. So no real issues locking down more hedges for '14. But as we get into -- further here into '13, liquidity will probably increase, I'm sure, for '15. So we always look for opportunities to hedge in when the markets are available and at a price that we think is fair. Okay. Well, I think with that, operator, we'll close the call, and I thank everyone for joining us today and look forward to our next call.","Operator","This concludes today's PPL Corporation Fourth Quarter Conference Call.

(Operator Instructions). Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Bergstein, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Joseph Bergstein","Thank you. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the PPL conference call on fourth quarter results and our general business outlook. We are providing slides to this presentation on our website at www.pplweb.com.","Any statements made in this presentation about future operating results or other future events are forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from such forward-looking statements. A discussion of the factors that could cause actual results or events to vary is contained in the appendix to this presentation and in the company's SEC filings.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Spence, PPL's Chairman, President and CEO.","William Spence","Thanks Joe. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. On the call with me are Paul Farr, PPL's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and three of our four Presidents for our business segments; Rick Klingensmith was unable to join us today.","My opening remarks will cover 2013 earnings, our 2014 earnings forecast and operational highlights. I will ask Paul to cover our financial results in more detail, including the performance by segment, and of course, we look forward to your questions at the end.","Let's start with the announced dividend increase effective with the April 1 payment. The new annualized rate will be $1.49 per share, up from $1.47 per share previously. This increase represents the twelfth increase in 13 years, and reflects a 181% increase over that period.","Turning to earnings; today we announced 2013 reported earnings of $1.76 per share compared to $2.60 a share a year ago. Adjusting for special items are earnings from ongoing operations were $2.45 per share, exceeding both the top end of our 2013 forecast and our 2012 earnings from ongoing operations. The most significant special item was a fourth quarter after tax charge of $0.62 per share related to the termination of a lease agreement for the Colstrip power plant in Montana. That lease termination will facilitate the previously announced sale of our Montana hydroelectric assets to Northwestern Energy.","For the fourth quarter, I reported loss of $0.16 per share, including the Colstrip lease termination charge. Quarterly earnings from ongoing operations were $0.60 per share, an increase from $0.49 per share a year ago. We exceeded the top end of our 2013 ongoing earnings forecast range, because of the exceptional performance of each business segment.","We saw increased earnings from each of the three regulated segments, and continued aggressive measures in our competitive energy Supply business, to reduce operating expenses, and optimize the value of our competitive generating facilities. I am very pleased with -- (inaudible).","Turning to Slide 5, today we are announcing a 2014 earnings forecast of $2.05 per share to $2.25 per share, with the midpoint of $2.15 per share. The strength of our regulated businesses provides a solid foundation for company earnings, with substantial well-defined prospects for future growth. Paul will provide details on the earnings forecast by segment in his prepared remarks.","On Slide 6, we have highlighted some of the key operational accomplishments of our regulated businesses. We have been committed to improving earned returns across all of our jurisdictions, and in Kentucky, our earned regulatory ROE was 10.17% for 2013. The solid performance was driven by an increase in base rates, partially offset by regulatory lag on non-ECR spending and inflationary increases.","In the UK, we continue to deliver solid returns with an earned ROE, including the effects of goodwill of 17.8% in 2013, a direct result of our frontier operational performance. And in Pennsylvania, we improved our transmission and distribution combined regulatory ROE to 10.42% through effective cost management and higher revenues. Of course, our GAAP to ROE is a bit lower in Pennsylvania, due to some items that are not recoverable in rates.","In November, we learned that the eight year business plans for all four of our western power distribution subsidiaries were found suitable for accelerated condition or fast tracking under RIO-ED1. Our well justified business plans reflect WPD's operational excellence on reliability, costs, and customer satisfaction, which our U.K. management has delivered for years, and continues to achieve today. Our WPD subsidiaries are ranked as the top four distribution network operators in Ofgem's broad measure of customer satisfaction, thus far in the current regulatory year.","Turning back to the U.S.; we continued progress on major infrastructure projects, including the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line in Pennsylvania, environmental upgrades at our Kentucky power plants and construction of a combined cycle natural gas generating plant at our Cane Run facility in Louisville.","Our company also recently achieved significant regulatory milestones for two other important infrastructure projects. The Pennsylvania PUC has approved construction of a $335 million reliability upgrade in the Pocono Mountain Region, that includes approximately 60 miles of new transmission lines and three new substations. And in January, we filed a request with the Kentucky Public Service Commission for approval of a second natural gas combined cycle power plant, and a 10-megawatt solar energy facility. These generation projects total more than $700 million, and will provide our Kentucky customers with reliable low cost generation, that meets the latest EPA regulations.","Turning to distribution and sales on Slide 7; you will see the total weather normalized sales in the fourth quarter, increased in both Kentucky and Pennsylvania from a year ago, driven by higher industrial load. In Kentucky, some of our automotive and steel customers maintained production levels in the fourth quarter, with fewer maintenance shutdowns than we had in 2012.","In Pennsylvania, higher industrial sales were primarily a result of increased usage from the steel and cement industries, due to commercial and industrial expansion projects in the region.","On an annual basis, sales in both states were relatively flat, driven by energy efficiency measures and regional economic conditions. For 2014, we project load growth between 0.5% to 1% at both our Kentucky and Pennsylvania utilities.","Taking a look at slide 8; I have already mentioned the agreement to sell PPL Montana's 11 hydro plants to Northwestern Energy, and that proceeds from that sale will enable us to reduce financing needs for future capital investment and our rate regulated business segments. Our Susquehanna nuclear plant achieved record output in the fourth quarter, operating at a capacity factor of 100%. We increased our total generation output at the facility by 12% in 2013, as we continue to analyze and assess detailed information on the performance of the turbines for both units. We will be installing additional modifications this spring to address blade cracking issues, with a goal to allow the units to run, without repair for their full two year operating cycles.","Finally, we continued our management of operating expenses at our Supply business, by reducing costs by $40 million in 2013. We expect to keep O&M essentially flat through 2016.","Before turning over the call to Paul, I'd like to give you a summary of some of our 2014 objectives. I have already mentioned approval of the northeast Pocono transmission line by the PaPUC in January. This is a key step towards strengthening reliability in the region. And our Susquehanna-Roseland transmission project remains on budget and on time for a mid-2015 in-service date.","In the U.K., we expect the final determination from Ofgem on fast track business plan approval for all four of our distribution networks by the end of February, and the decision on the cost of equity reveal the week of February 17th. In Kentucky, we are analyzing the potential for a rate case filing, to keep pace with our significant investment in the state; and we will continue to invest in our regulator infrastructure to ensure safe, reliable electric delivery. Finally, we will continue our focus to manage costs and Supply and maintain positive earnings in that business.","So in summary, 2013 was an exceptional year for PPL. We executed very well on our extensive construction plans and delivered strong earnings results, including ROEs above 10% at all three of our utility businesses. We continue to deliver on our commitments to customers as well, with numerous awards in 2013 for our outstanding customer service, safety and reliability, positioning the company for continued success. For 2014, we are confident in our ability to achieve our earnings forecast, and the colder weather has provided a good start.","I look forward to your questions, and I will now turn the call over to Paul.","Paul Farr","Thanks Bill and good morning everyone. Let's move to slide 10; our strong fourth quarter reflects higher earnings from each of our operating segments compared to 2012. Quarterly earnings at our regulated businesses increased, driven by improved gross margins due to higher base rates in Kentucky, higher U.K. revenues on higher prices, and higher transmission margins in Pennsylvania, due to capital investments in grid infrastructure.","In the Supply business, we experienced improved quarterly earnings, primarily due to higher nuclear generation output and higher capacity prices, partially offset by lower baseload energy prices.","Full year 2013 earnings from ongoing operations increased over last year, due to strong performance from our domestic and U.K. utilities. This performance was partially offset by the expected lower supply segment earnings, and dilution of $0.27 per share.","Let's move now to a more detailed review of 2013 segment earnings drivers, starting with Kentucky on slide 11. Kentucky earned $0.48 per share in 2013, a $0.15 increase compared to 2012. This increase was due to higher retail margins, primarily due to higher base rates, that went into effect on January 1 last year for LG&E and KU, and higher earnings from environmental CapEx. These positive margin drivers were partially offset by higher depreciation and dilution of $0.04 per share.","Moving to slide 12; our U.K. business earned $1.32 per share in 2013, a $0.13 increase over 2012. This increase was due to higher utility revenue, primarily due to the April 1 price increase that impacted all four of our utilities, and lower U.K. income taxes as a result of a lower effective tax rate; partially offset by higher O&M expense, largely due to higher network maintenance costs, higher depreciation due to higher network investments and dilution of $0.14 per share.","Turning now to slide 13; our Pennsylvania regulated segment earned $0.31 per share in 2013, a $0.09 increase over 2012. This increase was due to higher distribution rates that went into effect on January 1 of 2013, higher transmission margins and lower O&M, primarily due to lower storm and support troop costs, partially offset by higher depreciation and dilution of $0.04 per share.","Finishing with Supply on slide 14 for the detailed driver revenue, this segment earned $0.39 per share in 2013, a year-over-year decrease of $0.29 per share. This decrease was primarily due to lower energy margins, driven by lower energy prices, partially offset by higher capacity prices and increased nuclear generation output. Higher depreciation and higher income taxes, primarily due to state tax rate changes. Partially offsetting these drivers, was lower O&M, primarily due to lower outage spending. Segment results also include dilution of $0.05 per share.","Turning to slide 15; we have prepared a walk from our $2.45 per share in actual 2013 ongoing earnings to the $2.15 per share midpoint of our 2014 forecast.","Starting with Pennsylvania regulated, we expect higher margin to drive a significant increase in earnings in 2014, primarily due to transmission investments, including a substantial amount of work on the Susquehanna-Roseland line. In addition, we expect an increase in distribution revenue, due to a full year benefit of the DISC mechanism in 2014.","In the U.K., we anticipate flat earnings year-over-year, including a four set negative impact as a result of our voluntary agreement with the U.K. Department of Energy and Climate Change and Ofgem, and voluntarily reduce residential customer bills by GBP5 per customer on an annual basis. As a reminder, these revenues will be collected in future regulatory years, including a full carrying charge for the deferral.","U.K. regulated segment earning drivers are a net result of increased revenues due to higher prices and higher incentive revenues. Lower O&M due to reduced pension expense. Higher depreciation, higher financing costs and higher income tax expense.","In Kentucky, we expect lower earnings in 2014, primarily due to higher O&M, higher depreciation and higher financing costs, partially offset by improved margins driven by environmental CapEx, and modest retail load growth.","Finally in Supply, we expect lower earnings, primarily due to lower energy margins, as a result of lower energy and capacity prices, and higher depreciation expense. These negative drivers in Supply are partially offset by lower financing costs and lower income taxes. One additional data point for you regarding supply for 2014, our forecast assumes a sale of the Montana hydro portfolio at the end of third quarter of this year.","On slide 16; we provide updates on our free cash flow before dividends. Actual 2013 free cash flow before dividends was about $325 million higher than the projection we provided last February. The primary drivers of the net increase include higher cash from operations at our regulated businesses, including the benefit of higher anticipated earnings and lower capital expenditures at our supply segment. Partially offset by payments related to determination of the Colstrip power plant lease.","Looking at 2014, we are projecting an increase in our free cash flow, primarily driven by proceeds from the pending sale of the Montana hydro facilities. In addition, we expect cash from operation to increase due to lower deferred taxes and lower pension contributions, and we also expect slightly lower capital expenditures in 2014, mainly in Kentucky.","Our planned capital expenditures for 2014 through 2018 are detailed on slide 17, with regulated utility investment totaling almost $17 billion over that period. This includes previously announced initiatives such as U.K. spending for our filed RIO-ED1 business plans; executing on our environmental compliance plans in Kentucky to meet EPA regulations, and the construction of two combined cycle gas utilities, as well as updating and modernizing ageing infrastructure in Pennsylvania.","In addition, our revised plan reflects incremental transmission investment of over $650 million in Pennsylvania through 2017, including $400 million for our improved system reliability programs, that identify areas to strategically approve system performance, including adding more automation to our transmission assets, and $250 million for our asset optimization programs, to enhance or rebuild existing transmission assets, to ensure their continued reliable performance.","Turning to slide 18; our updated investment plan drives a CAGR of about 7% in our projected rate base through 2018, driving value for both customers and shareholders.","Finally, on slide 19, our Board approved a $0.02 increase in our common stock dividend, increasing it to $1.49 per share on an annualized basis, as Bill mentioned, effective with the April 1 dividend. This dividend level represents a 69% payout ratio, based on the midpoint of our 2014 earnings forecast, and the dividend is solidly covered by earnings from our rate regulated businesses.","That's the end of my prepared remarks, and I will now turn the call back over to Bill for the Q&A period.","William Spence","Thank you, Paul, and operator, we are now ready to accept questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from Kit Konolige of BGC. Please go ahead. ","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners","Good morning gentlemen.","Paul Farr","Good morning Kit.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners","So to follow a little bit on the projection of cash flow and CapEx. So in 2014, as you have described Paul, the proceeds from the sale of the hydro assets, gets you into positive territory on free cash flow before dividends. In our projections, going forward after 2014, you would continue to have a pretty significant deficit in that free cash flow before dividends. Can you talk a little bit about your financing plans for the significant rate base growth that you are talking about?","Paul Farr","Sure. I think we have covered this in prior calls. We have front-ended quite a bit of the equity with the converged securities. We had the $1.150 billion that converted this past year, mid year, and we have got another almost $1 billion plus the equity forward that we did this past year. And then we have got almost $1 billion that's converting mid-year this year. You talked about the $900 million pre-tax that's expected from the sale of the hydro facilities. So as we look at our target credit metrics, we look at the internal cash flow which, as we move towards the back end of the plan from a domestic regulated utility perspective, gets much improved from where we sit today, given that we are starting to harvest cash from these significant investments that we are making in the infrastructure. We do get real time recovery of a very significant majority of the CapEx across the regulated utility space, the regulated utility segment.","So, at this point in time, we don't forecast the need for equity beyond basically, what we have already got submitted to the company.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners","Okay. And can you talk to us a little bit about the outlook for rate cases in Kentucky and Pennsylvania, and the latest on the RIO proceedings? I think we had that update at the end of February I think on RIO on the ROE issue?","William Spence","Yeah, starting with the U.K. on that point, Kit, we do expect the week of February 17 to have some signal on the ROE issue, and then final determination for our fast tracking by the end of the month. I will ask Vic Staffieri to cover the Kentucky rate case outlook, and then following that Greg Dudkin for the PA outlook.","Victor Staffieri","Sure. Kit, we are looking at a rate case. We are analyzing the notion of the rate case filing some time in 2014, and we are in the process of that analysis right now. We are taking into account of what the capital construction, and are not otherwise covered by our (inaudible), as well as this test period that we are looking at right now. We haven't made a determination, when we would final the amount, but its something we are certainly considering for 2014.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners","Okay.","Gregory Dudkin","And this is Greg Dudkin on Pennsylvania. We do not intend to file our rate case in 2014, and we will continue to look at the needs beyond 2014.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And from Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Hey good morning guys.","William Spence","Good morning Dan.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Hey good morning guys. Wrong phone. Just I guess real quick on the filing of the fast track decision. What information do you guys expect Ofgem to provide, as far as detailed financials and rate structure, and kind of the transparency into what that full package looks like, relative to what you guys gave last July, when you provided the earnings outlook?","William Spence","Well I think just as a general proposition, we don't expect a lot of changes, because the plans themselves have been deemed as accepted as filed. So the key piece that we are looking for is, what they may decide on an ROE basis. So we do expect that to be a constructive outcome. We know that, based on our past experience, that they have been very balanced. They recognize our need to finance these companies and maintain strong financial metrics across the board, both for equity, as well as for the debt side. So we are hopeful that the outcome, when we get it, the week of February 17 will be a constructive one.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Then I guess Bill, just on the $0.04 drag this year because of the customer rebate. Do we add $0.04 on to next year, so this is the one time recalibration down and then you guys should earn that back, so we should -- to normalize where the U.K. is?","Paul Farr","Yes. This is Paul. It will be spread over a couple of years, but yeah, we will get full recovery of that, including an equity carry component to the charge.","William Spence","It's really just pulling forward some of the benefit of the rate reduction that was otherwise going to happen with the shaping of revenues. And as long as we are able to get that full carry, we were economically neutral, and we were happy to do it.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Got it. I guess just you know, maybe Paul or Bill, could you give an update on the thought process around Supply, kind of evaluating your options and where you see that business setting out and maybe, when we will hear the decision on strategic future?","William Spence","Sure. As you know, our current plan is to optimize the plants, and we are continuing to aggressively look at our cost structure and our operations to optimize the value of the fleet. Having said that, we are certainly open to other opportunities and routinely assess the potential for adding further value in the supply business and with the overall portfolio in total. So, we are willing to execute on opportunities, as evidenced by our decision to sell the Montana hydroelectric plants.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Do you think there is a point, Bill, where you guys make an affirmative decision, whether Supply is part of PPL on a long run basis, or whether its not part of PPL -- I guess for a lack of a better word, is this just going to be a wait and see and we are going to bug you with this question every quarter?","William Spence","I do get this question every quarter. We do think there is inherent value in this high quality fleet that we operate in upside potential, when we see the energy markets begin to recover. We are continuing on the plan to maintain a positive EPS contribution from that business to the company, and continue to believe that can be accomplished. But we are looking for opportunities to enhance the value all the time, and continue to assess options. I think its an ongoing process. There is no end date in mind, its continuous and we will continue to assess options for that business.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Okay. Got it. Thank you guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Hi good morning. Can you hear me?","William Spence","Yes. Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Excellent. Is this the implied ROEs on your 2014 guidance for the Pennsylvania and Kentucky utilities? Can you talk about that for a quick second?","Paul Farr","For 2014, we will look at between 8.5% and 9%.","William Spence","And Greg, in Pennsylvania?","Gregory Dudkin","From a regulatory perspective, both, combining T&D, its about 10.8%.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Excellent. And then, going back to the supply business, could you talk a little bit more about the blade situation, just what the game plan is (inaudible) spring, in terms of outage timing and impact. Perhaps you could talk about that?","William Spence","Sure. I will ask Dave DeCampli to cover that.","David DeCampli","Yes Julien, there is two outages planned for this spring. We will be taking one unit off, just to do some modifications for the turbine blade situation. That will be a relatively short outage, during the month of March. Basically, we are going inside the turbine housings and removing some of the riveting in there, that disrupts the seam flow. We will also be replacing the turbine blades in that unit, to assure that we can get a full year run, till it connects refuel cycle in the spring of 2015.","Unit 1 comes off for its refill outage, and within the scope of the refill outage, we will actually be doing a different modification to the -- this last rope of [suspect] turbine blades, will be installing a shorter redefined blade, that we believe will be likely part of the permanent solution. So the shorter blades will be installed, and it would be done inside the confines of the refuel outage duration in April and into early May. So we are doing two modifications, one on one unit, one on the other unit, both of which we think will contribute to the permanent solution to run two years, cycle to cycle.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Great, excellent. Could you talk about how much that costs, in terms of -- in your CapEx budget, and perhaps from a DTH perspective, if we were to normalize that out in 15 hours [27:42], just to make sure, we are not capturing that on a go forward basis?","David DeCampli","Sure. The impact last year with the multiple outages we had to take, was about $30 million net income after tax impact. Forecast going forward for 2014 would be, a little more than half of that, and then of course, in performance year 2015, we expect to run full cycle.","Paul Farr","The maintenance CapEx around those (inaudible) is not significant, relative to the normal budget for Susquehanna.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Excellent. And actually, since we are on the subject of CapEx, could you talk about a little bit, the shift in your 2014 CapEx budget? What exactly drove that? It looks like its WPD?","William Spence","WPD was a small amount. We provided that update, at the time we filed the business plan in July. It's gone up a small amount. Most of the rest of it is relatively consistent with what the prior expected spending was. We did add, as I said earlier, between 14 and 17, $650 million of transmission CapEx. So the maroon bar on slide 17, that's a little more back ended. But we do some level of increased spending, starting in 2014.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Great. And then just lastly from a CapEx perspective, on timing of Susquehanna-Roseland CapEx. Should we expect a very disproportionate jump in earnings at the Pennsylvania utility? Just so you can just try to make sure we capture that project coming online and all that?","Paul Farr","Its about -- of the improvements, the significant increase in margins, what I talked about for 2014 on that earnings log slide. Susquehanna to Roseland was about $0.04 to $0.05 of that total amount. So it\u2019s the single biggest driver, and then the DISC program was about $0.02.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Great. And this should be continuing every year, right? To be clear?","Paul Farr","Yes. That's correct.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Great. Thank you guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Neil Mitra of Tudor Pickering. Please go ahead.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Hi. Good morning.","William Spence","Good morning Neel.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Paul, you referenced the $650 million in CapEx for transmission. Could you talk more about what those projects entail, as there are smaller projects, and whether you need approval or you can just file them through your formula rates?","Paul Farr","Sure. Let me have Greg address that.","Gregory Dudkin","Yeah. These are all projects on our existing facility, so its basically rebuilding our older facilities. We had some transmission lines that were built in the 1920s, so its basically rebuilding those lines, reconductoring those lines. As well as, about $400 million for improving reliability, which means things like having automated switches, transmission switches, better relays, that type of thing. They are all going to be recovered through the formula rate.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","And what ROE are you assuming you get on these?","Gregory Dudkin","Now it is 11.68.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","And then, are there more projects on the horizon that you think you can add or is this kind of the -- and with the $650 million?","Gregory Dudkin","Well, this is our best look right now at our plant. So this is what we see as prudent investment. If there are other opportunities that arise, we will take a look at those.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Got it. And then around O&M optimization at the Supply business, could you talk about what you are specifically targeting, whether its reducing O&M around Susquehanna, and maybe what the normalized O&M inflation will be, going forward, at Supply?","Paul Farr","Sure, as I indicated earlier, we did take out $40 million in costs last year in 2013. The items are really more related to the Fossil Fleet than they are to Susquehanna. We are not reducing O&M costs at Susquehanna. And on an ongoing basis, we are expecting flat O&M at the moment. But having said that, we are going to continue to look aggressively at ways we can reduce costs (inaudible), taking out the inflationary pressure.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Okay great. Thank you.","Paul Farr","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. ","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Good morning.","William Spence","Good morning Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","A lot of questions have been asked and answered. I just wanted to -- just in terms of the trading volume that you guys see in 2014 versus 2013, just the -- call it vortex or what have you, some more volatility. Any change in the outlook or anything that you could share with us?","Paul Farr","I would say, the only change there is more volatility obviously in the forwards, which to some degree, we have taken advantage of by layering some more hedges for 2015. We are already fairly highly hedged coming into 2014. But we were able to take advantage of that at hedge price levels that are at or above our business plan. So that had a positive impact. If you look at the overall mix between our generation of retail, the net effect of the weather in January, we expect to be positive, although we have not closed the books yet for January, but on a net basis, we still expect January to be positive to our EPS.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay. And then what sort of a forecast for trading volume in 2014 versus 2013? Has there been a change in that, or how should we feel about that?","Paul Farr","No. Pretty much the same, no change. As you know, for us it\u2019s a fairly immaterial part of the overall earnings and business mix.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay. Now, with respect to the transmission spend, should we expect any significant change in transmission capability, or is this just pretty much reliability kind of spending, when you are talking about this, reconductoring or what have you?","William Spence","Well I think from a capability, Susquehanna-Roseland is a big piece. The other ones are, improved reliability of our system. So its improving the reliability supply within our system, within PJM.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay. Then finally, the RPM outlook. Given that we now have that GR ruling, plan parameters come out, MOPR exemptions, could you -- would you like to share with us what your thoughts are, about what's going to be coming after (inaudible)?","William Spence","Well, with the planning parameters having just come out, we are still in the process of assessing and modeling what does it mean for PPL and the poll in general. So we haven't completed that work year, but we are continuing to take a look at what all this is likely to mean. So unfortunately, I can't give you even a best guess at this point about what we think, until we finish that modeling.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thank you. Can you just -- I don't want to beat on Montana too much, but have you had expressions of interest, have you shopped it around, and where in the process are we?","William Spence","Well, on the hydro asset sale, let me just start there. That process is moving ahead as we had anticipated. Both state and federal applications have been filed. Back in late December, Northwestern Energy submitted their application to the Montana PSC and there will be a discovery process, followed by a public hearing, which is scheduled for early July at this point. We would expect the final FERC order by June, which is what we have requested, and we expect the Montana PSC to rule, hopefully by around the September timeframe.","For the rest of the assets remaining out there, we are just continuing to assess what options we have for those, and there is really no new update on that front at the moment.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","All [parties] have touched on this a little bit, but how much did the volatility hurt the retail business?","William Spence","Again on a net basis for us, with the fleet that we have and with the retail, it\u2019s a net positive for us. But clearly, there is a drag on the retail end. I don't really have figures on exactly, as I mentioned, we haven't closed the books yet for January, so its really premature to give you a number. But clearly, we expect it to be a net drag on the retail front, offset by a very positive outcome on the generating fleet side.","David DeCampli","In between load following and retail, only a couple of thousand megawatts. If you go back to the, kind of 2008 shopping timeframe experience and everything that happened in that window, when the liquidity kind of drained up; retail and load following is a relatively small component of the total hedge book, and we expect -- to keep it at those levels growing organically and modestly. So you probably are -- you may be trying to triangulate what others are experiencing, but it\u2019s a small piece of PPL.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Got it. So (inaudible) that long?","William Spence","Yes.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Trahan","Yeah. Hi guys. Just a question on the CapEx and rate base slide. It looks like your CapEx over the next four years is up over $1 billion, but the rate base numbers are actually pretty much the same, or even a little lower in the initial years. Could you explain that?","Paul Farr","I am just kind of taking a quick look at those slides right now. The U.K. is up a bit in terms of kind of improved FX assumptions and other things that we have layered on. I talked about, at the front-end, the $650 million -- actually, when you wrap in 18, versus where we originally thought 18 was going to be at, transmission and distribution reliability in Pennsylvania is up by almost $1 billion. We will have to get back to you in terms of that net increase, and looking at 17. We were at roughly 28. Some of this transmission spend does go in more towards the back end, so you wouldn't start to see that, until we are being [gathered] in, till we get closer to the back end. But we can get back to you on the differential on the net rate base.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Trahan","Okay. Great. And then on the -- could you just may be update us on your currency hedge position?","Paul Farr","Yes. So for 2014, between the actuals and the books and where we sit with hedges, we are in excess of 92% actually hedged for the current year, and we are very materially hedged in the 70% to 80% range for 2015 as well. Right around $1.59 for this year hedges, and close t o$1.61 on next years.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Trahan","Okay. Great. Thank you.","William Spence","Thank you, Steve.","Paul Farr","Sure.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Hey guys, congrats on a good quarter. Got a question for you, how are you thinking about O&M and cost management? Once you kind of get the final ruling out of Ofgem in the U.K. I mean, over the years, you have been one of the -- you've been basically the best operator from an O&M and cost per megawatt hour and other metric performance. How are you thinking about the ability and kind of the direction O&M will take over the next seven or eight years in the U.K.?","William Spence","Sure, I will let Paul answer on that one.","Paul Farr","Yeah, I would expect that we maintain the spending kind of for our plans, including what was filed with the RIO-ED1 plan. A lot of the costs, the efficiency that we are able to get out of the Midlands has been taken out. So I am certain, that there are some modest things that we can do around, continued supply chain optimization and other things. But we spend the dollars on the network to create the reliability, which drives our opportunity to outperform the bonus revenue targets. And so, everything that we look at, is done on a complete cost benefit basis, not for short term drivers and spending that we are doing in the Midlands now, some of it is literally catch-up spending that EON hadn't performed, and we will continue through that, through the end of the DPCR5 period. And then again, the plan is to spend, pursuant to the things that we are driving the net income numbers at -- that we provided on July 1 last year. We will update those numbers, once we can internalize the final RIO-ED1 outcome from a fast track perspective. But I wouldn't see cost reduction efforts being material in the U.K., as we move forward.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Okay. I wanted to ask a question about lag in Kentucky. I know you get the environmental costs are covered via the ECR, what about the cost recovery on the two combined cycles? Is that only recovered via traditional GRCs or rate cases or given that some of that is being built to replace some of the retiring coal units, any chance to eventually get recovery via a path to return mechanism?","William Spence","No. Today, they are only recoverable through general rate case.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thanks guys.","William Spence","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from Gregg Orrill of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays","Thanks. I guess you've really touched on this already, but in Kentucky, just drivers for the rate case filing that you are going to be making?","William Spence","I mean, the driver is the new construction, the combined cycles that we just discussed very briefly there. Its going to be the -- how much capital investment we will spend between now and the end of the year, we want to recover that obviously, and so we are looking at what's the optimum time to file a case, given the stream of expenditures, as well as the test periods and what are the future rate years in the offerings. So those are the analysis. But it really will be driven by the capital investment that's not recoverable through the ECR.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays","Thanks.","William Spence","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from Nathan Judge if Atlantic Equities. Please go ahead.","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities","Hi. I just had a question on Kentucky as well. What's the current ROE for the last 12 months?","Paul Farr","10.2.","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities","10.2. So is the reduction in earned ROE that you expect in 2014 related to regulatory lag, or is it -- because that sounds quite a bit?","Paul Farr","It has got a log, it has got increased OEM expenses, because we have inflation, we have wage increases. We have got some additional outages that we didn't have in the 12 months ended, 12\/31\/2013. And then of course, the additional capital spend, that's otherwise recoverable through the ECR. Those are the drivers. As well as, we have modest load growth. We are using about 0.5%. So we don't have that much load growth to offset inflation and wage increases and the like. That's what's really driving it.","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities","Okay. And so, kind of speaking beyond through 2015 and the flow-through of rate case. I mean, if you file this in 2014, when would we see returns get back to those levels, that would be more acceptable?","Paul Farr","We generally look to file rate cases when we (inaudible) 9% on an ROE basis, so we would -- if we filed in say June of 2014, new rates would go in effect on 1\/1\/2015. So its about a six month lag between filing the case and the new rates going into effect.","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities","Just generally on overall company, could you just give us an idea of the swing in pension expense this year versus last?","Paul Farr","Yeah. So for 2014, we'd expect across all the segments, about a $0.07 improvement in pension, running through the P&L, about a nickel of that in the U.K., and then about $0.02, pretty much evenly split between Kentucky, and then the balance of EU and Supply.","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities","Okay. Thank you. Just finally, on the Supply business, especially on the retail. Given that it is a small part, we have seen from your peers that, its not providing the kind of return to invested capital that other opportunities are posing for them. How do you think of that business, given how small it is, and the kind of returns its obviously providing right now?","William Spence","Well, the biggest value for us is really on the ability to hedge the output of some of our fleet. So we look at it really as a tool, that we can use among other tools, to place the generation into the marketplace. So that's the primary purpose of it. I think, in terms of incremental investments to go beyond that, its not something that we are focused on. We are obviously, very focused on the regulated side of the business, and incremental capital that we have is going into the regulated side of the business.","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities","Is the capital employed and not (inaudible) business is more or less than what it would be, if you went on and hedged it?","Paul Farr","It would be less than if we went out and just get straightforwards or collars where we'd -- on a mark-to-market basis to the extent that prices go against us and rise after we lay in those hedges. We are posting collateral at the ICE and NYMEX and the exchanges, given that the OTC side of things is pretty much kind of dried up. So if we use the traditional hedges, and we do -- as we do expect to see a rising price environment, we'd be joint on LCs and cash postings to be able to meet those calls. So on a working capital basis, it consumes less.","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities","So how much of your retail provides hedge to your overall generation then?","Paul Farr","Less than 20% I guess -- 9% and 14%.","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities","Converging that, it would make sense for you to increase that business, right?","Paul Farr","Well yeah, we have lived through. We just got then, answering a couple of questions on, what retail load experienced here in the month of January, which has clearly been negative; because the weather has been -- we forecast normal weather ranges around the volatility in that load, plus volatility around things like shopping. The weather has truly been exceptional in January, and even in the front part of February here. So as I said earlier in my comments, we have lived through some of this volatility in the past, in 2008 and 2009, when shopping levels were high.","We will plan to keep this business to be relatively modest in size. It\u2019s a good natural hedge, because most of the hedging we are doing, is to customers' right in the same neighborhood, that this generation has been hedging, since it has been built. So we've looked for us to be aggressive in adding to that. But there will be periods of time when that retail book provides better return opportunities than agendas and periods like in January and February, where the gen provides the better value proposition if you will of the total margins. But we will continue to modest in retail.","William Spence","I would just add that, when we look at retail, you have got to look at of course, what are the margins that that business can achieve, based on the competition in the marketplace, and is that incremental margin compared to your opportunities worth the incremental risk that you are picking up. So as Paul mentioned, on the positive side, you can lock in basis, but you can't necessarily lock with standard products. You don't have the collateral. It\u2019s a good for us, a good match to our generation. So those are the positives. But on the negative side, your margins may not be commensurate with the risks that you are taking on. So we have to balance all of that, and then assess what's the proper and appropriate level of hedging we want to do, via the retail market.","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Anthony Crowdell of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Anthony Crowdell - Jefferies","Hey good morning. I just want to ask the 100th question on Supply and O&M. Just trying to get more granularity on may be how you can manage this and how low it could go. What's a good, range to use for -- if I wanted to model out for the power plants, a good like say, O&M per KW for like nuclear and coal assets that you guys have?","William Spence","Well, on the nuclear side, as I mentioned earlier, we are not looking to necessarily cut the O&M. That's the unique asset and we don't want to take any chances with not fully supporting the plant. So when you look at the O&M on a KW basis, on the other facilities, the fossil and hydro, that's something we continue to benchmark and look at best practices. I don't have the number off the top of my head that I can give you, so I will just say that we are going to continue to look for opportunities to aggressively cut costs where we can, and I think what we did in 2013 with the $40 million, it was an appropriate level and its probably in that kind of a range that you are going to see going forward, that may be, we can continue to target taking out. But beyond that, really hard to answer that question without more benchmarking.","David DeCampli","We do have verified, on our nuclear assets that we benchmark extremely well in O&M costs per KWH or KW as compared to other fleet units, new unit fleets and [new] unit standalone facilities as well. So we are really well in the game with our O&M costs, with the nuclear facility.","Anthony Crowdell - Jefferies","How about kind of like taking a second bite at the same question? When I look at say, 2012 OEM for Supply was like $1.40 billion. You knocked out $40 million. So 2013 is about $1 billion. How much of that is for like power plant and maintenance, versus may be other stuff that's in that line item?","David DeCampli","Its about an 80-20 split. Between 80% being that applied more direct to the supply business, 20% being more of the corporate and other overheads. And of that 80%, probably, I would say about $600 million to $700 million of that is direct O&M, associated with plant operations.","Anthony Crowdell - Jefferies","Great. Thank you.","William Spence","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Good morning guys.","William Spence","Good morning.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Just quickly on the U.K., you said that -- you are hopeful of a constructive outcome on cost of equity. Can you give us a sense of -- does that mean, it is constructive in your mind, no change from what you filed, or it is constructive, sort of in line with the suggested 80 basis points that they talked about, when they -- I guess, came out with the initial fast tracking. Any color on that, relative to your guidance range (inaudible)?","William Spence","Constructive to me would be something less than the outcome that they saw on Ireland, and I would say that, our expectations -- its hard to gauge, but would be that, Ofgem would take a look at our specific performance and accordingly, grant us something that's reasonable. But I would say, if it came out somewhere in between, we'd just have to kind of assess. But I would expect if its not the status quo meaning no change, its going to be something -- I would hope, its something less, and we just have to assess, once we get to that point what that means, and what actions, if any, we would take as a result.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","And when you say, less, as in less significant a reduction?","William Spence","Yes.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Yes. Okay. Then just in terms of -- to understand the process, have you effectively been fast tracked to a pending, accepting an outcome on the ROE piece, sort of in your court, when that decision comes out, or has that decision already been taken, you are sort of -- and I can't remember whether -- what your options are at that point?","William Spence","We could -- depending right now, we are waiting for the February 17, that week for an outcome on the ROE. We will then assess what our options are at the end of that period. However, my understanding is, that we could go the slow tracker out, if we weren't happy with the outcome. But I think that might be unlikely, given the value and the benefit of the incremental revenues that you get by fast tracking. So I would think that that's a low probability, but again, we have to wait and see what Ofgem tells us in the outcome, on the week of the 17th, and assess where we are at that point.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Thank you, Bill.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Chin of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Brian Chin - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Hi good morning.","William Spence","Good morning.","Brian Chin - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Just to follow-up on John's question. In the -- let's hope unlikely event, that the ROE decision is not as constructive as you deem. Can you give a sense about how long your assessment period might be, before you notify what your course of action is going to be?","William Spence","I think it would be relatively quick, probably within a week.","Brian Chin - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, I did hear your -- as a second separate question. I did hear your answer to Paul Patterson on RPM. Just one small question on RPM still. We did notice that the PPL region was broken out separately by PJM, and they have indicated that regions that were broken out separately, were due to potential future generator deactivations in each LDA. Now, it doesn't look like the PPL region is particularly transmission constrained, so it would seem as though, potential future generator deactivations is what they are concerned about. Any color as to why the PPL region was one of the three regions that PPL broke out, because of that thought process?","William Spence","I really don't know why I would not think that its bigger than, at least not predominantly, by generator deactivations. I am not aware of any significant generators that are planning to retire, and its certainly, none of the PPL generators. So until we get more clarity on that, I am not exactly sure why they believe it could break out.","Brian Chin - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Very helpful. Thank you.","William Spence","Sure.","Operator","The next question is from Shar Pourreza of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup","Good morning everyone.","William Spence","Good morning.","Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup","Most of my questions have been answered, but let me ask you on your fuel hedges. Despite the move that we have seen in gas, you've seen coal prices kind of come off, but your hedge profile hasn't really changed, at least at the long end of the curve. Could you may be just comment on, whether you've been able to layer on, some more fuel hedges, at least on the coal side post Q4?","William Spence","Sure. Dave?","David DeCampli","Our coal hedges for 2014 are standing at about 94% and in 2015, about 63%. Beyond that, we are just continuing to take a look at the price of coal, market prices for energy, and we will hedge in, as appropriate. But we stand currently at 94% and 63% for 2014 and 2015.","Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup","Okay. And your fuel hedges -- your coal hedges haven't changed for 2015, right? Since EEI?","William Spence","No. Not materially. But for the last couple of years, we have also rolled some coal in contracts and pile into the subsequent year. So again, depending upon where we see capacity factors, especially this spring and fall, you could see some movement, ultimately between the years as well. The value of the hedge is the value of the hedge, so we have captured that. But we are cognizant of the decline or the trending in the decline in coal prices, and we will monitor that. But I don't think, we are going to be actively pursuing significant increases in these hedges in the near term.","Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup","Got you. Got you. And just one last question, have you and your native load around the service territory, have you seen any third party retail providers exit the system? Given the recent volatility?","David DeCampli","I don't know that we have seen any material ones. I think we have heard a few, very small providers going out of business. But we don't really have a lot of data points, to be honest.","Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup","Okay. Thanks very much.","William Spence","Operator, we are coming up on the 60 minute mark here, so we will take one more question please?","Operator","Our last question is from Brian Russo of Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","Hi good morning.","William Spence","Hi.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","Just, could you update on the Colstrip Unit 4 repairs, have they been concluded, and is the unit back online?","David DeCampli","Yeah, this is David DeCampli. Colstrip Unit 4 came back online full power in late January. So it is returned to service.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","Great. Thank you.","William Spence","Okay, you're welcome.

Please note, today's event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Bergstein, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Joseph P. Bergstein - PPL Corp.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the PPL conference call on fourth quarter and year-end 2017 results as well as our general business outlook. We're providing slides with this presentation on our website at www.pplweb.com.","Any statements made in this presentation about future operating results or other future events are forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. A discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in the appendix to this presentation and in the company's SEC filings.","We will refer to earnings from ongoing operations or ongoing earnings, a non-GAAP measure for this call. For reconciliations to the GAAP measure, you should refer to the press release, which has been posted on our website and furnished to the SEC.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Spence, PPL Chairman, President and CEO.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased that you've joined us. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer, and the heads of our U.S. and UK utility businesses. From Kentucky, that includes Vic Staffieri, LG&E and KU Energy Chairman and CEO, and Paul Thompson, President and Chief Operating Officer of our Kentucky segment.","As we announced in early January, Vic will be retiring in March after 17 years at the helm of LG&E and KU and 26 years with those businesses. Paul, who joined LG&E in 1991, will succeed Vic. Vic has provided outstanding leadership to our Kentucky segment, and he's been a very valued member of PPL's senior leadership team. We appreciate his many contributions to PPL. With our strong focus on succession planning, Paul is more than ready to step into this role, and we're pleased to have him joining us on today's earnings call. Congratulations to you both.","Moving to slide 3, our agenda for this morning begins with highlights of our 2017 results and a look at 2018 and beyond in light of U.S. tax reform. I'll discuss the strength of our dividend and our commitment to dividend growth, I will also provide an update on the UK regulatory environment. Vince will then review our 2017 segment earning results and provide a more detailed financial overview of our updated financial outlook. As always, we'll leave time to answer your questions.","On slide 4, very briefly I'd like to start with the state of our business in light of U.S. tax reform. Tax reform will be beneficial to our domestic customers, as lower corporate income taxes will be reflected in rates. The credit impacts of tax reform on PPL were more than we were expecting given the enacted tax rate of 21% compared to our expectation of 25%. We've taken steps to mitigate the impact of the lower corporate tax rate on earnings and our cash flows. In short, we've added additional equity to our plan in 2018. We've increased our cash distributions from the UK, and we're utilizing the excess value in our foreign currency hedges in 2018, 2019, and 2020. We'll discuss each of these in more detail as we move through the presentation this morning.","While there have been a number of changes with respect to our business plan, there are a number of items that actually have not changed. We still expect to grow earnings per share by 5% to 6% through 2020 off of our new 2018 base year. Our updated plan reflects higher projected 2020 earnings per share compared to our previous estimate, despite the effects of tax reform. We're committed to continued dividend growth. And today, we announced a 4% increase in the dividend, consistent with our prior expectations.","We are intent on maintaining solid credit ratings as well. We maintained a significant level of capital investment that also drives our long-term value. And we strive for operational performance excellence each day, and we will deliver on our commitments to customers and share owners. The state of our business remains strong, even as we've addressed the impacts of U.S. tax reform.","Turning to slide 5, today, we announced that we achieved the high end of our 2017 ongoing earnings guidance range, or $2.25 per share. This was the eighth consecutive year that PPL exceeded the midpoint of its ongoing earnings forecasts, which highlights the operational excellence of our pure-play regulated utilities. The $0.07 improvement over the midpoint of our prior guidance of $2.18 per share was due to lower O&M expenses in the U.S. and UK and favorable weather in the U.S. during the fourth quarter.","Turning to 2018, we've updated our business plan to reflect the impacts of U.S. tax reform and our mitigation actions, and have announced our formal 2018 guidance range of $2.20 a share to $2.40 per share with a midpoint of $2.30 per share. Vince will take you through a detailed walk of 2017 actual ongoing earnings to the 2018 midpoint later during his remarks. But, in summary, despite tax reform, our 2018 midpoint is $0.05 higher than our very strong 2017 results.","Looking longer term, our objective with this updated business plan is to continue to provide 5% to 6% earnings per share growth through 2020, while improving our credit metrics. We've established the 2018 midpoint as the new baseline for the 5% to 6% growth to coincide with the effective date of tax reform. As expected, the largest adverse effect of U.S. tax reform was on our projected credit metrics, with FFO-to-debt dropping into the low 12% range over the plan period prior to any mitigation effects.","In order to support our current ratings with S&P and Moody's, we're targeting to get back to an FFO-to-debt ratio of 13% by the end of 2019. We've taken several steps laying the groundwork to achieve this goal. First, we are utilizing the excess hedge value in 2018 through 2020 to mitigate the near-term tax impact to earnings and cash flow by letting our current hedges settle in their respective years. We feel comfortable with this revised strategy, given the strength of where the pound is trading against the dollar today.","Secondly, we plan to issue about $1 billion of equity in 2018 compared to our prior guidance for equity issuances of $350 million per year. Our additional equity needs beyond 2018 will be dependent upon the performance of our businesses, foreign currency and regulatory outcomes.","Currently, we expect to issue between $500 million and $1 billion of equity in 2019 and 2020, with very minimal equity needs beyond 2020. We will work to minimize the amount of additional equity needed in 2019 and 2020.","Even at the high end of the equity range, we are confident in our ability to achieve the midpoint of our 5% to 6% earnings growth through 2020. And at the low end of the range, we would actually exceed our EPS growth of 5% to 6% guidance through 2020.","Turning to the dividend, I want to reiterate that our dividend is secure and we remain committed to dividend growth. In every quarter since 1946, we have paid a dividend to our share owners; and PPL's dividend continues to be an important piece of our overall shareowner return. This year is no exception. We announced a 4% dividend increase for 2018, with an annualized rate of $1.64 per share.","I should point out that given our yield is significantly above our peer average, we will continue to monitor this as we consider the growth rate moving forward. We believe the disconnect between our yield and that of our peers is temporary, driven by the current political and regulatory uncertainty that exists in the UK.","I want to reiterate our position on the UK regulatory model, in that it remains a premium jurisdiction. Vince and I, along with Robert Symons, recently had a very constructive meeting with the most senior members of Ofgem, the regulator in the UK. Following that meeting, we feel even more confident that WPD is well-positioned for long-term success under the RIIO regulatory framework and that the mid-period review will not be a material event for WPD or for PPL. I'll talk more about my thoughts on the UK in a few minutes.","Let's turn to slide 6, where we outline some of our significant accomplishments in 2017. In addition to our strong financial results, from an operations standpoint, we continued to invest in the future, successfully executing on $3.5 billion worth of infrastructure improvements. These investments continue to make our U.S. and UK networks smarter, more reliable, more sustainable, and more resilient.","In Pennsylvania, we installed about 600,000 advanced meters, completed significant transmission projects, including the first phase of our $160 million Greater Scranton Transmission Reliability Project, and added hundreds of additional smart grid devices to enhance distribution automation and strengthen grid resilience and reliability.","In Kentucky, we completed a 20-year, 540-mile gas main replacement project in the Louisville area and made significant progress of more than $800 million in environmental upgrades as part of a 10-year project to cap and close ash ponds at our coal-fired power plants.","In the UK, we continued to make progress on our asset replacement and fault management plants as well as advancing nearly two dozen low-carbon network projects to enable increased adoption of renewable energy resources.","As we executed these investment plans, we remain focused on continuous improvement and value for our customers. In Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities recorded its best year ever for safety, reliability, and customer satisfaction. PPL Electric Utilities also achieved the lowest OSHA recordable injury rate as well as the highest customer satisfaction rate in our company's history.","The company finished the year near the top decile of public utilities nationwide in limiting the average number of outages per customer. In 2017, our Pennsylvania customers experienced 550,000 fewer power outages than they did just 10 years ago. In Kentucky, LG&E and KU achieved the company's lowest OSHA recordable injury rate in their history, finishing among the best in a group of comparable utilities nationwide while also improving reliability for our customers. In 2017, LG&E and KU also had their best performance for customer reliability in more than a decade. Since 2010, our Kentucky Utilities have reduced both the frequency and duration of customer outages by 35% and 34% respectively.","On the generation side of the business, the utilities achieved their lowest combined annual forced outage rate since 2004, once again putting us in the top quartile of our peers forced outage metric for the year.","And in the UK, WPD remains on track to achieve its 2017-2018 performance incentive targets, which include reliability and customer satisfaction metrics, with its four distribution network operators maintaining the top four spots for customer satisfaction among all the UK DNOs. This is a testament that the capital dollars we are spending across all three of our business lines are providing real value for customers.","Also in 2017, LG&E and KU received Kentucky Public Service Commission approval for a combined rate increase of $116 million, with new rates taking effect July 1 of last year.","As we executed on our business plans in 2017, we also remain committed to transparency and sustainability. In November, PPL released a detailed scenario-based climate assessment report, examining the potential impact of climate policies on PPL consistent with a share owner request for increased disclosure. In December, we issued our completed Edison Electric Institute environmental, social, and governance reporting template. PPL was one of a number of EEI member companies that helped to develop the template to provide investors a condensed, consistent look at sustainability metrics across our sector.","In January of this year, we announced a new goal to cut the company's carbon dioxide emissions 70% from 2010 levels by the year 2050. We expect to achieve these reductions by economically replacing Kentucky coal-fired generation over time with a mix of renewables and natural gas, improving our energy efficiency, reducing substation greenhouse gas emissions, and cutting vehicle fleet emissions. We also announced our intent to respond to CDP's annual climate survey.","In summary, once again in 2017, we demonstrated strong execution across our U.S. and UK businesses as we position the company for continued growth and success.","Turning to slide 7, I want to spend a bit of time on the UK regulatory update, as political and regulatory uncertainty in the UK affected our stock price performance during the second half of 2017. We continue to believe based on Ofgem's public comments and our meeting with them earlier this month that we will have the opportunity to earn double-digit real returns in RIIO-2 as the top performer among electric DNOs in the UK.","Our meeting with Ofgem was very constructive, and I think both parties really listened to what the others had to say. Ofgem communicated to us that while they are pleased with the outputs being generated by regulated networks under RIIO-1, they believe customers are paying too much for those outputs. This was especially evident in the transmission and gas distribution businesses, where the cost of equity was set much higher than for the electric DNOs, and overall returns on regulated equity in those sectors are higher than our sector. However, even for the electric DNOs, they were expecting a much wider distribution of returns among the companies.","As a result, we believe Ofgem's goal for RIIO-2 will be to bring the overall regulatory returns down for transmission and gas distribution and force much more differentiation for electric distribution while preserving the ability for the top performers to still earn a double-digit real return on regulated equity. Therefore, as we've been saying, while we agree the sector in general will likely see lower returns, it is far too early to say that WPD will experience lower returns as the top performing DNO.","From our side, we communicated to Ofgem the concerns we have been hearing directly from our investors about the uncertainty of the UK regulation and the impact it's having on investor confidence. We are also aware that some of our investors are actively engaging with Ofgem and expressing their views and concerns to them directly. I would encourage you to continue that direct engagement and to respond to the formal consultation processes, as we have done for the mid-period review and plan to do on the RIIO-2 consultation.","As many of you know, the consultation process is underway to determine if a mid-period review for ED1 is required, with a decision expected in the spring of 2018. Ofgem notes that the MPR mechanism was intended to be very limited in scope and that they have not identified any issues that meet the original scope definition.","Given that fact, we firmly believe that an MPR with an extension of scope would ultimately lead to increased costs for customers, as regulatory uncertainty will likely drive higher equity risk premiums and higher financing costs. We have made that clear to Ofgem on behalf of our share owners and other stakeholders in our formal consultation response, and they acknowledge that they have heard the same message from many others as well. Based on everything we are aware of to date, we do not expect the MPR to have a material impact on our future results.","Regarding RIIO-ED2, we believe it's far too early to predict any outcomes, as the rules have not yet been developed by Ofgem. However, with Ofgem's statements that the best performing companies should still be able to earn double-digit returns and that they want to drive more differentiation between the best and worst performing DNOs, we believe WPD is very well positioned to succeed in that type of regulatory construct in RIIO-ED2. Ofgem expects to consult with stakeholders in early 2018 on the proposed structure for the broader RIIO-2 framework. WPD and PPL will have an opportunity to share our views with Ofgem during this phase, similar to prior price control reviews.","Finally, I would like to add that we still have five years before the next rate period takes effect, which begins in April 2023. We've been very successful in the past at navigating through new price controls and mitigating earnings impacts. As we move forward, we will work constructively with Ofgem to continue to deliver positive outcomes for customers and fair returns for our shareowners.","In addition, we will keep investors informed of the ongoing regulatory processes and provide greater visibility into UK regulation and financial results. In fact, we are providing expanded disclosures on the UK regulated segment in the business section of our 10-K that will be filed later today.","Moving to slide 8, we've updated this slide to reflect our rate base and earnings growth post-tax reform. We expect the U.S. rate base to be higher relative to our prior plan due to the lower tax rates and the elimination of bonus depreciation for regulated utilities. We now project our combined regulated rate base to grow by 6.4% through 2020, increasing to $31 billion. We continue to expect to receive near real-time recovery for about 80% of the $10 billion in infrastructure investment we plan to make during that period, which supports our 5% to 6% EPS growth.","Now, I'll turn it over Vince for a more detailed financial overview. Vince?","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone.","Let's move to slide 10 for a review of our financial results. Today, we announced fourth quarter 2017 reported earnings of $0.11 per share, compared with $0.68 per share a year ago. Full-year 2017 reported earnings were $1.64 per share, compared to $2.79 per share a year ago.","Lower reported earnings for the quarter and the year reflect a current-year non-cash loss of $321 million or $0.47 per share, due to the impact of U.S. tax reform legislation enacted in December of 2017. This loss was driven by a reduction to deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carry-forward of about $120 million, and pension and other compensation related liabilities of about $90 million, to reflect the decrease in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In addition, we established a valuation allowance of about $100 million related to foreign tax credits associated with the transition from a worldwide to a territorial approach to taxing foreign earnings.","Adjusting for special items, including the effects of tax reform, fourth quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.55 per share, compared with $0.60 per share a year ago. The $0.05 per share decrease was driven by lower earnings from the UK regulated segment of $0.11, primarily due to higher income taxes due to a benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 for the utilization of foreign tax credit and lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017. The lower UK results were partially offset by higher domestic gross margins in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky, and lower operation and maintenance expense in Pennsylvania.","Moving to the bottom table, full-year earnings from ongoing operations were $2.25 per share, placing us at the top of our 2017 ongoing earnings guidance range, compared with $2.45 per share for 2016. I'll cover the year-over-year segment earnings drivers in more detail in a moment, but first let me just highlight the impact of weather for the quarter and the year.","For the quarter, we experienced $0.01 of favorable domestic weather compared to the prior year and compared to budget, mostly from Kentucky. And for the year, domestic weather negatively impacted our results by $0.04, compared to the prior year and $0.03 compared to budget. In the UK, for the year, weather was flat compared to 2016 and favorable by $0.02 compared to budget.","Let's move to a more detailed review of the full-year segment earnings driver, starting with the Pennsylvania results on slide 11. Our Pennsylvania regulated segment earned $0.51 per share in 2017, a $0.01 increase over 2016 results. This year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher gross margins, primarily resulting from additional transmission capital investment and lower operation and maintenance expense. This was partially offset by higher depreciation due to asset additions, higher financing costs, and higher income taxes and other.","Moving to slide 12, our Kentucky regulated segment earned $0.57 per share in 2017, a $0.01 decrease from 2016. This year-over-year decline was primarily driven by higher gross margins from higher base electricity and gas rates effective July 1, 2017, of about $0.05, partially offset by lower sales volumes due to unfavorable weather of negative $0.03 and higher depreciation expense due to asset additions.","Turning to slide 13, our UK regulated segment earned $1.28 per share in 2017, a $0.21 decrease compared to the same period a year ago. The lower year-over-year results were primarily due to lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017 compared to 2016 of $0.27, which we were expecting, increased depreciation expense from asset additions, and higher financing costs due to higher interest expense on index-linked debt.","This was partially offset by: higher gross margins driven by the April 1, 2016, price increase, partially offset by lower sales volumes; lower operation and maintenance expense primarily from higher pension income; and lower income taxes, primarily due to lower UK income taxes and a 2017 U.S. tax benefit from accelerated pension contributions, partially offset by a U.S. tax benefit recorded in 2016 for the utilization of foreign tax credits.","Moving to slide 15 and a more detailed review of the impact of U.S. tax reform, as Bill mentioned, U.S. tax reform will be beneficial to our domestic customers as lower corporate income taxes will be reflected in rate. The final legislation included many of the provisions we and other electric utilities advocated for, including the preservation of interest deductibility for utilities, paid for by foregoing bonus depreciation.","However, tax reform does negatively impact earnings and credit through the lower tax yield on holding company interest expense and reduced cash flows at our domestic utilities as we pass through to customers the lower cost of federal income taxes. And since PPL is not a current federal taxpayer, we will see no immediate corporate cash benefit from the reduced tax rate.","The net result in our credit metrics was a reduction in our FFO-to-debt metrics into the low 12% range over the planning period, which pressures our current credit rating. Therefore, in response, we expect to settle the foreign currency hedges over the next few years to help mitigate near-term earnings and cash flow impact, and we now plan to increase our equity issuances in 2018.","In terms of the UK segment, tax reform shift to a territorial tax system for foreign entities is not expected to have a material impact on PPL. We were able to successfully mitigate the legislation's one-time incremental tax on accumulated foreign earnings with existing net operating losses and foreign tax credits.","In addition, the fact that U.S. parent corporations will generally no longer be subject to an incremental U.S. tax on cash repatriation, this provides us with greater flexibility long term to repatriate cash from the UK. As referred to in earlier remarks, we've increased the projected amount of cash repatriation from the UK to pre-Brexit levels of between $300 million and $500 million per year compared to our prior plan of $100 million to $200 million a year, which also results in a corresponding shift in borrowing from the U.S. to the UK segment.","While there is now greater long-term flexibility with regards to repatriation, this decision was primarily driven by the change in the U.S. tax rate and the strengthening of the pound. Overall, the impact of U.S. tax reform was a net benefit to our federal cash taxpaying status, as we don't expect to be a federal cash taxpayer now until 2022 or 2023.","Lastly, on the regulatory front, on January 29 LG&E and KU reached a settlement agreement subject to approval by the KPSC to commence returning savings related to tax reform to their customers. In Pennsylvania, the PUC requested comments regarding the impact of tax reform on customer rates last week. We are preparing our responses to this request and will wait for formal guidance from the commission. At this point, we have not received formal guidance from FERC. We will continue to work closely with the applicable regulatory bodies to appropriately reflect and incorporate the impact of federal tax reform in our rates.","Turning to a discussion of our updated plan, on slide 16 we show a walk from our 2017 actual ongoing earnings of $2.25 per share to the midpoint of our 2018 forecast prior to tax reform of $2.33 per share. We then continue the walk reflecting the impacts of tax reform and then at our current 2018 ongoing earnings forecast midpoint of $2.30 per share. In summary, our 2018 midpoint is still $0.05 per share higher than our strong 2017 results, despite the effects of tax reform.","Looking at the detailed operational drivers on the left-hand side of the slide, our UK segment is expected to deliver higher earnings of $0.08 compared to 2017, primarily resulting from a higher foreign currency exchange rate and higher pension income, primarily due to continued pension funding required by our pension trustees, partially offset by higher taxes, primarily the result of $0.11 of tax benefit recorded in 2017 that are not expected to repeat in 2018.","In Pennsylvania, we are projecting higher transmission margins, partially offset by higher depreciation due to continued capital investment.","In Kentucky, we're projecting higher margins of $0.12, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expense, higher depreciation, and higher financing costs. In terms of our Kentucky margins, the positive projection includes a full year's worth of rate case benefit along with the assumption back to normal weather. Our free tax reform plan included equity issuances of $350 million per year, which results in about $0.05 of dilution for 2018 compared to 2017.","Moving to the effects of tax reform on the right-hand side of the slide, as expected, earnings were impacted by about $0.06 from the lower tax shield on holding company interest expense. However, this was more than offset by higher earnings on a higher domestic rate base, higher foreign currency rates as we shifted our hedge strategy to let the excess hedge values flow through each year, effectively eliminating the restrike strategy that we were deploying prior to tax reform and other factors. Finally, we see about $0.05 of incremental dilution from the additional $650 million of equity relative to our prior assumption net of the benefits from lower debt financing.","Moving to slide 17, our planned capital expenditures for 2018 through 2022 are detailed on this slide, with infrastructure investment totaling $15 billion over the period. Our revised capital plan increased by about $180 million compared to the prior plan, primarily driven by an increase in Pennsylvania distribution spending to maximize reliability. This incremental distribution capital should be subject to recovery under the DSIC [Distribution System Improvement Charge] mechanism and is consistent with our most recently approved LTIP [Long-Term Incentive Plan] filing. We also slightly increased our reliability-based capital spending in 2018 through 2021 in Kentucky while shifting some of our environmental spending out to later years.","We currently project our capital investments to be slightly lower in the back end of the plan compared to current levels due to the completion of advanced metering projects in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky, which is consistent with prior capital plans. We also reflect lower transmission spend in Pennsylvania in 2021 and 2022. As we only include identified projects in our capital plan, there could be further capital spending opportunities, as we often identify projects during the execution of our plan. I'll also point out that this five-year capital plan does not include Project Compass.","And finally moving to slide 18 for a foreign currency update, post-tax reform we have updated our hedge portfolio to incorporate the lower tax rate of 21%, down from 35%. We are now 100% hedged for the remainder of 2018 at an average of a $1.34 per pound and 100% hedged for 2019 at an average rate of $1.39. And since the third quarter call, we've continued to layer on additional hedges for 2020 and are now 35% hedged at an average rate of $1.46.","To help offset the earnings and credit impacts from tax reform, we expect to let our current hedges settle in their respective years without significant additional restrikes going forward. The restrike strategy served its purpose to provide some stability and flexibility as the pound was under a lot of pressure immediately following the Brexit vote in 2016.","Looking forward and given the strength of the pound, we would expect to hedge more in line with the ranges established by our risk management framework on a rolling 36-month basis. As a reminder, we target 70% to 100% hedged in year one, 30% to 70% hedged in year two, and zero to 30% hedged in year three. As I mentioned, we've increased our budgeted rate on 2020 open positions to be more reflective of current market rates. However, this remains a conservative assumption, as the current average forward rate for 2020 is well above $1.40.","That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Thanks, Vince.","Before turning to your questions, I want to reiterate a couple things. First, we believe that we have a solid low-risk organic growth plan that we can deliver on. Delivering on this plan in fact has been our strategic focus since the spinoff of our competitive generation business, and that focus has not changed. Our attention is squarely on delivering long-term earnings growth, on strengthening our balance sheet, and on reaching a positive resolution on the mid-period review in the UK, all of which we are making progress towards.","We believe PPL continues to be a very compelling investment opportunity within our sector. The underlying fundamentals of our business are strong. Nothing we see on the horizon changes that view. We continue to project competitive earnings growth and a secure and growing dividend even post-tax reform. We continue to demonstrate an ability to mitigate challenges that affect our business, as we did with Brexit last year, and now again with U.S. tax reform. Our utilities remain among the very best in the regions they serve, and we're continuing to invest responsibly to make the grid smarter, more reliable, more resilient, and to advance a cleaner energy future. The bottom line is we will continue to deliver on our commitments to customers and share owners, and we will continue to deliver long-term value to those who invest in PPL.","With that, operator, let's open the call up for some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Today's first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, so perhaps let me just start off on the obvious questions around tax reform and FFO-to-debt. Can you elaborate a little bit more about the longer term here? So obviously you're targeting 13% here in the medium term. How do you think about that in a longer-term sense? Is this still the right range for you to think about? And then in tandem with that, can you comment a little bit about equity needs beyond just the next few years here?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Sure. So I do think that getting back to about 13% by next year is very important to maintain the current ratings that we have, which we think is important for the overall strength of the business. So we do believe that credit, FFO-to-debt metrics in particular, will continue to improve even beyond 2019.","As far as equity needs post-2020, we think they're going to be very minimal, probably just the DRIP [Dividend Reinvestment Plan] of $100 million or less per year. So in effect, we've accelerated a lot of the $350 million a year that we would have had otherwise in 2021 and 2022, so that's been pulled forward. And as we indicated, well, we're very confident that even at the high end of the equity range that we gave for 2019 and 2020, that we can still achieve the midpoint of our 5% to 6% earnings per share growth.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But 13% is \u2013 you alluded to some improvement beyond the end of 2019. How much better do you think you're getting as you look at your plan over the forecasted period?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","I'd say, it'd probably be another 100 basis points by the end of the period as we get out in time.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, and that's a more sustainable level in your mind over the long-term?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","I think certainly north of 13% would be a sustainable level that we're targeting.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then just to follow up...","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Hey, Julien, it's Vince. So, as Bill said, the credit metric will continue to improve once we get to 13% in 2019 and 2020. We think it's important to continue to show strength in the FFO-to-debt as we move towards that taxpaying status of 2022-2023 because we don't want to drop below 13% at that time and have to issue additional equity. So I think building up a little strength as we go through the next five years will certainly serve us well longer term.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right, excellent. And just perhaps following from there real quickly, as you think about the near years, you've got a 5% to 6% through 2020, but you've got a rate base CAGR that goes through the 2022 period. What are the kind of puts and takes if you're not ready to kind of roll forward your EPS CAGR in the next couple years? Obviously, you've got the dynamics in the UK, but can you talk about maybe the FX and any other kind of puts and takes there?","(39:41).","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Yeah. Sure. So FX is probably one of the key ones, and the forward curve currently for 2021 is $1.49. So clearly that's $0.09 above where we're currently projecting 2020 earnings, or based our earnings on 2020 at $1.40. So there's clearly significant upside should the forward curve continue to show that kind of strength.","In terms of other puts and takes, you mentioned the rate base growth. That will continue. I believe over the entire period it's just above 6%. That, in the 5% to 6%, range will continue beyond 2020. So that's going to be a key driver of earnings, as well as just, I would say overall cost management, cost containment, which we've done a really good job of managing over time. So I think those are a couple of the key factors.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, excellent. I'll leave it there. Best of luck.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Thank you, Julien.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, our next question today comes from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you, good morning.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Good morning.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","First question, the extra $650 million of equity that you're planning for this year, will that be covered from internal program like DRIP, ATM, or would that require some kind of block issuance? What's the thought there?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Our thought is the DRIP and ATM would be probably the most efficient. And we think that given the incremental $650 million is not that significant, overall, we could issue probably much more than $1 billion overall for the year under the ATM and DRIP programs. So we think it's very doable. And as always, we'll look at other means and use the most efficient means, but ATM is the most likely mechanism.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I see. And then, Bill, you made this point in your slide. This is the eighth consecutive year where you've actually exceeded the midpoint of your guidance. Should we assume, given that track record and trend, that there is a healthy dose of conservatism built into your 2018 guidance?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Well, I think certainly we have had a track record that's been very positive of delivering above our midpoint of our earnings guidance. I think we put together what we believe are very solid business plans. They have proven to be conservative I guess in the past, if you look back at the track record. But one of the reasons we gave you a range for the equity issuances for 2019 and 2020 of $500 million to $1 billion was the fact that we have delivered in excess of the midpoint.","So taking that into account, as well as some of the other moving parts, for example, we don't have the regulatory outcomes yet in Pennsylvania nor at FERC, we think that there is some upside there; not only just been delivering, but that $500 million is probably achievable in terms of the equity in 2019 and 2020 if things fall in place as they could. So again, kind of being conservative. We wanted to point out that even at the very high end, the $1 billion of equity in each of the three years, we can still meet the midpoint of the 5% to 6%. And if we can lower the equity raise, then we're going to be above that range.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then lastly, just clarifying your comments (43:32) so you laid out your 2020-2022 CapEx plan which equate to a 5.4% CAGR on rate base, per your math. And as you point out, the forward exchange rates are much higher today than the $1.40 that you're budgeting. So given conditions as they are today, is it fair to say that that 5% to 6% should be sustainable through 2022 given what we know today?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Given what we know today and the forward curve at $1.49, we could maintain the 5% to 6%, yes. But we're not issuing formal guidance right now. But with those assumptions that you outlined, that would be achievable, correct.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","You're welcome.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Good morning, Jonathan.","<: Just one question. Can you give us a little sense of what your most likely option for executing on the equity is?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Sure, I think it would be the combination of ATM and DRIP. And we think that that's very doable in the current environment. And particularly as we get beyond the mid-period review and some of the initial RIIO-2 framework, we think we'll see some strength in the stock and some of the uncertainty removed. And so I think ATM for now is our assumption and probably a pretty good one from our perspective.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And the DRIP I think you said is about $100 million?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","That's correct.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then I had a question on the walk from 2017 to 2018 that was on slide 16.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Yes.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I'm sure this is obvious, and I apologize for the question if so. But why is it that Kentucky, the impact of tax reform on Kentucky is negative, but that on Pennsylvania is positive?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Vince, do you want to?","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Sure. So, Jonathan, Kentucky has holding company debt as well, where PA has none. So they in addition to cap funding are losing the tax shield on going from 35% to 21% on their holding company debt.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","But that's encompassed within the number you've given for overall holding company debt impact, but it's just in that segment. Is that correct?","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","It's in the $0.06 that I talked about on that first bucket for the lower tax shield on HoldCo interest. It's in that $0.06 that's cap funding MLP.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, so it's a segment allocation thing. Okay. I think that's \u2013 and then I just have one other question. On the 13% you're talking about around FFO-to-debt, is that the threshold that you currently have, or is that where you feel you need to be to be comfortable? I just want to be clear whether \u2013 because I guess we didn't see you guys put on negative outlook, so we don't have a clearer sense of exactly where your threshold might be.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","So the threshold previously as indicated by Moody's was 12% to 15% FFO-to-debt. With tax reform, we would be skating at the bottom of that range, and we felt that was probably not the best place to be. And in conversations with the rating agencies, we felt that it was probably most prudent to add some more equity into the plan. And given we had the hedge value that we could utilize to maintain our EPS growth rates, we felt that that was the best way to do it.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Perfect.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Jonathan, that is one of the open items as we think about the $500 million to $1 billion for 2019 and 2020. We've had initial discussions with the agencies, but I would not say we've had fulsome discussions in detail with either of them, and so we need to do that. And so ultimately, we'll flesh out where that ultimately needs to be to maintain our credit ratings with both agencies. But at this point we're assuming 13% will be a comfortable area.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thank you. Just to be sure I fully understood you on equity, we're saying in 2019 and 2020 it's at least $500 million each year, but it could be up to $1 billion each year.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","That's correct.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","It is. But if we're at the $500 million, that will simply be pulling forward 2021 and 2022 because we're going from $350 million to basically less than $100 million in those years.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","You're welcome.","Operator","Today's next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys, just a bigger picture question. Given a few factors, meaning tax reform in the U.S., higher interest rates overall, how do you think those two things change your competitive positioning relative to other U.S. and European utilities? And how does that trickle into your view of whether further consolidation on either continent is both value-added and worthwhile?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Let me try to \u2013 let me take the last part of your question first, Michael. On the M&A front, I don't really think that tax reform overall is going to have a significant effect within our sector, whether that's in the EU or here in the U.S. I think the one effect it could have is it does remove the uncertainty about what tax reform might have been. So from that perspective, it might create some more opportunity for some. But I don't think the fundamentals of the business overall have changed much because everyone is pretty much on the same level playing field.","Now having said that, for PPL specifically, because 50% of our business is in the UK and 50% is here, as interest rates rise in the U.S., we've got somewhat of a hedge against rising interest rates here vis-\u00e0-vis the UK. So to the extent that the UK interest rates remain much lower than they are here in the U.S., that could be a positive to the stock.","And I think overall, we don't see a whole lot of change from the PPL perspective and our view of M&A. So what we've said in the past is that we can be successful with the organic growth plan that we have. We don't need M&A to be successful. I think we've been pretty transparent that as we think about M&A, our objective has been to strengthen our EPS growth rate and credit metrics if we were to engage in M&A. Said another way, I'm unaware of any transaction that would meet these objectives today. Our focus is clearly on delivering long-term earnings growth, which we can do organically.","I'd also mention that currently we think our stock is undervalued, and we believe that transaction multiples are currently \u2013 continue to be pretty excessive and would not allow us to achieve our objectives in any M&A kind of scenario.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.

Spence - PPL Corp.","Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for today's call. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer, as well as the presidents of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses.","Starting with slide 2, our agenda this morning includes an overview of our 2016 earnings results along with an operational update. Following that, I'm going to address our 2017 earnings forecast and review our projections for long-term earnings growth. Following my remarks, Vince will review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial overview.","Before I get started, I did want to highlight a few key points of our presentation this morning. We've delivered strong 2016 ongoing earnings, achieving 11% year-over-year growth. We've also raised our dividend by 4% in 2017, with our continued commitment to grow that by 4% annually through 2020.","We've also taken steps to further de-risk our 2017 through 2020 plan by significantly reducing our foreign currency risk and reducing our load growth forecast from 0.5% to no load growth. Finally, we also believe we are well positioned to manage the potential impacts of tax reform.","Turning to slide 3, today, we announced 2016 reported earnings of $2.79 per share compared with $1.01 per share in 2015. Adjusting for special items, our 2016 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.45 per share, up 11% from 2015 results which puts us at the high end of our forecast range.","For the fourth quarter of 2016, reported earnings were $0.68 per share compared with $0.59 per share a year ago. Earnings per share from ongoing operations were $0.60 in the fourth quarter compared to $0.43 a year ago. The key drivers of the 11% growth were strong performance across the regulated businesses and a positive tax adjustment of $0.05 per share related to the expected utilization of foreign tax credits.","2016 marks seventh consecutive year that PPL has exceeded the midpoint of its ongoing earnings forecast. As our track record shows, we take great pride in delivering on the commitments we make to our shareowners.","Turning to slide 4, backed by the continued strong performance of our utilities, today we announced we're increasing our common stock dividend on an annualized basis from $1.52 per share to $1.58 per share or a 4% increase. The quarterly dividend of $0.395 per share will be payable April 1 (sic) [April 3] to shareowners of record as of March 10. This marks PPL's 15th dividend increase in the last 16 years.","Let's move to slide 5 for an update on our utility operations. In Kentucky, our rate review continues to proceed as expected before the Kentucky Public Service Commission. This comes after our Kentucky Utilities filed a request in late November of last year to increase revenue by a combined $210 million. That includes revenue increases of $103 million and $93 million respectively at Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Gas and Electric, through adjustments to annual base electricity rates.","In addition, it includes a revenue increase of $14 million for LG&E through an adjustment to annual base rates \u2013 gas base rates. The requested increases are driven by additional capital investments to make the grid smarter, more reliable and more resilient. We've included a schedule for the rate review process in the Appendix to today's slides. If approved by the commission, the increases would take effect on July 1, 2017.","The company's continuation of the customer experience initiative has resulted in another J.D. Power award in Kentucky. LG&E and KU ranked first and second among mid-sized utilities in the Midwest region in 2016 Calendar-Year Electric Utility Business Customer Service Satisfaction Study. This brings the total number of J.D. Power awards earned by PPL subsidiaries to 42.","In Pennsylvania, we remain focused on transmission and distribution system improvements, with an eye towards reliability and resiliency. We continued to make substantial progress in these areas in 2016. As a result of the investments we've made, PPL Electric Utilities today has one of the most robust and advanced distribution automation systems in the country.","That system, which was bolstered by the addition of more than 700 smart grid devices last year, avoided more than 100,000 customer interruptions throughout the year. And as a result of investments we've made to modernize and expand our transmission system, sustained transmission outages have dropped by nearly 75% over the last five years. PPL Electric Utilities reliability performance is among the nation's best. We're intent on keeping it that way, as we execute our plans for 2017 and beyond.","In the UK, we received the final RIIO-ED1 results for the 2015-2016 regulatory year, achieving the highest incentive revenues among the UK's distribution network operators. End customers have rated us the best electricity network in the UK, with an average customer satisfaction rating of 89%. Meanwhile, we remain on pace to achieve our projected performance against the 2016-2017 regulatory year incentive targets. Details on our projected 2016-2017 incentive revenues is included in the Appendix on pages 24 and 25.","Turning to slide 6, we are reaffirming our 2017 earnings forecast of $2.05 to $2.25 per share with a midpoint of $2.15.","Moving to slide 7, we show a walk of the drivers from our 2016 ongoing earnings of $2.45 per share to the $2.15 per share midpoint of our 2017 earnings forecast. I should point out that included in our 2017 forecast is $0.05 of hedge restrikes that move value from 2017 to 2019. Without the restrikes, our EPS forecast would have been $2.20 per share.","Our 2017 guidance is lower than 2016 earnings, primarily from a lower foreign currency hedged exchange rate, dilution from issuing additional equity of $250 million per year, and tax benefits recorded in 2016 that are not expected to repeat in 2017. We've increased our equity issuances in the plan from $100 million to $350 million per year, to support the funding of incremental capital spending and to continue to strengthen the balance sheet. This will help us maintain strong credit metrics and also lowers future holding company debt balances, which reduces the potential impact of tax reform, as we'll discuss in a moment.","Moving to slide 8, PPL continues to invest responsibly in the future. It's that investment, coupled with timely rate recovery in the constructive jurisdictions we operate in, that's driving our 5% to 6% earnings per share growth. Our capital plan of about $3 billion per year is expected to produce compound annual rate base growth of 5.3% from 2017 through 2020, with our rate base growing to $29 billion.","We expect to receive near real-time recovery for about 80% of the $13 billion infrastructure investment we expect to make during that time. As you can see, our core business is growing in support of our longer-term growth objectives.","Slide 9 highlights the key drivers and assumptions in our business plan. As mentioned earlier, that plan assumes $350 million per year in equity issuances and targets additional dividend growth of about 4% annually through 2020. We expect 4% to 6% growth in our domestic utilities from 2017 through 2020. This reflects several things: higher gross margins from additional capital investments in Kentucky; increased transmission spending in Pennsylvania, partially offset by higher depreciation and interest; and the dilution from the equity issuances I just mentioned.","Domestic net income is expected to grow 5% to 7% over the forecast period. Meanwhile, we're expecting UK earnings growth of 6% to 8%, reflecting the hedges we've put in place and our ability to achieve our $1.30 per pound budgeted rate through 2020. In addition to effects of currency, the growth in our UK segment is driven by higher gross margins, driven by annual price increases and higher pension income due to higher returns on higher pension asset balances, which more than offsets the effects of any dilution.","We continue managing our currency risk proactively, taking steps to improve the risk reward profile and the certainty we will achieve our growth objectives. We can meet 5% EPS growth through 2020, even if the pound drops to $1.13 per pound, and we can meet that growth through 2019 at $0.90 per pound. This is a very significant improvement in our risk reward profile.","Vince will provide a detailed update on our foreign currency hedging in his remarks. We're expecting net income for the UK segment to now grow in the 8% to 10% range for the forecast period. Overall, we feel very confident in our ability to deliver on our projected 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth from 2017 through 2020. Further, we expect to achieve a very competitive total annual share on the return of 9% to 10%, as we execute our plans for growth.","Let's turn to slide 10. We know the investment community has a keen interest in the topic of U.S. tax reform, including how any changes may impact PPL and other utilities. For PPL, the two primary effects we're tracking are the deductibility of interest expense on our domestic holding company debt and the net effect on rate base at our utilities from the extension of 100% bonus depreciation, offset of course by our tax rate.","I want to highlight two very important points that differentiates PPL from its peers. First, since about half of our business resides in the UK, we have minimal exposure to tax reform for half of our earnings. Second, we have the flexibility to raise capital in the UK, thereby retaining the ability to deduct interest.","We support efforts to simplify the U.S. tax code and to lower the federal corporate tax rate to a level that is more competitive globally. But speculating on the impact of tax reform is extremely difficult, given the lack of detail on current proposals that have been set forth today. Our industry has a good track record of working with policy makers to shape meaningful tax-related legislation that minimizes negative impacts to our customers and to our companies. This was true during the last comprehensive tax reform in 1986, as well as during the debate on \u2013 later on taxes related to dividends and capital gains.","Our base assumption is that any benefits from the reduction of the tax rate will be passed through to our customers. Therefore, the only real impact on our utilities is the impact on rate base. As we think about tax reform, it's important to keep in mind that we have several opportunities, in PPL's case, to offset potential impacts. We can use the dry powder created by our hedging strategy, we could shift some of holding company debt financings to the UK, and we have the ability to increase capital spending.","Of course, the details of any tax reform plan are very hard to predict at this point. But to help frame this up for PPL, I wanted to address a few possible scenarios. First, as it relates to rate base at our domestic utilities, if we're required to adapt 100% expensing of capital, our breakeven tax rate for rate base would be about 20%.","Regarding deductibility of interest, if the tax rate is reduced to 20% and we retain the ability to deduct interest to expense on all debt or if non-deductibility of interest is only applied to new debt, we would see about a $0.05 per share impact to earnings which we believe we can fully mitigate with the strategies I just talked about.","If non-deductibility of interest applies to all existing debt, we would see about a $0.10 per share impact to earnings, which we also believe we can largely mitigate through these strategies, especially if the pound stays around $1.20 or above as it is today. I'm confident that U.S. tax reform, as it's currently being discussed, is a manageable event for PPL and not a barrier in our ability to meet our stated goal of growing EPS by 5% to 6% through 2020.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Vince, for a more detailed look at our earnings. Vince?","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to slide 12, for a review of segment earnings. Full year 2016 earnings from ongoing operations increased over the prior year, from 2015 earnings of $2.21 per share to $2.45 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our 2016 earnings guidance by $0.07, placing us at the high end of the forecast range.","Each of our operating segments delivered strong growth compared to the prior year. The Pennsylvania Regulated segment contributed $0.13 of growth for the year, the Kentucky Regulated segment contributed $0.07, and the UK Regulated segment contributed $0.05. Corporate and Other remained relatively flat compared to the prior year.","Before I get into the segment details, let's briefly discuss the impact weather had on our results for the full year. Weather really did not have a significant impact on our 2016 earnings performance, as it was flat compared to 2015 and it was $0.01 worse than budget.","Let's move to a more detailed review of the 2016 segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on slide 13. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.50 per share in 2016, a $0.13 increase compared to 2015. This increase was due to higher gross margins as a result of higher distribution base electricity rates effective January 1, 2016, and higher transmission margins from additional capital investments. Higher margins were partially offset by higher depreciation due to asset additions.","Moving to slide 14, our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.58 per share in 2016, a $0.07 increase from 2015. This increase was due to higher gross margins, which is the net effect of electricity and gas base rate increases effective July 1, 2015, and returns on additional environmental capital investments, and lower operation and maintenance expense including the reduction of costs associated with the 2015 coal plant retirement. These net positive results were partially offset by higher financing costs related to the September 2015 debt issuances.","Moving to slide 15, our UK Regulated segment earned $1.49 per share in 2016, a $0.05 improvement compared to 2015. Positive factors driving earnings results include higher gross margins, primarily driven by an April 1, 2016 price increase, partially offset by four months of lower prices from the April 1, 2015 price decrease, a decrease in O&M primarily from lower pension expense and lower U.S. income taxes primarily from the benefit recorded in Q4 2016 for the expected utilization of foreign tax credit, resulting from our updated business plan.","These positive factors were partially offset by increased depreciation expense from asset additions, higher financing costs due to 2015 debt issuances, and lower average exchange rates in 2016 compared to 2015. The average rate for 2016 was $1.45 per pound compared to $1.57 per pound for 2015.","Moving to slide 16, we've updated our hedging disclosures and made great progress in de-risking our plan related to foreign currency exposure. The chart at the top of the page highlights our contractual hedge level. And as you can see, we started to layer in hedges for 2019 with 50% already hedged.","As Bill mentioned, embedded in the midpoint of our 2017 earnings forecast of $2.15 per share, is about $0.05 of hedge restrikes. We achieved 50% hedge level for 2019 as of today by executing four of the $0.05 of planned restrikes, as well as entering into forward contracts for 2019, at rates that were near our budgeted rate of $1.30.","As you can see on the slide, the average rate for the 2019 hedges is $1.34 per pound compared to our budgeted rate of $1.30. It's important to note that we achieved this 50% hedge level above our budgeted rate without reducing the hedge levels for 2018. 2018 is still hedged at an average rate of $1.42 per pound, well above our budgeted rate, enabling us to still restrike value from 2018 into 2019 and 2020.","To the strength of our business plan and with the hedges in place for half of 2019, we continue to de-risk 2019 and 2020 as illustrated in the lower table. This table lays out our ability to hedge 2017 through 2020 at various GBP rates to maintain at least the low end of our earnings growth range of 5% to 6%.","Effectively, we have no exposure through 2019. The pound could fall as low as $0.90 per pound, and we could still achieve a 5% EPS growth rate through 2019; and at $1.13 per pound, we can achieve that growth through 2020. The additional hedging we have done significantly mitigates our foreign currency exposure related to our UK operations, and we believe we have skewed that exposure to the upside with the actions we've taken to-date.","I should also note that tax reform will likely improve this picture even further, since we gross up our hedges to cover the current 35% tax rate. If the tax rate is lowered to 20%, we would be 100% hedged for 2018 and about 70% hedged for 2019. Also, the sensitivities in the bottom table would improve for 2020 as well, with the breakeven rate going from $1.13 per pound down to $1.07.","Moving to slide 17, our planned capital expenditures for 2017 through 2021 are detailed on this slide, with infrastructure investment totaling $16 billion over the period. We continue to invest about $1 billion annually in each of our business lines, which includes our previously-announced initiatives, as well as $1 billion of incremental capital identified for 2017 through 2020 compared to the prior plan.","As Bill mentioned earlier, our investments focus on delivering a sustainable energy future by expanding and modernizing the grid, adding smart grid technology and automation, and strengthening physical and cyber security. We are also connecting more renewable energy and expanding solar offerings to our customers.","In Kentucky, we are investing an additional $525 million over the next four years, despite lower environmental spending of $345 million due to updated scope and timing changes for ELGs and CCR projects. This additional capital includes $320 million to install advanced meters and $550 million to improve the reliability of electric and gas infrastructure in Kentucky.","In Pennsylvania, we are investing an additional $310 million in transmission, driven primarily by increased or accelerated project activity, such as line rebuilds, new substations and security. Distribution spending levels in Pennsylvania remain relatively flat. We currently project our capital investment to decrease slightly in the outer years, as our advanced metering projects are completed in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky and our environmental spend in Kentucky ramps down.","Consistent with last year's plan, our capital plan is based on identified projects only across the portfolio, and it does not include unidentified growth projects. However, we continually find new capital projects in support of reliability, safety and security. We have a robust pipeline of capital projects. And I believe, as we continue to work on the system and develop our future plans including responding to tax reform, we will identify additional capital spend for the back end of the plan.","Moving to slide 18, here we're providing an update to our view of domestic cash flows, reflecting 2016 actual results and providing the 2017 projection. 2016's excess cash position of $702 million includes the $310 million of net proceeds received last year from the monetization of the 2017 and 2018 earnings hedges following the Brexit referendum. Cash available for distribution is expected to be lower in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to lower cash inflows from our currency hedges, higher domestic maintenance capital as we continue to invest in the utilities, and the lower dividend coming from the UK. Overall, though, we still expect cash available for distribution to be either breakeven or positive over the forecast period, even assuming the dividend grows at 4% per year.","And finally, turning to slide 19, we show our updated RPI forecast assumptions using the January 2017 HM Treasury forecast of the UK economy. Our business plan assumptions are in line with these current RPI forecasts. Our sensitivity for a 0.5% movement in 2016-2017 RPI, now results in a $0.01 impact out in 2019. As a reminder, this past November, we set our 2018-2019 tariffs based on the forecasted RPI at that time and that is consistent with Ofgem's guidance.","That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call over to Bill for the Q&A. Bill?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Thank you, Vince. 2016 was a very good year and I'm proud of PPL's many accomplishments in 2016. And I'm equally excited about our future, as we continue and advance a smarter, cleaner, and more reliable energy infrastructure. At the outset of the year, we established our earnings forecast. In the end, we delivered, achieving the high end of that forecast range.","As 2016 began, we said we would begin to grow our dividend more meaningfully in 2017. Today, we have delivered, announcing a 4% dividend increase. We established also a plan to invest more than $3 billion in infrastructure improvements in 2016. Again, we delivered. It's what we do, we deliver. And looking ahead, we are very well-positioned to continue to deliver on the commitments we've made to our shareowners and customers.","PPL is uniquely advantaged with operations in the UK, with only half of our earnings subject to potential U.S. tax reform, and our ability to optimize the capital structure relative to interest deductibility. And as Vince noted in his remarks, we believed we are now positively positioned with the company's exposure to the British pound, given our hedging activity to-date which could also be used to mitigate any potential negative impacts of U.S. tax reform.","On that note, I want to thank you for participating in today's call. And operator, let's open the call for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The first question comes from Greg Gordon at Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Hey, good morning, guys. Fantastic quarter.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Good morning, Greg.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Thank you so much.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Yeah. Congratulations. A few questions and I'm going to admit, some of the stuff may have gone over my head a little bit, so I may be asking you to repeat yourselves. But first on the \u2013 when I look at the earnings from operations for the year, obviously the biggest positive delta was in the UK, but you only increased your 2017 earnings guidance expectation by $0.01.","And I'm just wondering how much of the beat in 2016 was truly sort of just structurally improving on the base of earnings versus somewhat non-recurring? And are you being a bit conservative at the midpoint on the UK earnings for 2017?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Sure. I'll ask Vince to comment, but just one point to note is what the increase in our equity issuance is that obviously is going to create some dilution which has a ripple effect across all the businesses of course. So, that's one driver. But Vince, do you want to take care of the other drivers?","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Yeah. So I think the big holdback in 2017 is putting the restrikes into the plan. And so, we put a nickel of restrikes in the plan to basically continue to de-risk. And as I said, four of the $0.05 we've already executed on that.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. I get it. I get it. So between a little equity dilution and restriking...","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Yeah.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","...those are two of the big components. Okay.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Those are the biggest.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Yeah.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. And then, when we look at the current hedge profile, what you basically said, if I go to page 16 is that, if the U.S. federal income tax rate went to 20%, your breakeven would go up, but it's still significantly lower than where the pound is trailing?","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Do you want to take that?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Yeah. Sure. Go ahead, Vince.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","No. So if the tax rate goes from 35% to 20%, the $1.13 which is our breakeven to get to a 100% hedged through 2020 on the slide, that would go to $1.07.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Oh, it goes the other way. See, I told you. That's why I wanted to ask. And then...","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Just to clarify because I know we kind of went through that quickly, but the reason for that is the hedge levels would go up in the top part. So, the 87% goes to 100% and the 50% and 19% goes to 70%.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","So, we basically need \u2013 we need less dry powder to get the results we were getting in the plan.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Next question. I do understand that you have flexibility on where you can finance, you can issue debt in the UK, you can issue debt in the U.S., and that's obviously on a going-forward basis an advantage if deductibility changes. But if the federal income tax rate goes from 35% to 20%, the tax yield on your current leverage would go down and that would be an earnings drag, then that's just algebra. So, is there some way that you could also just sort of retire debt in the U.S. and issue debt in the UK in order to limit that negative arbitrage or not?","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Potentially, I mean, at 20% we're basically the same rate as in the UK as well, and that's $0.05 that Bill talked about. So the impact of maintaining deductibility, but going from 35% to 20% at $0.15 loss in tax yield is basically a nickel and we think we can manage that with the strategies Bill talked about.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Greg.","Operator","The next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith at UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good morning.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Good morning, Julien.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, so maybe let me start right where Greg left off here. So can you discuss a little bit on repatriation strategy? Obviously, you guys have been talking about bringing that down a little bit in last quarters. How do you think about repatriation changing your strategies, you've talked up to $0.5 billion at times? Would you expect to make use of that if there were to be a holiday or maybe comment on that first?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Sure. I'll ask Vince to take that question.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Sure. So, a tax holiday really benefits those U.S. companies that are sitting on a pile of cash offshore. That's not our situation. As you know, we invest our cash into the business. And so, really the financing of the capital structure in the UK is what enables us to fuel that growth in the UK and then distribute some cash back to the U.S.","I wouldn't see us necessarily modifying that, but once the final rules come out for U.S. tax reform, we'll look at what the best economic answer is overall for the corporation, and then determine really where we want to finance. We still have the ability to increase our financing in the UK and dividend more than, say, the 100% to 200% (32:04) that we have in the plan tax free. And so, we would certainly have the ability to do that, but really until the rules come out, I can't tell you how we're going to modify that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And then maybe little bit of a higher level question vis-\u00e0-vis sort of appropriate capital structure. How do you think about, should this tax reform take place, your debt pay down strategy, e.g., your kind of optimal capital, would you expect to target to pay down more or just kind of higher level observation, maybe frame it in the context in that further debt targets, would that shift around?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","I don't think our strategy would change much even in the face of tax reform. I think the capital deployment might get a little bit higher, again, depending on how the 100% expensing goes. But I think overall, the capital structure and the credit metrics that we currently are targeting would still be pretty much the same.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Yeah, Julien, I...","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Just to add to that, I think the $350 million that we put in the plan gives us some nice risk mitigant against any credit actions or credit impacts of tax reform. So I think that level that we have in the new plan should be sufficient under tax reform or not.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And just to clarify, the acceleration of CapEx under tax reform, what would that principally be if you could comment on that, distribution in Kentucky?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Would be probably more Pennsylvania distribution than Kentucky.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Excellent. Thank you, guys.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Steve Fleishman at Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","So, couple questions. Just on the UK pound, so the $1.13 now through 2020 for the kind of protection as to the 5%, the bottom of your range. I assume to get to the middle of your range, it would be maybe somewhere in the high $1.10s like or $1.20. Is it still like $0.01 per $0.01? Yeah.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Yeah. Yeah. Still roughly $0.01 for $0.01.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","So yeah, that's still probably \u2013 it would clearly be well below where the pound is today.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","All right.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Yeah. So probably in the upper teens.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Yeah. So Steve, it's about $1.20, $1.21 to hit 6%. So it's in the middle there for midpoint.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. And then just on, god forbid, anyone ever thinks about the pound going up, could you just remind us environment where it goes above $1.30? Obviously, you'll do better on your open positions than you're assuming. But just in thinking of the company as a whole, like, are your hedging kind of locked in or do you have room on your hedges to actually capture some of a higher pound?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Yeah. So, there is room on some of the hedges. The more recent hedges we put on are straight swaps, so there's less flexibility there. But obviously, with the open position for the remainder of 2019 and 2020 now, that would be upside and then, of course, longer term as we see how Brexit turns out. And hopefully, with the rising pound, we have the ability to lock in 2020 and beyond at higher than $1.30. I think we've talked on previous calls, the 20-year average prior to Brexit was above $1.50, so closer to $1.60. So, there's room to grow there and certainly exposure to the upside for us.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then the lower growth rate at the U.S. obviously is the dilution. The higher growth rate in the UK, you're offsetting the dilution with what?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Go ahead, Vince.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Sure. Yeah. So, I think it was third quarter we talked about the property taxes coming way down from what we were originally expecting. We did not take credit for that, as you recall, on the third quarter because we wanted to wait till the plan was completed. And so, there's really three main items that are driving the dry powder that we created to get to these much lower rates that you're seeing on slide 16. It's the property taxes. Pensions actually came in better than we were projecting.","If you recall back on the second quarter call when we rebased the earnings post-Brexit, we took a very conservative approach on pension, so they came in stronger than we expected. And then, through income tax planning, we're also seeing some improvement there. And so, that created about $0.10 in total of earnings. Half of that went to increasing the growth rate of the UK and half of it went to create the dry powder that you're seeing on slide 16.","So, maybe just to append to your earlier question on what happens if the pound goes up, well, if we don't need all that dry powder, I would suspect earnings would be up $0.05 a year going through the period.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. One last thing, any thoughts on Compass with respect to the Indian Point closure, and how that could potentially play into being one of the ways to solve that?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Sure. I'll ask Greg Dudkin, President of our Pennsylvania Utility, to answer that question. Greg?","Gregory N. Dudkin - PPL Electric Utilities Corporation","Yeah. Thanks, Bill. So, we actually are involved in something called CARA (38:05) study, which is a study that is done with the New York ISO to really determine the value of the project. So, our study was slowed down a little bit because of the Indian Point closure. Our expectation is that that will be a positive for Compass. We expect that this CARA (38:24) study will be done in March, so we'll know the final results of that then.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","The next question is from Jonathan Arnold at Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Could I just ask on the $0.05 and $0.10 numbers that you gave on tax, were they additive or is it $0.05 if you keep deductibility on past interest and $0.10 if you lose it or is it...","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Got you, yeah.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Correct, they are not additive. They're discrete numbers. So, it's...","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Incremental $0.05.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","...incremental $0.05. So, it would be max $0.10.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","You're welcome.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then the second thing, can you give us a little more color on the reduction in the Kentucky environmental spend? What is it that you aren't going to be doing? Is it just a little less under certain rules, or are you assuming some things aren't required?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Sure. I'll ask Vic Staffieri, the President and Chairman of our Kentucky Utilities, to answer that one.","Victor A. Staffieri - Kentucky Utilities Co.","I think it's a couple of things, Jonathan. The first is that now we've got into some more detailed engineering and we've been able to save some money for our consumers. We've gotten some indicative bids that has helped us. And as we've done it again, additional engineering, we've found other ways that are more cost-effective for our customers. So, the rules haven't changed. The course of our compliance has changed, and actually that benefits our consumers.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then maybe, I could, just one other thing on the incremental spend that you've put in that's \u2013 how much of that is approved and what's the mechanism for getting it approved?","Victor A. Staffieri - Kentucky Utilities Co.","For the most part, those are in our rate case right now. The additional capital runs over a long period of time and we're in the process of seeking commission authority (40:30) right now in our rate case. That's within our testimony today.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Ridzon at KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Good morning, Paul.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","You had a big O&M cut over in the UK, how sustainable is that going into 2017 and beyond? Will that stop gap or is that \u2013 reliability would be a risk if you kept at that level?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Sure. I don't think reliability would be at risk at all, but I'll let Robert Symons, the CEO of our UK operation answer that question.","Robert A. Symons - PPL UK Distribution Holdings Ltd.","I don't think it will have any effect on reliability. From my point of view, we've put in about 2,000 separate schemes (41:20), improving reliability over the last 12 months and we'll continue to do so.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So, do you think 2017 could be flat O&M in the UK?","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Relative to 2016?","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yes, sorry.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Paul, unfortunately I don't have that detail in front of us. I mean, part of what's contributing to 2016 is lower pension from the methodology change that we enacted late in, I guess 2015 going into 2016. And so that in addition to just higher returns, we earned on average about 15% returns last year in the UK on our pension assets, which that carrying forward helps. And so, not reliability driven at all, it's more related to pension and it is sustainable.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So, what percentage is pension versus rentals.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","That's a good question. I'm not sure that we have that right off the top of our heads. So, we'll have to follow up with you on that. Sorry.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Sounds good. Thank you very much.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Okay. You're welcome.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Patterson at Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Good morning.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just one question left for me. You guys mentioned the ability to issue debt in the UK versus the U.S. as a way of dealing with the potential tax changes. What is the sort of the \u2013 quantifiably, how much could be done there if, in fact, it was advantageous to do that?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Sure. So I'll start and I'll let Vince follow up. But as you may recall, with the UK holding company we can lever up to 85% and still maintain investment grade credit ratings. So that's the kind of upper limit. We're right now in the kind of mid-to-upper 70%, so we have that level of headroom to go up to 85%. So, I don't know if you had any other comments, Vince.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Yeah. So that's worth over $1 billion by time we get through the end of the plan period. In terms of \u2013 I think we hang at around 80% and we could go up to 85%. So, by time we get out to 2020, again, that's worth about $1 billion-plus. I would say, as we kind of look at tax reform, we have to see how much on any annual basis we could shift it. I would think at least $150 million would be no problem and it could probably go back up to $400 million that we had originally. But again, that's all going to depend on how those final rules come out, but somewhere in that range, I would say.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. That's all I have left. Thanks a lot.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Great. Thank you, Paul.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Chan at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Brian L.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Andy Ludwig, Vice President of Investor Relations, Please go ahead sir.","Andy Ludwig","Thank you, Rocco. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining the PPL conference call of fourth quarter and full year 2019 financial results.","We provided slides for this presentation. And our earnings release issued this morning on the Investors section of our website. Our presentation and earnings release, which we'll discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements about future operating results or other future events, actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the appendix of this presentation and PPL's SEC filings for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements.","We will also refer to earnings from ongoing operations or ongoing earnings a non-GAAP measure on this call. For reconciliations to the GAAP measure, you should refer to the appendix of this presentation and our earnings release.","I'll now turn the call over to Bill Spence PPL Chairman and CEO.","Bill Spence","Thank you, Andy, and good morning everyone. We are pleased that you joined us for our 2019 year-end earnings call.","With me today are Vince Sorgi, PPL, President and Chief Operating Officer and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer.","Moving to Slide 3, our agenda this morning begins with an overview of 2019 results and PPL's business outlook for 2020. Vince will then review some of PPL's recent operational highlights and outlook for 2020 as well as discuss PPL's clean energy transition strategy including our decision to set a more aggressive goal to reduce PPL's carbon emission.","Following Vince's remarks, Joe will provide a more detailed financial review of 2019 and 2020 along with our updated earnings forecast for 2021. I'll conclude by taking a few moments to highlight what has truly been a decade of transformation and growth for PPL. And PPL is marking its 100th anniversary thanks to our employees hard work and dedication and the unparalleled support of our communities. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions.","Turning to Slide 4, in 2019 PPL continued to deliver on its commitments to the share owners, customers, and the communities we serve. We remain steadfast in our strategy to deliver best in sector operational performance, invest in a sustainable energy future, provide superior customer service, maintain a strong financial foundation and engage and develop our people.","Our results in 2019 reflect this strategy. We exceeded the midpoint of our earnings guidance for the 10th straight year delivering on growing earnings of $2.45 per share. We remained committed to dividend growth, increasing our dividend for the 17th time in 18 years and returning more than 1 billion in dividends to share owners.","As we delivered on these financial commitments, we continue to extend our track record of operational excellence. We maintain strong transmission and distribution reliability across all of our utilities. In addition, we achieve top decile generation reliability in Kentucky. At the same time, we remain as focused as ever on providing superior customer service.","In fact, our utilities remain among the very best for customer satisfaction in the regions we serve. Our U.S. utilities earned four JD Power awards for customer satisfaction raising their combined total to 51 since JD Power began assessing utility customer satisfaction in 1999.","Meanwhile, our U.K. utilities all achieved a 9 out of 10 rating in Ofgem's broad measure of customer satisfaction review. In addition, Western Power distribution earned the U.K's. customer service excellence award for the 27th consecutive year.","The company was also ranked by the industry regulator as best in stakeholder engagement and support for vulnerable customers for the 8th straight year. These achievements and more reflect our shared values and common purpose across PPL to deliver without fail for our customers to exceed their expectations and to continuously improve. Aware of the tremendous opportunity we have to make a positive impact on society not only today but for years to come, PPL also invested more than $3 billion in infrastructure improvements.","Our continued investments are aimed at strengthening grid resiliency in the face of worsening storms, incorporating automation, replacing and rebuilding power lines and substations and reshaping electricity networks to support the growth of renewables and other distributed energy resources. In regulatory matters, we remained focused in 2019 on achieving balanced regulatory outcomes that will benefit our customers and our share owners.","In Kentucky, we received public service commission approval of a combined $187 million revenue increase, which supports additional improvements to the grid, our natural gas lines and our generation fleet. New rates took effect May 1st.","And in the U.K., we continued to actively engage with Ofgem to advance a balanced regulatory framework that will provide real value to customers, support the U.K's. electrification and decarbonization initiatives and provide fair and reasonable returns to investors when the next price control review period begins in 2023.","Our engagement over the past year included meeting with Ofgem leadership and submitting responses to Ofgem's open letter consultation on behalf of both PPL and WPD including our sheriffs. I'll note that the RIIO-ED2 framework released by Ofgem in December was largely in line with our expectations.","In summary, we are proud of our many achievements over the past year on behalf of PPL shareowners and customers. Our performance is reflected in the numerous awards received throughout the year. Looking ahead, we're committed to building on this momentum and adding to our long-term track record of financial and operational excellence.","Now turning to Slide 5 and our 2020 outlook. Today, we initiated formal 2020 earnings guidance of $2.40 per share to $2.60 per share. This reflects our updated foreign currency hedge position, which we increased following the U.K. election that finally led to Brexit last month. Given the election result, we expect the U.K. business climate to remain strong as it has historically been.","Turning to our dividend, today, we announced we were raising the annualized dividend, to $1.66 per share. The increase announced today represents our 18th dividend increase in the last 19 years and we remain committed to dividend growth. In terms of network investment in 2020, we plan to invest an additional 3.3 billion in all of our utilities. These investments will continue to support our efforts to improve customer experience and grid excellent resiliency and advance a cleaner energy future.","Finally, as I touched upon earlier, we will remain engaged on the regulatory front to achieve balance outcomes that benefit customers and shareowners. Last week, the new CEO of Ofgem, Jonathan Brearley, announced his de-carbonization program action plan. Ofgem's plan over the next 18 months to make low cost decarbonization a reality shows that the DNOs will play a critical role in the significant investment required to deliver clean energy and the U.K's. net zero carbon emissions target by the year 2050. This supports what we've been saying that we see real long-term growth opportunities with our WPD business as the DNOs lead many of the decarbonization initiatives that will enable a net zero carbon economy.","I will now turn the call over to Vince for our operational updates. Vince?","Vince Sorgi","Thanks Bill.","As we turn to a new year and a new decade, I just want to express how proud I am on the operational excellence that our seven utilities continue to deliver for our customers. Our sector continues to rapidly evolve and our teams are meeting the challenges and finding opportunities to leverage technological advancements and decarbonization initiatives that are driving real value for our customers.","We believe that PPL is well positioned to further enhance its networks and continue to build these utilities of the future as we look ahead. I'd like to highlight some of the operational developments from this past year and briefly discuss our strategic priorities for each segment for 2020 and beyond. I'll also provide an update on our five year capital expenditure plan.","Turning to Slide 7, starting with the U.K. during 2019 WPD continue to demonstrate this leadership in support of the UKC carbonization goals. WPD was the first U.K. network operator to publish an electric vehicle strategy building on knowledge gained through the company's electric nation easy smart charging initiative.","The company has begun to proactively ready its network for increasing numbers of electric vehicles, anticipating the potential for up to 3 million EVs in our service territory by 2030. WPD also continues to deliver an industry leading innovation program, including finding ways to connect more distributed generation to local networks.","Through 2019 WPD connected nearly 10 gigawatts of distributed generation to its network, about six gigawatts of which was renewable energy. In addition, WPD is leading the way in developing markets for flexibility services and demand response solutions to help maintain grid resiliency and control costs to U.K. customers. These flexibility solutions should enable the deferral of some network spend, which Ofgem is keen to see the DNOs deliver.","As we look to the upcoming year, it's important to review how we are performing against our real easy one business plan and I'm proud to say that WPD continues to perform extremely well in RIIO-ED1.","In the most recent Ofgem annual report for electric distribution, WPD ranked first in customer satisfaction and customer minutes lost and ranked second in time to connect customers. Our returns are middle of the pack with an RORE expectation of 8.4% on a real basis over the 18 period. I'll note that this equates to a nominal RORE of about 11% when including RPI inflation.","As we've indicated in the past as the only fast-track company in RIIO-ED1, we think the fact that we are the top performing DNO group in the sector and only earning average returns will serve us well going into RIIO-ED2. Our strategic priorities moving forward are to continue this high level of performance and continue our engagement with Ofgem to help develop the sector specific methodology. Our objective is to ensure RIIO-ED2 provide the appropriate incentives for DNOs to deliver on the initiatives required to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.","Turning to Slide 8, in Pennsylvania, PPL electric utilities continue to demonstrate its leadership in the deployment of smart grid solution. We currently have 4,500 smart switches installed on our grid, since 2015 this technology has helped us eliminate over 900,000 outages for our customers.","As we've discussed during the year, PPL electric has received numerous awards this year for his operational excellence and commitment to innovation, including the deployment of a new distributed energy resource management system or DERMS and the development of groundbreaking technology that safely and automatically cuts power to down power lines protecting the public first responders and our employees.","In addition to PPL electric utilities was awarded the most improved utility as a decade by PA consulting. The company is also substantially complete with the multi-year nearly $500 million project to install 1.4 million advanced meters for our customers. Looking ahead for 2020, we remain focused on executing on our substantial electric transmission and distribution investment plan.","The majority of the spend this year remains in our transmission business, which has been the fastest growing business in our portfolio for a number of years now. Due to the ongoing needs to upgrade and modernize our transmission system. This includes upgrading transmission lines and substations, replacing wood poles with steel poles and building new substation.","We've also invested considerably in our distribution network. Also adding smart grid devices to the network, hardening the system, targeting our tree trimming effort and investing in new systems to automate how the network is controlled. This investment has also resulted in significant reductions in the number and duration of outages for our customers.","Going forward, we'll continue to deploy digital and cloud-based technology solutions to further automate the system to improve service even further for our customers. From a rates perspective, our retail rates continue to remain competitive in the mid Atlantic region. Thanks to our ongoing emphasis on integrating technology and efficiently managing costs, especially since we haven't had a base rate case since 2016.","Over the past decade, we've held our operating costs to less than a 1% decrease on average each year. We'll look to continue our efforts in this area as we don't expect another rate case to be effective within the earnings guidance period.","Moving to Kentucky on Slide 9, Louisville gas and electric and Kentucky utilities continue to make progress on a multi-year $800 million project the cap includes Ash bonds at our coal fired power plants. Overall, we are about 80% complete with the enclosure program.","We also retired 272 megawatts of coal fired generation at our EDW round facility raising the amount of retired coal generation to nearly 1200 megawatts since 2010. In addition, we secured public service commission approval of green energy tariff for businesses and continue to enhance our solar offerings for all of our customers. We completed construction of the first phase of our subscription based solar share program and we have fully subscribed the second phase with construction expected to be completed in Q2 of this year. Following up on a renewable energy RFP conducted in 2019, in January, we requested approval of contracts to supply an additional a hundred megawatts of as available solar power to Kentucky customers.","As we move into 2020, we see a balanced mix of investment across our Kentucky utilities. Over the past decade, we've had a significant portion of our capital devoted to improving the environmental profile or generating units, which has supported reductions of SO2 and NOx emissions by approximately 90% about 80% respectively. We'll be completing the majority of these environmental projects to comply with current regulations within the next couple of years.","As the environmental capital requirements have begun to decline, we've been able to deploy capital to improving our electric and gas TV networks with a focus on system reliability and automation that are already delivering real value for our customers as evidenced by 120,000 interruptions that have been presented to-date from our smart grid solutions. All of these investments have supported rate-based growth of over 7% per year on average over the past 20 years in Kentucky.","As we look forward, we are focused on a number of initiatives including customer focus programs such as our green energy tariff, as well as planning for the future investment cycle as it relates to generation resource planning. We'll also be working on updating our integrated resource plan with a new IRP to be filed with the commission in late 2021.","We expect the new IRP will provide a better sense of timing for the next wave of capital deployment in Kentucky related to the replacement of our coal fired generating fleet. I'll touch on this further in a few minutes.","Turning to Slide 10, as the world focuses on climate change, PPL remains committed to advancing a cleaner energy future while maintaining safety, reliability, and affordability for those who serve. Today we are updating our goals to reduce PPL CO2 emission. Specifically, we raised our goal of reducing PPLs carbon emissions to at least 80% from 2010 levels by 2050 from our previous target of 70%.","Company also accelerated its previous 2050 target by a decade and we are now targeting reducing carbon emissions by at least 70% by 2040. PPL has already reduced its carbon emissions by over 50% since 2010 exiting the competitive generation business in 2015 including nearly 4,000 megawatts of coal fired generation and retiring 1200 megawatts of coal in Kentucky. We expect to achieve these further reductions through a variety of actions including replacement of Kentucky coal-fired generation over time with a mix of renewables and natural gas while meeting our obligations to provide least cost and reliable service to our Kentucky customers. Our updated targets are based on our ongoing resource planning activities and updated market data and trends in Kentucky.","Assuming we receive KPSC approval for the previously mentioned renewable PPA and if technology continues to improve and drive down the cost of renewable, it is certainly possible that we can achieve even greater carbon reductions in these targets, while at the same time ensuring the best value and reliability for our customers.","We are confident, however, that these targets are achievable under current legislation and regulation as well as current technology and current economics.","Turning to Slide 11, we also wanted to provide an overview of the near-term and longer term opportunities to economically shift our business mix away from coal-fired generation. As you can see from the chart on the left side of the slide, PPLs rate-based already consists of more than 80% transmission distribution in non-coal fire generation. Given that our significant plan investments over the next five years are heavily weighted towards additional team, the infrastructure, the percentage of rate-based from coal-fired assets is expected to decrease even further in the near-term. In fact only about 5% of our $17 billion of our $14 billion capital plan is for investments related to coal-fired generating assets.","Our current files, IRP supports the transition to cleaner energy driven by technology and economics consistent with current policy and regulations. As you can see based on the chart on the right of the slide based on certain scenarios from our latest IRP filed back in 2018, we could see some additional coal retirements in the back half of the 2020s with significantly more coal retirements in the 2030. These scenarios continue to evolve and we are starting to see more momentum for renewables in the state as evidenced by the results of the recent renewable RFP where we are proposing to economically add a lower cost as available renewable generation resource while reducing the amount of output from some of our higher cost fossil units.","We are not at a point where renewables can compete on a replacement capacity basis as renewable plus storage options are not even competitive with our PT and gas plan. With that said, it is clear that these factors are rapidly changing as we move through time, which requires us to continuously assess the most proven strategy that's in the best interest of our customers something we've always demonstrated.","Moving to Slide 12, we've updated our capital expenditure plan and continue to see significant investment opportunities in our networks over the next five years totaling about $14 billion. We've increased our 2020 and 2021 projections by approximately $200 million each year from our prior estimates, primarily due to additional fluid limitation guidelines spend in Kentucky and it makes it timing related investments in the U.K. Our U.K. capital plan projects that we will be within 1% of our Ofgem approved business plan for ED1, this will strengthen our credibility with Ofgem when we file our RIIO-ED2 business plan. Note that changing the assumed tax rate from $1.40 per pound to $1.30 per pound on our U.K. spend reduced the five-year CapEx projections by about 300 million. We have not included the $300 million Kentucky AMI project in our forecast at this time, but that remains a potential upside opportunity for us as well as the other areas of opportunity noted on the slide, including de-carbonization related spending in the U.K.","We believe these additional opportunities could be as much as another $500 million above what's in the five year capital plan. Long-term, we expect more than an incremental billion dollars of investment to be required over the five year RIIO-ED2 period to achieve electrification initiatives based on our initial estimates.","As I previously noted, we also believe the transition of our coal-fired generation fleet will be the next significant investment opportunity in Kentucky. While this opportunity is outside of our five year capital plan under current scenarios, it's important to remember that this plan reflects assumptions based on today's use of future prices and market conditions which could rapidly change. What will not change is our commitment to our customers to continue to optimize our fleet and exceed our expectations as we lead the evolution of our Kentucky operation, including the transition to less carbon intensive generation resources.","So, as we look at the diverse portfolio of businesses that we have, it's important to point out that each business is in a different stage of its investment cycle. While U.K. wrap growth has been a strong 4% to 6% in ED1, we see that growth accelerating into ED2 beginning in 2023 as we fund the UK electrification initiatives.","In Kentucky, we see the initial stages of the Kentucky coal generation replacement strategy likely starting in the mid 2020 which will begin another period of significant capital investment. And in Pennsylvania, we are expecting growth to likely slow in the next couple of years following extensive period of transmission spending over the last five years at almost $700 million per year.","It's the diversity of our portfolio of businesses combined with our culture of operational excellence and continuous improvement that will continue to deliver long term value for our share owners.","With that, I'll turn it over to Joe now to cover the financial review. Joe?","Joe Bergstein","Thanks, Vince, and good morning everyone.","I'll begin with a brief financial overview on Slide 14. While PPL delivered an outstanding quarter of financial performance earning $0.57 of ongoing earnings per share, I'll focus my review this morning on our full year results. We have included a walk in the appendix of today's presentation and our news release for additional details on fourth quarter results. Looking at the full year, we achieved 2019 reported earnings of $2.37 per share compared with $2.58 per share a year ago. Adjusting for special items, primarily reflecting mark-to-market changes related to unrealized foreign currency, economic hedges, 2019 earnings from ongoing operations of $2.45 per share exceeding the midpoint point of our forecast by $0.05 per share. This compares to $2.40 per share that we earned last year, which included significant weather benefits of about $0.08 per share.","Looking forward to 2020, we announced the formal guidance range of $2.40 cents to $2.60 per share which reflects updates for current market conditions and our foreign currency hedge position. We also were updating our 2021 estimates primarily reflecting changes to foreign currency forecast which are lower than our prior forecast.","Let's turn to Slide 15 for an update on our earnings results for the full year. Walking from our 2018 results on the left, we first make weather adjustments for compatibility purposes of the underlying businesses. As I mentioned, weather was $0.08 favorable compared to normalized weather results in 2018. For 2019, we experienced slightly favorable weather.","The net result for the $0.07 per share decline year-over-year across all of our utilities. We also adjust for the effect of dilution. We settled the remaining 43 million shares on our forward equity transaction in November of 2019, which is the primary driver of the $0.10 per share of dilution year-over-year. Segment allocation of pollution is included on the slide for your reference.","Turning to the individual segment drivers which exclude the impact of these items starting with the U.K. Our U.K. regulated segment or the $1.40 per share, a $0.12 year-over-year increase.","The increase in the U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, primarily driven by higher prices due to the April 1, 2018 and 2019 price increases partially offset by lower sales volumes and higher pension income. In Pennsylvania, we are in $0.62 per share which was $0.05 higher than our results in 2018. Our Pennsylvania results were primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investments in transmission, partially offset by year-over-year differences and reduced income tax rates due to U.S. tax reform. The higher adjusted gross margins were partially offset by higher depreciation expense.","Turning to our Kentucky regulated segment, we're $0.59 per share in 2019, a $0.05 increase over our results one year ago. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from higher retail rates effective may one 2019 and lower income taxes primarily due to the Kentucky recycling credit recorded in the second quarter.","Partially offsetting these items were higher depreciation expense and higher interest expense due to higher interest rates and increased borrowing results in corporate and other were consistent compared to the prior year. The results were primarily driven by higher other income offset by higher operations and maintenance expense.","Turning to Slide 16, our financial outlook for 2020, he feels growth is underpinned by continuing operational excellence and organic investment at our regulated utilities. Walking from our strong 2019 results on the left to the slide, I'll note that whether this past year was not significant compared to our forecast of normal conditions and resulted in only at $0.01 per share adjustment for compatibility purposes. We also projected dilution of about 11 cents due to the November, 2019 settlement of our May, 2018 equity forward offering which increases our 2020 average shares outstanding compared to 2019 the allocations by segment are provided on a slide for your reference.","Excluding these two factors, we project growth that each of these business segments U.K. segment is expected to experience growth primarily driven by higher base demand revenues due to the annual April 1 increases and expected higher foreign currency exchange rates reflecting our solid hedge position for 2020 these positive drivers in the U.K. are expected to be partially offset by lower revenues from true of mechanisms related to cost of debt recovery, property taxes and sales volumes totaling about 10 cents lower pension income primarily due to this significant decline in discount rates in the U.K. and a combination of other miscellaneous drivers such as higher depreciation financing costs and taxes.","In Pennsylvania, we project an increase driven primarily by higher returns on transmission investments.","And turning to Kentucky, we projected an increase from 2019 driven by higher retail rates, partially offset by higher depreciation expense. In corporate and other, we projected improved earnings driven by a number of items including lower interest expense due to lower short-term debt. Post the settlement of our equity forward. These drivers results in the midpoint of our guidance range of $2.50 per share.","Turning to slide 17, we've also updated our 2021 projections to account for current foreign currency forecast. Our prior earnings forecast is $2.50 to $2.80 per share reflected a foreign currency range of 1.35 per pound to 1.60 per pound, which was consistent with bank FX forecasts at the time we initiated the earnings range are updating earnings are updated. Earnings forecast of $2.40 to $2.60 per share includes an updated foreign currency range of $1.25 to a $1.40 per pound, which is below the current forwards and market forecasts.","We're using these lower rates for the FX range given the expected near term volatility as U.K. works through the Brexit transition period during 2020 and we will be heading 2021 during this time period. The other drivers for 2021, highlighted in our previously announced forecast remain largely unchanged with rate based, still expected to grow at 5% to 6% and our expectation to continue to earn near or long returns.","Our 2020 and 2021 forecast continue to assume an immaterial amount of equity issuances as previously indicated.","Let me provide an update on our foreign currency hedging status, which is on Slide 18. For 2020, we were actively hedging during the fourth quarter and increased our hedge percentage by another 20% bringing our hedge position to 90% of 2020 forecast at ongoing earnings. The average rate for 2020 reflecting these new hedges is $1.48 per pound.","We were able to slightly improve on the average 2020 hedge rates by optimizing our hedge portfolio given the brief uplift and currency rates following the positive U.K. election outcome and the strength in our 2019 results. We continue to utilize options in our hedging strategy that preserve upside of the current market rates was about one-third of the 2020 hedge portfolio being option based.","For 2021, our hedge position is at 5% of forecasted earning at an average rate of $1.33 per pound. Again, we expect to continue layering in 2020 hedges, 2021 hedges going forward.","Turning to Slide 19, as we continue our efforts to invest in our networks and earn our authorized returns, we remain committed to paying dividends to shareowners as we've done over the past century. The January 1st dividend represents the 296 consecutive quarterly dividend paid to shareholders. As Bill mentioned, we remain committed to dividend growth and today announced we are raising the annualized dividend to $1.66 per share and we will continue to assess the rate at which we grow the dividend going forward in the context of our yield and pay out relative to our peers.","That concludes my prepared remarks and I'll turn the call back to Bill for some closing comments. Bill?","Bill Spence","Thank you, Joe.","Before we open up the call for Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on what has truly been a remarkable decade for PPL. Over the past 10 years, we've doubled our market cap. We've unfailingly exceeded the midpoint of our earnings forecast, we've grown our dividend 18%. we've won 21 JD Power awards for customer satisfaction in the U.S., we've consistently ranked highest for customer satisfaction among the network operators in the U.K, we've invested $27 billion to make our network smarter, to improve reliability and to advance a cleaner energy future, we've cut average customer interruptions by over a third in the U.K. and by more than 20% in the U.S. since 2010.","All the while we've kept electricity costs reasonable for our customers and remain deeply engaged with the communities we serve. And last but not least, we have dramatically transformed PPL. A decade ago we were primarily a Pennsylvania hybrid utility facing stiff headwinds in competitive markets. Today, we are one of the nation's largest investor owned utility company with 100% of its earnings driven by stable, high-performing regulated businesses. In short, we are stronger today than we were a decade ago.","We're better positioned to invest in the future and as we celebrate our Centennial, we are poised to power progress for another hundred years. When our Directors first met a century ago, they did so at a pivotal time. The country was beginning to move from a patchwork quilt of isolated lighting companies to a coordinated network of regional utilities, power plants and transmission lines. Or in that moment, PPL would help drive that change, extending electricity service throughout the regions we serve, expanding to meet the needs and demands a rapid industrial growth and just helping to improve quality of life for generations of customers.","Today, we again find ourselves at a pivotal moment for our industry, which is investing in new technologies to reshape not only how we deliver power, but how we produce it as well. In this moment, we remain as committed as ever to powering progress, to fostering innovation, to creating long-term shareowner value, and to making a positive impact on society.","In closing, I'm proud of our past achievements. I'm equally excited about our future and I'm convinced that PPLs best days are ahead.","With that operator. Let's open the call for questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Ali Agha of STRH. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha","First question I just wanted to reconcile your 2020 guidance of 2.40 to 2.60 with -- the numbers you'd been showing us for quite a while up until recently, a 2020 projected range of 2.54 to 2.58. I guess when I think about the mid points, I know there was a narrower range, but the midpoint was certainly higher than what you're showing us today. Could you just reconcile what changed from the numbers you had been sharing with us?","Bill Spence","Sure. I'll make a couple of opening comments and I'll pass it on to Joe. As one of the things you just pointed out was the very tight range that we had established for 2020. Having said that, we still are kind of within that range but towards the lower end. Operationally, when you look at the assumptions behind the 2020, we're largely consistent with the prior forecast, the primary change was really a significant decline in corporate bond rates in the U.K. resulting in some lower discount rates, which had a negative impact on our U.K. pension obligations. Those factors really resulted in about a $0.06 impact compared to our prior plan. But as I mentioned, despite this, we're still in the prior range for 2020. Joe, did you want to say anything more?","Joe Bergstein","Yes. We saw a sharp decline in corporate bond rates in the U.K. that lowered the discount rates resulting in the increased U.K. pension obligations under U.S. GAAP. The discount rates declined by more than a 100 basis points. It went from about 3% to less than 2% and that's really what's causing the difference from our prior forecast. Again, to Bill\u2019s point operationally, everything else remains unchanged.","Ali Agha","I got it. Then, second question, Vince, I just wanted to be clear when you talked about, the CapEx opportunities that you're seeing across the different utility segments did I hear it right that over this five year period, '19 through '24 or '20 through '24, I should say, that you're seeing potentially another 800 million of additional CapEx or was the number even larger than that? I just wanted to be very clear. What's the opportunity size that you see that's not yet embedded in your official CapEx numbers?","Vince Sorgi","Yes. Sure. Ali, in my remarks, I indicated that was about a 0.5 billion. So 500 million.","Ali Agha","500 million, and I think separately, you also talked about 300 million of AMI. That's not yet in that, is that correct?","Vince Sorgi","Yes. That's part of the 500.","Ali Agha","Well that's part of the 500. I got you. Okay.","Vince Sorgi","Yes. The other thing I would note is that, just changing that FX assumption from $1.40, our previous assumption down to $1.30 as indicated on our Slide 12, cut about 300 million from the forecast. So depending on when we get out, particularly to 2022 and beyond to the extent the FX rate goes back up that'll come back into the forecast. And we do think that there's a skew to the upside when it comes to the FX rate given where we see Brexit today and U.K. political front. So, we're expecting some of that may come back in. But that was 300 million alone.","Ali Agha","Right. And last question Bill, I know in the past you've talked about from your vantage point, you still think that the U.K. business is disproportionally too big as a contributor to earnings for PPL. Just wondering how you look at that today and is there any new tools available to you or what's your thinking on how to correct that today, if you still think that it's disproportionately too large of a business mix for you?","Bill Spence","Sure. Well, first I'd say we are comfortable with the current business mix and believe it will deliver long-term value for our shareowners and that there are many opportunities as Vince described in his remarks. As I have said in the past, the unprecedented U.K. volatility that we've been experiencing over the past few years, I would have preferred to be less weighted towards the U.K. But quite frankly, we probably share a similar view for any jurisdiction where we've got a significant weighting such as in the U.K. I do think for those things that were within our control we've got a great track record of operational excellence and financial investments that that I think are going to pay dividends for the future. And I think the opportunities we outlined today will continue to enable us to be successful for very long time.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Shar Pourreza","I just wanted to just touch sort of the guidance in your outlook just a little bit deeper. And obviously if you just kind of look at your out of year plan, the CapEx steps down and remains flat, Kentucky rate-based kind of declines. There's a modest step up in Pennsylvania. Can you maybe just give a little bit more details in the puts and takes and what could move you higher? And I'm kind of curious on when you can present the timing of an update, understanding that you guys are very, very conservative when it comes to the outer years i.e., the capital opportunities associated with EV deployment in the U.K. Why not have included some of the stuff in your capital alloc today? Like why, why take such a conservative stance?","Bill Spence","Yes. So I'll make a comment or two and then turn it to Vince. If you look at the overall CapEx plan, [indiscernible] and the rate base growth that's associated with that, looking at in my view, a minimum 4% rate-based growth with earnings that will follow that with the caveat that of course, exchange rates and pension deficits funding can push that higher or lower. But I think in my view, because of the upsides that Vince talked about, I look at the plan as a minimum 4% probably more in the 4% to 6% over the longer term as we fill in some of the gaps with more certain projects and really scrub things a little bit better in the outer years.","As you indicated, we have historically been pretty conservative with our forecast. And we continue to be the really driven by what we know about current projects, but also what we see is the current kind of FX rate which has been pretty volatile over time. And again, I mentioned earlier that I believe we have a skew to the upside with the FX rate as the Brexit process becomes a lot more clear.","Vince, do you want to add anything to the potential upside?","Vince Sorgi","And Shar, to your question about kind U.K. EV spend and how we're thinking about that when we would update, so the 200 million a year that we've included, so basically an incremental billion that we're expecting over really to -- that's based on our initial estimates going into electrification initiatives that would be required to funded by the DNOs. When you look at the process going forward for RIIO 2, right, the sector methodology consultation will be coming out Q2, Q3 of this year. This is on Slide 28, by the way, in the deck, the methodology decision wouldn't be coming out until Q4 and then the companies will be submitting our submissions in Q2 of 2021.","So to be honest with you, we're going through the process right now on planning for those submissions the business plan of submissions while were consulting with Ofgem on the methodology. And so I think we just need to get through that process a little more, Shar, before we would I think update the view of EV or electrification spending going into ED2. But to your point, I think there's certainly could be an opportunity there for incremental capital, especially coming out of what Jonathan Brealey published really on his first day on the job with his de-carbonization plan. So, we think that all fits very nicely into what we've been talking about. But I think we need to get through the process a little more before we would go beyond our initial estimate.","Shar Pourreza","Got it. And then just sticking sort of with your conservative theme here just around the FX. I mean you did highlight, obviously you're taking a little bit more of a conservative stance, but your assumptions do trail sort of consensus and forwards. So just maybe talk a little bit about that at a deeper level. And then what's sort of the timing of the '21 hedging program. Are there any sort of, any mandated thresholds or you're able to keep it open based on kind of your fundamental views?","Bill Spence","Joe, you wan to talk about the FX to start.","Joe Bergstein","So I guess the first part of your question, [Shawn] [ph] on our forecast range relative to four market spot rates and market forecast. We are lower than those for the reasons I said in my prepared remarks. We expect volatility in the exchange rate during 2020 as the UK continues through the transition period. And we'll hedging 2021 during that time period. Thank for tests are in a range of $1.35 to $1.45 for 2021. So there's certainly some potential upside to our forecast and as we've looked at 2022 as bank forecasts are actually in the mid 140s range. So that sensitivity of a penny of FX to a penny of earnings, that's, that's $0.15 of upside. If the bank forecasts are accurate in 2022 relative to where we sit today. Got it.","Shar Pourreza","Got it. And then just one last one is, Bill, I know, you may or may not want to answer this, but I know the board has been obviously very patient around how you guys are thinking about the stock and the valuation. But it does kind of still continue to trade even if you look at it from a sum of the parts, multiple wrap basis post-Brexit. Is there any other strategic steps that you can take to maximize value for shareholders outside of the plan you sort of present today and outside of the, obviously incremental opportunities given the fact that your plan very conservative?","Bill Spence","Well, obviously, I'm not going to speculate on potential M&A, but when I look at the overall strategy for the things that we can control, it's actually worked really well. I think in terms of meeting all of the things that we do control, we obviously can't control the politics in the U.K. or the exchange rate.","I think that as we look forward, particularly as we get through 2020, it's very likely that we'll know a lot more about where Brexit ultimately lands and what the currency landscape looks like for sure. Having said that, we're always looking at strategic or improvements to the base case that we can make that would create shareowner value. So we'll continue to do that as a Board and as a management team wherever and always if there are opportunities I think to create some additional shareowner value. But we are always on the lookout for how do we improve the base case and the plan that we have and I will continue to do that.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Greg Gordon at Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Actually Shar actually set me up reasonably well there. We didn't even plan this. When I look at like what you can control, obviously, operationally you guys are still top-notch across all your businesses. But given the things that you can't control in '20 and '21 and then the other thing you can only to some degree control in '22, which is the reset of under RIIO-ED2. If I step back and look at this from a high level, is it fair to look at the big picture as the next few years; you've got some earnings challenges that could create a more or less flat earnings profile, but the setup going into '22 and beyond creates a lot of growth opportunities from a decarbonization perspective on both your platforms to start growing the business again at a pretty steady and long trajectory?","Bill Spence","Yes, Greg. I would say overall, with the guidance we just gave here today from '20 to '21, at least looking at the midpoints, looks flat. As we indicated, depending on the FX rates, in particular, that could move up and show some growth. I think the underlying businesses, kind of to your point, continue to grow. The rate base is continuing to grow. And I think we are going to be set up well going into both decarbonization opportunities in the U.K. as well as domestically. So I think that, depending on your outlook for the FX, will dictate whether there's growth from 2020 to 2021.","Greg Gordon","Right. And then, look, 2022, I know you haven't given guidance. So I'm not trying to sort bait you into giving me guidance. But, we did go through in RIIO-ED1, when you transitioned, there was a reset year on revenues that you had to overcome. And you've talked about on prior calls how you can manage through fast pot, slow pot allocations and how you think that because you're best-in-class operator, you'll do better than average on the outcome and that hopefully the DNOs will do better on the margin than some of the other utility segments. But it is fair to say that '22 has its own set of challenges as well that you're going to have to manage, correct?","Bill Spence","Well, I think, again, I think it really depends on what the forecast that you want to use for foreign currency rates. Because I think we're -- in my view, kind of toward the low end. If you look at what FX rates have done really since the election, there was a temporary bound, but really stayed around $1.30. It's pretty much been range bound for the last couple of months.","And you look at the forward forecast and a lot of them, as Joe indicated, are $1.35 and better, particularly much better when we get to 2022. So I would expect just on the strength of the FX that by the time we get to 2022 we'll see some earnings growth.","Joe, I don't know if you want to add.","Joe Bergstein","I guess if we just look at the underlying business, absent FX, sort of all else equal, given we are talking about 2022 we would see growth in the businesses. And really the reason we're flat from 2020 to 2021 based on the midpoints is because of our strong hedge position for 2020 relative to the hedge position we have in 2021. So that's really what's showing a flat year-over-year earnings is because we actually have a decline in the FX rate that's hedged and assumed in 2020 compared to what we've used in the forecast for 2021.","So I think there is, on the underlying businesses, we see growth. And then we'll have to see what FX does. But certainly as we move through 2020, you expect some clarity on the transition; get back into what we would expect and hope to be more normal times around the FX rate that could add additional growth on top of that.","Vince Sorgi","Yes. Greg. it's Vince. Just also the RIIO2 transition is 2023, not 2022.","Greg Gordon","Oh gosh, sorry.","Vince Sorgi","Yes. I think on Joe's point on expected growth into 2022, right on the money.","Greg Gordon","Got you. And then I think back to the strategic decisions that you guys made when you decided to aggressively diversify and you bought more utility assets in the U.K. and you bought the Kentucky business and you did it at a really opportune time to diversify it away quite well from your exposure to the declining margin outlook for merchant power. And I can't help but think that this decarbonization opportunity which is going to be huge for your company in Kentucky and in the U.K., is also a huge opportunity. And to build a little bit on Shar's question on strategic options, would that play into a decision to think about how you could potentially scale up with a partner to better -- potentially better execute on that transition?","Bill Spence","Well, probably -- I shouldn't say probably. I will not speculate on M&A. But in terms of your underlying thesis around the decarbonization opportunity, I agree with that, and I believe that particularly in the U.K., it's one of the reasons why we continue to have a positive outlook on the U.K. We've weathered probably the strongest of the storms so far, particularly with renationalization threats which are now obviously not a threat at all, given the strong election outcome in the U.K. So that risk is now behind us and we still have the risk of Brexit that's keeping the markets a little bit jittery. But beyond that, I think things will stabilize. We'll have a much better view of not only RIIO-ED2, but also where the FX starts to land. And I think for the going forward setup for the business was I think we're in very good shape.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Praful Mehta","So maybe staying unfortunately with the theme on the strategic side. And I guess one of the points that I took away from all the answers was, clearly, you would look to at least benefit from reducing the proportion of the U.K. business. So I just wanted to understand --I know that there was a constraint around selling the U.K. business because of tax and the leakage there. If you were to partner up and use that to increase the size of the company, effectively reducing the proportion of the U.K. business, what kind of constraints should we think about on the tax side or other side that could limit any kind of strategic decisions around that decision?","Bill Spence","Well, again, I'm not going to speculate around M&A. However, as we've indicated in the past, an outright sale either in full or partially of the U.K. business does create multiple challenges, all of which destroy shareowner value. And if you look at the valuation of the company today, I think it's even more challenging today than it probably was when our stock was in the upper $28 to $30 range, so in the upper 20s. So, I think with where we are today, that strategic decision continues to be a big challenge for us.","In terms of where the renationalization risk being removed, clearly you've seen the values of the U.K. utilities move up significantly after the election, and we still have what we believe is one of the strongest, if not the strongest, distributor network operator in the U.K. So we believe, on its own, its value has increased. But again, for us to de-weight and sell the business, that would be destructive to shareowners.","Praful Mehta","Yes. I get that and I remember that. What I'm asking is, if rather than selling the U.K. business, PPL as a whole would partner with somebody else and that way reducing the proportion of the U.K. business, do those same constraints apply on the tax side or any other side that we should be thinking about as we think about the strategic direction?","Bill Spence","Yes. Let me ask Joe to comment on that.","Joe Bergstein","Hi, Praful. I think that it's a very hypothetical question and it would be dependent on the other party and a lot of aspects of that, and so it's really hard to give an answer in that. I would say we -- to the earlier point, we look at all sorts of ways to create shareowner value. And obviously tax implications and what that would do to shareowner value is something that we focus closely on. But I think it'd be very difficult to say in a hypothetical situation and depending on who the other party may be.","Praful Mehta","Fair enough. And that makes sense. Just a couple of quick cleanup questions. On Slide 25, when I look at the rate base growth that you've projected through '24, I saw a meaningful decline in rate base growth both for the U.K. business and Kentucky. Obviously, this was slightly different timing; '18 to '23 versus '19 to '24. But I'm just trying to understand. The U.K. sounds like mostly pension related and exchange rate and mostly exchange rate, I guess and Kentucky, you guys have talked about. Is there anything else we should be thinking about around the rate base growth profile as you think about the different segments?","Bill Spence","So looking at that Slide 25, you can see there that the rate base growth in the U.K. is about 5.5%. It's not materially different, I don't believe, from where it was previously. I think it might have been as high as 6%. I think the biggest decrease is really in the Kentucky operation, where we're only projecting a 1.5% growth much about or much because of the reasons that Vince articulated in his opening remarks.","And in the PA transmission, that's really been probably the larger decrease when you look at the overall mix because for a period of time we were growing double-digit there. And then on the distribution side, I think it's been fairly consistent in the 4% to 6%. So I think the two big changes are lower in Kentucky and lower on the Pennsylvania transmission side.","Praful Mehta","Yes. Thanks. Sorry, I did mean Pennsylvania transmission. Sorry, so thanks for that. And finally, just on Slide 26, when I look at incentive revenues, there has been a slight decrease in that projection as well for the U.K. So I just want to understand, is that also exchange rate or anything else on the incentive side?","Bill Spence","It's purely exchange rate.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, team, well done, again. And just going to play a cleanup here on some of the last questions. So can we talk a little bit more specifically on the timeline here for AMI and Kentucky? You talked about $300 million. Sort of procedurally, how do we get that done, when I know there's been some talk historically about that?","And also, perhaps more importantly, decarbonization in the U.K. How do you think about that, the timeline be able to reflect some of that and how would that manifest itself in terms of CapEx here? Just to be a little bit more specific on that process. And I got a follow-up.","Bill Spence","Okay. Sure. Vince, go ahead.","Vince Sorgi","Sure, Julien. On the AMI, we would likely time that with the next rate case. As you know, in Kentucky, we've been on this every other year, rate case cycle. The last rate case -- new rates were effective May 1 of 2019. If we were to continue that cadence, yes, right, you would see a rate case becoming effective in the first half of 2021. So AMI, I would say, we would factor that into that upcoming rate case. And then, I apologize, what was the second part of your question?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","How does the decarbonization in the U.K. get reflected? How does that manifest itself? What kind of order of magnitude of spending we're talking about? I know you guys talked about $500 million upside in the five year outlook. I mean, when you think about decarbonization, that probably seems like a bigger number here. But I don't want to put words in your mouth. And what time period? Are we talking about in the current ED? Are we talking about the next one, if you can provide some context?","Vince Sorgi","Sure. So, the bulk of the incremental electrification CapEx we've included in the ED2 initial estimate. So we have about $1 billion over five years, call it $200 million a year in that five year period. And again, that's based on our initial assumptions. The team is working through our business plan submission, and that will be filed mid-2021 as part of the RIIO2 process.","I would say depending how aggressive the government initiatives and Ofgem's policies become on the tail end of ED1, we could see deploying some capital in our current rate -- our current business plan time frame on electrification initiatives. We think we have enough leeway within the existing plan that we would be able to divert some spending towards that. Therefore, it wouldn't be a drag on the returns because, as you know, the revenues are kind of set for the ED1 period. So we would have to basically shift capital away from other things to EVs. We have innovation capital. Other things that I would say are placeholders that we could redeploy there.","So I think we have enough flexibility in the back end of ED1 and you'll see a significant up tick in E2, which could once we get the business plans done, could be higher than what we're currently projecting at that $1 billion over the five years.","Bill Spence","Yes. It's probably obvious, but anything that we would shift from the current ED1 to ED2 to accommodate any electrification initiatives would wind up showing up in ED2 because presumably it's all work that is necessary to be done, not necessarily for electrification put for reliability and customer service reasons.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Anthony Crowdell of Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Anthony Crowdell","I want to follow up on Greg's earlier question. If I think of 2021 and '22 earnings, in order to see some growth there, in order to see like an earnings growth that matches rate base growth, do I need to see an improvement in the exchange rate?","Bill Spence","No.","Anthony Crowdell","And then, also on currency for -- I think some of the currency hedges are options where it preserves the upside. Any thought on why not locking in '21 now since, I don't know if there is many moving parts to '21 earnings with rate cases, and also '22, I think that you just mentioned, Kentucky, not locking those options now and preserving the upside, but maintaining a base versus if there is any further fallout in the U.K.?","Joe Bergstein","The options, Anthony are for 2020 not in 2021. So I think given where the options are priced and where the spot rate is, we'll prefer to see what happens within those option rates because we're protected on the downside. Clearly, you could see some appreciation on the upside, but they are in 2020, not 2021.","Bill Spence","Sorry, just to add to that. To the extent that we wanted to put options on for the bulk of 2021, that can be pretty expensive. So we probably wouldn't look to do that unless there were some shifts in our thoughts around the currency. But for now, I think we'll look opportunistically to hedge in at $1.30 and above wherever we can. And we'll start to ramp up a lot of our hedging by probably mid-year.","Anthony Crowdell","And just lastly, if you could update us on the pension assumptions. I don't believe there is a major change in your pension assumptions in the U.K. I thought there was like 10% degradation from 2020 to 2021, but I just wanted to double-check with you guys.","Joe Bergstein","We had projected about $0.05 change from 2020 to 2021, and our assumptions haven't changed materially around that at this point.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Bill Spence for any final remarks.","Bill Spence","Okay. Thank you, Rocco. And thanks everyone for joining us today. We'll visit with you again on the first quarter earnings call. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you, sir. Today's conference has now concluded, we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day."],"17617":["PPL Corp. (NYSE:PPL) Q3 2016 Earnings Call November  1, 2016  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Joseph P.

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Bergstein, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.","Joseph P. Bergstein - PPL Corp.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the PPL conference call on third quarter results and our general business outlook. We're providing slides of this presentation on our website at www.pplweb.com. Any statements made in this presentation about future operating results or other future events are forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from such forward-looking statements.","A discussion of factors that could cause actual results or events to differ is contained in the appendix to this presentation and in the company's SEC filings. We will refer to earnings from ongoing operations or ongoing earnings, a non-GAAP measure, on this call. For reconciliations to the GAAP measures, you should refer to the press release which has been posted on our website and has been furnished with the SEC.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Bill Spence, PPL Chairman, President and CEO.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for today's call. With me are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer as well as the presidents of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses.","Starting with slide 3, our agenda this morning begins with an overview of our quarterly and year-to-date 2016 earnings results. Following that, I'll address our 2016 and 2017 earnings forecast as we are raising the midpoint of our 2016 forecast and reaffirming our 2017 guidance. I'll provide a brief operational overview as well as an update on our UK currency hedging. Following my remarks, Vince will review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial overview. As always, we'll leave time to answer your questions.","Turning to slide 4, today, we announced third quarter 2016 reported earnings of $0.69 per share compared with reported earnings of $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Year-to-date through the third quarter, reported earnings were $2.11 per share compared with $0.42 per share through the same period a year ago.","Reported earnings for the first nine months of 2015 reflected a loss from discontinued operations of $1.36 per share, which resulted primarily from the spinoff of our competitive generation business. Adjusting for special items, third quarter 2016 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.63 per share compared with $0.51 per share a year ago. That represents a 23% increase on a per share basis. The increase was driven largely by an April 1, 2016 price increase in the UK, higher base electricity rates and higher transmission earnings from additional transmission capital investments in Pennsylvania and higher sales volumes due to favorable weather in Kentucky.","Through the first nine months of 2016, earnings from ongoing operations were $1.86 per share compared with $1.77 per share a year ago. Higher earnings year-to-date were primarily driven by higher base rates in Kentucky and Pennsylvania and returns on additional capital investments.","Vince will go into greater detail on third quarter results a little later in the call, but we're pleased with the strong results across our business units.","Moving to slide 5, based on our strong performance year-to-date, we've narrowed our guidance range from the previous $2.25 to $2.45 per share to $2.30 to $2.45 per share, increasing the midpoint of our 2016 ongoing earnings forecast from $2.35 per share to $2.38 per share. Vince will provide a walk on the drivers contributing to this 2016 increased performance later in his remarks.","As we discussed on our October 12 call, we took steps to significantly reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk by restriking our remaining in the money 2016 hedges. The impact to 2016 ongoing earnings was a negative $0.06, but because of our strong business line results, we're increasing our 2016 earnings guidance even as we've leveraged the strength of our 2016 performance to minimize future currency risk.","We also discussed on the October 12 call the opportunity to further leverage 2017 hedge gains, targeting no more than $0.05 of EPS exposure for 2019, even at an exchange rate of $1.15 per pound. As of today, we've completed all the restrikes for 2016 and 2017, and we've achieved our targeted hedge levels. Vince will provide the details of our updated hedge positions in his remarks.","The higher-than-projected earnings in 2017 that enabled us to restrike a portion of our 2017 hedges was partially driven by lower-than-anticipated UK property taxes. In the revised earnings guidance we provided on the second quarter call, we were expecting fairly significant property tax increases starting next year and continuing through 2020. But based on the property tax valuation recently completed by the UK government, our property tax increases are lower compared to our previous expectation.","Additionally, some of the earnings strength we are experiencing in 2016 as a result of lower O&M in the UK is expected to continue into 2017. These positive factors provide us with the confidence to reaffirm our 2017 earnings forecast of $2.05 to $2.25 per share, with a midpoint of $2.15 per share, despite executing about $0.06 of 2017 hedge restrikes.","Lastly, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term growth projections. We expect to achieve 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth from 2017 to 2020, and are targeting annual dividend growth of about 4% over the same period.","Let's move to slide 6. Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Gas and Electric are announcing today that they intend to file rate requests on November 23 with the Kentucky Public Service Commission. KU and LG&E expect to seek revenue increases of $103 million and $93 million, respectively, through adjustments to annual base electric rates. LG&E meanwhile anticipates seeking a revenue increase of $14 million in annual base natural gas rates.","In total, we're expecting to seek a revenue increase of approximately $210 million. The requested increases are driven by additional capital investments that are focused on enhancing our reliability programs across the operational groups, along with technology and infrastructure investments in our customer service areas. This will allow us to continue to provide safe, reliable electric and gas service to customers while meeting federal regulations. Even with the increases, it's anticipated that LG&E and KU rates will remain well below national averages. If approved by the commission, the increases would take effect in July of 2017.","Now let's turn to slide 7 for some additional operational highlights. In Kentucky, KU and LG&E will be seeking approval to invest in an advanced metering system and a distribution automation program as part of their rate case proceeding. They will include applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity for implementing these new initiatives which focus on enhancing service offerings to customers, with a continued emphasis on our reliability.","In recognition of continued efforts to focus on the customer experience, LG&E ranked highest among midsize gas utilities in the Midwest in J.D. Power's 2016 survey of residential customer satisfaction. This J.D. Power award is the third by a PPL utility this year and the 41st overall for PPL companies, demonstrating our commitment to provide customers with the highest level of service.","As we highlighted on our second quarter call, both PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities earned J.D. Power awards in July. In Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities is on track to execute more than $1 billion in capital improvements to modernize the grid and strengthen reliability for our customers. The company's automated power restoration system has now restored within minutes more than 58,000 customers since that system became fully operational this past June. We also continue to add new smart devices to extend these benefits and improve grid resiliency even more.","The company is also completing preparations to replace 1.4 million meters in Pennsylvania with new smart meters. The meter replacements are expected to begin before the end of the year, and the full $471 million project is expected to be completed by 2019. Transmission expansion also continues with additional investments focused on reinforcing, expanding, and hardening the bulk power system, adding redundancy and making the grid more secure.","In the UK, we continue to execute on our plans, and while there is still considerable time left in the current regulatory year, we're on pace to achieve our projected performance against the 2016, 2017 incentive targets for customer minutes lost and customer interruptions. In addition, we're on pace to be at or near the maximum reward levels for customer satisfaction. We provided updates to our incentive revenue performance in slides 20 to 22 of the appendix.","Also in the UK, we're leading the way, according to the regulator Ofgem, in connecting renewable generation to local distribution networks. To-date, we've connected or offered to connect almost 20 gigawatts of renewable power. We've already connected approximately 200,000 private solar installations along with 7,500 commercial distributed generation facilities.","The company has also launched what we believe to be the world's largest electric vehicle trial to explore charging patterns and the ability of markets to influence those patterns. The trial involving up to 700 vehicles will inform future network planning.","And finally, as I've already discussed, we have taken steps to reduce our 2018 and 2019 exposure to foreign currency.","Vince will now walk you through a more detailed look at earnings and our hedging strategy. Vince?","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to slide 9. Our third quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.12 per share, driven by $0.05 of higher earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment, $0.02 from the Kentucky Regulated segment, and $0.06 from the U.K. Regulated segment.","We should note that for the third quarter, we saw warmer weather compared to last year, and as a result, domestic weather was favorable $0.03 compared to last year, and weather was about $0.02 positive compared to budget. However, with the warmer winter earlier this year, on a year-to-date basis, domestic weather is only positive about $0.01 compared to budget. Year-to-date weather in the UK is negative $0.01 compared to the prior year and negative $0.02 compared to budget. So, for the company in total, weather has not been a significant driver of our financial performance this year.","Let's move to a more detailed review of the second quarter segment earnings drivers starting with the Pennsylvania results on slide 10. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.13 per share in the third quarter of 2016, a $0.05 increase compared to the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher gross margins due to higher distribution margins as a result of new rates going into effect January 1 of this year, higher transmission margins due to additional capital investments, and the favorable effects of weather.","Moving to slide 11, our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.18 per share in the third quarter of 2016, a $0.02 increase compared to a year ago. This result was primarily due to higher gross margins due to favorable weather.","Turning to slide 12, our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.35 per share in the third quarter of 2016, a $0.06 increase compared to a year ago. This result was primarily driven by higher gross margins, primarily resulting from higher prices from the April 1, 2016 price increase, partially offset by lower volumes due to weather and lower O&M expense, including pension expense.","Moving to slide 13, as Bill mentioned, strong performance at each of our regulated utilities led to very solid results through the first nine months of the year compared to our plan, enabling us to raise our 2016 guidance. This slide provides a walk from the midpoint of our original 2016 earnings guidance of $2.35 per share to our new forecasted midpoint of $2.38 per share. The $0.03 improvement in the forecast is coming from $0.02 in Pennsylvania and $0.01 in Kentucky. While we were experiencing better-than-expected earnings in the U.K. as well, that was fully offset by the $0.06 of 2016 restrikes. The outperformance in the U.K. is driven by higher margins as well as lower operating expenses.","In Pennsylvania, we are expecting higher margins from favorable weather and usage, as well as higher transmission margins. In Kentucky, we are expecting slightly lower operating expenses. Additionally, across all the segments, we are seeing lower interest expense from lower interest rates and deferrals of debt issuances, in part due to cashing in $310 million of 2017 and 2018 U.K. earnings hedges.","Moving to slide 14, as we discussed on our October 12 call, we took action in early October to restrike our remaining in the money 2016 hedges to hedge more of our 2018 exposure. Since the call, we have taken additional action and have completed the execution of the 2017 restrikes, further increasing our hedge levels for 2018.","You can see we are now hedged 94% for 2017 at an average hedge rate of $1.25 per pound. We are well hedged for 2018 as a result of the actions we've taken. The combined results of the 2016 and 2017 restrikes is that we have increased our 2018 hedge levels to 93% at an average hedge rate of $1.42 per pound. This creates the flexibility to restrike about $0.12 of 2018 hedge gains to help hedge 2019 earnings at our budgeted rate of $1.30 per pound.","The 2019 hedge attainment table reflects the targeted hedge levels in 2019, assuming we restrike 2018 hedge gains and layer on 2019 hedges at our budgeted rate. So if market rates are around $1.20 per pound when we execute the 2018 restrike, we would be able to hedge 100% of 2019 earnings at our budgeted rate, leaving no additional currency exposure for 2019. If market rates were to drop to $1.15 per pound at the time we execute the 2018 restrikes, we would be able to hedge about 73% of 2019 earnings, leaving about $0.04 of exposure on the remaining open position.","In the bottom right part of the chart, we also show sensitivities on the open position at various market rates from $1.15 to $1.45 per pound. To the extent the incremental hedge value that we've created in 2018 is not needed to hedge 2019 earnings, which would be the case if the pound rebounds closer to our budgeted rate, we could use it to hedge 2020 earnings.","And before I turn the call back over to Bill, you will find an update on RPI in the appendix on slide 23. That slide has been updated for the October RPI forecast from HM Treasury, and is consistent with our forecasted assumptions.","That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Thanks, Vince. To summarize, we continue to perform very well across all three of our business segments, and we're solidly on track to deliver on our increased 2016 earnings guidance. And even with the $0.06 of restrikes we've executed for 2017, we are reaffirming our 2017 earnings guidance.","The actions we've taken as part of our foreign currency hedging strategy has substantially minimized foreign currency risk through 2019, and provide greater assurance to our earnings growth targets, and we're confident in our ability to achieve competitive earnings growth of 5% to 6% a year from 2017 through 2020. The strength of our underlying business plans also provides us with confidence in targeting about 4% annual dividend growth beginning in 2017 and running through 2020.","With that, operator, let's open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Neel Mitra of Tudor, Pickering. Please go ahead.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Good morning.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","I had a question as to how often you plan to file rate cases within the U.S. both in Pennsylvania and Kentucky now that the capital spending is coming down to some degree, given that transmission in Pennsylvania and the ECR in Kentucky is somewhat coming to an end. How often do you need to file in order to avoid under earning? And kind of what's the criterion which you'll go in for a rate case or what your earned ROE needs to be before you go in to take that risk?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Sure. Let me begin with Pennsylvania. So, on the transmission side, we're continuing to build out many projects, and those projects are included in our five-year capital spending plan that's included in the appendix of our presentation today. So, that work will continue on. Relative to Pennsylvania distribution operations, that capital spending is coming down, and we would not expect the need to go in for a rate case in Pennsylvania during our forecast period. In Kentucky, I'll let Vic comment on our plans there.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Well, as we just announced today, we just filed this morning, so I suspect I'd (20:54) like to see the outcome of this case before I speculate on when we would file again. But generally speaking, when we get below 10% or so, we begin to look at whether or not another case is required. I should also point out that given the current status environment of regulations, I still would expect there to be substantial expenditures associated with our ECR, both in terms of the $1 billion that was just recently authorized by the commission to meet some of our coal combustion residual requirements and then also now we have some water issues that are going to require us to file under the ECR. So, I still think there will be a lot of money running the ECR. Let's get the outcome of this case, and generally speaking, when we get below 10%, we begin to look at additional cases.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Thanks, Vince. And just one addition, some of this could be dependent also on the results of the Clean Power Plant and how that may roll out into the future in terms of at least the Kentucky operations.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Could you remind me the rider (21:55) that you have in place for ECR and how much that covers regarding contemporaneous spend?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Sure. Go ahead, Vince.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Under the terms of the statute, we're entitled to recover cost both capital and O&M associated with the Clean Air Act, and generally speaking, that handles most of things associated with not only the Clean Power Plant you've discussed the match (22:20) requirements and all of those types of expenditures. I don't have a breakdown with me of how much is in rates now and how much will be in rates, but generally speaking, it pretty broadly addresses almost all of the environmental requirements associated with our coal combustion facilities.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","And it's near real time.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","It is near real time. We file it and we recover it almost instantaneously, I think about a 60-day delay.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Got it. So, the Kentucky rate case that you're filing now, is that more for distribution spend? Is that the way we should look at it?","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","It's for everything not associated with environmental spend. So, it would be things not associated with the ECR filing. So, for example, as Bill pointed out, we're looking for things like additional reliability on distribution system, additional automation on our distribution system, additional rebuild of our transmission systems. So, it's really driven by bricks and mortars associated with distribution and transmission, and there is some capital in there that's not associated necessarily with coal combustion.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Got it. And then quickly, could you just update us where you are with any Compass approvals and where you are in the progress with that project, just with the first phase?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Sure. I'll ask Greg Dudkin, President of our Pennsylvania Utilities, to address that one.","Gregory N. Dudkin - PPL Electric Utilities Corp.","Sure. Yes, so where we are is, we have filed an interconnection request with New York ISO. We're expecting a response shortly on that. And for New York transmission projects, you have to go through something called Article VII, which is environmental citing and need process, and we're in the process of starting that up. And I should add that that Article VII process normally takes two to three years.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thank you very much.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Abe Azar of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Good morning.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","When do you expect new rates will be in place for the Kentucky Utilities? And can you remind us what your history is of settling rate cases there?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Sure. The expected rates would go into effect, if approved by the commission, in July of next year. Our history of settling has been very solid. We operate, we believe, in a very constructive jurisdiction in Kentucky, and I think all of our spending in the past has been well justified, and we've had what I think are fair and balanced outcomes through settlements. So that's been the pattern thus far.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. That's all I have. Thank you.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Sure. You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Paz of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","David A. Paz - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. Good morning.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Good morning.","David A. Paz - Wolfe Research LLC","I heard earlier someone there mention water issues. I just wanted to make sure I understood. What are the water issues you referenced earlier with respect to capital spending? How much is that? And is that already in your five-year plan?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Yeah. Those are water effluent guidelines that have been issued by the EPA, so it's not a new issue. And we're looking to see if we have a breakdown of exactly how much that is. We may not have it here at hand, but we can get that to you.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","This is (26:24). I should also comment that we're in the process now of reviewing those regulations. They only recently promulgated, and so those regulations and how we're going to comply with them, we're also finalizing those estimates, and I suspect we'll be in a better position to comment on that at the next call.","David A. Paz - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Okay. And I presume the next call is when you will update your five-year plan to include, I guess, 2021?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","That's correct. Yes.","David A. Paz - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. And then, just on the 2019 specifically, 2019 hedges. I just want to make sure I understand. What has changed since the October 12 call? (27:05).","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Just really the fact that we were able to execute the plan that we talked about on the October 12 call. We had outlined what the strategy was, and we had executed some of that plan, but now we've completed the restrikes for 2016 and 2017, and we're able to do that at the rates that are shown on slide 14, which shows, as Vince commented, that when we get out to 2018, we've got hedges on at $1.42, well above our $1.30 that's embedded in our earnings expectations, the 5% to 6% earnings growth. So, that gives us $0.12 of potential value that we could move to hedge 2019, if need be.","David A. Paz - Wolfe Research LLC","Got you. Okay. And as long as the pound is within $1.15, $1.25, you're relatively protected in 2019. And if the rate is above $1.30 or so, $1.35, that's when you say you can move to 2020 protection.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Well, first off, let me just comment on, if the pound stays at, let's just say, $1.20 and above, what you can see on this slide is at $1.20, we would effectively be able to use that $0.12 from 2018 and hedge up 100% of the 2019 exposure. To the extent that we don't need 2018 value to hedge 2019, we would then look forward to 2020, and we could use some of that value for 2020 if we needed to.","David A.

Spence","Thanks, Joe and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call today. We appreciate your continued interest in PPL, and as always, we look forward to answering your questions. To facilitate more interaction on these calls, we're going to be condensing our prepared remarks today and we also have all 4 business unit presidents with us for the Q&A. Joining us today are Vic Staffieri, President and Chief Executive Officer of LG&E and KU, which is our Kentucky Regulated segment; Rick Klingensmith, President of PPL Global, who has responsibility for our United Kingdom Regulated segment and our Energy Services business; Greg Dudkin, President of PPL Electric Utilities, our Pennsylvania Regulated segment; and Dave DeCampli, President of our Competitive Market Supply segment; and of course, Paul Farr is joining us, our CFO. ","First I'll kick off the call with an overview of our first quarter results and operational highlights for the first 3 months of the year, then Paul will provide more details on our segment performance for the quarter. Following his remarks, we'll turn to your questions. With that, let's go ahead and get started.","Today we announced reported first quarter earnings of $0.93 per share, up from $0.82 in the first quarter of 2011. Earnings from ongoing operations for the quarter were $0.70 per share compared with $0.84 a share in the same period last year. Our first quarter earnings from ongoing operations reflect $0.14 per share of dilution from our April 2011 common stock issuance to finance our acquisition of the Midlands utilities in the U.K.  As you can see in our segment results for the quarter, we had very strong performance in the U.K., including the successful integration of the Midlands operations. These quarterly results demonstrate the value of our expansion and into diversified regulatory jurisdictions and the attainment of a more predictable earnings profile. While our Competitive Supply segment has become a relatively smaller piece of the pie, our Supply team continues to successfully navigate through these very challenging commodity markets. Paul will go into additional details on a segment-by-segment basis but the weather-driven weakness in our Domestic Regulated businesses were offset by the strength of our U.K. operations and very good Supply segment performance.","So despite the impact of the mild winter, our first quarter results keep us solidly on track to achieve our 2012 earnings forecast. Today we are reaffirming our forecast of $2.11 -- or rather, $2.15 to $2.45 per share in earnings from ongoing operations.","Now let's turn to a brief operational overview for the quarter.","Starting in the U.K., Western Power Distribution has fully integrated the Midlands operations on schedule and within budget. As you can see from the slides in the appendix to today's presentation, WPD employees have already made dramatic improvements in performance, resulting in material benefits not only for our customers but our shareholders as well. Our current assessment in the case that annual cash cost savings, for the Midlands operations, will be higher than what we projected during the acquisition announcement and equity financing last spring.  These cost reductions are not coming at the expense of customer service, rather just the opposite. In just 12 months Midland customers have seen a 40% reduction in customer minutes lost, an important measure of performance in the U.K. We've also accomplished a 96% reduction in customers out of service for more than 18 hours, a 26% improvement in the number of customers restored in just 1 hour, and a 22% improvement in the number of interruptions per 100 customers. These customer service performance improvements will result in additional incentive revenues in the future for WPD. We also believe that these improvements will further cement WPD's reputation as the gold standard for network operations in the U.K.","We recently received some very good news on the Susquehanna-Roseland Transmission Line project. The National Park Service confirmed our preferred route through the Delaware Water Gap as the most desirable alternative. We expect a final record of decision from the National Park Service in October. This timing will allow us to have the line is service to meet the 2015 PJM peak demand.","In our Competitive Supply business, we completed the acquisition of a 700 megawatt gas-fired power plant in central Pennsylvania. The purchase of the AES Ironwood plant represented an excellent opportunity for us to expand our gas fleet at an attractive valuation, and in our own backyard. All of our competitive power plants had high availability during the quarter and our gas-fired units saw increased run times as a result of low natural gas prices and a displacement of higher cost coal units. Our combined cycle gas units are already seeing close to maximum run times. For example, our Lower Mount Bethel was operating at a 92% capacity factor in the first quarter. Ironwood had very strong numbers as well but that unit underwent a plant outage during a portion of the quarter.","Our energy market and trading operation is driving value from these assets through our expert knowledge of market dynamics. Our team has done an excellent job in capturing value and executing hedges at the right time, and as you can see on our hedge disclosure slide in the appendix, we've updated it to reflect actual results through the first quarter and the termination of the Southern Montana contract. The modest change in coal prices reflects the lower coal burns this year, shifting some of the deliveries to next year. Our hedge levels for power in 2014 are not materially different from the 10% to 20% we discussed on our year end call in early February. We have chosen to keep our hedging at this level because we don't see value locking in prices that we think are, currently, artificially low. We continue to believe that current forward power prices do not appropriately reflect the cost to comply with MATS and CSAPR rules or all anticipated coal plant closures. We also believe we can see even further heat rate expansion as gas and power prices continue to decouple in the forward years.","Finally we see current forwards being disproportionately affected by the short term weather, economic and gas market dynamics. These factors and the competitiveness of our mid-Atlantic fleet lead us to believe that there is more upside opportunity for 2014, than downside risk, at this point.","On the nuclear front Susquehanna Unit 1 is in the midst of its refueling outage. You may have seen our recent press release indicating we've identified several cracks on low pressure turbine blades on Unit 1 and will be scheduling an inspection of unit 2 turbine blades as well. As we said in our release, the financial impact of these replacements is not expected to be material.","Moving now to the Pennsylvania Regulated segment.","I'll provide you with a summary of the distribution rate case increase request that PPL Electric Utilities filed with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission just at the end of March. We expect that any approved increase would go into effect January 1, 2013. Slide 7 provides some details of the request. We expect the PUC, following its normal procedure, to announce its plans to conduct a formal proceeding on the request. These proceedings will include technical and public input hearings during the summer, an administrative law judge-recommended decision in the fall and a final PUC vote, which is expected in December. As indicated on the slide, a 1% change in the allowed ROE amounts to about $23 million in revenue. This case does not include any request for alternative rate treatment or a DSIC mechanism under the new Pennsylvania Act 11 law. That law does not permit filing of DSICs before January 1, 2013.","As always we'll keep you posted on the rate case developments and we provided a docket number here so you can follow the proceeding.","As I mentioned earlier, our first quarter results provide us with additional validation of the robustness of PPL's current portfolio. Because of the geographic and regulatory diversity of our business, we remain on track to achieve our earnings forecast, despite some of the mildest winter weather that our domestic utilities have ever seen. Over the past several months I've been asked numerous times about potential changes in the company strategy under my leadership of PPL. I've obviously been very involved in our strategic direction for some time and I believe time has proven the value of the steps we've taken over the past several years. Going forward, our focus is going to be on delivering high-quality service to our customers and remaining flexible in our Competitive Supply business to respond to dynamic market conditions. I believe our current business mix is one of the most attractive in the sector as we have significant growth opportunities in each of our Regulated business segments and a very competitive generation fleet.","With 70% of our 2012 ongoing earnings coming from growing rate-regulated businesses, we have a very solid platform for continued growth. We're forecasting compound annual rate base growth of about 8% over the next 5 years in our utility operations in the U.S. and the U.K. The resulting $8 billion of net rate based growth will come from infrastructure investments, much of which have already been approved by regulatory agencies or recovered in formula rates. This includes the improved environmental cost recovery spending in Kentucky, our approved capital spending in the U.K. through early 2015 and transmission projects in the U.S. We also received regulatory approval, yesterday from the Kentucky Public Service Commission, to both acquire and build gas-fired generation in Kentucky. Our regulated utilities are recognized for high-quality customer service, excellent reliability and positive storm response which, as you know, are keys to successful long-term regulatory relationships and customer satisfaction. PPL will continue to be sharply focused on these important areas. While many of us await improved fundamentals in the electric commodity sector, PPL's favorable mix of nuclear, coal, gas and hydro facilities gives us flexibility in the current market, and will provide significant upside potential when markets ultimately recover.","In summary, I continue to believe that PPL's current strategic position is a compelling one and our focus will be on the execution and delivery of the commitments that we've made to customers and our share owners. I look forward to your questions following Paul's comments. Paul?","Paul A. Farr","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Before I provide details of the earnings drivers for the first quarter, I first want to discuss the equity financing that we completed in early April through a forward transaction. This offering, combined with our existing DRIP and management comp programs, fulfills the $350 million of equity need for the year that we have consistently communicated. We decided to issue the stock through the use of a forward contract in order to de-risk the equity exposure we had and accomplish that without affecting the expectations we set regarding share count and EPS for the year. In fact, the EPS impact is actually pushed out slightly beyond the late 2012 timeframe that we recently communicated to you. As part of our internal comprehensive risk management program and for the same reasons we had generation, output, fuel, interest rates, our currency for known exposures, we used this forward transaction to mitigate risk around our equity need. Beyond the de-risking benefit we also wanted to alleviate a potential overhang on the stock which several of you have recently voiced as a concern. Given the current state of commodity markets there has been concern that we may need additional equity beyond the $350 million previously communicated. We do not.  The regulated acquisitions we completed, combined with modest amounts of equity to fund rate base growth, provide credit stability that will help us endure prolonged weak commodity markets.","With that, let's move to Slide 8 to review our first quarter financial results.","PPL's first quarter earnings from ongoing operations are down from a year ago, driven by $0.14 per share of dilution associated with the April issuance, last year, of common stock to finance the Midlands acquisition; lower energy margins at the Supply segment; and lower electricity sales due to the extremely mild weather experienced in our U.S. service territories. These negative drivers were significantly offset by strong operating results in the U.K., including the Midlands operations that we acquired April 1 of last year.","Let's turn to the Kentucky Regulated segment earnings drivers on Slide 9.","Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.06 per share in the first quarter, a $0.09 decrease compared to last year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower margins due to lower retail electric volumes from mild weather, which impacted margins by $0.03, as well as lower op system sales. We had higher O&M primarily due to the increased scope of scheduled generation outages in 2012, higher depreciation due to higher plant and service and dilution of $0.01 per share.","Moving to Slide 10.","Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.31 per share in the first quarter, a 15% increase over last year. The increase was due to the operating results of the Midlands utilities, net of interest expense associated with the 2011 equity units and higher delivery margins in our legacy WPD operation, primarily driven by the net impact of higher prices and lower volumes. These positive earnings drivers were partially offset by higher O&M, including higher pension expense; higher U.S. income taxes; and dilution of $0.06 per share.","Turning now to our Pennsylvania Regulated segment on Slide 11.","This segment earned $0.06 per share in the first quarter, a $0.05 decrease compared to a year ago. This decrease was the net result of lower delivery margins of $0.02, primarily due to unseasonably mild weather; modestly higher O&M; higher depreciation, again due to higher plant and service and dilution of $0.01 per share.","Moving now to Slide 12.","Our Supply segment earned $0.27 per share in the first quarter, a decrease of $0.15 compared to last year. This decrease was primarily the net result of lower Eastern energy margins, driven by both lower energy and capacity prices, and partially offset by higher nuclear generation; higher O&M; lower income taxes, primarily due to a lower state effective tax rate; and finally, dilution of $0.06 per share. ","And with that, by way of review, I'd like to turn the call back to Bill for the Q&A period.","William H. Spence","Okay, operator, I believe we're ready to start the call -- or the questions rather.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","You're certainly messaging a pretty constructive or more constructive than market view on 2014 power markets. How long do you guys feel comfortable not getting more active in the hedging program as you look out that far? I guess, is question number one.","William H. Spence","Sure. Well, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are thinking that, at least at this point, the MATS and CSAPR impacts are not appropriately reflected. I think we'll probably learn a lot, Dan, potentially, from the capacity auction when the results come out and see what units are actually going to be retired. But beyond that, there is a point at which we're going to begin to hedge in. We won't leave it completely open until we get to 2014. So I think, as we've done in the past, we have a fairly disciplined hedging program. We have plenty of time, at the moment, to make those decisions and pick our spots when we hedge in. And I think, in the past, we've done a really great job of picking those times to hedge in. So I think we're going to have an opportunity, and if it gets too late in the process, we'll begin to selectively hedge in.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, in Pennsylvania with the rate case, can you just remind on thought process? Not necessarily for this case, but for next cases as far as when you're going to file again since you're not going to get the mechanism this time through. Does it mean that there's going to be another case shortly thereafter so you can get the DSIC in place after this case gets done?","William H. Spence","Yes, Dan, we would expect that once this case is completed we would file for the DSIC and then, probably in future rate cases, we would use a future test period.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And you're going to file that in '13, at some point in time then?","William H. Spence","For the DSIC, yes. I think for the rate case itself, that's yet to be determined.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I got it. Just, comprehensively, on weather for the quarter. How much was the overall drag, Paul, if you were to add up all the pieces between supply and U.S. utilities?","Paul A. Farr","If I took the $0.03 in Kentucky plus the extra $0.01 of all systems sales, which also -- there was just outright demand destruction across many systems, it was about $0.04 in Kentucky and then $0.02 in EU, so a total of $0.06.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kit Konolige with Konolige Research.","Kit Konolige - Konolige Research, LLC","So on the question of equity, Paul, you were pretty clear that you're not going to need additional equity related to I'd say a cash shortfall that might be arising from low commodity prices. What's the outlook over the next several years? You have a significant structural free cash flow deficit. What's the schedule for funding that with equity and how should we view it overall on how equity fits into your cash needs over the next few years?","Paul A. Farr","Okay. I'd really break it into 2 component pieces, Kit. We will be getting incremental cash of roughly $2 billion over the next 2 years from the conversion of the converts. So that equity will provide a meaningful de-levering of supply and results in incremental cash to the company. On top of that, we think we'll still need the roughly $350 million per year, for the next several years, as we make our way, especially through the large rate-based build in Kentucky. And after that program is complete, the cash flows are relatively robust there. The CapEx programs, I would look at, kind of projecting forward, the levels of spend that we got in both EU and in WPD. There are strong opportunities and needs to put capital to work there, but the big build in Kentucky does have some finite into it. So I think we've got plenty of equity opportunity just given how we finance the 2 acquisitions, and then later in that $350 million per year that we've talked about, at least for the next several years.","Kit Konolige - Konolige Research, LLC","So we should think, in terms of some time in '13, you would logically be raising equity again in an offering similar to this one?","Paul A. Farr","Yes, that's correct and I would be looking late in the year like we were this year.","Kit Konolige - Konolige Research, LLC","Very good. Okay, one other question on the Pennsylvania segment. What's the kind of run rate of your actual return on equity at this point?","William H. Spence","Yes, Kit. I'll ask Greg Dudkin, the President of our electric utilities to answer that.","Gregory N. Dudkin","Kit, we're running about mid-single-digits on our ROE for our distribution at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin McCann with S&P Capital IQ.","Justin C. McCann - S&P Equity Research","I have 2 questions, one for Paul and one for Bill. Paul, just a follow-up from Kit's question. What do you expect the average diluted shares to be for '12, '13 and '14?","Paul A. Farr","Just one second, I'll pull those numbers for you. So for '12 it's right around 585 million shares. For '13, around 615 million and for 2014, 670 million, roughly.","Justin C. McCann - S&P Equity Research","Okay. And, Bill, at the reception in New York last month, and basically this [indiscernible], you mentioned the [indiscernible] of the gas prices for power prices. If you could elaborate on that.","William H. Spence","Sure. I think what I'm really referring there to is the correlation between gas and power which had been historically in the last decade or so, very strong, is already beginning to break down. So you're seeing improved heat rates, particularly on gas units, of course. And what we're seeing there is the fundamentals of the power side beginning to take over just the strict correlation of the marginal fuel in PJM. So as more units are being retired and supply and demand come in to closer balance, we're really seeing the fundamentals of the power market driving power prices not just fuel input such as natural gas.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I wanted to touch base with you on the tax rate. It looked like it was a little bit lower and I guess that was coming from supply. I'm not completely clear. Could you tell us what happened there?","William H. Spence","Yes, we come from a combination of supply, which I referenced. And that was just a couple of cents of share from the lower effective state tax rate. The bigger driver, year-on-year, is going to come from the change in the business mix of the company. The U.K. effective tax rate for that segment is only 25% versus the other segment that run closer to 35% to 37%. So just the change in the business mix is going to drive a lower effective tax rate.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, great. And then secondly, the coal burn. You mentioned that some it is going to be pushed into next year. How should we be thin about that from an earnings perspective? I mean in other words, are you deferring higher cost coal into next year's burn, so to speak?","William H. Spence","I would say, Paul, it's probably not meaningful or material from a coal burn and coal cost input side. There is delaying or pushing out of coal into next year because we're not burning it this year. I'll ask Dave DeCampli to provide anymore color on that. If you would Dave?","David G. DeCampli","Yes, Paul. We're working very hard with our suppliers on a number of fronts, deferrals, altering the mix and consumption schedule for the balance of 2012 and making some adjustments. So we're calling it not material at this point because we're relatively in good shape for 2012's inventories.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, great. And then just finally, the mark-to-market gain that you guys are going to be realizing into 2012. That's going to be going into operating earnings, is that correct? It's being excluded from operating earnings. I guess it would've been a positive. And how is it going to impact 2012 and does it go just in 2012? Does it go beyond that?","Paul A. Farr","No, it'll go beyond that, Paul. Primarily, rates relates to some correlation breakdown in our Eastern hedges. From a FAS 133 perspective, there's still very good hedges from an economic and risk perspective and so we'll match those periods as those contracts deliver, and it's 2012 and 2013 primarily.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Kordell with Jefferies.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I want to focus on Susquehanna nuclear plant and how you think -- you have Unit 2 down for inspection and if you guys -- if you do see the cracks, will you guys put blades in or will it be a de-rate of the unit?","William H. Spence","First, we would absolutely replace the blades. We would probably not do a de-rate but I'll ask Dave DeCampli to talk about the timing of the Unit 2 outage.","David G. DeCampli","Yes, Anthony. The Unit 2 outage is scheduled later this month and we expect it to be somewhere around 20 days and that will be dependent upon what we find in the turbine. We do have the blades available on standby to replace. We've gotten rather efficient at the inspection process at this point. So we're thinking it will be somewhere about 20 days, depending on what we find once we get in the turbine.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Does the 20-day outage include if you had to replace the blades or 20 days of inspection and blade replacement will be incremental?","David G. DeCampli","Call the inspection process the first 10 days, once the unit cools down and we gain access to it. And then the replacement will be very dependent upon whether we have to pull the turbine out of its saddle or not. And we'll have to do with the number of blades that we find cracked. So on the short end, it would be 20 days.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So first question, just kind of bouncing off what Public Service said the other day, are you guys anticipating higher Rose than the Susquehanna CapEx here, just given what's happened of late, first? I didn't really see any kind of material change too much.","William H. Spence","No, I'm sorry. No, we don't expect too much material change in the Susquehanna Roseland CapEx.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then secondly, with regards to coal prices this year. It seems as if it just went up a slight hair there, $1 a ton. Is that basically, call it, payments for taking delivery at a later point in time?","William H. Spence","It is. It's primarily a timing issue, yes.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Excellent. And broadly speaking, what are you seeing on the coal side, in terms of the capacity factors for the balance of the year? You would think, intuitively, call it the gas switching would somewhat alleviate in the summer months. Just kind of what kind of capacity factors are you seeing on your baseload units?","William H. Spence","Yes, correct. I think for the summer months we're going to see the coal units return to their traditional baseload operation. I think, in the fall, of course it's all going to be dependent upon natural gas prices, as well as coal prices. But I would expect that we would see -- hopefully, if you see normal weather, you'd see more run time than we signed the first quarter. But with the current natural gas price to coal price relationship, I would expect that the capacity factors in the fall are going to be less than what we've historically seen. But probably not as bad as the first quarter.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Interesting. And you guys have commented a little bit about O&M hit this year. Just curious, to the extent to which you run your coal plants less. How much of an O&M benefit could we potentially see there? We heard some other companies discuss that.","William H. Spence","Yes, there is an O&M benefit when you're off-line and there's also a margin benefit when we are highly hedged, as we are. We're essentially able to buy power cheaper than we can produce it at those coal facilities. So there's a dual effect there, if you will, that did help us in the first quarter and could help us in the fall as well if we see similar conditions. As far as an exact number on the O&M. I don't know that it would be that material, that I could say that -- that would be measured in pennies, probably not nickels and dimes.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. And then just the last question, sort of a small detail. The Montana contract rejection. What kind of an impact are you guys seeing there just annually?","William H. Spence","Well, of course, it's all dependent on where we can place the power that otherwise was contracted for by southern Montana. But having said that, I would say, it's again, it's one of those things that's not extremely material. And as we mentioned we're maintaining, and are comfortable, with the midpoint of our earnings.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Bischof with MorningStar.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick questions for you this morning. On the Midlands integration, you mentioned you were trading above your initial synergy savings. Are you willing to provide a new range or any clarity on that?","William H. Spence","I'll let Rick Klingensmith, the President of our global operation, answer that.","Rick L. Klingensmith","As you saw on the earnings release, the news release that came out, we have increased our forecast for this year up to $1.07 a share. And that incorporates the additional benefits we're seeing from the integration of the Midlands operation. And that's pretty much where we're heading out, thus far, for this year in our forecast.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And I have a question to the capacity factors. Your net gas plants, you mentioned about 90% factor at that one plant. Is this a dramatic case or is it safe to assume that these are kind of factors across all your plants?","William H. Spence","Well, on the natural gas plant side?","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Yes.","William H. Spence","I would say -- I mentioned, also, that Ironwood was out on an outage for some period of time. That still saw about a 76% capacity factor during the quarter. So I would expect, with similar conditions, that we would be at a 90% type capacity factor.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Paul, when you gave those forward-looking share counts, did that contemplate new equity or is that kind of as we sit today?","Paul A. Farr","Yes, contemplated new equity. So it would be impacted by the converts converting as well as some amount of the incremental equity, for that, on an annual basis, as I mentioned.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And your CapEx forecast, does that include generation in Kentucky gas-fired generation?","Paul A. Farr","Yes, it does. For both the combined cycle, gas unit that can't run, as well as the ELS power acquisition.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I guess, a follow-up on Susquehanna. You said minimal impact, but is that as we sit today and if it does require a teardown and take the turbines out, could it be more than immaterial?","Paul A. Farr","At this point, I don't anticipate that, no. Could it be? Yes, of course I can't say it couldn't be. But based on what we found on Unit 1 and the fact that the Unit 2 blades are relatively new, having been replaced last summer, I wouldn't anticipate that we're going to get into a situation that's significantly different from Unit 1, where we essentially replaced one row of blades. So that would be, in my view kind of the expectation would be if we get in there and find some damage. We'd be looking at replacing one row of blades.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Is this warranty work?","Paul A. Farr","The blades are under warranty and until we determine the final root cause, we'll continue to work with the vendor and work those details out.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Are there any LDs on lost opportunity?","Paul A. Farr","No.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Bank of America.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just might be, first a couple of follow-ups. The hedge and effectiveness gain that you pulled out as a one-timer. When it does effectively come back, isn't it effectively kind of a loss then?","Paul A. Farr","No. Until the correlations would come back in, they couldn't be redesignated but the mark-to-market would start from the beginning of the period where the effectiveness reoccurred if we elected to put them under 133. Again, which we're not necessarily going to do. So in similar ways, to where we've had smaller amounts of ineffectiveness in the past, we've seen special items debits and credits up and down, this was larger than maybe some of those historical movements have been and that's why we called it out for you so you understood what was happening. It would match...","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Well, just my thought is that if you have a favorable hedge like this and you ended up, for accounting, having to book the benefit upfront when we see the hedge flow-through in '12 and '13, is the hedge effectively kind of gone? Could you book that benefit upfront?","Paul A. Farr","Well, I mean ultimately all these contracts will go to delivery. We fully expect them to and we'll settle at the contracted prices, so the intervening mark-to-market up and down, which would normally be in the balance sheet, only that hits the P&L, we've carved it out. So you won't see the loss in the future either, if you will, in the same way that the benefit has been carved out, so would the movement back to contracted price.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, okay. So that might also get booked as one-time in these next 2 years? Or...","Paul A. Farr","I would expect the mark-to-market on these to continue through contract delivery on these contracts. Correct.","William H. Spence","It's a good question, and just to be clear, we don't expected it to, from an ongoing earnings perspective, have any impact on our business plan.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Secondly, what are you seeing in your region regarding basis, both in the quarter but also kind of forward? Are you still kind of at flat basis to peak in West or any update there?","William H. Spence","Steve, we saw in the first quarter about a negative $2 basis. Obviously, there's the weather and natural gas prices and West Hub prices had a significant impact on that number. I guess, the drivers that I have mentioned on previous calls, that move the basis around, natural gas prices, transmission outages, new lines coming in, et cetera, all are still in play. And there is an awful lot of transmission work being done in the region, throughout the region. So I think our expectation is to still see some pressure on basis in the upcoming months and through the rest of this year. We'll have to reassess after the summer where we think basis is going to travel, but for now, we think that negative $2 is what delivered in the first quarter and it's going to continue to have some pressure. Now the good news, Steve, is that we've had some very effective hedges in place that have helped offset that for us. So from a impact to PPL, it was really neutral during the quarter even though -- had we been unhedged it would have been a negative $2.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, and then just finally a follow-up on coal. Just how do your -- maybe a little more color on where your coal inventories stand in the various regions.","William H. Spence","Sure. I mean, like a lot of folks, we have built up quite a bit of inventory but we still have room to go at our stations so it's not a pressing issue for us at this moment and many of our units are back online as we speak. So we're going to be bringing the coal power, probably down again, a little bit. But we've been pretty effective at, I think, deferring some deliveries. We worked very closely with our coal suppliers to really manage the inventories during this time. And then I think, in the West coal strip, it's a mine mouth plant so we don't have the same issues out there, in terms of inventory, as we do in the East.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Raymond Leung with Goldman Sachs.","Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I think Paul mentioned that proceeds from the converts, that $2 billion, and you also mentioned about de-leveraging supply. Can you sort of give us some context of what you think is a right leverage metrics for supply? And then also staying on supply. As you sort of look at your business, obviously, you transformed into more regulated. How should we think about longer-term degeneration business as part of the overall family?","Paul A. Farr","Okay, let me tackle the credit one and Bill can comment on the more strategic perspective of generation. From a credit perspective, as I indicated, we've got $1.15 billion that's converting in mid-'13 we've got $950 million converting in April of '14 related to the equity converts that we did as part of both deals. Effectively, what will happen is that equity happens at core, if you will, and will get injected into supply allowing supply to de-lever. The 2 rating agencies -- well I'll talk about the 3, but S&P -- I'll talk about 2 in the 3. S&P looks at PPL on a consolidated credit basis and so they look at consolidated FFO and consolidated debt. That movement down to supply would be, effectively, inconsequential to them, which is effectively taking debt that's at Supply and moving it up the core. And in all this, we're trying to maintain investment grade credit ratings, obviously for Supply, which enables us to get the liquidity at reasonable prices to do the hedging. For Moody's, they [indiscernible] for us on an entity by entity basis and I think -- I won't speak for them, but if we can maintain 20%-ish FFO at the debt metrics, I think we can maintain investment grade. We'd like to be more robust and I think, by the time we get out a couple of years, we'll see some of the fundamental benefits that Bill talked about in terms of power prices, in terms of tighter capacity margins and that will clearly provide opportunity for the fleet. So on a year by year basis, you could can look at things and they may look a little tight, but I think you can put it in a reasonable enough time horizon, and with the amount of incremental small equity needs that I talked about, year-on-year, we can manage through this.","William H. Spence","On your question on the competitive generation fleet. As I think about it, scale we have that; the mix of generation is very good; we're in a very good market here in PJM; very visible prices; and of course, a very good capacity market. And you have to keep in mind, even if we were not looking at the competitive generation, we still have 8,000 megawatts, over 8,000 regulated generation in Kentucky. So we have a sizable fleet with around 20,000 megawatts. So we do have the scale in good markets. And I think, as Paul mentioned earlier, we have the ability to weather the down cycles, now, in the commodity cycle because of the robustness of the Regulated businesses. So overall, I feel like it's a fit for the company, continues to be a fit for the company and a potential upside as we go into the future. And just a final note, from an environmental perspective, I think you're aware that on a competitive fleet side, we're very well equipped to deal with the MATS and the CSAPR. So we're not looking at any major new incremental investments on the environmental side.","Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Just one follow-up question for Paul. Would you look at -- if you were to reduce debt at Supply, would it be more just as they mature or would you do something a little more proactively there?","Paul A. Farr","We'd probably look as things mature and as we're closing out the construction programs in the next 12 months or so, around both Rainbow and Holtwood, so that growth CapEx, if you will, kind of goes away. And our teams are looking very hard. I think we've talked about in the past the cutting of, roughly over the 5-year plan, around $500 million of CapEx from that segment. We're continuing, as power prices have come down, to continue to look at O&M and CapEx there to try to help alleviate some of the stress as well. The markets aren't viewing the value of the plants quite as highly and we'll have CapEx in line to make sure that they're available, but prudently available if these challenging markets -- as we make our way through that market cycle.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Chin with Citigroup.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Could you just walk through the rationale on your earlier comment about filing for the DSIC sometime in '13 and I'm looking at the forward test, your mechanism, a little bit at some point in the future beyond that. Why split those up as opposed to doing it together?","William H. Spence","Well, I think we've got the rate case we just filed. We would expect the outcome January 1, rates to be in effect January 1. So I think we have to balance the company's needs with customer reaction to rate cases just one after another after another. So I think we have to keep that in mind and in consideration. Greg, I don't know if you have any other comments you want to make other than -- maybe you can comment on the DSIC and how we would approach the DSIC.","Gregory N. Dudkin","Yes. So to supplement those comments, so the rate case that we're filing or that we filed in March will become effective January 1, and that's based on our 2012 capital and O&M projection. So the DSIC, the reason why we're filing the DSIC next year is so that we can get timely recovery of ongoing distribution investment for '13 and beyond. So that's the rationale. And then should we need another base rate increase in the future year, we'd look to most likely, utilize the fully future test year as the way to do that.","Paul A. Farr","Yes. Remember, Brian, under the new law, if you will, entities can't file for the DSIC until 1\/1\/13 and they need to have an adjudicated ROE to be able to make that filing. So the general rate case that we filed this year gets that piece of it done and then, from a timing perspective, we can file beginning 1\/1\/13 and we'd be looking to do that.","William H. Spence","And I think, Brian, what we would do is -- we'll look at -- when we get into next year, we'll look at the outcome from the current rate case. We'll look at the impact that the DSIC have on a timely recovery of our CapEx and where we project our ROE and then we'll make a decision at that time. So I'm not ruling out the possibility that we might not file another one but we just have to be mindful of the impact on customers and so forth.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And then one other question. Roughly, ballpark, hedging on '14. Where is the company at?","Paul A. Farr","Sure, we're in the same -- essentially, the same position we were at year end -- or on the year end call, about 10% to 20% hedged for 2014.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","If the view is that gas may decouple from power because of retirements, does it make sense to use forward gas sales to maintain your heat rate upside as opposed to just throwing naked long on power? Are there any considerations on that front?","William H. Spence","Yes, there are some considerations of that front. We have done some of that in the past and we'll continue to look at that as an opportunity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium Asset Management.","Ashar Khan","Can you just talk to us a little bit regarding the U.K. regulatory process, in terms of the fast track, and could you just give us a bit of a timeline?","William H. Spence","I'm going to ask Rick Klingensmith to take that one.","Rick L. Klingensmith","Regarding the regulatory process in the U.K., the real process that Ofgem has established is in full speed ahead with the transmission and the gas distribution and gas transmission sectors. For the electricity distribution sector we're in the very early stages and those stages are really around policy development right now, stakeholder engagement. We will see a strategy document and consultation likely issued in the fall, issued by Ofgem, and then a decision documented perhaps the first quarter of 2013. We will start preparing our business plans for submittal in the May, June '13 timeframe and then Ofgem will decide further, in late '13, as to do any of that electric distribution business plans that have been submitted. Will they be eligible? Are they complete and robust enough to be fast tracked through the process? And you'll see some publications of that probably in late '13 and a final decision on electricity distribution fast tracks in early '14. And again, our rates will be effective in 1st of April 2015. You have seen, just recently, Ofgem and the transmission rate case price control reviews, they have fast tracked 2 of the Scottish transmission companies. And so we view that very positively and that the process is working. It allows those business plans to move forward and save about a year in the regulatory cycle for the price control review.","William H. Spence","Well, I think that wraps up the call for today. Really appreciate everyone dialing in and look forward to talking to you on the next quarterly call.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PPL Corporation Fourth Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Joe Bergstein, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Joe Bergstein","Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining the PPL conference call on fourth quarter results and our general business outlook. We are providing slides of this presentation on our website at www.pplweb.com. Any statements made in this presentation about future operating results or other future events are forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from such forward-looking statements. A discussion of factors that could cause actual results or events to vary is contained in the appendix to this presentation and in the company's SEC filings. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Miller, PPL Chairman.","James H. Miller","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for participating in the call today. As most of you -- I think all of you know, I'll be retiring from PPL at the end of March, so this will be my last earnings call with you. Obviously, it's been a real thrill with serving PPL for the last 6 or so years as Chairman and CEO, and it certainly has been a highlight of my career. A lot have changed, a lot of interesting transactions throughout the sector and certainly, many, many, many challenges that we've tried to seek, finding the opportunities within that realm of challenge. ","I would say that PPL is fundamentally a very strong company, and we've made significant progress over the past few years in further strengthening the foundation, which we can continue to grow the value for the share-owners. And I am real confident that you're going to see the best years of PPL ahead as a result of the work we've done over the last several years. We've got a great team in place under Bill Spence's leadership. I'm sure he'll turn that confidence into a reality. So I thank all of you on the phone for your interest in the company and for your diligence in assessing PPL's performance over the years of my tenure. ","So I wish each of you continued success and good fortune in your areas out there. And again, I think you'll see PPL flourish under its new portfolio structure, and a lot of opportunities lie out there ahead for us. ","So today I'll talk a little, just a little bit about the overview of 2011 results and talk a little bit about our positioning for the future. Then Bill will provide an overview of our '11 operational performance, a review of future prospects for each of our business segments, and a bit of discussion on our 2012 earnings forecast. And then Paul Farr, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide very detailed financial review before we turn to your questions. ","As you saw in the announcement, fourth quarter earnings of $0.69 per share compared with $0.73 in the fourth quarter of 2010. Earnings from ongoing operations for the fourth quarter were $0.70 per share compared with $0.83 in the same period a year ago. Our reported earnings and our earnings from ongoing operations were each $0.13 per share lower than a year ago due to dilution from the April 11 common stock issuance. For the quarter, both reported earnings and ongoing earnings were pressured by lower wholesale electricity margins at our Supply segment. ","Turning to the year-end results, we announced 2011 reported earnings of $2.61 per share, an increase of $0.44 per share over 2010. Our 2011 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.72 per share compared with $3.13 per share in 2010. Now the '11 earnings from ongoing operations reflect dilution of $0.75 per share due to the June 2010 and the April 2011 issuances of common stock to fund the Kentucky and U.K. acquisitions. Strong '11 results were driven by solid performance in each of our business segments, and I'm also pleased that we're able to announce this morning a rough 3% increase in our annualized dividend. Our quarterly dividend will now be $0.36 per share. The increase is further indication of our continued confidence in the strength of our portfolio and our prospects for future growth of the company. ","Before turning the call over to Bill and Paul, I'd like to review some of the significant factors that position us well for the future. Clearly, we think our business mix has shifted significantly towards rate-regulated earnings, providing us stability and security to our earnings forecast, dividend and credit ratings. ","Approximately 70% of our projected 2012 earnings per share will come from regulated businesses, and we expect compound annual rate base growth in these businesses of nearly 8% over the next 5 years. That growth would result in an $8.1 billion increase in the asset base of our regulated companies by 2016, the equivalent of adding another large regulated utility to the portfolio. Much of this rate base growth comes from planned CapEx, that's already been reviewed by various regulators with very little lag in earning a return for shareowners. ","The business mix improvements we've made over the past 2 years of have resulted in an excellent business risk profile rating from S&P, putting us in a category with only 2 other companies in our sector. So our stable earnings mix also makes our dividend more secured and gives us platform for continued growth. And while wholesale electricity prices remain depressed, our high-quality competitive Ghent fleet provides upside in stronger energy markets. Baseload plants and PJM are complemented by a flexible mix of gas-fired units that'll position us well on the largest wholesale market in the world. ","Fuel mix of our fleet differentiates PPL from many other power producers in the sector. Diverse fuel mix provides us competitive advantages in a variety of market conditions over fleets that are heavily dependent on one fuel source. Over the past several years, I believe that our management team has consistently proven its ability to make the right strategic and tactical calls. Already our team in the U.K. has made meaningful improvements in the Midlands operations, achieving the financial objectives we announced at the time the deal was signed and subsequently financed. ","While we have accomplished a great deal, challenges certainly remain. I'm confident, however, that Bill and his team of excellent executives will continue to turn these challenges into opportunities and growth for our shareowners. ","So I'll now turn the call over to Bill, the PPL's new CEO. Bill?","William H. Spence","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to first take this opportunity to thank Jim on behalf of the executive team and all the employees of PPL for his outstanding leadership in the company over the past 6 years. In guiding PPL through a very challenging time, Jim not only ensured the company weather challenging market conditions, he led the implementation of the strategy that has significantly strengthened the company. ","Under Jim's leadership, PPL fundamentally repositioned itself with 2 transformational acquisitions and aggressive hedging program that has added tremendous shareholder value and operational performance that ranks among the best in our industry. Congratulations, Jim, on an outstanding career, and thanks for all you've done for PPL. I'm honored also to have been selected to carry on your excellent leadership. ","And speaking of carrying on, let's next turn now to Slide 6. As Jim noted, 2011 was a very successful year for the company. PPL has had now 12 consecutive quarters of very solid performance and 3 consecutive years of exceeding the midpoint of our ongoing earnings guidance. And as Jim mentioned, we've completed 2 transformational acquisitions in an extraordinary fashion. In 2011 we seamlessly acquired and permanently financed Central Networks in the U.K. We implemented our integration plan very close to targeted cost and at the high-end of our expected range of synergies. We overcame extended nuclear outages in poor market conditions in our Supply business, and our Electric Utilities in Kentucky and Pennsylvania provided solid results in a lackluster economy. ","I'll briefly review each of the 4 business segments starting with the U.K. Our WPD CEO, Robert Symons, and his team developed a very aggressive efficient integration plan, following our acquisition of the 2 Central Networks utility operations last April. I'm very happy to report that all of that significant operational integration is now complete, and that Western Power Distribution is now serving over 7 million customers with a radical improvement in WPD Midland's operations in just 9 months. This is possibly one of the most dramatic changes ever made in the U.K. utility industry, and I expect WPD Midlands will now join WPD South West than WPD South Wales as the U.K.'s front-tier performers on several incentive measures. ","These dramatic improvements are appearing in 4 key areas: percentage of customers restored to service within one hour of high-voltage fault; minutes that customers are without service; the number of customers without service for more than 18 hours; and the number of customer interruptions per 100 customers. There are charts in the appendix of today's presentation that detail some of these significant improvements. While these measures are expected to result in incentive revenue opportunities for the company beginning in 2013, customers in the Midland region of the U.K. are already seeing the benefits of our ownership and our proven operating model. ","Our experience in the first 9 months of operating the larger WPD has confirmed our beliefs, that this acquisition will create significant benefits for our customers and PPL's shareowners. ","Turning back to the U.S., we achieved a significant milestone when the Kentucky Public Service Commission unanimously approved the settlement of a critical environmental cost recovery case for LG&E and KU. As a result of the settlement and KPSC action, we now have the approval and the cost recovery mechanism to move ahead with approximately $2.3 billion in environmental upgrades necessary at our regulated coal fire plant in Kentucky. ","The agreement provides for a 10.1% return on equity for these projects, which will be completed over the next several years. In Pennsylvania, our electric distribution operations certainly had its challenging year, facing 2 of the most damaging storms in the company's history in just a 2-month period. In addition to significant flooding in some areas of our territory. In all cases, our experienced and dedicated crews did an extraordinary job restoring service to customers at very difficult circumstances. In the restoration effort, we received excellent help from other utilities from our mutual assistance program and from PPL's sister companies LG&E and KU. ","Regarding customer service, PPL Electric Utilities, LG&E and KU have continued to garner additional J.D. Power awards. In total, the 3 companies now have 32 J.D. Power awards more than any other utility in the U.S. ","Turning to the Supply business segment, we were able to achieve our 2011 earnings expectations despite the extended outages at our Susquehanna nuclear plant, which caused us nearly $100 million in pretax margins. Our team brought both units back in it service within just 6 weeks, and they've operated reliably ever since. ","And the rest of our Supply business, including our marketing operation and our other power plants rose to the challenge, significantly offsetting the loss of nuclear output, demonstrating the value of our diverse fleet. I'm also pleased with the work our coal group did in 2011, negotiating a long-term rail contract for coal delivery. While the details of the contract are confidential, I can say that we were able to negotiate a multi-year contract that is expected to provide more stable coal transportation cost.","Coupled with our other transportation arrangements, we expect to maintain overall transport cost in the low to mid-$20-per-ton range for the next several years. ","In summary, over the past 3 years, PPL's made and financed bold acquisitions, completed swift integrations and executed value-accretive generation hedges. This is in addition to the strong operational regulatory performance. Our resulting business mix of high-quality utilities and diverse competitive generation provide the strong foundation that Jim talked about, creating shareholder value. As Jim said, we believe PPL's best years are yet to come. ","Before discussing our earnings forecast for 2012, let me take a few minutes to review the positioning of each of the 4 business segments. Starting with the International Regulated segment, the headline here is that the U.K. operation is a highly-attractive rate-regulated business with expectations of significant growth. The U.K. regulatory system provides network operators with pre-approved 5-year forward-looking revenues, which are inflation-adjusted and take into account capital spending, as well as O&M cost. In addition we have the ability to earn incentive revenues, and we face no volumetric risk. This results in a real-time return of and return on capital investment without the lag that is often the norm in the U.S. regulated businesses. ","WPD is the top-performing electricity distribution business in the U.K., leading the way in capital and operating cost efficiency, customer service and reliability. In the past 7 years, we've earned more than $380 million of incentive revenues, the highest percentage of bonus revenue among U.K. electricity distributors. As I mentioned earlier we have completely transformed the Midland operation in just 9 months, clearly positioning us to earn additional incentive revenues. ","PPL Kentucky operations represent a very positive case of \"what you see is what you get.\" LG&E and KU are efficient well-run utilities that are also projected to have significant rate base growth in the coming years. As the result of the constructive regulatory climate that's focused on the long-term needs of customers, we have in place mechanisms that provide for timely return on a substantial portion of the CapEx plan over the next 5 years. We currently estimate compound annual growth in our Kentucky rate base of 9.6% over the next 5 years. We're also forecasting significant growth in both our transmission and distribution rate base in Pennsylvania. On the transmission side, we now estimate a compound annual growth base rate of nearly 22% through 2016. ","This is driven by the 145-mile Susquehanna-Roseland transmission project and other initiatives to improve aging transmission facilities in Pennsylvania, including a recently announced significant new project in the Pocono Mountain area. There have been some recent positive developments regarding the approval process for the Susquehanna-Roseland line, and we hope to receive approval from the National Park Service before the end of this year. ","We're also continuing to upgrade aging infrastructure on our distribution system, which covers 29 counties in Pennsylvania. Our distribution improvement efforts are expected to result in a 6% compound annual base growth over the next 5 years. A related positive development on this front comes from the legislative initiative to provide an alternative ratemaking mechanism in the state. This mechanism would permit the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to authorize recovery of costs for pre-approved infrastructure improvement projects to our distribution system improvement charge. ","This legislation was passed by the State House incentive within a year of being introduced. The Senate bill passed unanimously and then moved back to the House for concurrence, where it also passed unanimously just this past Tuesday evening. Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett has been supportive of the legislation, and we would expect them to sign the bill within the next week. The legislation will take effect within 60 days of the governor signing. We would anticipate the model tariff and other PUC guidance to be completed this year, and companies would then be in the position to file for recovery using the new mechanism early next year. ","While the industry continues to face the challenge of low wholesale power prices, our competitive generation business continues to be well positioned, having the diversity to capture value in a variety of market conditions. In PJM, we have more than 2400 megawatts of low marginal cost nuclear and hydro facilities, in addition to the 2,800 megawatts of efficient supercritical coal units that have state-of-the-art emission control equipment that put them substantially in compliance with new emission standards without any major investments. We do not believe current forward prices reflect the costs that comply with MATS or CSAPR rules and industry-wide expected coal plant closures. Our fundamental analysis suggests forward power prices are not reflecting the incremental costs necessary to comply with EPA rules, which we estimate to be in the $3 to $5 per megawatt-hour range. Of course, notwithstanding this fundamental analysis, the current market reality is power prices remain soft. ","PPL's well positioned in these challenging markets, and I point to a couple of factors. We've been very successful on hedging our generation for '12 and '13 and have one of the strongest hedge profiles in the sector. But beyond hedging, I believe an often overlooked and highly attractive aspect of our fleet, is the more than 2,400 megawatts of gas-fired plants we have in PJM. Our gas-fired assets are capturing an increased share of the markets, as they've been running at near baseload production levels. ","For example, in 2011 they ran at a combined capacity factor of 78%, that's up from 43% in 2009. Our gas fleet can benefit from lower gas prices. Displacing less efficient coal units, this should help offset some unhedged dark spread risks associated with our coal assets. And of course, this is precisely the benefit of fleet diversity. Our flexibility and fuel type, dispatch response and technology type provide opportunities and reduce volatility under a variety of market conditions.  And to further enhance our fuel diversity, we are exploring options to operate some of our coal units of natural gas. ","Turning to the next slide, we provide a regular look at hedge positions for 2012 and 2013. We've increased hedged levels for both years, and provided a range for our hedges, reflecting potential variability and generation production and our use of options. Each can cost some variability in the hedge volumes. ","Focusing on 2013, the additional hedges were primarily for off-peak power. You may remember that during the second quarter call, we actively hedged 2013 to capture an increase in power prices, and at that time I indicated those hedges were biased towards on peak power. The hedges we executed since the third quarter essentially bring our booking balance between on peak and off-peak. ","Looking at the intermediate and peaking data, you can see we've increased our expected production from the gas-fired units caused by the market dynamics, that I described earlier. This increase partially offsets our lower expected output from the baseload coal fleet. ","Before I turn the call over to Paul, let me summarize our 2012 earnings forecast, and then I'll ask Paul to take you through the details. This morning we announced the 2012 earnings forecast of $2.15 to $2.45 per share. While this forecast is, as expected, lower than the results we achieved in 2011, I want to highlight several important points before Paul provides a detailed review of our 2012 guidance. ","The largest driver is an expected decline in energy and capacity margins from our Supply business, as higher price hedges are rolling off. I don't think that's a surprise to any of you on the call. The lower supply margins are partially offset by 4 additional months of earnings from the Midlands utilities. Again, I don't believe this is unexpected. However, it's important to note that our forecast for International, exceeds the expectations relative to 2012 net income we'd previously communicated to you. As you will see from Paul's slides and what may not be as expected, we are planning to spend significantly more in improving our customer service and reliability in Pennsylvania and Kentucky. ","This increase amounts to about $0.15 per share compared with spending in 2011. As you know, many utilities, including PPL, were hit with devastating storms in 2011. While PPL companies responded very well, we believe there are areas for improvement that will help us do an even better job, when faced with such challenges in the future. We believe the proactive approach will not only improve service to our customers, but will maintain or improve our regulatory margin as we faced rate proceedings in 2013 and beyond. ","Finally, I wanted to highlight that our Supply business operating expenses in 2012 are roughly $0.10 per share higher than 2011. This increase is driven by more plant fossil outages and higher costs at our Susquehanna nuclear plant, some in response to anticipated NRC initiatives. ","In closing, I'd say that 2011 was another solid year for PPL's, particularly in terms of challenges met and opportunities seized. We're well positioned for 2012, and our announced dividend increase reflects our optimism in the PPL strategy. ","Now let me turn the call over to Paul.","Paul Farr","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 13 to review fourth quarter and year-end results. As outlined on this slide, the largest positive driver of earnings from ongoing operations in the fourth quarter came out of the U.K. and was primarily due to earnings from the Midlands acquisition. This positive driver was more than offset by the combined impact of dilution of $0.13 per share as a result of the common stock issued in April to fund the Midlands acquisition and lower energy margins, as we expected. ","Full year 2011 earnings from ongoing operations were favorably impacted by the financial performance of our utilities in U.K. and Kentucky. These positive drivers were offset by dilution of $0.75 per share, resulting from the common stock issued in June 2010 to fund the Kentucky acquisition and the common stock issued in April of last year to fund the Midlands acquisition. ","As forecasted our Supply segment had lower margins in 2011 compared to a year ago. Because the Kentucky acquisition did not close until November 1, 2010, the fourth quarter results are not fully comparable. However, I'd like to remind everyone that the Kentucky Regulated segment earnings include 4 major items: the operating results at KU and LG&E, the holding company costs at LKE, interest expense associated with the 2010 equity unit issuance and dilution of $0.11 per share. ","Let's move now to the International Regulated segment earnings drivers on Slide 14. Our International Regulated segment earned $0.87 per share in 2011, a $0.34 increase over 2010. This increase was due to the operating results of the Midlands utilities, net of interest expense of $0.05 per share associated with the 2011 equity unit issuance, higher earnings in WPD's legacy businesses, resulting from higher delivery revenue primarily driven by higher prices and a more favorable currency exchange rate. This was partially offset by higher pension expense, higher income taxes and dilution of $0.24 per share. ","Moving to Slide 15, our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.31 per share in 2011, a $0.04 increase over 2010. This increase was the net result of higher delivery margins, primary due to the distribution base rate increase that went into effect in April 1 of last year. Lower O&M -- lower taxes primary due to a Pennsylvania state tax benefit related to the 100% bonus depreciation last year and dilution of $0.09 per share. ","Turning now to Supply on Slide 16, this segment earned $1.14 per share in 2011, a decrease of $1.13 per share compared to 2010. Lower earnings in this segment were driven primarily by lower regulatory margins as a result of energy and capacity prices in the East, lower baseload generation, lower basis and higher delivered coal prices. This was partially offset by higher margin on coal requirement sales contracts. Also impacted 2011 results were higher O&M at Susquehanna in our fossil and hydroelectric stations in the East and the West, higher income taxes, primarily due to valuation allowances on Pennsylvania net operating loss carryforwards, that were driven by lower projected future taxable income, including the impacts of bonus depreciation and lower forward energy prices. Finally, dilution of $0.31 per share. ","Turning now to Slide 17, as Bill already mentioned, we are announcing our 2012 earnings forecast range of $2.15 to $2.45 with the midpoint of $2.30 per share. This slide shows the year-over-year change in earnings by key drivers within each segment. The $0.13 impact of dilution has been removed from the segment earnings and is shown as a separate line item on the graph. We expect increased earnings from the International Regulated segment primarily due to an additional 4 months of earnings from the Midlands businesses, basically our 4 highest earning months of the year, and an annualized increase in delivery revenue of 9.5% effective April 1. ","Partially offsetting these positive earnings drivers are higher O&M, higher depreciation, higher income taxes and a less favorable currency exchange rate. We expect lower earnings from our Supply segment in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to lower energy margin, as a result of lower energy and capacity prices, and higher fuel costs, partially offset by higher nuclear and coal generation output, higher O&M primarily due to additional plant outages at our Eastern fossil and hydroelectric stations, higher depreciation, higher income taxes and an assumption of lower realized nuclear decommissioning trust earnings that we experienced in 2011. ","The lower earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment are primarily due to higher O&M, as a result of plant increases and system reliability work and customer service costs, as Bill mentioned, and higher, depreciation resulting from higher plant and service. We also expect higher income taxes as a result of the 2011 Pennsylvania State tax benefits related to bonus depreciation that will not continue into 2012. ","These negative earnings drivers are expected to be partially offset by higher delivery revenue, primarily on the transmission side of the business. We expect lower earnings from the Kentucky Regulated segment due to certain regulatory initiatives in the areas of customer service, gas pipeline safety and infrastructure security, increased operating and maintenance costs from additional plant or plant outages and higher baseline spending. We also expect higher depreciation as a result of higher plant and service. These increased costs will be partially offset by higher budgeted electricity and gas margins due to expected low growth, our growing ECR rate base and base rate increases from Virginia and the FERC. ","On Slide 18, we provide updates on our free cash flow before dividends. For 2011, this graph obviously excludes the impact of approximately $5.8  billion necessary to fund the Midlands acquisitions. Our 2011 projected free cash flow before dividend has not changed materially since the third quarter call. A decrease in actual capital expenditures was due to lower capital spending in the Supply and Kentucky Regulated segments, partially offset by higher capital spending in International. The changing CapEx was almost entirely offset by a change in other net investing activities. ","The largest driver of 2012 free cash flow before dividends is projected capital expenditures of $3.8 billion, primarily at our rate regulated businesses. The details of our projected capital expenditures and related rate base growth can be found in the appendix of today's presentation. ","Partially offsetting the increase of capital spending is higher expected cash from operations in the International Regulated segment, primarily due to the additional 4 months of Midlands operations versus 2011. Cash from operations also reflects projected pension contributions of around $400 million for the year. ","Due to large fluctuations that can occur in certain cash flow items like changes in working capital and collateral requirements on power hedges, starting at 2012, we no longer plan to discuss quarter-over-quarter changes to our year-end projections of free cash flows before dividends. We will provide an annual estimate of free cash flow before dividends for the upcoming year at the time, we announce earnings guidance. You can obviously track the company's actual free cash flow before dividends using our SEC filings, though. ","Finally, turning to Slide 19, as Jim mentioned earlier, we have raised the annualized dividend 2.9% to $1.44 effective with the April dividend payment. This dividend level represents a 63% payout ratio based on the midpoint of our 2012 earnings forecast, and is expected to be more than covered by our rate regulated earnings. The combination of the acquisitions we completed over the last 2 years, the diversity of the competitive generation fleet and the growth prospects of our utility businesses clearly permit us to look at flexibility in growing the dividend in the future. ","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim for the question-and-answer period.","James H. Miller","All right. Thanks, Paul. Operator, open the call up for questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Marc de Croisset from FBR Capital Markets.","Marc de Croisset - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I just wanted to ask a brief question about the earnings trajectory or the trajectory for EPS growth, if you could comment on it. On previous calls, you mentioned your expectations for higher power prices in '13 and '14, and it looks like you still hold that view. But for the moment, we basically have a stay in CSAPR. We've seen substantial decline in forward natural gas and power prices. And so if this actually materializes, given these facts, do you see enough drivers on the regulated side to offset those headwinds and any impact from the converts to drive earnings growth in '13 and '14 from 2012?","Paul Farr","Okay. One of the reasons why obviously beyond just having rate case filings, that we expect for next year like we have multiple fronts. Clearly, the commodity markets are dynamically changing, and the environmental regulations stays obviously make it difficult to predict earnings on an intermediate forecast basis. I would expect as we look at current forward collar prices that we would be able to offset much of the decline that could come from margin declines with rate regulated earnings growth, that would be a combination of those rate case filings I've talked about, the ECR spending in Kentucky the, normal formula rate adjustments that we've got coming through the FERC jurisdictional transmission in Pennsylvania Electric Utilities, as well as obviously in this year in 2013, on an annualized basis starting April 1, I talked about the 9.5% revenue increase for that asset base, and that's going to continue to grow in '14 and beyond. I'd expect we'd be able to offset much of it. The question is obviously what happens between now and the time that we layer in the hedges that secure most or all of 2013, which I wouldn't expect to happen until we move further in the year, obviously. And then '14 as we've talked about in the past, is fairly open. So it just depends upon on what happened in those commodity markets. I think, For what we have control over, we've executed very well in terms of the rate case filings and the settlements in those areas, and I'd expect we'll do the same in '13. The thing that we don't have control over is the commodity markets.","William H. Spence","Mark, this is Bill. I would say that for 2013, given that we're already over 80% hedged, we feel very good about earnings per share growth for '13 as we sit here today. I think Paul highlighted some of the other risks in '14 and beyond, that we're going to have to deal with. But the fact is with the mix that we have today, we are very much well positioned to combat something like this compared to where we were 18 months ago. So I think as we sit here today, we really feel great about the transformational acquisitions we've done and where we are relative to the commodity cycle.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ameet Thakkar from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ameet I. Thakkar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just had a couple of quick questions. It looks like the 2012 EPS guidance, it looks like you guys have a bit of a wider range than you historically have about $0.10 wider . And given, I guess, one-year hedge levels where they stand for '12 and a greater proportion of regulated earnings, I was wondering what kind of drove the wider range for this year?","William H. Spence","There were a couple of things there. Obviously, with the volatility in the commodity prices, even though we are substantially hedged, they're still of the intermediate and peaking units. They're open. There's still some unhedged baseload generation. That's clearly significant factor. With International, even though things are going very, very well and we're actually, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, forecasting net income well above even the upper end of the range we gave during the roadshow on the equity offering, we're still  9 months into the business, so there's potential variability there. Of course, with the economy being what it is, that's going to be a factor, in addition to weather, of course. So those are some of the factors that went through our minds as we looked at the range.","Paul Farr","I think also we've got for 2012, we've got about between actual results, where the currency rates are locked, and the hedges that we've got in place, about 82% of budgeted total year earnings are hedged from a U.K. standpoint. But there's a little bit of an open position there. Interest rates can move on as they can affect the index link bonds in the U.K. I think it will clearly take a combination of significant items to move us to the top or bottom end of the range. But we felt like given the very -- Bill mentioned weather, the weather was a fairly significant headwind for us in the fourth quarter. Very temperate in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky. It's been very temperate in Jan, Feb so far. So we just felt it was prudent to give a range that if a combination of items were to hit us, the range would be broad enough to accommodate those items.","William H. Spence","But I would say we feel very good about the midpoint of the range and confident that, that's an achievable target.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Jefferies.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess, my first question has to do with based on your projected level of contribution from the regulated companies in Pennsylvania and in Kentucky, what type of ROEs does that - earned ROEs does that get you to in 2012?","Paul Farr","In 2012, that would get us on the Pennsylvania Regulated front, and I'll leave the U.K. to the side, because we've talked about the U.K. in the past and where we get the below the double digits to middle double digits unlevered and get into the low 20s on a lever basis. Everything is pretty much fully unplanned on that front. We were in the -- with the benefits of -- which almost $0.04 of bonus depreciation benefit in Pennsylvania, get in the 10% to 11% in '11, I would expect with that not recurring and with the spending plan, what we've got for the customer and  reliability initiative we talked about that we'd be in the mid-single-digit range for Pennsylvania electric. And then in Kentucky, it's going to be in the 8-ish percent range, factoring in at the operating companies and not factoring in goodwill or anything like that, given where we expect the spending plans in those businesses to be as well.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Actually, a couple of questions. First on O&M cost in the U.S. both at the Regulated segments and at Supply, what's kind of embedded as a percentage year-over-year increase from '11 to '12? And how much of that is pension versus kind of true -- kind of late labor materials related O&M?","Paul Farr","When I look at the O&M across the board, of course, you're focusing on Slide 17, and leave International Regulated off, pension year-over-year domestically is $0.03 just in terms of rounded out in full. It's another $0.01 in the U.K., so it's a total of $0.04 from an ongoing earnings perspective related to the pension. Everything else would relate to either movement or higher levels of power plant outage experiences in both Kentucky and in the Eastern fleet, as I've mentioned in my comments. And then inflationary spending around wages and other benefits and things like that. So those will be the biggest drivers there. There are specific [indiscernible] related items in Kentucky, there are customer service initiatives and responding to an audit that we went through last year in Kentucky that requires some cost support, there's the initial reliability base measures that Bill talked about in the Electric Utilities that are several cents a share, as well. So it did -- only about $0.04 in total globally in pension, $0.03 domestic.","William H. Spence","And I would say, Michael, the way I'm looking at it, about half of the increases year-over-year are driven by the normal labor escalation and the pension cost that Paul mentioned. The other 1\/2 are initiatives specifically focused on customer service and reliability.","Paul Farr","Yes, now clearly we expect to recover those in the rate filings, as well.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if I look at the coal hedging for 2013 for the Eastern fleet, if that's delivered ton and it includes rail, and if it's low to mid-20s per ton of transport, that's implying like roughly $60, $62 a ton of delivered coal, a little bit below where we've seen over the last 6 to 12 months, kind of before the Appalachian coal prices range. Just curious, are you able to exercise -- are you benefiting somehow from proximity from mines? Are you signing longer-term contracts at lower prices but giving the mining companies a little bit more certainty over the longer term? Do you have some other form of buyer power? Just can you give any color around that?","William H. Spence","Sure. And yes, you're spot on in terms of the cost of the mine mouth, if you will. And that is really a function of longer-term contracts that we had negotiated some time ago and many of those contracts have collars that limit the increases. Of course, they also limit the decreases as well in a very soft market. But we're seeing the benefits, at least in 2012 and 2013 ,of the strategy we put in place a number of years ago to lock in a substantial amount of the coal at very favorable prices.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First question. With regards to the same hedging slide, I just wanted to kind of touch base on the expected generation number there. You talked about the offset from your gas portfolio. How much of the change down here is from coal? And how much of an offset are we getting, just if you could provide that in terms of terawatt hours? How much is one offsetting the other there?","William H. Spence","Sure. Yes, if you take a look at the slide and compare it to where we were at the end of the last quarter, on the 2012 side, expected generation in the intermediate went up from 6.2 gigawatts to 6.9, so that's substantial increase there. That is displacing, if you will, some coal generation, not so much on our own coal generation, but other less efficient units in the market. On the baseload side, you see most of the drop is in the East, although there is some drop in the West quarter-over-quarter. And for 2012, for example, we're at 46.2 gigawatts at the end of the last quarter and we're at 45.5 gigawatts in the East this quarter. That drop is really a combination of 2 things. One is more plant outages on the coal fleet but also less runtime, particularly in the off-peak hours from the coal fleet based on the current soft power prices.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","All right. Great. So there's nothing from the gas side now baked in the baseload for whatever it's worth, right?","William H. Spence","Correct, that's right.","Paul Farr","It's all down below.","William H. Spence","It's all down below. Even though it maybe running as baseload, we still categorize it in the intermediate to peaking area.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Perfect. And then a follow-up on the rate implementation. Assuming everything gets signed in Pennsylvania, I wanted to see, does this impact your timing of a rate case this year, are you guys still going to go in file a rate case this year and then next year go in and sort of true that up with the implementation?","William H. Spence","Correct. We would not anticipate any change in the rate filing we would make, which we would expect to file at the end of the first quarter here, where the rates effective 1\/1\/13 for that base rate case. For the enhanced disc, if you will, this distribution infrastructure charge, we would expect to file that in the first -- hopefully in the first quarter of next year. It would not be combined with the base rate case. I think if you read the legislation, you know that you have to have it filed within the last 5 years to file this rate proceeding, which we will have had. So we would use that as the basis for the launching off point, if you will, for the disc.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then the last question is more broad. When I look at the hedging in the Supply business, it seems that you guys might be pursuing a little bit less for requirement, perhaps, more on sort of residential retail, what have you. I just wanted to get the latest thoughts in terms of how you anticipate pursuing the various sales channels on that front.","William H. Spence","Sure. As I've mentioned previously, we do look to have a balance portfolio in terms of types of products that we -- and options that we use to hedge the fleet. So there is a combination of straight sales and West Hub that are just fixed-price. There is a combination of collars, and then we have retail, as well. At this point, the retail load is not a large piece of the hedge portfolio. It's growing, but it's probably one of the smaller pieces. It's really dominated right now, the hedges are, with fixed prices and collared products.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Bischof with MorningStar.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question for you in regards to MAAC. What do you think is kind of the likelihood that MAAC will really face legal challenge and on what grounds do you think someone would base that legal challenge on?","William H. Spence","I'm sorry it was a little hard to hear the question.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry. What do you think is the likelihood that MAAC rule will face legal challenge and what grounds do you think someone would base that legal challenge on?","William H. Spence","Yes. That's so hard to predict. I don't think we have a feel at this point for whether it will be challenged. My guess is that like all these rules that have come before it, there will be some type of challenge. How it's challenged, I really can't say.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","It's actually Kevin. On the U.K. operations, what level of incentive and bonus revenues are you assuming in 2012 guidance?","Paul Farr","In 2012 it was GBP 18.7 million, so annualized from April -- and that was based upon the results through March 31, 2011, probably a test year or accomplishment year. We would expect, so that would affect revenues from April 1, '12 through 3\/31\/13. We would expect to basically at least double that amount for the next year that would be ending here come March 31, '12. So from April 1, '13 through March 31, '14, it's from instead of $30 million, it's closer to $60 million.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then with the dividend, with the big increase, what is your dividend policy now and how do you expect to grow it in the future?","Paul Farr","We don't really formally have a policy. We focus very heavily on clearly ensuring that the rate regulated utilities can more than fully cover the dividend. What I'd say is that we're trying as best as we can to grow the dividend, but at the same time, we've got very significant growth opportunities and capital and capital that we can deploy in areas where we earn basically immediate recovery. So I would expect when you look at that kind of a trajectory of earnings of the rate base and therefore, net income growth in the regulated utilities, it will be at a fraction of that. Whether it's 1\/3 of that amount or 1\/2 of that amount, I'm not entirely certain. There is an element that does depend upon as things kind of fall into line around the fundamentals around supply. We do consider supply, I know that's not as probably as specific as you want, but we don't target a specific payout ratio.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And last question is for 2012 guidance. Are you assuming like $300 million to $350 million of equity through your DRIP and other programs?","Paul Farr","Yes. That's saying we're at $350 million for 2012 as we have kind of discussed previously. That includes $75 million related to the DRIP and management comp, so it will be an incremental $2.75 of issuance. If the commodity market stays soft, I could see that staying at that level for the next couple of years when markets look a little better. We're looking at amounts less than that over the next couple of years. So that'll be a little bit dynamic, but I wouldn't see it moving materially at all from the $350 million over the next several years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Dancey with Cutler Capital.","Geoffrey K. Dancey - Cutler Capital Management LLC","I'm curious what you see in terms of further switching from coal to natural gas and how important it can be for you and just your broad observations on it, sort of across the industry.","William H. Spence","Sure, I think as we've already begun to see, there's significant levels of switching going on now. And I would expect that to continue with the soft natural gas prices. For us, as I have mentioned in my opening remarks, our capacity factor on our gas units was up around 78% last year. And roughly, almost double what it was 2 years before that. So we are seeing with our  fleet, and I'm  sure others are, significant additional runimes. As gas continues to go down, if the margins continue to improve, there's clearly some upside for those of us that have the capability to use these gas assets.","Geoffrey K. Dancey - Cutler Capital Management LLC","And what about just the considerations for new plants coming on. How long and how low do you need to see natural gas prices before you think new plants come on driven based off on natural gas.","William H. Spence","Well, I think that's heavily dependent not only on the energy price, but also on where capacity prices clear in the forward markets. I think if you look at current capacity prices that have cleared in the last few auctions, coupled with where energy prices are today. I don't think it would even clear the economic hurdles that you'd need to incent new generation. Having said that, as more coal units retire, certainly, the largest beneficiary from a technology standpoint are going to be gas-combined cycle units, and those typically take from on a greenfield site, you're talking about a minimum of 3 years between permitting and construction to put those into play.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark de Croisset from FBR Capital Markets.","Marc de Croisset - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just a quick follow-up. You mentioned you are lightly hedged in '14. I'm wondering if you might give us a little more indication around that? Is that a 20%, 30% hedging in '14? Or are you substantially open at this point?","William H. Spence","No, we're less than 20% out in 2014. 2010 and 20%.","William H. Spence","I was just going to note that we will probably -- when we substantially hedge more of 2014, we'll obviously add that to our slide deck in the future. But for right now, given that it's in that 10% to 20% range, we didn't think it was meaningful enough to put it onto the slide.","Marc de Croisset - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And maybe you commented on this. I don't recall exactly. But on Slide 17, you have Other as a headwind between 2011 and 2012. Can you describe a little bit more what is in that bucket?","Paul Farr","Yes. And I've talked about at a high level on my remarks, this is Paul. Let me kind of go through it segment by segment and tell you what's in Other. In International Regulated, that $0.11, $0.06 is depreciation, and $0.05 is taxes, income taxes. In the $0.10 of Other, in Supply, it's about $0.03 of depreciation, $0.03 financing, $0.02 nuclear decommissioning trust earnings being lower, and then $0.01 of truly other. Pennsylvania Regulated, o$0.01 of depreciation and $0.03 to $0.04 related to bonus depreciation that I talked about that wouldn't continue into '12, because the way the Pennsylvania interpretation was worded. And then in Kentucky Regulated, the other $0.02 of depreciation and $0.01 is a mix of other items.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont from Jefferies.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes. Just a clarifying question. If you were not to do anything, either to issue shares or repurchase shares, can you just give us a sense of what the diluted -- average diluted share count will look like in '14, given the converts?","Paul Farr","Given the coverts, we move from 550,000, 553,000 to 586,000 in '13. Let me take a quick look, 586,000 -- I'm sorry, 586,000 in '12. So it goes 615,000 in '13. Now that does include a modest amount of additional equity, so the DRIP in the management comp is in there. So if you back off probably call it 10 million shares from that, you're closer to 610,000 and then in the year like in '14, you ask for, which is 664,000 you'd probably have to back off 20 million to 25 million shares from that. So you're closer to...","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So that would be like 640,000 right?","Paul Farr","Like 640,000, right. In that zip code.","Operator","And we have time for one further question. It comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I Just want to ask quick questions on the regulated side. First, Kentucky, you mentioned you're going to file this year and Pennsylvania, you're still planning to file this year in Kentucky, that's a first question. Second question on the bill in Pennsylvania and the new alternative ratemaking process, can you give a little color in terms of how that will be implemented? Is it like a track or a formula rate plan? Or is it just a true multi-year forward test year? The way we read it, it seems like you almost have an option of an either\/or, but we'd love to hear your thought.","William H. Spence","Yes, of course, we'll see what the model tariff looks like from the PSC and any other provisions once they issue those. But on the Pennsylvania House Bill 1294, we do think there's an option there. You can either pick a forward test year or the disc-type mechanism. My understanding of it is, that it would be trued up on a quarterly basis, so you would file and there's a limit of up to 5% of your distribution revenues that can be filed under this, although you can ask for a waiver for additional, if you'd like. And we think that's a pretty substantial amount to go for, anyway. So I would think that we would file, as I mentioned earlier, some time early next year, and then we would probably lean towards the tracking-type mechanism more so than the forward test year, but we haven't made that determination yet. And that's just based on our early read of that. As it relates to Kentucky, we have not announced formally any plan to issue a rate or to file a rate case. Typically if we were to do so, we need to file that about 6 months in anticipation of the targeted date for implementation, 6 to 9 months in that range. As Paul mentioned, we're looking at ROEs in the 8 percentage range for this year, and we'll -- obviously, that's well below the authorized rates, so we're obviously going to be looking at our plans for filing a rate case for next year in the next quarter or so. But we haven't made that decision yet.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Meaning, you're looking at filing -- you're going to look at it in the next quarter or so about whether you would want to file midyear this year or about whether you would want to wait until filing sometime in 2013?","William H. Spence","Yes. Correct, but I guess; assuming the 8% holds, I would say it's probably more likely that we'd file for rates to be effective 1\/1\/2013, but, again, we haven't made an official notice or filing yet.","Operator","And presenters, I'll turn the call back over to you for any closing remarks.","James H. Miller","Okay. Thank you, operator. Well, thank you all for being on the call. I just offer, maybe 3 important points that the team I think has covered today. One, it was obviously 2011 was a good strong year. 16-or-so percent total shareholder return. I think, as Bill mentioned earlier, the range for 2012, we feel good about the midpoint of that range at $2.30. And I think to Paul's comments, we feel that although obviously natural gas prices are staying down, the reason we move the company in this direction is precisely to be able to perform and hopefully grow earnings during the sustained period of low grass prices. And at the same time, we're growing our dividends so that people -- dividend is important, too. They're being paid that dividend while we wait for probably a couple of years for prices to start to move up. But they will move up, given the ultimate retirement of coal and demand picking back up. ","So I think we feel as a whole that the company is positioned very, very well to face the future and we feel pretty good about where we sit today. So thank you all for being on the call and it's been great working with all of you. Take care.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"17615":["PPL Corp.

For a reconciliation to the GAAP measure you should refer to the press release, which has been posted on our website and has been filed with the SEC.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Spence, PLL's Chairman, President and CEO.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased that you could join us. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer as well as the Presidents of our U.S. and UK utility businesses.","Moving to slide three, our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our 2015 earnings results an operational overview, and a discussion of our 2016 earnings forecast, and our priorities for this year. After my remarks, Vince will review our segment financials and provide a more detailed financial overview.","Before I go any further, however, let me simply say that 2015 was a remarkable year for PPL. We successfully spun off our competitive generation business. In doing so, we better positioned PPL for future growth and capped our strategic transformation into a purely regulated utility business. We delivered more than $3 billion in infrastructure improvements, investments that are driving earnings growth and improving service to our 10 million customers.","We secured favorable outcomes in our Kentucky and Pennsylvania rate cases, successfully transitioning to RIIO-ED1 in the UK; we increased our dividend for the 13th time in 14 years; and we've delivered strong earnings results. Moreover, our stock outperformed our peers, the UTY and the S&P 500 Utilities Index.","PPL's total shareowner return of 6.2% on the year was higher than any other utility in the UTY. All were significant accomplishments during a time of significant change for our company and our industry. Today, we're announcing a plan to achieve compound annual earnings growth of 5% to 6% through 2018 off of our 2014 adjusted EPS of $2.03 per share. The continued excellent performance of our utilities gives us confidence in our ability to deliver competitive earnings growth and a strong dividend.","Turning to slide four. Today, we announced 2015 reported earnings of $1.01 per share compared with $2.61 per share in 2014. Our 2015 results reflect the loss from discontinued operations of $921 million or $1.36 per share resulting primarily from the June 1 spin-off of our competitive supply business.","Adjusting for special items, our 2015 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.21 per share. That's an increase of 9% from 2014 adjusted results of $2.03 per share. For the fourth quarter of 2015, reported earnings were $0.59 per share compared with $1.04 per share a year ago. Earnings per share from ongoing operations were $0.43 in the fourth quarter compared with $0.49 a year ago. The 9% or $140 million year-over-year improvement in earnings from ongoing operations was driven primarily by the benefits of our corporate restructuring, lower income taxes, and depreciation expense in the UK, higher returns on capital investments, and a mid-year Kentucky rate increases. Vince will provide more details on segment results in his remarks.","Let's move on to slide five for an update on our utility operations. On November 19, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a rate increase for PPL Electric Utilities. The action followed a settlement agreement that we reached with parties to our rate case. The increase, which took effect January 1 will provide an additional $124 million in revenue and help fund additional liability improvements as we continue to strengthen and modernize our Pennsylvania delivery network. This settlement was a black box settlement and does not specify an allowed return on equity.","Turning to Kentucky; Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities filed environmental compliance and cost recovery plans with the Kentucky Public Service Commission on January 29. The application seek approval an environmental cost recovery rate treatment for $1 billion in upcoming environmental improvement projects. These projects will ensure compliance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's new coal combustion residuals rule that became effective last year. The projects will involve capping and closing remaining ash ponds at our coal-fired power plants, building process-water facilities and completing the second phase of the dry storage landfill project at our E.W. Brown Generating Station. We expect to begin these investments in these environmental improvements in 2016, and they will continue through 2023.","Looking to the UK, WPD wrapped up the DPCR5 price control period March 31, 2015. WPD was the top performer over the period and earned $478 million by outperforming its incentive targets. We were consistently the best performer for customer service in all categories: customer satisfaction, customer complaints, and stakeholder engagement. During the price control period, WPD went through a major transformation applying two lower performing Midlands network operations in 2011, and very quickly improved their performance, which helped drive the significant incentive revenues earned under DPCR5.","Turning to the new RIIO-ED1 price control period, WPD continues to outperform its 2015 to 2016 performance targets and is on pace to be near the maximum incentive reward for customer minutes lost and customer interruptions. In addition, we're on pace to be near or at the maximum reward levels for customer satisfaction. During our last call, we raised our guidance estimates for the incentive revenues we expect to earn for the calendar years 2017 and 2018. Based on our continued strong performance to-date, we expect incentive revenues for 2016 to be at the high-end of our $120 million to $130 million range.","As you may recall, incentives for the 2015-2016 regulatory year will be received in revenues beginning in the 2017-2018 regulatory year, as there is a two-year lag. Details on WPD's performance and incentives are included in today's Appendix.","Turning to slide six, our 2016 earnings forecast is $2.25 to $2.45 per share. The midpoint of this range, $2.35 per share, represents growth of 6.3% compared to our 2015 earnings from ongoing operations of $2.21 per share.","As I highlighted in my opening remarks, the continued excellent performance of our utility operations and the organic growth from planned and approved infrastructure investments give us great confidence in our ability to achieve compound annual growth in earnings of 5% to 6% through 2018, again, off of our 2014 adjusted EPS of $2.03 per share. We expect EPS growth of 11% to 13% through 2018 from our U.S. operations with 1% to 3% growth expected in the UK. Vince will cover this in more detail during his remarks.","Turning to slide seven, I'm also pleased to announce our board approved an increase in our common stock dividend, raising it from $1.51 to $1.52 per share on an annualized basis. This marks PPL's 14th dividend increase in 15 years. This is consistent with our prior guidance of a modest dividend increase in 2016 as we work our way into the mid-60% payout range. We expect to grow the dividend more meaningfully, beginning in 2017, at which time we will target in the 4% range.","Now, let's move to slide eight and highlight some of PPL's objectives in 2016. A primary objective of ours is executing on our planned capital investment program of $3.5 billion. This includes expenditures to strengthen transmission and distribution networks and to make continued environmental improvements in Kentucky. In Pennsylvania, we're focused on advancing Project Compass, which is designed to provide significant benefits for electricity consumers in the Northeast.","In October, we filed an interconnection request with the New York ISO to build the first segment of Project Compass, a 95-mile transmission line between Blakely, PA and Ramapo, New York. We expect to start the next step in the approvals in the first quarter of 2016, New York's Article VII application process, which is a full siting and needs application.","We're also focused on completing our Northeast Pocono Transmission Line, a $350 million improvement project that includes 70 miles of new transmission lines, three new substations, as well as additional improvements. We expect to conclude that project this May, which is about a year ahead of our original schedule.","In Kentucky, our major focus will be approval of compliance plans and cost recovery for the environmental construction projects that I highlighted earlier. Another key objective is to work with the State of Kentucky to address the Clean Power Plan in the best interests of our customers and our shareowners.","In the UK, our team is focused on continued regulatory performance and adding to our long history of operational excellence. We'll also look to continue to hedge our 2018 British pound currency exposure beyond the 20% that we've been able to hedge to-date at or near our budgeted rate of $1.60 per pound. We built some capacity in our business plan to further hedge 2018 and at the current spot rate for the GBP \u2013 the pound of about $1.46, we feel confident that we will be able to achieve our stated earnings growth rate through 2018.","Turning to slide nine, we expect infrastructure investment to continue to drive rate base and EPS growth in the coming years. We plan to invest nearly $10 million from 2016 through 2018 to modernize and strengthen our transmission and distribution systems and to address environmental regulations in Kentucky.","Constructive rate mechanisms in the premier jurisdictions where we operate allow near real-time recovery of much of that investment. More than 80% of our regulated capital expenditures are subject to minimal or no regulatory lag. Based on planned infrastructure spending, we expect our rate base to grow by $4.3 billion from 2015 to 2018.","We expect compound annual EPS growth through 2018 of 5% to 6% above adjusted 2014 earnings from ongoing operations of $2.03 per share. As you know, prior to the year-end 2015, passage of the PATH Act by Congress extended 50% bonus depreciation from 2015 through 2017 with a phase-out reduction in bonus to 40% in 2018 and 30% in 2019 with 0% thereafter.","The impact of the bonus depreciation extensions are factored into our earnings projections. Vince will speak more about this in just a bit. We're confident we will be able to achieve this growth rate given our low-risk business plan, the premium jurisdictions in which we operate, and our demonstrated ability to manage our foreign currency exposure in the UK.","I look forward to your questions after we hear some additional earnings details from Vince Sorgi. Vince.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to slide eleven for a review of segment earnings. Full-year 2015 earnings from ongoing operations increased over the prior year from 2014 adjusted earnings of $2.03 per share to $2.21 per share, slightly ahead of the midpoint of our earnings guidance range. The main drivers of growth were higher earnings in the UK Regulated and Kentucky Regulated segments as well as lower costs in Corporate And Other partially offset by lower earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment. The favorable $0.10 in Corporate And Other is primarily driven by the corporate restructuring efforts.","Before I get into the segment details, let's briefly discuss the fourth quarter results as well as domestic weather for the year compared to the prior year and compared to our 2015 budget.","Our fourth quarter earnings from ongoing operations decreased over last year by $0.06 per share, driven primarily by lower earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment as a result of transitioning to the RIIO-ED1 regulatory period. Pennsylvania Regulated and Kentucky Regulated segments were both slightly negative this year versus last, reflecting the impact of unfavorable weather. And Corporate And Other was better this year resulting from the corporate restructuring.","Overall, domestic weather was flat compared to the prior year and had a positive impact compared to budget by about $0.02. Favorable weather for the first nine months of the year was partially offset by the warmer weather experienced primarily in December.","Let's move to a more detailed review of the 2015 segment earnings drivers starting with the Pennsylvania results on slide 12. Our 4Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.37 per share in 2015, a $0.03 decrease compared to 2014. This decrease was due to higher O&M expenses as a result of higher service company allocations due to the spin-off of the supply business, and also our strong performance throughout the year provided us the opportunity to take advantage of additional spending opportunities focused primarily on improving grid reliability, which should benefit future periods.","Depreciation was higher due to asset additions and we had higher financing costs related to prior year debt issuances. Partially offsetting these negative factors were higher margins from additional transmission investments and returns on distribution improvement capital investments, and lower taxes primarily due to the settlement of a 2011 gross receipts tax audit resulting in a $0.02 benefit this year.","Moving to slide 13. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.51 per share in 2015, a $0.04 increase from 2014. This increase was due to higher gross margins, which is the net effect of electric and gas base rate increases effective July 1, 2015, and returns on additional environmental capital investments, partially offset by lower volumes due to warmer weather in November and December of this year compared to the prior year and lower industrial sales.","And while the first quarter was colder than average, it was not as cold as the polar vortex-driven weather in 2014. These net positive results were partially offset by higher O&M expenses, including costs associated with the retirement of the Cane Run coal-fired facility of $0.02, and higher financing costs related to the September 2015 debt issuances.","Moving to slide 14. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $1.44 per share in 2015, a $0.07 improvement compared to 2014. This increase was due to lower U.S. income taxes, primarily from lower taxes on dividends in 2015 compared to 2014 and lower UK income taxes resulting from a lower effective tax rate in the UK due to a reduction in the statutory tax rate. Lower depreciation expense from the asset life extension we discussed earlier this year, also contributed to the improvement, which was partially offset by increased depreciation from asset additions. These increases were partially offset by lower gross margin as we transitioned to RIIO-ED1 on April 1 of this year, partially offset by the April 1, 2014 price increases and higher O&M expenses.","Before we move to the next slide, I wanted to mention that, similar to last year, we will provide you unaudited consolidated financial information for PPL Global LLC for 2015. We expect to furnish those statements separately in an 8-K to be filed at the time we file our 10-K in a couple of weeks.","Turning to slide 15. We have prepared a walk from our 2015 ongoing earnings of $2.21 per share to the $2.35 per share midpoint of our 2016 earnings forecast. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment is forecast to contribute $0.10 to the improvement in 2016 earnings. This increase is primarily driven by the distribution base rate increase, which became effective, January 1, 2016, and higher transmission margins and lower O&M. These positive drivers are expected to be partially offset by higher depreciation, higher financing cost to fund the capital growth in Pennsylvania, and the tax benefit received in 2015 from the release of a gross receipts tax reserve.","Our Kentucky Regulated segment also projects higher earnings of $0.06 per share. This increase is primarily driven by realizing a full-year of electric and gas base rate increases that became effective July 1, 2015, and higher returns on additional environmental capital investments, and higher retail load and other margins. Higher margins are expected to be partially offset by higher depreciation on the increased plant and service, and higher interest expense to fund the capital growth in Kentucky.","In the UK, we project slightly lower segment earnings due to higher financing costs, primarily from a full year of interest expense on the December 2015 debt issuances, higher depreciation expense from asset additions, higher taxes and other, and unfavorable effects of foreign currency, as we execute some 2016 restrikes to hedge 2018 earnings near our budgeted rate of $1.60. These negative drivers are partially offset by lower O&M, including pension expense and higher gross margins from price increases.","Corporate And Other is expected to be relatively flat year-over-year with slightly higher interest expense in 2016 driving the $0.01 decrease.","In addition, for the U.K. Regulated segment, you will see in the appendix, on slide 27, that we have provided one additional year of earnings projections. Our UK earnings guidance range for 2017 is $1.40 per share to $1.50 per share with a midpoint of $1.45 per share.","Turning to slide 16, as Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we are confident in our ability to achieve our 5% to 6% earnings growth targets through 2018, off of our 2014 adjusted ongoing earnings of $2.03 per share. We now expect 9% to 11% growth in our domestic utility earnings and approximately 2% growth coming from our corporate restructuring efforts, and we increased our expectation slightly in our UK business over this time period to 1% to 3% growth, up from 1% to 2% growth.","The 1% to 3% represents growth off of 2014 earnings of $1.37 per share, which incorporates the lower depreciation expense from the asset life extension and our updates on incentive revenues as well as lower net pension expense, in part due to updating our pension discount rate methodology to utilize the spot rate method recently approved by the SEC to measure both service cost and interest cost. This change in pension discount rate methodology was only applied to the UK pension plan, as the method we use in the U.S. to set our discount rate did not qualify for the spot rate method approved by the SEC.","Several key drivers to our organic growth in the domestic utilities include strong transmission rate base growth of 14% through 2018 in Pennsylvania, favorable rate case outcomes contribute to our growth in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky. The successful execution of our CapEx plans is critical for all three of our business segments. We continue to assume minimal load growth over the period in both Kentucky and Pennsylvania. Also, included in our 5% to 6% earnings growth forecast is the full five-year extension of bonus depreciation. As a reminder, when we updated our 2017 earnings growth target to 6% last quarter, we had assumed a two-year extension of bonus depreciation, incorporating the full five years of bonus depreciation did not have a significant incremental effect on our 2018 earnings. While extending bonus depreciation is a net negative to earnings, it is positive from a credit perspective, especially in the back end of the plan period.","Over the next five years, we expect bonus depreciation to reduce our Federal cash tax position by about $270 million. And we do not expect to be a significant cash tax payer through at least the next five years. The increase in available cash combined with our stronger earnings growth has enabled us to reduce our equity needs from $200 million per year to $100 million per year and maintain our targeted credit metrics.","For the U.K. Regulated segment, of course, executing on the Ofgem accepted RIIO-ED1 business plan has been built into the growth assumptions and provides eight years of base revenue certainty with continued opportunity to outperform targets. We have also assumed a budgeted currency rate of $1.56 per \u00a31 for 2016, $1.58 per \u00a31 for 2017, and $1.60 per \u00a31 for 2018, which includes existing hedge positions.","The inflation rate used for the 2015-2016 regulatory year tariffs was 2.6%, which will be trued up for actual inflation in the 2017-2018 regulatory year. We are now assuming the actual inflation rate for 2015-2016 will be 1.3%, and the adjustment to true up the 2.6% down to the 1.3% has been included in our 2017 and 2018 earnings forecast and affects 2017 revenue by approximately $0.03 per share. We have provided additional details on the true-up mechanisms to base revenue on slide 30 in the appendix.","Our RPI assumptions for 2016-2017 are now 2.3% and 3.1% for 2017-2018 consistent with the HM Treasury forecast. We have increased our incentive revenue estimate for 2016 to the high end of our previous $120 million to $130 million. We are assuming the same incentive revenues as last quarter for 2017 and 2018, and finally, we are assuming an effective tax rate in the UK of about 17%. For Corporate And Other, we have built into the growth rate achieving the full $75 million in corporate support cost savings and an additional $0.02 per share improvement by 2017.","On slide 17, we're providing an update to our view of domestic cash flows for 2015 and 2016. As you can see in the table, we expect to have sufficient domestic cash flows to fund our maintenance capital and the common stock dividend with almost $300 million left over in 2016 to fund dividend growth and growth CapEx. We have no domestic debt maturities in 2016, so the debt and equity issuances in the U.S. will fund the rest of our growth CapEx.","Moving to slide 18, our planned capital expenditures for 2016 through 2020 are detailed on this slide with regulated utility investment totaling about $16 billion over the period and about $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion per year. This includes previously announced initiatives such as UK spending for our accepted RIIO-ED1 business plan, executing on our environmental compliance plans in Kentucky to meet EPA regulations, updating and modernizing aging infrastructure in Pennsylvania including programs that identify areas to strategically improve system performance and reliability, and this capital plan still excludes any impacts of the Clean Power Plan.","Moving to slide 19, our revised capital plan reflects generally the same spending levels in the UK as last year's plan except for some slight increased spending on faults and overhead repairs in 2016. We reduced investment of approximately $650 million in Kentucky, as we deferred a projected Natural Gas Compliance Cycle Plant. However, new gas-fired generation may ultimately be part of our Clean Power Plan compliance strategy, which as noted on slide 18, is not included in our projections.","This was partially offset by additional reliability based programs in the transmission and distribution businesses in Kentucky, while environment spending has remained fairly consistent with the prior plan.","In Pennsylvania, we are experiencing higher than expected increases in reliability based on all the capital investment we've made to date. As a result, we now believe we can achieve our targeted reliability with about $270 million less of distribution capital compared to last year's plan. Anticipated transmission spend remained relatively consistent with the prior plan. These investments are expected to result in additional improvements in reliability over the next five years. And consistent with last year's plan, our capital plan is based on identified projects across the portfolio and does not include unidentified growth projects.","Turning to slide 20, our rate base is now expected to grow at a 5.3% CAGR over the next five years, which incorporates the five-year extension of bonus depreciation and the deferral of the second combined cycle gas plant in Kentucky.","And finally, moving to slide 21. On this slide, we provide an update to our GBP hedging status for 2016, 2017 and 2018 including sensitivities for a $0.05, $0.10 and $0.15 downward movement in the exchange rate compared to our budgeted rate of $1.60 on our open positions. We are 95% hedged for 2016 at an average rate of $1.56. For 2017, we have continued to layer on hedges during the quarter and have increased our hedge percentage from 66% at the end of the third quarter to 89% today at an average rate of $1.58.","You can see from the sensitivity table that there is no exposure for 2016 and minimal exposure for 2017. We've also started to hedge our 2018 earnings and are now 20% hedged at an average rate of $1.60. It's important to note as well that included in our earnings guidance ranges, there's enough dry powder to hedge about 50% of our 2018 UK earnings. After we get about 50% hedged for 2018, our risk program would not require us to layer on additional hedges until about mid-2017.","Switching to RPI. Also on this slide we show our RPI sensitivity, which has been updated as well. As I discussed earlier, we are now incorporating a 1.3% RPI rate in our current 2015-2016 planning assumptions compared to the 2.6% included in our tariffs. Therefore, the 2017 RPI sensitivity for a 0.5% downward movement in the 2015-2016 RPI is now off the current budget of 1.3%.","In November of 2015, we set our 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 tariffs based on the forecasted RPI at that time consistent with Ofgem's guidance. Now, that we've completed the tariff setting process for the next two regulatory years, in November of 2016 only one additional year of tariffs, for 2018-2019 will be set based on the RPI forecast at that time.","Overall, we're confident in our ability to manage our FX exposure and we've incorporated the low RPI environment into our earnings growth projections. That concludes my prepared remarks and I'll turn the call over to Bill for the Q&A period. Bill?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thank you, Vince. And operator, let's open the call for questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. And our first question will come from Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, guys.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Dan.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Bill, can you just maybe share some thoughts, you guys laid out a lot of the CapEx details, but, obviously, the Clean Power Plans, one of these yet to be determined, but potentially a big deal particularly for Kentucky. Given the fact the states now position, Pennsylvania is kind of just in a passive functionality, how do you guys see your two states playing through as far as coming up with plans? And when do you think you're going to get a better handle on, how you guys are going to try and work to comply?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Let me give some general comments and then I'll ask Vic Staffieri to talk specifically about Kentucky. But I think in both states cases, while they may be opposed and legally challenging the Clean Power Plan, I think, pragmatically speaking, they both recognize that probably beginning to work on a state implementation plan would be a prudent thing to do compared to just waiting, perhaps, a Federal implementation plan to be visit upon them. So, I think, generally speaking, both states, I believe, will constructively work with their utilities to come up with an alternative should their efforts to overturn the roll fail. So with that little bit of background, Vic, do you want to talk specifically about Kentucky?","Victor A. Staffieri - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Kentucky Utilities Co.","Yes. Just recently our Governor has announced that notwithstanding the fact that Kentucky will continue to litigate as well as our company, we will, in fact, be filing for an extension of time in September this year to push out the compliance \u2013 our compliance plans for at least an additional two years. I think, in the interim, we will continue to work with them to develop a plan that will be in the best interest of Kentucky consumers.","We will work with the Kentucky Public Service Commission, of course, to get a plan that's acceptable and then, from our perspective, I would anticipate us perhaps contemplating another combined cycle plan later in the planning spec, like outside this planning period probably by 2022. But I do think, Kentucky realizes that it would like to maintain the flexibility both to develop its own plan and not being subject necessarily to New York, because this was a Federal implementation plan. And second, be in a position to alter its plan to the extent litigation should be successful in part or in total.","So that's where we are. And I think it will be a constructive exercise for all of us. And I think the state recognizes the need to maintain its flexibility.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you. And so, I guess, should we just take from that we're probably not going to see a lot of incremental layering in of CapEx in Kentucky until there is more action on this front and those kind of the (33:50).","Victor A. Staffieri - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Kentucky Utilities Co.","I think that's spot on. Our initial projection would suggest we don't have to do anything until 2022. So you wouldn't see any capital expenditures as a run up to the \u2013 to a new power plant until \u2013 after the 2018 or 2019 that you're looking at now.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you for clarifying that. And then, I guess, on the FX calculation. I think you guys said that you could hit the 2018 number even if you were clear at $1.46 on the pound right now. If I look at your sensitivity, it looks like there's about a $0.10 exposure if you were to mark to today. Is there that much room in that pretty narrow 1% growth rate band to cover $0.10 of downside, or do you guys have a lower FX number kind of embedded in that $2.52 than what's on the table on slide 21?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Dan, we are very confident that we can still hit the 5% to 6% even under today's pretty weak pound. So, yeah, I think we do have levers to pull, O&M and some other things that we've looked at. So, I think, yes, we are still very confident that even with this weak pound that we can maintain that 5% to 6%.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Dan, it's Vince. I think if we have to hedge up everything at $1.46, we would be at the lower end of the 5% to 6% range, but we still think we'll be in that range.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then just on the hedging, so you needed to get up to about 50%, so 30% more kind of in the first half of 2016, and then you have a year until you have to do the rest of that, what that risk parameter would allow for?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, I would say throughout 2016, we'll execute on the rest of the re-strikes that we've embedded in the plan.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, got it.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Generally.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, generally speaking, that's correct.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","The next question will come from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Good morning, Vince and Bill.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Just a quick clarification. The slightly lower growth in the U.S.; that's a function of the bonus depreciation extension or the pushing out of the CPG-2?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Primarily bonus.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Okay, got it. And then, just lastly, just focusing on Compass, obviously a little bit of an undertaking here and you've announced the first segment. Were you at all or if you go into JV parts of this line, especially the New York portion, are you looking for partners? And then, how should we sort of think about the other segments being announced and whether the CODs of the other segments could be earlier than 2023?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Let me ask Greg Dudkin, President of our PPL Electric Utilities to take that question.","Gregory N. Dudkin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PPL Electric Utilities Corp.","Yeah. So with regard to potential JVs, we're prepared to go this alone. But if there is a JV that makes sense, we'll certainly look at that. As far as the other segments of the line are concerned, right now, we are focused on this segment and we'll continue to evaluate the other segments to make sure that we have the right cost, the right plans, the right modeling; and then as we get to a point where we believe that we have an exceptional project, we'll then release that similar to the way we did on the first segment.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Got it. That's helpful. And then just to confirm, this is completely additive to your growth trajectory.","Gregory N. Dudkin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PPL Electric Utilities Corp.","That is correct.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Excellent. Thanks so much.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So perhaps just following a little bit up on the last questions here. As you've been thinking about spending opportunities, obviously you're shifting things down a little bit. But in light of the bonus depreciation, is there any ability to accelerate some of the other spend that you would have otherwise had out in the future, just to kind of take advantage of those tax benefits and perhaps argue to some of the constituency of the business there is a real tangible benefit to doing so?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It certainly is possible. and just having seen this change here at the end of the last year, we'll look to that opportunity for additional spending once we begin the planning process again for this year taking us out through 2019. But, for now, we believe, we've got a really solid plan with all completely identifiable projects through 2018 that we are highly confident we can execute on, and we'll continue to look to see if there is additional projects we can bring into that window or the window just beyond 2018.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And then just to get a little bit more clarity on the change in the projected T&D expenses, you called it reliability spend, in Pennsylvania; how much of that reduction is tied to the negative sales normalized trend that we saw last year. Is it really just about a narrow view of the liability and how effective it is? Or how much does it tie into the sales forecast itself?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Relative to sales forecast, typically, and I think what you're probably referring to is new customer load predominantly. So that's pretty small \u2013 very small in the context of the large capital plan that we have. So it would not be a major factor in moving the CapEx around one way or the other.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. All right. Thank you guys.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Welcome.","Operator","The next question will come from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Hey, gents. Good morning.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Sorry, I don't want to be a nitpicker, but I wanted to follow-up on a couple of questions that were already asked. So if I look at your slide 21 and I just take the sensitivities that \u2013 sorry, slide 27, I was looking at your last deck, and just take the sensitivities to heart today, especially in 2018 on the pound, it would basically imply an $0.11 negative delta which would put \u2013 still put you at a little over a 4% earnings growth rate from 2003 to 2018, which given the hits other companies have taken from bonus depreciation, which still put you guys in the winning column. So how are we getting from the low 4%s to 5% under that scenario, because you guys seem pretty confident, you have the levers?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So part of it, as I mentioned, were the operating and maintenance expense timing, so we could move things around. I think also, as we've seen in the past, when we have years where we've got strong earnings either driven by weather or other events, we've taken that ability to go ahead and do re-strikes on the hedges or set in new hedges.","So I think we have built into the plan. I know we have built into the plan some re-strikes, some funds, if you will, for basically moving hedges around in time periods to meet our plan. So I think the combination of those two would probably be the two levers that would most likely get pulled to keep us at that minimum 5% EPS growth rate that we're confident we can hit.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thank you. And then my second question is, also if I just take to heart the 5% to 6% earnings growth range of $2.03, you've rolled out a 2018 earnings aspiration of $2.52. But you sort of left a gap in the 2017 timeframe. In the last presentation you gave \u2013 at my conference in early January, there was a sort of notional target of $2.42; I know that wasn't guidance.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","But it looks like if you just look at the midpoint of 5% to 6%, that number would be more like $2.38 now. Am I over-thinking it? Or is there just a modest drag from bonus depreciation in 2017 that we need to think about?","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No. I would say that 2017 guidance hasn't really changed from what we have talked about prior.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks. I just wanted to make sure. Have a great day.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You too. Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Your next question will come from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, Bill. Good morning, guys.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I just wanted to follow-up quickly on the dry powder headroom that you referred to in talking about the FX exposure. Is that all within the UK segment? Or are you talking about more broadly across the business? Could you clarify there?","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","This is Vince. So some of that \u2013 so we have about $0.05 or $0.06 kind of built into the plan to do re-strikes, and further hedge up 2018. Some of that's embedded in the UK guidance, I think some of it's probably sitting up at Corporate And Other as well, but in total it's about $0.05 or $0.06.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And that's the \u2013 and beyond that you'd be talking about cost management holistically across the company.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","That's correct.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you guys.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Okay.","Operator","Our next question will come from Brian Chin of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","On the hedge re-strike comment, I just want to make sure I understand conceptually, so that would be, for example, like monetizing hedges that are in the money today and using that to put on hedges in place in 2018 to some degree? Is that conceptually what you're thinking about?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Exactly right, Brian.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. And then, just going back to the Kentucky nat gas plant deferral, just to be clear, was it the state's position on CPP that was the driving factor behind the plant deferral, or was there some other factors that helped drove that? And the reason why I'm asking it is, I'm wondering is there a risk of any other large asset deferrals in Kentucky or elsewhere?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Let me ask Vic Staffieri to comment on that.","Victor A. Staffieri - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Kentucky Utilities Co.","No, Brian, it was purely a matter \u2013 we had some large municipals that are coming off the system later in the period, five years from now; and so that's why we made the change. We went through that application last year; had nothing to do with this Clean Power Plan. We do not have any other generation in this plant either. So, no, it had nothing to do with Clean Power Plan and there are no other anticipated deferrals of the capital spending.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So let me make sure I get that right. So you have large municipalities, you said, that were coming off the system, as in they are self-powered on their own and so the plant isn't needed, is that right?","Victor A. Staffieri - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Kentucky Utilities Co.","That's correct. They gave us notice \u2013 they have five-year termination period. They gave us notice of termination of about 300 megawatts, they gave it to us last year. We've noted it before. And as a result, we had into the Commission looking for approval to build the plant; we withdrew that approval and the municipal notified us that they were coming off of our system and were contemplating going elsewhere. And to the extent we have lost that revenue, we'll make it up in the rate case timing that we have.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think that's April of 2019?","Victor A. Staffieri - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Kentucky Utilities Co.","Yes. That's April of 2019. So \u2013 but that's the only reason for the deferral of the power plant.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Understood. And then, lastly, what's the sales growth assumptions that are embedded in the 2016 guidance? Can you break that down?","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Give us...","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","In the 2016 guidance?","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","For Kentucky it's \u2013 we're using an average over the period of less than \u2013 about 0.5% over the period. I think for Pennsylvania...","Victor A. Staffieri - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Kentucky Utilities Co.","They're just flat. Yeah. Pennsylvania is flat year-over-year basically.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Actually, I see that here at the slide deck, my apologies. Thanks. That's all I got.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Congrats on a great transformational year. One or two simple questions. First of all, can you talk about what's assumed in guidance for earned ROEs in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky? And second, on both sides, can you just talk about what kind of headwinds and\/or tailwinds to earning authorized are on both places?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Vic, why don't you take the Kentucky ROEs and then we'll pass it over to Greg.","Victor A. Staffieri - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Kentucky Utilities Co.","In Kentucky for the period, Michael, we are somewhere within 50 basis points of the allowed 10% ROE. Headwinds for us, not a whole lot, because we're going to be in rate case cycle. Most of our returns are coming either from rate cases or ECRs. We're using future rate years, which would take into account of any economic issues, which is the only thing that I could see; other than that, it's a pretty solid plan for us.","Gregory N. Dudkin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PPL Electric Utilities Corp.","And Pennsylvania, it's Greg Dudkin, our expected GAAP combined ROE is 9.7% and we don't really see any headwinds, particularly in 2016, because in the distribution case we had a fully projected future test year. So we're very confident we'll be able to achieve that.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Plus we are in the same place for 2016 \u2013 Kentucky, we're in the same place for 2016, we just finished up our rate case also using a future rate year. And as we noted earlier, we made our filing on the ECR. So we're in pretty good shape.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. One other question. Just company-wide O&M, can you just talk about what puts and takes are for O&M 2015 over 2016? Kind of like what's embedded in guidance, and where the biggest O&M saves and where the biggest O&M pressures are in 2016 versus 2015?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, generally speaking, on the increase side, the typical major driver are general wage increases, many of which are already known and quantifiable through bargaining unit agreements and so forth. So that's one of the major pluses.","I think it depends on each of the companies on other things. So, for example, in Kentucky, as we build more assets out on the environmental cost side, there are costs associated with running new types of equipment, whether it's scrubbers or other things like that. Any other color in Kentucky, Greg?","Gregory N. Dudkin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PPL Electric Utilities Corp.","No. I think, Bill, you're right, but, remember we're using future rate years now. So all of these costs are embedded and we have no plans other than what we filed with the Commission. So I'm not sure there are a lot of \u2013 there are no really unknown puts or takes. So, I think, again, that's why we say it's pretty solid, because it's based on a \u2013 our rates are based on a future rate year and extended, in this case \u2013 our case, through the middle of next year.","So we're not \u2013 our plans are pretty solid. There's not a whole lot of puts and takes. So we're going to do what we told the Commission we're going to do.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Those general wage increases and other factors are already in the plan.","Gregory N. Dudkin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PPL Electric Utilities Corp.","Wage increases attracted additional manpower to meet SIP requirements, things like that; they're all embedded in our rates. But when you do look at 2015 to 2016, that's where you would see it in those categories. Go ahead.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Last. Just real quick, last thing. On the UK, are you expecting O&M down in the UK? And is the 17% tax rate that you mentioned in the slides, that's a GAAP tax rate? And is that a lower number versus prior guidance as well?","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So I will take that?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, go ahead Vince.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","How are you doing, Michael? It's Vince. So just first on the tax rate, 17%, I think, is pretty much where we've been guiding, the last few calls. So I would say that's consistent and pretty much see it at around 17% going out for a few years now.","On the O&M, if you look at slide 15, it kind of shows the walk from the $2.21 to the $2.35. You'll see O&M is really not a major driver, except for the UK, it's $0.02 \u2013 sorry, it's $0.07 down. About a nickel $0.05 of that is that pension methodology change. So outside of that, I would say, O&M is really not a major driver year-over-year.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks guys. Much appreciated.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Michael. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Anthony Crowdell of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Just a quick question on PPL capital funding. You have a maturity, I guess, in 2018. Do you plan, I guess, with maybe more cash from bonus, maybe CapEx tailing down a little, do you plan to retire the debt at capital funding or keep using that as a vehicle for access to capital?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say at this point, Anthony, we would likely refi that as opposed to just paying it down.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","And how much debt is that capital funding?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","In total?","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Yes, please.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We'll get that number for you.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Okay. I'll follow up with Joe after the call. Thanks for taking my question.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You're welcome.","Operator","And the final question will come from Andy Levi of Avon Capital Advisors. Please go ahead.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","Thought you guys are going to forget me.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We got you Andy and we never forget you.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","Good morning. How are you doing?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","Actually, I thought it was a really good run-down, so just FYI on that and very good handout too. Just a couple of questions. On the high-end for 2016, how do you achieve the high-end, what are the drivers relative to midpoint?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Vince, you want to take that one?","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So on 2016, I would say weather, load growth, O&M management \u2013 currency is pretty much locked in, so that's really not driving much of the exposure there. I think those are the main drivers.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would agree. I think those are the key ones.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","So it's really costs and sales basically, that's.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Basically, yeah.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","Okay, okay. And then just on \u2013 just on.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","(53:02) the opposite. Correct?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","Okay. Got it. And then just on the hedging in the UK, so just to make sure, because you got like a bunch of questions on it, I don't know why it was still hard for people to understand. But basically, what you're saying is, if I understand it correctly, is that through re-strikes you're basically saying that you're 50% hedged for 2018 even though your table says 20%. Is that kind of what you're trying to convey?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think that's a fair way to look at it. We've not executed those yet, but we have the ability and the room to do that. So I think that's (53:38).","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","And then that would take obviously those sensitivities down?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Correct.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","Got it. And then the last question or point that I'd like to bring up, which I find interesting after going through a week-and-a-half of earnings and looking at companies like Southern and Dominion meaning to take down their numbers because of bonus depreciation here in the U.S. Just to be clear, there is no bonus depreciation in the UK, is there?","Gregory N. Dudkin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PPL Electric Utilities Corp.","No. Not in the way we would think about it here, right.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right. Correct.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","Right. So in a sense you could argue that by being two-thirds in the UK \u2013 again, we obviously know the currency risk, but at the same time, not having bonus depreciation in the UK is actually a very large benefit for you relative to some of the other U.S. utilities who have seen their earnings significantly \u2013 earnings power significantly go lower because of bonus depreciation.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think that's true. Yeah.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","Okay. Thanks a lot.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thank you, Andy.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Just to get back on \u2013 was it Anthony's question, on how much debt is that cap funding; $3.6 billion.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Vince.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks everyone for your participation on today's call. I would just summarize by saying that 2015 was an extremely pivotal year for PPL for many of the reasons I mentioned at the outset of my remarks. I think it's incredible if you look at where we are since the spin. We've raised EPS growth rate guidance; we've achieved two favorable rate outcomes in Pennsylvania and Kentucky; we've raised our guidance on UK incentive revenue; we lowered our exposure to the pound; we signaled meaningful increases in our dividend growth; and we've lowered our equity needs. I can't think of another company that has accomplished so much in such a short period of time.","And throughout this transformation, we've continued to execute at a high level, consistently delivered on our earnings forecast, exceeding the midpoint of our forecast for the sixth year in a row.","Our assets are diverse. We operate in premium jurisdictions continuing to invest heavily in our businesses to improve service for customers as well as grow value for shareowners, and I think we've demonstrated a proven ability to execute very large capital projects and managing our foreign currency exposure.","Looking forward, I believe we're very well positioned to continue to deliver on these commitments, the shareowners offering competitive earnings growth, and an-above average dividend yield.","So with that, thank you very much for being on the call today and look forward to our next earnings call.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Bergstein, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Joe Bergstein","Thank you, Emily. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the PPL conference call on fourth quarter results and our general business outlook. We are providing slides of this presentation on our website at www.pplweb.com.","Any statements made in this presentation about future operating results or other future events are forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from such forward-looking statements. A discussion of factors that could cause actual results or events to differ is contained in the appendix to this presentation and in the company's SEC filings.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Spence, PPL Chairman, President and CEO.","William H. Spence","Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased that you're joining us this morning. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer, and the presidents of our 4 business segments.","Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our 2014 earnings results, an operational overview and a discussion of our 2015 earnings forecast. After my remarks, Vince will review our segment financials, and we'll talk about the recent movement of the pound sterling, and then, we're going to take your questions.","On a number of fronts, 2014 was another very successful year for PPL. We achieved strong earnings results in our regulated utility segments and a competitive Supply segment, also, turned in a solid performance despite the continued challenging market conditions. And we made significant progress towards the spinoff of our supply business, which is designed to unlock significant value for our shareowners. The continued excellent performance of our utility, operations and our ongoing infrastructure investments in those companies together with the successful restructuring of our corporate support functions, give us confidence in PPL's ability to achieve compound growth in earnings of 4% to 6% through at least 2017 following the spinoff of the supply business.","Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced 2014 reported earnings of $2.61 per share, an increase of $0.85 from our 2013 results. Adjusting for special items, our 2014 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.45 per share, matching the level that we achieved in 2013, despite significantly lower hedged power prices in our supply business. I'm very pleased, we're able to match our 2013 ongoing earnings per share this year with a solid financial performance of our regulated utilities, primarily in Pennsylvania and the U.K., offsetting the $0.10 decline we saw in supply.","For the fourth quarter, reported earnings were $1.04 per share, compared with a loss of $0.16 per share a year ago. Earnings per share from ongoing operations were $0.58 in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with $0.60 in 2013. For the year, our utility operations in United States and the United Kingdom improved earnings from ongoing operations by combined $116 million or 8.5%. The primary drivers for this impressive performance are returns on additional transmission investments in Pennsylvania, higher returns as a result of power plant environmental projects in Kentucky and higher utility revenues resulting from U.K. price increases. Vince will provide more details on segment results during his remarks.","Let's move to Slide 4 -- 5 rather for a discussion of our 2015 earnings forecast. As we said in our news release this morning, going forward, we're excluding from our forecast any earnings from our supply business and the net cost associated with the supply spinoff. We believe this approach provides our investors with a clearer picture of the financial performance of the ongoing portfolio of PPL. As we previously communicated, we're restricted in providing supply or Talen forecast while in registration with the SEC. We appreciate everyone's patience during this process, I know that Paul and his team are very excited to communicate the full Talen story, which will occur as soon as possible following the spin. We provided an update to PPL Energy Supply's hedge profile in the appendix of today's presentation material, consistent with our prior practice.","Our 2015 forecast range for earnings from our regulated utility operations is $2.05 to $2.25 per share, unchanged from what we provided with our June announcement of the Talen transaction. The midpoint of this range is $2.15, which is 5.9% higher than the adjusted ongoing earnings from our utility operations in 2014. Our 2014 adjusted regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations removed supply earnings and includes the full impact of dissynergies related to the spinoff of supply, including indirect O&M, interest and depreciation. Vince will cover this in more detail during his remarks.","As I mentioned earlier, the excellent performance of our utility operations and the organic growth from planned and approved infrastructure investments gives us great confidence in our ability to achieve compound growth in earnings of 4% to 6% through at least 2017 following the supply spinoff. The slide shows that we're anticipating slight increases in earnings in our U.K. and Kentucky utilities and slightly lower earnings in our Pennsylvania utility. This slide also shows a significant improvement in the corporate and other category that we expect to realize as the result of our ongoing corporate support cost reductions, including the $75 million of dissynergies we discussed at the time of the announcement. In addition to the Talen spinoff, 2015 is a transitional year for PPL in many other ways. In the U.K., we're moving to the RIIO regulatory construct, and we are in rate cases in Kentucky and expect to file a rate case during the year in Pennsylvania as well.","Growth in earnings in 2015 comes largely from the corporate restructuring efforts, but growth beyond 2015 will be driven by our utility companies.","Now let's turn to Slide 6 for an update on our Regulated operations. We're very pleased to note that WPD was recently named Utility of the Year by the international edition of Utility Week. This marks back-to-back years that PPL companies were named Utility of the Year. In judging WPD as the winner, a panel of industry experts scrutinized the business performance in terms of customer satisfaction, stakeholder return, sustainability and corporate social responsibility, staff development and stakeholder relationship. We congratulate the employees of WPD for this impressive achievement, and this recognition underscores the value we see in our U.K. business, as a key component of the portfolio going forward. Back in the U.S., progress is continuing on our rate cases in Kentucky. As we told you in November, we've requested increases in annual base electric rates of $30 million and $150 million at LG&E and KU, respectively, and an increase in annual base gas rates of $14 million at LG&E. The increases are principally driven by investments in generation supply and other infrastructure investments needed to maintain and enhance the safe and reliable delivery of electricity and natural gas to our customers and to meet federal environmental regulations. We anticipate that the new rates will go into effect on July 1st of this year. A timeline for the rate case consideration is included in today's appendix.","In 2014, we also continued to focus on major capital projects in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, with capital spending for the domestic utilities of approximately $2.3 billion during the year. In Pennsylvania, nearly $350 million was spent on our 2 largest transmission projects, Susquehanna-Roseland and the Northeast\/Pocono projects, which are now 95% and 60% complete, respectively. $140 million was spent on disk projects improving the reliability of our distribution system, while earning a near real time return. In Kentucky, some key construction achievements were reached as new environmental systems were completed in 2014 for 2 of the units at our KU gen station, and for 1 of the units at our LG&E Mill Creek station. The gen landfill and ash transport system also became operational during the year. Construction of our new Kentucky combined cycle gas unit Cane Run 7 is on schedule with commercial operation in the unit estimated to begin by the end of May this year.","Turning to Slide 7. Let's briefly discuss domestic weather-normalized sales for the year and the quarter. In Kentucky, weather-normalized sales for the year were essentially flat with lower residential and commercial sales being offset by continued strong industrial sector growth. Industrial sector growth is driven by solid production levels being maintained by several of our large manufacturing customers amid improving economic conditions. Fourth quarter sales in Kentucky were lower because of the decline in residential and commercial sales, that was somewhat offset by industrial growth. The residential and commercial downturn is attributable to the continued slow growth or decline in several rural parts of Kentucky and Virginia.","As you can see, sales increased slightly in Pennsylvania in 2014, with the industrial category showing the strongest growth. The industrial sales growth is occurring, primarily, in the cement, metal and steel sectors. Pennsylvania weather-normalized sales in the fourth quarter showed slightly higher commercial sector use than was the case last year. That increase resulted from a higher customer count this year, as a result of improving economic conditions.","Moving to Slide 8. Looking back on 2014, I'd like to highlight a few key accomplishments at the Supply segment. In November, we completed the sale of the Montana Hydro electro facilities to NorthWestern Energy for about $900 million. As a reminder, these cash proceeds remain with PPL following the spin, and we expect to use them to fund utility infrastructure investments and pay down holding company debt in Kentucky this year. Looking into overall portfolio performance, we executed very well in 2014, outperforming our initial margin projections due to expanded spark spreads, fleet optimization and availability during peak load periods and our strategic hedging program that captured incremental value even when our units were uneconomic to dispatch.","You can see from the chart in the appendix on Slide 28 that we experienced some coal-to-gas switching this year, as low gas prices enabled our combined cycle gas units to continue to run like baseload units. Further we see market reforms, such as PGM's proposed capacity performance product, the shift in the variable resource requirement curve and a recent increase in the offer cap, as constructive signals supporting the competitive power business in PGM for the future.","Next, I'd like to talk about our significant progress related to the spinoff of our competitive generation business, which will be combined with Riverstone's competitive generation business to form Talen Energy. Last week, we submitted a response to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, accepting their proposed mitigation plan to address potential market power issues in the mid-Atlantic region. The approval process is moving ahead as expected with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, and we continue to anticipate approvals within our original projected timelines. The Talen Energy transition team headed by Paul Farr, President of PPL Energy Supply, has completed its staffing plan and continues to work towards their targeted synergies. We expect to close the Talen transaction in the second quarter of 2015.","Before we move on to Vince, I'll briefly provide you with an overview of our key objectives for 2015, which you'll see on Slide 9. Our primary objective, obviously, for this year is the completion of the energy supply spinoff. In the U.K., our folks are focused on executing the new business plan that was accepted as part of the RIIO-ED1 process, which begins April 1st of this year. In Kentucky, as mentioned earlier, we're moving forward with the efforts on our rate cases, and in Pennsylvania, while we don't yet have details on our filing, we do expect to file a distribution base case during the year.","In Kentucky, the major focus continues to be the execution of our generation and environmental construction projects, which are on schedule and on budget. In Pennsylvania, we're also focused on executing the large capital expenditure plan to continue to strengthen both our transmission and distribution systems.","And finally, we're very focused on implementing the corporate restructuring currently underway. We're confident that 2015 will be another solid year for PPL, as our employees implement our business plans to provide excellent service to customers and to continue to invest in infrastructure improvements. I'd like to take this opportunity to say that PPL employees have done an excellent job in designing and implementing a transition process that will launch a strong and streamlined corporate structure for the new PPL as well as set Talen Energy on course to operate safely and efficiently on Day 1. 2014 was, obviously, an eventful year for PPL, one in which we began to blaze new paths in growing value for our shareowners, even while we continue to provide the highest quality of service to our customers.","Our high-level performance during this challenging year further strengthens my confidence that both PPL and Talen Energy will be very successful companies for years to come. PPL has a strong record of strategic and financial execution. As we enter a new phase of our evolution, we're confident that we will continue to provide shareowners with competitive returns and our customers with best-in-class reliability and service at reasonable cost. As a pure play electric utility going forward, we believe our 3 regulatory jurisdictions provide predictable earnings opportunities with timely recovery of investments.","Our Transmission business has grown rapidly, and we continue to identify additional projects that will drive further growth in that part of the business. We expect the Transmission business to be the fastest growing part of our business for the foreseeable future. Finally, despite the recent decline in the British pound, we're confident in our ability to achieve an earnings growth rate of 4% to 6%, given our current hedge levels and long track record of successful hedging programs that have helped drive our ability to meet or exceed earnings expectations. I look forward to your questions after we hear some additional earnings details from Vince Sorgi. Vince?","Vincent Sorgi","Thank you, Bill. And good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 10. Our fourth quarter earnings from ongoing operations decreased slightly over last year, driven primarily by lower earnings at our competitive supply in Kentucky Regulated segment, partially offset by higher earnings from the U.K. and Pennsylvania Regulated segments. Full year 2014 earnings from ongoing operations were the same as last year, both at $2.45 per share. Higher earnings in the U.K. and Pennsylvania Regulated segments were offset by lower earnings from the Supply segment and Corporate and Other. The $0.03 reduction in Corporate and Other is, primarily driven by tax-related items and higher financing and other costs.","Let's move to a more detailed review of 2014 segment earnings drivers starting with the U.K. results on Slide 11. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned a $1.37 per share in 2014, a $0.05 increase compared to 2013. This increase was due to higher utility revenue, due primarily to higher prices, partially offset by lower volumes due to weather and lower O&M due to lower pension expense. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher U.S. income taxes due to an increase in 2014 taxable dividends and from a 2013 positive adjustment related to an IRS ruling on our earnings to profits calculation. We also had higher depreciation from assets placement service and other of $0.03 per share.","One other item of note for the U.K. Regulated segment in an attempt to provide you with additional visibility and transparency into the U.K. business, we will provide you unaudited consolidated financial information for PPL Global LLC. PPL Global is, primarily, the U.K. Regulated segment, exclusive of the after-tax effect of allocated interest from the debt issued at PPL cap funding for the Midlands acquisition. We'll footnote those amounts, so you can reconcile the PPL Global LLC results to the results of the U.K. Regulated segment presented here today. We hope you'll find this additional disclosure useful. We're still assessing the format in which to provide this information, which we expect to furnish separately in an 8-K to be filed at the time we file our 10-K.","Moving to Slide 12. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.47 per share in 2014, a $0.01 decrease from 2013. This decrease was due to higher O&M, driven predominantly by timing of generation maintenance outages, storm-related expenses and higher uncollectible accounts. Higher depreciation from assets placed in service, higher financing costs from higher debt balances to fund CapEx and other of $0.03 per share. This decrease in earnings was almost fully offset by higher gross margins from returns on environmental capital investment and higher sales volume due to favorable weather. The other variances of negative $0.03 for both the Kentucky and U.K. Regulated segments is related to the way we compute diluted earnings per share using the if-converted method of accounting for the debt component of the equity units. Not to get too technical, but the interest add back to net income in 2013 was higher than the add back in 2014. And with no change in the number of shares outstanding, this has the effect of reducing EPS this year compared to last year.","Turning to Slide 13. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.40 per share in 2014, a $0.09 increase over 2013. This increase was due to higher delivery margins in both transmission and distribution from higher returns on additional capital investments and lower O&M. These increases were partially offset by higher depreciation due to asset additions and higher financing costs from higher debt balances to fund CapEx.","Finishing our segment review with supply on Slide 14, this segment earned $0.29 per share in 2014, a year-over-year decrease of $0.10 per share. This decrease was, primarily, due to lower energy margins driven by lower energy and capacity prices, partially offset by favorable baseload asset performance, gains on certain commodity positions and the net benefits of unusually cold weather in the first quarter of 2014. Lower margins were partially offset by lower financing costs, primarily, due to the repayment of the lower Mount Bethel debt in December of 2013, when we exited a lease and acquired that plant, and lower income taxes driven by truing up our state effective tax rate at year end 2014, and a valuation allowance adjustment recorded in 2013 related to deferred tax assets for state net operating losses.","Turning to Slide 15. We have prepared a walk from our 2014 ongoing earnings of $2.45 to our 2014 adjusted utility earnings from ongoing operations of $2.03, which adjust for the Supply segment and are related to synergies from the spin, as Bill described. This adjusted 2014 earnings amount is the starting point from which we are basing our 4% to 6% compound annual growth rate.","Starting from $2.45, we removed the current year Supply earnings of $0.29. We then adjusted for the $0.07 of O&M dissynergies, previously disclosed. This is the $75 million of indirect corporate costs that were allocated to Supply, but do not go with Supply as part of the spinoff. As we've discussed, corporate restructuring effort currently underway is intended to eliminate this dissynergy. We also adjusted for the $0.05 of interest on the $880 million of debt at PPL cap funding that was previously allocated to Supply, but will remain with PPL Corp. This is a permanent dissynergy.","Finally, we adjusted the depreciation dissynergy down from $0.03 previously disclosed to $0.01, since by the time we get to 2017, there is only $0.01 of depreciation dissynergy remaining, as these assets are generally IT systems that have short useful lives, and some of the assets become fully depreciated over this time period.","Turning to Slide 16. We have prepared a walk from our 2014 adjusted regulated utility ongoing earnings of $2.03 to the $2.15 per share midpoint of our 2015 ongoing Regulated Utility forecast. Corporate and Other is forecasted to contribute $0.11 to the improvement in the 2015 earnings. As we implement the corporate restructuring, we expect to reduce the O&M dissynergies of $0.07. And in 2014, we incurred about $0.02 of deferred tax asset adjustments that we do not expect to incur in 2015.","In the U.K., as discussed previously, utility revenues will decrease by about $0.14, primarily, due to revenue profiling and a lower weighted average cost of capital, partially offset by inflation and other items, as we move into the RIIO-ED1 price control period beginning April 1 of this year. Offsetting lower revenues, our lower U.S. income tax is as a result of the decrease in taxable dividends and a higher British pound exchange rate for 2015, as a result of our hedging program. The hedged rate for 2015 is about $1.63 compared to a realized hedge rate of $1.60 in 2014.","In Kentucky, we anticipate a slight increase in earnings with rate increases effective July 1. Higher margins are expected to be partially offset by increases in O&M, due to higher pension and other labor related cost, higher depreciation on the increase plan and [ph] service, and higher interest expense to fund the capital growth in Kentucky. In Pennsylvania, we expect lower earnings in 2015, due primarily to higher O&M, higher depreciation and higher financing cost. These negative drivers are expected to be partially offset by improved margins driven by increased transmission margins and returns on distribution improvement capital investments.","On Slide 17. We provide updates on our free cash flow before dividends. Actual 2014 free cash flow before dividends was in line with the projection we provided last February, which if you recall included the proceeds from the sale of the Montana Hydro facilities. Looking at 2015, we are projecting a decrease in our free cash flow, primarily, driven by the $900 million Montana Hydro sale proceeds that we received in 2014, and the free cash flows of energy supply that are included in 2014 of about $200 million. 2015 cash from operations and capital expenditures exclude the Supply segment, except for $191 million of distributions to be received by court at the end of the first quarter with no additional distributions from supply thereafter.","Moving to Slide 18. Our planned capital expenditures for 2015 through 2019 are detailed on this slide, with Regulated Utility investment totaling almost $18 billion over that period. This includes previously announced initiatives, such as U.K. spending for our accepted RIIO-ED1 business plan, executing on our environmental compliance plans in Kentucky to meet EPA regulations as well as focusing on system reliability and generation capacity replacement with the retirement of some of our coal fleet in Kentucky, updating and modernizing aging infrastructure in Pennsylvania, including programs that identify areas to strategically improve system performance and reliability. Our revised capital plan reflects incremental investment of approximately $900 million in Pennsylvania through 2018, including $500 million per transmission investments, including line rebuilds, new substations and substation security, and $200 million for distribution improvements, the smart meter replacement program and upgrades to our facilities. Most of the increased distribution spend is recoverable through rate mechanisms, including the disk and the smart meter rider. The revised plan also includes an increase of over $270 million from 2015 to 2018 in Kentucky environmental spending due to increases in scope to meet effluent water guidelines and other projects related to coal combustion residuals, including ash pond closures. This increase partially offsets the net reduction of about $600 million of spend from 2015 to '18 from the deferral of the Green River 5 CCGT plan.","And finally, our capital plan is based on identified projects across the portfolio and does not include unidentified growth projects.","Turning to Slide 19. Our updated investment plan drives a CAGR of about 7% in our projected rate base to 2019, driving value for both our customers and our shareowners.","Turning to Slide 20. As Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we are targeting to achieve compound annual growth in earnings per share of 4% to 6% through at least 2017. At this time, I'll highlight certain key assumptions used for each segment, that supports the 4% to 6% earnings CAGR. For the Pennsylvania Regulated segment, assumptions contributing to this growth include the successful -- excuse me, execution of our capital plan for both transmission and distribution. Earnings growth through 2017 is based on transmission CapEx spend of $2.1 billion and distribution CapEx spend of $1.2 billion, with disk and smart meter CapEx contributing $530 million and $160 million, respectively. The successful distribution base rate case plan for 2015 with new rates effective in early 2016, and we are assuming minimal load growth over the period.","For the Kentucky Regulated segment, key assumptions include the successful execution of our environmental CapEx program of $1.3 billion and the completion of the Cane Run combined cycle natural gas-fired plant. Successful completion of the current base rate cases with new rates effective July 1, 2015, and once again, we are assuming minimal load growth over the period.","For the U.K. Regulated segment, of course, executing on the Ofgem accepted RIIO-ED1 business plan has been built into the growth assumptions and provides 8 years of base revenue certainty, continued opportunity to outperform targets and the ability to true up certain costs, such as the annual change in the cost of debt and inflation, as determined by the U.K. RPI. We have also assumed a budgeted currency rate of $1.60 per GBP. And for RPI under the Ofgem methodology, the forecasted inflation rate used for the '15, '16 regulatory year is 2.6%, which will be trued up for the actual realized inflation in the '17-'18 regulatory year. Our long range RPI assumption beyond '15-'16 is 3%. Incentive revenues are soon to be slightly higher for the 2014-15 regulatory year compared to the $125 million we earned for the regulatory year ended in March 2014. We assume incentive revenues decline from there, given the type of performance targets under RIIO-ED1.","For Corporate and Other, we have built into the growth rate achieving the full $75 million in corporate support cost savings. At this point, we fully expect to be able to achieve this level of savings. We also assume equity issuances of $200 million annually, which is an increase of $100 million per year from our prior disclosure. This increase is to help fund the additional CapEx in the plan, while maintaining our strong credit metrics.","Moving to Slide 21. We know many of you have been focused on the recent movement in the British pound to U.S. dollar exchange rate and would like to understand the effect it has on our earnings from WPD. The next couple of slides present information on our hedge levels and provide details that help us set a budgeted rate of $1.60 per GBP. On this slide, we detail our hedging status for 2015 and 2016, including sensitivities for a $0.05 and $0.10 downward movement in the exchange rate compared to our budgeted rate of $1.60. First, we are nearly fully hedged at 97% for 2015, at an average rate of $1.63.","For 2016, we are 70% hedged at an average rate of $1.61. Since our third quarter update, we have layered on additional hedges for 2016 using collars to help protect against a further decline, but preserve some upside should the GBP strengthen from its current position. You can see from the sensitivity table that there is basically no exposure in 2015, given our 97% hedge level and minimal exposure in 2016, even if rates stay at their current levels.","Turning to Slide 22. As I just indicated, our business plan uses $1.60 as the budgeted rate for our open positions. While this rate is higher than the current spot rate, we believe it is indicative of a longer-term exchange rate based on historical data. First, the 5-year average GBP rate was a $1.59, and the 10, 15, and 20-year averages were all above $1.65.","Over the last 3 years when the exchange rate dipped below at $1.50, it was short-lived as seen by the blue line. In the last 20 years, only 20 days went below $1.40. And about 90% of the time, the exchange rate was $1.50 or higher. Similar to the commodity hedge program we use to hedge our supply business, our foreign currency hedging program sets ranges as guidelines that provide flexibility to take advantage of periods of GBP strengthening, as we did earlier in 2014 by increasing our hedge levels for 2015 and '16 and does not require us to fully hedge our exposure at lower levels.","As you are aware, we have been very successful with this strategy on the commodity side of our business. And as I detailed, this strategy has positioned us well for 2015 and '16. I know that was a lot, but that concludes my prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?","William H. Spence","Thank you, Vince. And Operator, we are ready to take questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Neel Mitra of Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","I had a question on basically around Slide 21. Can you guys disclose the 2017 hedge levels for the currency? And basically, are you using the $1.60 exchange rate for 2017 as well to kind of get to the 4% to 6% earnings growth?","William H. Spence","Yes, thanks for the question, Neel. For 2017, we are not hedged at all at the moment. And it is $1.60 in our forecast, as I think Vince commented on one of the slides, that is used for all the years in the business plan for open positions. And of course, 2017 is fully open.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And when you look at the $1.60 exchange rate, and I guess, where we're at right now with the forward curves around $1.50 or a little bit higher, is the 4% to 6% growth kind of safe through 2017 under the current forward curves or is it more kind of on your point of view at the $1.60 level?","William H. Spence","Well, certainly, for 2015 and 2016, it would have minimal impact as shown on the Slide 21 here. Vince, do you want to comment on 2017?","Vincent Sorgi","Sure, yes. So, Neel, we look at the forwards as well as historical data when we kind of look at our exchange rates, and there is quite a variability, as I'm sure you know, right, they range from around $1 -- out for '17 around $1.40 to all the way up to $1.75. When you look forward, clearly, I think we think there'll be opportunity for GBP strengthening, so that we could hedge at higher levels. The sensitivity [ph] as we've discussed in the past for '17, for every $0.05 movement is about $0.04. So we'll continue to execute our hedge strategy layering in hedges, as we go through the next 18 months. And with periods of spiking, we'll hedge up higher like we did back in 2014.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And then, the additional $100 million in equity. Can you explain what that's going to be used for, and is that going to be issued through a DRIP program, or how is that going to be rolled out?","William H. Spence","Yes, Vince, why don't you take that one?","Vincent Sorgi","Sure, Bill. So the -- we discussed last time the $100 million would, primarily, be DRIP and management comp. We'll likely be doing a [Audio gap] program, in addition to the DRIP and management comp to get to the $200 million.","William H. Spence","And that extra $100 million is really being used to fund the incremental CapEx that Vince talked about, and a lot of that's transmission in Pennsylvania as well as some increased spending in the other utility businesses.","Operator","Our next question is from Dan Eggers of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, just the first question, following up on Neel's question, is just from a hedging perspective on FX. Is it one of these things that you guys are going to kind of wait for a point of view to get something to a better exchange rate before you put something on in '17 given the time horizon before 2017 actually happens?","William H. Spence","Yes. We, obviously, have quite a bit of time before we get to 2017 given our higher -- high hedge levels for '15 and '16. So not unlike what we've done, Dan, in our commodity hedging programs, we look at it as a fairly dynamic process. We set targets. In this case, we've obviously set a target of $1.60. Given the volatility we've seen in the past, we think there will be points in time where we reach that and we can take advantage of that. So that's kind of a marker that we have, obviously, as we get further into '15 and '16, we'll continue to assess our outlook for 2017. But we've got plenty of time, and we think we will have opportunity to hedge it in over that period of time.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Bill, on the update to the rate base numbers as in Slide 19. The Pennsylvania piece has grown quite a bit, it's like 11%, I think, CAGR on rate base growth, [indiscernible] uptake in the back end. Can you just talk about, maybe, a little bit of what's gotten layered in from last quarter to this quarter in those expectations, and what the visibility is on delivery on that CapEx?","William H. Spence","Sure. I'll ask, Greg Dudkin, President of our Electric Utilities in Pennsylvania to take that question.","Gregory N. Dudkin","Thanks, Bill. So it's primarily transmission-related expense and -- or capital investment, and when you take a look at transmission, Vince mentioned it in his comments that we're looking to update our -- we have a lot of assets that are reaching the end of their useful life. So circuit breakers, transformers, we even have some transmission lines were built in 1920. So a lot of that planned investment is to upgrade those. We're also investing a lot in improving the systems reliability through automation, through wood pole replacements, et cetera. So it's primarily in the transmission end. We're also doing some extra investment in the distribution space, talked about the smart meter plan. We're doing a lot of things, smart grid related smart switches, what we call tielines, which basically ties circuits together which further enable smart grids. So those are the principal components of the additional investment.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So none of the count -- the prospective [ph] compass CapEx is included in those numbers?","Gregory N. Dudkin","That's correct.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And one last question on the U.K. side, there's been a lot of movement obviously on RPI. But what's the sensitivity, maybe, do like a 1% move in RPI or something just so we can think about how to calibrate that back to your model?","William H. Spence","Well, a major move that we would anticipate, Dan, is going to be in the pound sterling versus the RPI. So we articulated what that movement is. So clearly, the RPI one would be less. I'd say, we probably don't want to get into trying to give sensitivities on every element that could move the revenue or the cost line, but what I would say, also, is that we've got some index-linked bonds that are also going to be somewhat of an offset to a move down in the RPI. So it's a little bit of a dynamic exercise to go through and figure out what might be moving the RPI and how much it could impact revenue. So I'm not trying to necessarily dodge a question, Dan, but we're really focused on the major uncertainty in the U.K., which is the GBP.","Operator","Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So quick question here on the utility side, first. Bonus depreciation, how much was that in terms of an impact here if you could quantify it?","William H. Spence","Vince?","Vincent Sorgi","So, Julien, the impact of bonus is included in our earnings guidance for 2015 and is also included in our 4% to 6% growth target. It wasn't that significant for either PA or Kentucky. I would say, maybe, around $0.01 in each case. So not -- nothing significant.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then, just cutting back to the actual capital expenditures themselves. First, am I hearing from you right in Kentucky that the coal ash rules, and especially the effluent side, seems to actually be adding some real dollars? And then, secondly, on the Pennsylvania side, I heard you delineate some of the individual pieces, but is compass included within the broader scheme over the longer term here?","William H. Spence","So starting with the last question. First, compass is not included and correct on the Kentucky side that the evolving environmental regulations are driving our need for additional investment in the Kentucky business.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then, shifting to supply real quickly. Your west numbers, at least on the hedge number there for '17, came down pretty big of late. What's going on if you can comment?","William H. Spence","I'll ask Paul Farr to take that question.","Paul A. Farr","Yes. Julien, this is Paul. On a wholesale power price basis, prices in the near term have been hanging in the low 30s, which is not completely logical kind of given where snowpack is. So we've done basically a straight mark. We've offset some of that with some retail hedges that were at prices much more beneficial than what the wholesale indicates, but that's just running it on a straight mark. So with prices in the low 30s and the open position that we got, that drove that roughly $4 movement.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And then, lastly, just a clarification on what Dan was asking about before. Your RPI assumptions, are they at market? And then, I suppose, separately just to be clear, it's less than the unhedged 2017 impact, right? Just to be clear, it's not versus your kind of nearer term hedged FX, right?","William H. Spence","That is correct.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And the RPI is at market there as far as you calculated?","Vincent Sorgi","Yes, we -- I provided the RPI assumptions in my remarks, Julien. It was 2.6% for '15-'16 and 3% thereafter. RPI really doesn't have a major impact in '15-'16 in the guidance that we provided in the appendix for the U.K. earnings.","Operator","Our next question is from Anthony Crowdell of Jefferies.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just to jump on Julien's question. How much, I guess, is it a correct description \"inflation revenues\" did you guys receive in 2014 or you expect to receive in 2015?","William H. Spence","Well, the 2015 would be the 2 point -- well, because -- first off, we should clarify that these are regulatory years that we typically deal in with RPI adjustments versus calendar year. So they don't change as of the first of the year. And I believe so for the last period, which will end this March, it's going to be the 2.6% number that Vince talked about. And then, we're assuming a 3%, which we won't know if that's the correct RPI or not for the '15-'16 year.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","What was the, I guess -- was there an inflation rate percentage of the -- I guess, the last published year, which would be -- was it '14-'15?","William H. Spence","I'll ask Rick Klingensmith to answer that piece of the question.","Rick L. Klingensmith","Sure. No. For the '14-'15 regulatory year, the inflation was fixed at about 2.5%. And so we are realizing that in the current period, and then, as Bill and Vince have indicated, the inflation has been set for the '15-'16 regulatory year at 2.6%. And Ofgem has actually changed their methodology from the current regulatory period into the RIIO period, where they will -- are using a forecast going forward in setting the tariffs that are reset on April 1st. And that forecast is what's published by the HM Treasury in November prior to that April period. And then, as Vince indicated in his remarks, there will be a true up after the '15-'16 period as to any under-recovery or over-recovery will get captured in the 2017-'18 regulatory year. So for '14-'15, we're fixed at 2.5%; for '15-'16, we're fixed at 2.6%, and our assumption going further out in time is 3%.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Great. And just lastly, I guess, more of a bigger picture question. Some utilities have looked at, maybe, building out some gas infrastructure rate base where your subsidiaries are located, Kentucky, Pennsylvania. It seems that maybe there's some investment opportunities there for you. Is that something you guys have looked at and thought about?","William H. Spence","Are you thinking more from an M&A perspective on the gas side?","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","No. More of like a rate base, like either rate basing reserves, like some southeastern utilities or building out on top of the shale play, but not M&A?","William H. Spence","Yes, I don't think for us that's much of an opportunity, given the transmission projects that we already have identified. However, what I would say is the compass project, which is not included in our CapEx program, would be a program or a project if you will that would take advantage of some of the opportunities in the Marcellus shale to basically instead of bringing the gas pipelines across, we'd be bringing electric lines across to the potentially new power stations that could be built. So that would be our opportunity, if you will, that's shale gas-related.","Operator","Our next question is from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Couple of questions, guys. So, not to beat a dead pound, I mean, a dead horse, but on the pound -- that was a joke actually, guys. So if I look at 2016, your hedge is 70% at $1.61, and the pound is currently at $1.53. So if the pound didn't move effectively you'd be at $1.58, $1.59 realized. So the headwind into '17 over '16, if you realized $1.53 would be, am I right, $0.06, maybe, $0.07, that you'd have to overcome, if in fact the pound just stayed at this level for the next 3 years?","William H. Spence","Vince?","Vincent Sorgi","Yes. For which year, Greg, are you referring?","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division","'16 bridging to '17, given the guidance you gave on the -- what your exposure is to a $0.05 change in currency?","Vincent Sorgi","Yes, so we said $0.05 is about $0.04. [indiscernible]","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Yes, so it would be a little -- $0.04 plus half again. So $0.06 or $0.07, right?","Vincent Sorgi","Yes, I think that's right.","William H. Spence","That would be [indiscernible] . Yes.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division","So that would be the headwind you'd have to overcome, great. And then, my second question goes to the earnings guidance. You are saying 4% to 6% through at least '17 off the $2.03 of earnings?","William H. Spence","Yes.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division","But your guidance range for '15 is $2.05 to $2.25, right? Whereas 4% to 6% would be like $2.10 to $2.15. Why is the guidance range so demonstrably wider than what you think your long-term earnings path is for '15?","William H. Spence","I would say it's just a transition year, and knowing that we've got the spin and the timing of the spin and some of the dissynergies that Vince talked about, that we're working to remove. We want to make sure we get through that process, but I think your point is a good one. Going forward, it's probably going to be a bit more predictable, once we know kind of -- we get through that first full year, if you will, of the pure play electric and gas utility business.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Okay. So -- and then, would one of the other major sort of variables also be the outcome of the Kentucky case. You've obviously, got a placeholder in your guidance for what you think might happen, but only a $0.01 of incremental earnings from what looks like a pretty substantial need in terms of the CapEx you've made. That seems to be a fairly conservative placeholder, or am I wrong that that's a key variable in the guidance?","William H. Spence","Well, I think that is a key variable in the guidance for sure. We've been reasonably successful in the past. So we think, we -- this is a very straightforward base rate case in our opinion, but we are using a forward test year in the States. So we'll see what the outcome is, but I think, we picked what we believe is a reasonable outcome for planning purposes. Obviously, I can't state what that is, but -- so time will tell whether it's conservative or not, I guess, is the answer to your real question.","Vincent Sorgi","Yes, Greg, I would just add that I think the effect you're really seeing is at the midyear. The rates don't go into effect until July 1. So we're not getting the full year's revenue uptick from the rate case.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Great. And then, should we be concerned at all about sales trends in Kentucky as it relates to your ability to continue to have what has been a constructive dialogue with the regulator. I mean, if your customer base is shrinking, it's just a more, a bigger and bigger burden on the existing customers?","William H. Spence","I'll ask Vic Staffieri to comment on Kentucky .","Victor A. Staffieri","I think the notion that our energy requirements will be -- is fairly flat, if you will, less than 1%, does create some pressures. But I have to say that we're really encouraged by the industrial growth we're seeing. We haven't seen a follow on yet in the commercial and residential sectors. We're experiencing, obviously, some natural efficiencies, but we're pretty bullish. Actually, the unemployment rate in Kentucky is probably at a low 5.1%, hasn't been that low in many years. So I think there's actually some optimism from us on the economy.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Okay. One last question shifting to the U.K. When we look at the new regulatory scheme, the first year-over-year incentive -- potential to collect incentive revenues and the way the incentive revenues are calculated changes, is it '16-'17 or '17-'18, I forget. And then, if you were to maximize the revenue, the bonus revenues in that year, as you have historically, how significant of a potential overall decline in incentives would you see given that they're going to be -- they've tightened down those calculations under the new scheme?","William H. Spence","Sure. Good question. Let me ask Rick Klingensmith to comment.","Rick L. Klingensmith","Sure. Greg, the incentives as you just mentioned are going to be reset starting April 1, in our new RIIO construct. The targets that we have are being reduced. They're being reduced about 27% for customer interruptions and about 42% for customer minutes loss. So as we go through the period starting April 1st and see our performance against those lower targets, we do expect lower revenues to be received. However, those lower revenues will not be realized until the sort of the fiscal year 2017 time period, when it's the '17-'18 regulatory period where incentive revenues will be captured at that point.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Right. And that's -- so it's '17-'18, and all things being equal if you maxed out your incentives. How much lower would they be than the '16-'17 year?","Paul A. Farr","We're not prepared at this point to kind of discuss the magnitude of the decline in revenues that might be possible as we're working to try to maximize everything we can under the new targets.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just a few quick ones and I apologize if you went over this. The expected regulated ROE in Pennsylvania and Kentucky for 2015, what was that?","William H. Spence","We did not go over that. So that's a new question.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, good.","William H. Spence","Do you have a comment on that?","Victor A. Staffieri","2015, we're assuming ROE somewhere below 9%.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","For which jurisdictions?","Victor A. Staffieri","This is in Kentucky, I'm sorry.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And Pennsylvania?","William H. Spence","Pennsylvania from a GAAP perspective, we're expecting to be a little bit over 9% in '15.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then, sales growth you guys mentioned that the load growth over the long-term looks minimal. I was just wondering if you could give a little bit more flavor as to what minimal means?","Vincent Sorgi","Yes, I would say, it's 0.5% in each case.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then, just finally, the spinoff. Any more clarity on a specific date or closer sort of range of dates, now that we've gotten through so much?","William H. Spence","I'll ask Paul Farr to comment on that.","Paul A. Farr","Yes, Paul. This is Paul. Really, nothing has changed from the standpoint of the initial indications that we gave. We kind of early on said the NRC approval because of the process that we go through there, and then, the PaPUC, again, because it's process driven. We actually did reach a settlement in December in Pennsylvania, but just because of what the ALJ has to do and then the normal commission uptake cycle, that kind of took us in both of those instances into kind of the, into late March, maybe, early April timeframe, nothing's changed from our standpoint there.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","You're forecasting a $0.10 loss at corporate for '15, but I'd imagine that's got a ramping effect of your initiatives. What do you think the run rate will be by the end of the year?","William H. Spence","Go ahead, Vince.","Vincent Sorgi","Yes, it's around $0.10, $0.11.","William H. Spence","On a run rate basis.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So it should be flat for the next few years at $0.10 loss?","Vincent Sorgi","Yes, I would say the next few years. As we get further out and need to borrow up that cap [ph] funding to stabilize the cap structures of the utilities, we'll start to see some interest expense creep in there. But I think for the next couple of years, $0.10 is probably a good proxy.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And on your earnings walk from '14 to '15 at U.K. there was a $0.06 uptick from currency. Could you explain what's driving that, again?","Vincent Sorgi","Yes, that's just the $1.63 hedged rate versus the $1.60 realized rate for '14.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just the hedge, okay. And then, lastly, on the U.K. I guess, not lastly, I have one more follow-up. Just in '15, as far as the shape of the U.K. earnings, given the rate case timing, I assume that first quarter should be up and then flattish throughout the rest of the year?","Vincent Sorgi","Yes, that's correct.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then, I know you don't have a geographic overlap on the shale, but kind of what's your exposure to falling energy prices as far as suppliers or just suppliers to the shale, I guess?","William H. Spence","It's pretty minimal. There's really no impact in Kentucky and a very minimal impact in Pennsylvania.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Because you're so much further east than the shale?","William H. Spence","Correct.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","If I go back in time to when you first entered the U.K. market years ago, 2000-ish, 2001-ish timeframe. One of the things that happened was you continued to show strength in being able to manage O&M. Just curious, it's been 2, 2.5, 3 years since the last U.K. acquisition. Where do you -- what inning do you think you are in, in terms of managing the cost structure, since you've taken control. I mean, are we talking still early innings in terms of getting that done, or are we talking 8th or 9th inning, and what you're able to take out and save, from a cost perspective, you've already realized?","William H. Spence","Well, I'll comment first Michael, and then, I'll turn it over to Rick. But I think our U.K. team was very aggressive from the very outset at looking for opportunities in this last regulatory period. And as we described in previous calls, in the first 6 months, I think, we took out a third of the cost and a third of the employee base to make it much more efficiencies -- efficient. So I think, we're probably in the latter innings, if you want to use that analogy, but that doesn't mean that there aren't still some opportunities for some hits here and there. So with that kind of intro, Rick, you can go ahead and comment as well.","Rick L. Klingensmith","Yes. Wow, Michael, thank you for the history and the recognition of what the team has been able to do in the U.K. But Bill is right, we were probably in the latter innings. As we went into this RIIO process, we provided a business plan that had our operating costs sort of the realization of all the efficiencies into that business plan and that's what we provided Ofgem for the next 8 years. And that was actually a major factor in why we were fast-tracked and others were not, was because of the cost efficiencies that we had already realized. But what was also in the plan, was another about 1% a year efficiency. And so we are in the latter years, but we have about that 1% ongoing in efficiency that we are looking to achieve out into the future.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. One other question, this is, maybe, more strategic in nature. You guys have never been bashful about transacting when -- or just doing something at the corporate level as a way to either reduce risk or highlight value you think is embedded within the company. Post the spinoff of Talen, a large portion, more than 50% will come from the U.K., and historically, there've been very kind of decent differences in valuation methodologies investors have used for your non-U.S. utilities versus U.S. utilities. At what point do you take a step back post-spin and say, what are the range of options to help highlight the value of the U.K. business to the broader investment community. And how do you think about what those kind of options are if the market doesn't kind of give it what you think the appropriate value of that business is?","William H. Spence","Yes, so I think the market will ultimately put an appropriate value on it, as we exit the spin transaction, if you will, and have the opportunity to spend a lot more time just focusing on the core utility businesses, including the U.K. As Vince mentioned in his remarks, we're providing some income statements for the U.K. business unaudited to give more transparency. And as we go forward, we're also looking at other ways in which we can highlight to investors the real significant value that we believe exists in the U.K. business. And some of that value has, obviously, shown itself through our fast track that Rick just mentioned. As well as the fact that we're into a -- entering into a full 8-year period upon which we have a great deal of certainty on the revenues and the cost side. So we think it's a great business. It fits well with our portfolio. To the extent that we cannot overcome, maybe, questions or concerns that investors have, we'd obviously, as you point out, want to try to engage in activities that would either highlight that value or reweight the portfolio. But at this point, I don't think there is a need or desire to do any of that. And I would also mention that because our U.S. businesses are growing much faster than the U.K. business, over time the weighting is going to come down for the U.K., just through our organic growth in the U.S. So I think over time, we'll continue to highlight the value in the business and make sure it's appropriately valued and look at any opportunity we need to, to make sure that shareowners get that value out of it.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And 1 last one. And this one, may be a Vince question. Can you remind us what is your cash tax versus kind of statutory tax or GAAP tax rate going forward? Or more importantly, do you expect to pay much, if any, in the way of significant cash taxes over the next few years?","Vincent Sorgi","Sure. So with bonus, Michael, we're -- I would say, we're not a full taxpayer for the foreseeable future, certainly, through the planned period. For 2015, we don't have a minimal tax burden. I would say, it's about $20 million. And it's around $100 million for the next couple of years after that.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So meaning, cash taxes will be a very small percent of total GAAP taxes?","Vincent Sorgi","Yes. It ends up, I mean, the way I kind of. Yes, I mean, we have NOLs and credits that bring that down. I kind of think of the amount of cash we're paying on our taxable income is about 25% as opposed to 35%.","William H. Spence","Emily, we're past our time limit here, but we will go ahead and take one more question.","Operator","The last question comes from Brian Chin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","As we get a couple of steps closer to the Talen spin being completed, any marginal updated thoughts on dividend policy for the PPL parent utility?","William H. Spence","So we still do not have a formal dividend policy or dividend payout ratio that we're targeting, Brian. But as we've said, post spin, our intent is to continue to maintain the same level of dividend prior to the spin. And we'll look at opportunities where appropriate to grow it if we can. So that's kind of still the game plan going forward.","Okay. Thanks, everyone, for joining us. And have a good day.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"17651":["PPL Corporation (NYSE:PPL) Q3 2014 Earnings Conference Call November  4, 2014  8:30 AM ET","Executives","","Joe Bergstein - VP, IR","Bill Spence - Chairman, President & CEO","Vince Sorgi - CFO","Rick Klingensmith - President, Global Business","Paul Farr - President, PPL Energy Supply & PPL Generation","Greg Dudkin - President, PPL Electric Utilities","Analysts","","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Anthony Crowdell - Jefferies","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Neel Mitra - Tudor Pickering","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Operator","Welcome to the PPL Corporation Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Bergstein, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Joe Bergstein","Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining the PPL conference call on third quarter results and our general business outlook. We're providing slides of this presentation on our website at www.pplweb.com.","Any statements made in this presentation about future operating results or other future events are forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from such forward-looking statements. A discussion of factors that could cause actual results or events to differ is contained in the appendix to this presentation and in the company's SEC filings.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Bill Spence, PPL Chairman, President and CEO.","Bill Spence","Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. With me on the call this morning are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer and the Presidents of our four business segments. Moving to slide 3, our agenda this morning starts with an overview of third quarter earnings and operational results and an update on our 2014 earnings forecast which we have raised for the third time this year. After my remarks, Vince will review our segment financials and then we will take your questions.","Looking back on our performance through the first nine months of 2014, we put an impressive year together, delivering solid results while overcoming some challenges brought on by Mother Nature and executing on a substantial strategic effort positioning the company for future success.","We continue to invest heavily in our regulated infrastructure, enhancing grid reliability for customers in each of our service territories and providing an avenue of stable returns for our investors and at supply, the team has in a great job of managing both base load and intermediate fleets which is reflected in the continuous improvement in our expected results throughout the year. We expect to carry this momentum through the remainder of 2014, continuing our approach of excellence and execution and identifying ways to deliver value.","Let's move onto third quarter results. Turning to slide 4, today we announced reported earnings of $0.74 per share for the third quarter that is an increase from $0.62 per share in the third quarter of 2013. Adjusting for special items, our earnings from ongoing operations were $0.54 per share in the quarter, a decrease from $0.66 per share in the third quarter of last year.","Year-to-date reported earnings were $1.57 per share, compared to $1.90 per share in the first nine months of 2013. Earnings per share from ongoing operations for the first nine months of the year were $1.87, an increase from $1.85 per share in the same period a year ago. Strong year-to-date performance in our regulated businesses, combined with continuing strong performance in our competitive energy supply business has led to exceptional results through the first nine months of the year.","Our domestic utilities improved earnings from ongoing operations by a combined $60 million year-over-year, primarily resulting from returns on additional transmission investments in Pennsylvania, power plant environmental projects in Kentucky and higher sales volumes. The improved sales volumes were primarily driven by weather, as the mild spring and summer were more than offset by unusually cold weather in the first quarter of this year.","Let's move to slide 5 for an update on our 2014 ongoing earnings forecast. Our continuing strong results led us to announce today an increase of our ongoing earnings forecast to $2.37 to $2.47 per share. The new mid-point, $2.42 per share, is $0.12 higher than the mid-point we announced in August and almost 13% higher than the midpoint of the initial 2014 forecast which we provided in the first quarter.","On the regulated front, we see an improvement in the UK regulated segment earnings and remain on track in our domestic utilities. As you can see on this slide, our forecast increase is primarily driven by higher expected earnings from supply. The strong 2014 performance of PPL's competitive energy supply business underscores the inherent value of this business and its ongoing potential as market fundamentals improve. These 2014 results provide additional confirmation that the spinoff of our supply segment will create significant short- and long-term value for our shareowners. Vince will discuss the details of our updated forecast in a few minutes.","Now let's turn to slide 6 for an update on our regulated operations. Starting in the UK, we're pleased to announce that WPD earned a combined $130 million in annual bonus revenues for its premier customer service and reliability metrics for the regulatory year ending March 31, 2014. This is a $17 million increase over the previous regulatory year. We expect OpGen [ph] to confirm this amount by the end of 2014.","In Kentucky, we're announcing today our plans to file a rate case later this month. We provided a high level summary of the filing on slide 7 which I will discuss in a few moments. On a last quarterly call, we had just announced Project Compass, a proposed 725 mile transmission line through the shale gas regions of Pennsylvania and into New York and New Jersey and Maryland.","We\u2019ve been meeting with officials at the state PUCs and governor's offices in the states where customers will benefit, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Maryland. Those meetings have gone well overall and we plan to have continuing dialogues on the project benefits. We're also meeting with other key agencies and other transmission operators in the region. We will continue to update you as we reach project milestones.","Turning to the Kentucky filing on slide 7, our requests are for increases in annual basis electric rates of $30 million and $150 million at LG&E and KU, respectively and an increase in annual base gas rates of $14 million at LG&E. The increases are principally driven by investments in generation supply and other infrastructure investments needed to maintain and enhance the safe reliable delivery of electricity and natural gas to our customers and to meet federal environmental regulations.","The single biggest investment driving the requested increase is the company's new, natural gas combined cycle plants Cane Run 7 which is scheduled to go into service in May of 2015. The filing will be based upon a forward test year and in June 30, 2016 assuming an ROE of 10.5% with new rates effective July of 2015.","Moving to slide 8, let's take a brief look at sales volumes in our domestic utility operations. In Kentucky for the quarter and trailing 12 months, strong industrial load growth has more than offset the weakness experienced in residential and commercial sales, leading to overall weather normalized sales growth of about 0.1% and 0.5%, respectively. The industrial growth has been driven by expansions and increased production at some of our larger customer's facilities.","Mild weather in Q3 of this year negatively impacted actual sales volumes relative to last year. In Pennsylvania, we experienced a modest decline in weather normalized sales quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by lower residential sales.","On an actual basis, cooling degree days were down by roughly 14% which drove weak demand from residential customers, weather normalized commercial sales were up over 1% which helped offset some of the residential weaknesses, while industrial sales were relatively flat for the quarter. PA weather normalized sales continue to trend in positive territory at about 0.5% for the trailing 12 months.","Moving to slide 9, let's talk first about the progress related to the spinoff of our competitive generation business which will be combined with Riverstone's competitive generation business to form Talen Energy. Discussions with regulatory agencies are proceeding as expected and there have been no surprises in the process. We still anticipate closing in either the first or second quarter of 2015.","The Talen Energy transition team headed by Paul Farr, President of PPL Energy Supply is on track to achieve at least $155 million in annual run rate synergies for Talen which was a target we had established. Separately at PPL, we have identified a targeted annual support cost savings to eliminate at least $75 million of disynergies created by the spin, most of which will be achieved in 2015.","These cost savings are also consistent with the targeted reductions discussed when we announced the spinoff transaction in June. Moving on to the pending sale of the Montana Hydro facilities to Northwestern Energy, I'm pleased to report that the Montana Public Service Commission has approved the transaction. FERC approved Northwestern Energy's financing plans for the transaction last week clearing the way for an expected closing by year end.","Just a brief update on the Susquehanna plant, as you know, we installed redesigned shortened last stage blades on one of the Unit 1 low-pressure turbine this past spring. Our continuous monitoring of turbine performance shows that the new, shorter blades have significantly reduced blade tip vibration. We're finalizing plans to install these shorter blades on the remaining low-pressure turbines over the next couple of refueling outages, starting with multiple turbines on Unit 2 during the refueling outage next spring. We don't expect to need special turbine maintenance outages after these modifications are completed.","Turning to a summary of plant performance for the quarter, you will notice from our updated hedge disclosures in the appendix that our 2014 expected base load output declined by about 3 gigawatt hours since our last update. The primary driver of this decrease was due to lower than planned output from our Eastern coal facilities during the quarter as depressed load and prices from mild summer weather led to a 30% average capacity factor for the period. While actual coal generation was down given these lower prices, our hedging program proved beneficial, as we captured value for the portfolio through the financial settlement of the higher priced forward sales contracts.","Excellent plan performance from our natural gas units which ran at a 98% capacity factor also added value as spark spreads improved in the third quarter driven by very low spot natural gas pricing.","Before we move onto Vince's comments, I would like take this opportunity to say that PPL employees have done an excellent job in designing and implementing a transition process that will allow Talen Energy to operate safely and efficiently on day one and will result in a more streamlined corporate structure for the remaining businesses of PPL Corporation. And we're doing the significant transition work while maintaining our focus on business results, reliability, safety. 2014 has obviously been an eventful year for PPL, one in which we're blazing new paths and growing value for shareowners, even while we continue to provide the highest quality service to our customers.","Our high level of performance during this challenging year further strengthens my confidence that both PPL and Talen Energy will be very successful companies for years to come. I look forward to your questions after we hear some additional earnings details from Vince Sorgi. Vince?","Vince Sorgi","Thanks, Bill and good morning everyone. Let's move to slide 10, PPL's third quarter earnings from ongoing operations decreased from last year driven primarily by lower earnings at our competitive supply segment, the Kentucky regulated segment and the UK regulated segment. Let's move to the detailed segment review starting with the UK results on slide 11.","Our UK regulated segment earned $0.28 per share in the third quarter, a $0.03 decrease from last year. This decrease was due to higher income taxes from a UK tax benefit recorded in the third quarter of 2013 and higher U.S. taxes in the 2014 related to cash repatriation. We had higher financing costs from higher debt balances to fund our CapEx and higher depreciation from assets placed in service.","These negative earnings drivers were partially offset by higher utility revenues due to the net result of higher prices and lower volumes primarily driven by weather and lower O&M driven by lower pension expense. Moving to slide 12, Kentucky earned $0.12 per share in the third quarter, a $0.02 decrease compared to a year ago. This decrease was primarily driven by higher O&M and higher financing costs from higher debt balances to fund the CapEx.","In addition, higher margins from environmental capital investments were offset by lower sales volume due to mild weather. Turning to slide 13, our Pennsylvania regulated segment earned $0.08 per share in the quarter, flat compared to last year with higher returns on additional transmission capital investments of about $0.01, being offset by multiple minor earnings drivers.","Moving to slide 14, our competitive generation segment earned $0.07 per share in the third quarter, a decrease of $0.07 compared to last year. This decrease was primarily the result of lower Eastern Energy margins driven by lower hedged base load energy prices and lower capacity prices partially offset by favorable asset performance at our base load units. Lower margins were partially offset by lower O&M at our fossil facilities, lower financing costs and lower income taxes resulting from a negative adjustment to deferred tax assets recorded in 2013.","Let's move to slide 15 and review in more detail our updated earnings forecast. As Bill noted, we're raising and tightening our 2014 earnings guidance this morning. Of the $0.12 increase to the mid-point, we added $0.07 at supply primarily drive by higher projected margins, the lower depreciation, the lower financing costs and lower income taxes. We also increased the UK regulated segment mid-point by $0.03 driven by higher revenues, lower O&M from lower network maintenance expenses and lower financing costs. These are all consistent with what we have been experiencing through the first nine months of the year.","These positive drivers were partially offset by higher U.S. income taxes related to a legal entity restructuring we completed at the end of October. You may have read about that reorganization, as both S&P and Moody's issued and reaffirmed our credit ratings on Friday for the applicable WPD entities that have third-party debt outstanding. The restructuring brings ownership of all four distribution network operators under a single UK holding company, better positioning our UK operations for further debt issuances.","From a cash repatriation perspective, we will incur some additional U.S. tax in 2014, as certain of the steps within the restructuring were taxable transactions. However, the new structure also provides future flexibility for how we source our cash repatriation from the UK.","In addition to increasing supply in the UK, our expectations for corporate and other also improved by $0.02 primarily from lower expected O&M as we're not filling open positions as we work through the various transition efforts.","That completes the more detail financial overview. And I'll now turn the call back over to Bill for the Q&A. Bill?","Bill Spence","Okay. Thank you, Vince. And operator we're ready for questions.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Greg Gordon at Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","A couple of questions, first, on the UK, this is like for the fourth or fifth time you've raised guidance for 2014 which is great momentum. Looking at $1.38 when I think about that your 2015 midpoint for the 2015 guidance you\u2019ve given for PPL post the spin, you got a $1.36 embedded in there at the to 2015 midpoint which will be $0.02 below your guidance for '14 now. Is there any reason to believe that there is some significant potential downside in earnings off the $1.38 this year? Is there something happening on the revenue line or expense line with currency that we need to think about as we think about where you'd be inside that guidance range?","Bill Spence","Sure. Well you'll recall that next year for at least a portion of the year beginning April 1, we start the new Reo, revenue reset. So there's a step down in revenue on the top line that we'll experience next year. Somewhat offset by higher than expected or -- and then initially communicated bonus revenues that we've recently been awarded in the last cycle. I'll ask Rick Klingensmith, President of our Global Business to comment on any other drivers or factors including currency. Rick?","Rick Klingensmith","As bill mentioned, Greg, the major affect for us next year is the revenue change that comes as a result of the REO ED-1 implementation on April 1. So that's what's really driving the earnings downward as compared to this year's $1.38, offsetting that we'll see some lower U.S. and UK income taxes. As Vince had mentioned about some of the cash repatriations and the restructuring that we just went through we'll see a benefit within our earnings next year for that. With the hedging that we did on the currency side, we're seeing some benefits as well when next year's earnings to help offset and mitigate the revenue decline as a result of the REO ED-1. And so the $1.36 that we\u2019re forecasting for next year incorporates the decline as well as some of the upsides that we're seeing from tax and currency as well.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","And the regulated segment bonus revenues that you talked about on slide 6, $130 million, $17 million increase, when do those actually start to flow through and what was your expectation that you baked into the midpoint of your guidance?","Rick Klingensmith","Sure. The expectation was exactly that because when we provided that guidance earlier this year we had completed our year and which is the end of March and so we knew what the results were, we just had to go through an audit process to be able to confirm and ensure that the results were accurate. And so what we have in our midpoint for next year was exactly that 130 million as we move forward.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Switching to PPL supply, am I right in looking at the slides and comparing them to the last disclosure that expected generation in 2015 from your intermediate and peeking fleet is about up about 3 kWh? What's caused you to -- if that\u2019s in fact accurate -- what's caused you to recalibrate that expectation?","Bill Spence","Sure. That's correct and the increase is really driven by the low gas prices in the summer producing that 98% capacity factor on our natural gas plants that I commented earlier on the intermediate unit. Paul, do you want to add any more color to that?","Paul Farr","","In '15, Greg, the built just went through '14 and '15 it's really all looking at the improved spark spread that we\u2019re seeing in the market. So we've seen as you can look at the market pricing that we gave you in Q2 versus Q3, natural gas prices are off but spark spread grew pretty dramatically. So that level of output will basically put us on par to achieve something pretty comparable to the gas performance in calendar 2014.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Final question, in Kentucky, have you actually filed the case and if not when do you plan on formally filing and when we will get a final decision?","Vince Sorgi","We have given them notice and we\u2019re about to put the publication into the press. We won't file a case until the very end of November. It generally takes about seven months in a case like this so we would expect new rates to go in July 1, 2015 [ph].","Operator","The next question comes from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Can you talk a little more about where you're finding your bolt-on energies on Talen and avoiding the dissynergies at the residual PPO, kind of as you've gotten into it where those bucketing dollars have come from and where you think you\u2019re on the continuum of doing better or worse from those numbers?","Bill Spence","Sure. Maybe I'll ask Vince to comment on the PPL Corp side and then Paul can comment on the Talen Energy side. Go ahead, Vince.","Vince Sorgi","Sure. So first of all I will say that we're well within the target of the $75 million that we\u2019re going after at Corp. I would say we are right around that plus or minus a couple million dollars. So I would say we\u2019re pretty much honing in right on that, on that $75 million, Dan. And it's really coming from restructuring the corporate support services organizations, I call it condense and consolidate. So we're reducing layers of management and condensing more functions under fewer Presidents and higher level organizations. So there's a pretty significant reorganization going on. We've also looked at noncritical third-party services and other things like that. So it's really just taken a deep dive into the corporate center.","Paul Farr","On the Talen Energy side, we really split that. If you think back to the June 10th presentation, $85 million in headquarters and services costs, $60 million in operations think about as a plan for $10 million for margin in the HQ and services. So even though we haven't been able to work extremely closely with the Riverstone folks because of anti-trust reasons as we go through the approval processes that are well underway.","From the diligence that we did, the yearly dialogue that we did, we have a very good idea in terms of the plans where we can get the 60 that will well underway into achieving -- the headquarters and services it's really just looking at setting up from a bottoms up perspective. The HQ for Talen Energy relative to the level of costs that PPL charges the supply business today, again, I feel really good about the capability to achieve that $85 million and another $10 million in marketing with the way that Riverstone hedges their plans versus the more dynamic way that we manage our portfolio, we feel good about that as well.","I would hope there would be additional opportunities as we're able to get into supply chain, IT, some other activities when we're able to be more involved with that fleet. But today we're doing it based upon the best information that we've got, but we do feel good about where we're.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Okay. And I guess, Paul, just on the Susquehanna blade issues. How the long do you think it's going to take to get the shorter blades put in all the turbines and then what is the maintenance profile over the next year or two, how long it takes to get that done as far as the frequency of extended or more frequent outages?","Paul Farr","As Bill indicated in the prepared remarks, upto three low pressure turbines that are on each of the units. In the unit one outage this past spring we replaced one of the three that would be the one that had the most issues since we've been discovering the issue that we've got with the blades. On unit two, we replaced that one as well as another so we'll replace two of the three LP turbine with the lower blades next spring on unit two.","The third turbine on each of the units, we haven't seen any major issues with. So in our business plan for next year we have got the plant refueling outage and blade modification outage for unit two. We do not have an incremental outage factored in for unit one because we think based upon the data we're seeing on those turbines, that we will be able to make it through two, the refueling outage in spring of 2016 where we'd replace the other two turbines with a lower blades and that will pretty much take care. We have one unit left in spring of '17 but we don't think we are going to need to have interim outages on the units following the spring -- for spring refill next year.","Bill Spence","And they can be accomplished -- those retrofits if you will within our normal refueling outage timeframe. So it's not going to increase the outage, the normal outage scheduled. We can fit it with insight that window.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Okay. And Bill, guess one another question, with the drop in gas prices and prospectively higher capacity prices, can you talk about what interests you might be seeing on generators looking for interconnection to the system for new builds capacity and how you queue that in in more timely fashion and the Compass Project which is pretty long dated?","Bill Spence","That\u2019s really run through the PJM planning process and obviously PPL on our transmission side we\u2019re part of that process, but I think there is ongoing interest in building new natural gas plants, but I wouldn't say that current capacity potential upside or lower gas prices are driving it much more significant than we had saw in the past. I think a number of the developers that started these projects anticipated improving fundamentals and we\u2019re already preparing for a lot of this not necessarily the PJM capacity price construct change, but time I guess will tell through the PJM process as to how much incremental interest we see.","Paul Farr","Yes, I would say, Dan, that a lot of those projects that are being built are not projects that would qualify for the CP product, so we typically stick with single few, no storage capability, no gas transmission, so there will be a limited impact in terms of the CP outcome. ","Operator","The next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies.","Anthony Crowdell - Jefferies","I just wanted to jump on Dan's question I guess for a clarification with the capacity performance product. I mean your I guess non-solid fuel plants, you know oil and gas that are in supply. I mean do you think they can achieve the -- if they have dual fuel switching capability, could they achieve that forced outage rate that PJM is looking for?","Paul Farr","I think you might have asked two questions there. So on our dual fuel oil and gas unit, any of your units can (indiscernible) it would qualify. For example, our Martins Creek facility would qualify where Ironwood and Lower Mount Bethel would not except for the extent that we can locate storage and get firm gas transition if we can for either all or partial of those facilities those may qualify.","But we do expect there's going to be limited capability in the market to be able to deliver much product along those lines. When we think about the level of CapEx spend that we've driven out of the coal plants, there may be some modest increments to deal with the penalty exposure depending upon how that gets quantified but I wouldn't look from the PPL plan perspective at Montour (indiscernible) but those will be material cost increases.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Ridzon at KeyBanc.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","Sorry if I missed it, but with the shorter turbines at the Susquehanna, is there a D Rate [ph] associated with that?","Bill Spence","There would be a very limited D Rate only during certain periods of the year so not really material in the long run. So, yes there would be a small D Rate with the shorter blades.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","That would be summer I assume?","Bill Spence","Yes in the summer.","Paul Farr","If we replace two of the three were actually flat. If you replace one and there's actually a minor uplift because we get more output in the summer, we're generator [ph] limited in the winter. Replacing the second one puts us back to flat and then the third one would be it's less than 10 MW per unit that would be impacted if all three are ultimately changed out.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","When you announced Talen you kind of gave a forward-looking EBITDA of 627. Where does that given the uplift you see?","Paul Farr","When you think about the numbers that we have provided on the supply side for PPL, I think you can get a reasonable calculation of the uplift. We have not been getting details up pace in terms of hedging, modeling parameters from the Riverstone folks. Again we\u2019re competitive with them until we get through the anti-trust regulatory approval process with DOJ so we can to certain regulations but we\u2019re not prepared to provide an update to EBITDA today.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","Can you give an update on the PPL side? Perhaps on Riverstone?","Bill Spence","Yes until we provide our earnings update at the end of the year in January, I'll refrain from that. We\u2019re still going through our normal business planning process and looking at O&M and CapEx and fuel and the hedges. We're as prices have improved here recently including very recently with the uplifts in '15, we've and even '16 we've been hedging more. So I would be giving you information that would be outside of the 930 numbers that are in the market prices and hegding data that we provided in the deck, So I think we will refrain today.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Patterson at Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Just the following on the situation with the merger and what have you. The independent market monitor as you know has been filing recommendations, I know they are just recommendations but it's hard for me to quantify what the impact of sort of cost that are -- mitigation might mean for some of the proposals he has with respect to getting restraints or divesture limitations. I was wondering do you guys have any sense or any quantification if in fact any of those were adopted what the impact could be?","Bill Spence","We don't have any quantification of that. And as you kind of mentioned, it is really hard to calculate something like that given the complex nature of his comments and the way some of those kind of work when you say together, but some work in one direction and some go the other way. So it's kind of hard to assess that type of thought process they are. So we have not quantified it, what it might mean.","Paul Farr","I don't think it changes our view of (indiscernible) assessment of market power and how they're going to test us in any meaningful way. So we feel as comfortable as we did before he has made comments similar to this, the outer units, some of them are a bit more mitigated in nature. But these same assets tend to have approved for their transaction processes. So we\u2019re -- again nothing surprising by way of what he said for the analysis behind it, it's hard to perfectly predict that we very currently think that we fully meet FERCs requirement with either of the two packages that we proposed.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","And in terms of the process, it looks like we\u2019re kind of finished with the process, at least in terms of the back-and-forth between you guys and the IMM. When do we expect could you give me -- went do you FERC will act on this?","Paul Farr","I think FERC should act by year end, hopefully by mid-December type timeframe, as are just reading the tea leaves now and then the DOJ would be sometime in mid-January to mid-February given the process.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","And then on Act 128 Phase III, how do you guys see that -- I know they are beginning the process and what have you, but do you think that might impact the sales growth maybe -- do you think maybe the growing fruit [ph] with such efficiency and stuff has sort of gone away perhaps and perhaps we might see better sales growth given what's happened with Act I29 or just any flavor you can give us in terms of what you see might be happening there?","Greg Dudkin","Yes, we're just starting to work on taking a look at Phase III, you raised a good question about what the future opportunities are and from Phase II, we're still seeing some economically justified opportunities for savings for energy efficiency. And I think from a long-term perspective, we are basically looking at flat sales growth. Our five-year look is about a 0.5%. So that's basically what we're looking at. So we\u2019re not looking at significant increases in our load that\u2019s basically flat.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","And then Reggie, there's some obviously due to the elections today but if the democrat were to win and (indiscernible) has the polls, it seems to sort of for joining Reggie. Do you see that potentially impacting you guys at all?","Bill Spence","Well I guess it remains to be seen, but we haven't gotten the full details from the prospective Governor on his energy plan totally. I think there has been some comments made about taxes on shale gas, but as it relates to Reggie, kind of remains to be seen. I think the other question is whether it would require legislation to make it happen or not and if so and that might be a tough thing to gets.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay. And then just finally on the currency hedge position, could you give a refresher on how much you've hedged? And at what price for the (indiscernible)?","Rick Klingensmith","Sure, Paul, for 2015, we're at 98% hedged at a 163 rate and so that was included in our guidance for 2015 and then for 2016 which we've given you guidance on as well, we're 55% hedged at a $1.64 per pound rates.","Operator","Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","So kind of a higher level question here to start off, I'm curious, can you clarify or at least give us a little bit of a timeline in thinking about getting better than a 4% EPS growth rate, perhaps some comments previously around 4 to 6. How do you think about getting there? Where do you see yourself today particularly in the context of better synergy realization?","Bill Spence","Sure. We\u2019re in the midst of our financial planning process right now and we're going to be looking to optimize the current plant that we\u2019ve by year-end and so far we don't see anything at the moment that would suggest we can't grow earnings by at least the 4% annually that we've communicated previously. Of course we hope to improve upon that and we will be providing an update on earnings growth projections on the year-end earnings call. So, expect on the next call that we will give you some additional flavor on that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","And then little bit of a detail over on the supply side. Montana, you have a single asset left really. What's the thought process there as you look towards realizing this Talen deal?","Paul Farr","The thought process there is one for hydro the next few weeks we move forward to the North Western [ph]. We will be optimizing our cost to cost structure to deal with the smaller asset mix. We would plan on continuing to run the four units at that Colstrip. We had previously communicated the plant to shut down come spring which is still the plan. So we will continue to run the assets there, the positive cash flow units to the extent that another party has a view to create a capability for us to exit at the value that represents our fundamental reevaluations, that\u2019s something that we can entertain not unlike that we did with hydros.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","And then perhaps this is going a bridge too far, but what do you think in terms of CP in PJM in terms of aggregate revenue upside or impact to the market ultimately for your portfolio given your comments and responses to prior questions?","Paul Farr","You started off right in terms of your bridge too far. I will be down there today with one of the coalitions in front of the Board making our very strong points that when you look at the fact that roughly more than half of the coal-fired generation in PJM earns no economic return and it's flat to negative cash flow that they completely unsustainable situation.","If we just look at what at our units (indiscernible) while they are positive cash flow, from the '09 - '10 period we went from just under $200 a megawatt a day to a little under a $120 a megawatt a day in the 17-18 [ph] auction. We've gone from 80% plus capacity factors over that time frame to less than 50 and the amount that we're earning for every megawatt hour that we produce is getting closer to being the variable cost of production.","So it's a very challenging situation for the coal plant. On the Talen side, we're not going to live with scenarios where any one of the plant subsidizes other facilities. And I think other companies are resolutely in the same spot. So we find as a system to provide the right levels of revenue to ensure that these assets remained in the marketplace and are reliable or we\u2019re going to see an accelerated -- even for units that are in place, significant legacy investments and complying with care and with max [ph]. You\u2019re going to see more of those facilities shut down and have the system become more volatile.","So because only when more gas is going to get built, as Bill indicated in earlier remarks and Vince did, in Q3 we had less than 30% capacity factors on our coal units. It worked out fine because we can buy product back from the market and satisfy hedges at net prices losing money at peak but gaining in off-peak less than we can produce it for but over the long term that\u2019s unsustainable and our gas plants are running at base loads.","So that's why obviously you're seeing D Rate [ph] expansion that you're seeing in '15, in '16 it's starting with less liquidity there, but some of the market value the units. And if the answer is yes then we need a durable, sustainable revenue stream to these plants because this is new capital going in. This isn't O&M that they are asking for in terms of reliability and people have been really cutting back capital in the facilities and it's very difficult to actually today to predict reliability. So that risk reward as well on the penalty side has to be balanced as several companies are going to need to play some relatively material investments in the plan to get them to the level that avoids penalty structures.","Bill Spence","I would just add that as proposed, the capacity construct would be a net positive a significant positive to the overall Talen Energy fleets given a significant levels of base load that we have with firm fuel. So it obviously includes nuclear and the coal assets as well as any dual fuel. So given the characteristics of our portfolio, this would be a significant potential upside to the Talen Energy fleet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neel Mitra at Tudor Pickering.","Neel Mitra - Tudor Pickering","I had a question on domestic utilities and the 4% growth rate going forward. What are you potentially looking at in Pennsylvania and Kentucky after the ECR spending and what are some of the rate growth based projects that maybe aren't in the plan right now that you are contemplating?","Bill Spence","Well we provided CapEx plans for five years so I think you can -- and rate based growth. So I think at least that far out you can see pretty clearly where that growth is going to come from. The transmission and distribution systems are aging. We're replacing a lot of that aging equipment with newer technology, so I think much of that is going to continue on even beyond the five-year program and plan.","And we're going to be providing 2019 numbers on the yearend earnings call. So you get at least another additional year at that point. I'll ask Rick and Greg to comment for both Kentucky and Pennsylvania to maybe supplement anything there.","Rick Klingensmith","We're in the process of putting together our plans for the next couple of years and I would expect that will continue to feel the environmental pressures particularly in the landfill slide so I would anticipate to the additional expenditures on the environmental side. And in addition, while we did postpone the Green River facility from 2018, we probably will have to bring that back in some time 2021. So we would look at additional expense in the latter part of the period as well. And frankly just given the state of play, I'm confident the environmental requirements are going to go up.","Greg Dudkin","As far as Pennsylvania, again we're in the middle of a planning process and just as Bill said, we'd see continued needs of both on the distribution and transmission but expect additional expenditures in both places.","Bill Spence","And I think our largest growth opportunity in Pennsylvania is the Compass Program, that 725 mile transmission lines so to the extent that is ultimately approved, that would be I think a very large and meaningful project for Pennsylvania and for Greg's business.","Neel Mitra - Tudor Pickering","And Paul, you kind of mentioned that your combined cycle plants are running really low while be base load plants are disadvantaged with dark spreads. Are there any Brownfield opportunities given the fact that you're right on top of the Marcellus with a lot of your base load and intermediate plants to expand capacity there? Or would it run into some market monitor issues?","Paul Farr","No, there wouldn't -- to the extent we decides to build something while we\u2019ve to go through our normal triennial process to ensure we don't have market power for that purpose from a market monitor perspective if we build, that's different than buying which creates kind of an immediate tests. So we will be okay on the build side, I believe in this area.","We have an existing site at Martin's Creek, that's buildable and dual fuel. We're still looking at very seriously the ability to gasify Brunner Island to the extent that we did that beside that pipe could also handle CCBT [ph] at that site, we\u2019re very close by. So we've got a couple of sites ready to go in PJM as well as two of the three sites in Texas are expandable as well if we see the right price signals and the right fundamental there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fleishman at Wolfe Research.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Just on the updated guidance for '14 and locations for '15. So any of the -- you mentioned the UK incentive revenues and the structural change were already in the guidance when given when the Talen deal was announced? Is that correct?","Bill Spence","That's correct, Steve.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Okay, but is there any other benefit of the '14 improvement that would flow through to '15?","Bill Spence","Not really, Steve, most of the benefits of 2014 are coming from the supply segment as we talked about a little bit improvement on the WPD side in the UK. But the bulk of the outperformance in 2014 has been on the competitive gen side.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Okay and then you're expecting improvement in Kentucky in '15 and anticipated this rate filing?","Bill Spence","Yes. That's correct.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Okay. And then maybe could you give us a little more sense on the new structure for the UK businesses and the ability to how flexible are you to take basically cash out every year?","Rick Klingensmith","As Vince mentioned in his remarks, we've done a restructuring reorganization of our -- primarily our UK holding company organization. And as you know, we operate the WPD business as one business all for distribution network, operating companies. But in the past, we have had two legal entity structures; the legacy, the Southwest and the South Wales business came up through one legal entity structure and the new Midlands businesses came up through a parallel but a separate legal entity structure. And so what we've been able to accomplish here at the end of October is to bring that within a single UK holding company structure. And so that actually provides for a financially stronger holding company that should be better positioned for future debt issuances and re-financings that we now need to do out of the holding company.","It also sort of simplifies the group structure for other third parties, the credit rating agencies, the banks and other entities as well. We do see some benefits internally, it helps us with cash management, regulatory reporting and some administrative elements and so we\u2019re quite pleased with the reorganization that we just accomplished for this stage.","As we look to future cash repatriation, there was a side benefit in that we did within the planning of this combination, significant looks at and reviews of our cash repatriation needs for the future and how we can bring them back in a tax efficient manner. And not have higher incremental U.S. taxes under the new structure and we were successful in being able to lower our effective tax rates out into the future as compared to this year and even the average that we have had for the last few years.","So we were not only from a business standpoint improving the structure, but we were also able to bring back the levels of cash that we've forecasted in the past and that we have commented on and provided you the numbers in the past. We'll be able to do that more tax efficiently than we had expected as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lapides at Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Just a couple of easy questions here, first of all, in the UK can you just quantify for us what the revenue roll off in 2015 is related to implementation of REO in the spring and if I heard correctly the step up and bonus revenue is just 17 million, but I didn't hear the first piece about the roll off.","Rick Klingensmith","As we look to fiscal year 2015, the revenues will be changing on April 1 of that year. So it's not a full year effect. But we're seeing about a $150 million in a revenue reduction, that\u2019s a $0.15 as our reduction for fiscal year '15. I'm sorry, Michael, the second part of the question again?","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","And so just partially offsetting that is the bonus revs, the bonus revenues are only up about -- is that $17 million or is it more than that?","Rick Klingensmith","Well is 17 million higher on a regulatory year basis and again that will start on April 1st as well, so that $130 million will be coming in and starting within that period of time. The fiscal year on fiscal year difference between 2014 and 2015 is not as great, but it absolutely helps mitigate the revenue short fall or the revenue decline that we\u2019re seeing in 2015. What's also helping is I had mentioned earlier is that we're seeing lower taxes -- tax expense, so that\u2019s helpful. We\u2019re seeing a benefit from the currency hedging that we had put into place where we're 98% hedged at a $1.63 per pound rate, so that\u2019s how to mitigate the decline in revenue for next year.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","And on PPL supply when I look at the 2016 data that's in the hedging supply, two things. One, putting noticeable drop-offs in the volumes expected from the Eastern base load facility when you look at '15 versus '16, what's driving that?","Paul Farr","In '15 versus '16 we've got reversion and spark spreads, we've got only a very small portion of the year that we've got the correct facility available. So it's market drivers and not having correct available and the mix and any further step [ph] all the way from '14 to '15 to '16 you\u2019ve got the 3 million -- 3.5 million megawatt hours of hydro also disappearing through that time period as well.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Yes, I'm just thinking more on the PJM fleet. The 43.1 down to 40.8 is that all spark spread driven or is it planned outage related as well?","Paul Farr","That's all base load, so you'll see what's happening in the spark spread, at the bottom, the dark spread at the top.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","And then the last thing on coal for the Montana fleet, the 2016 data assumes a reasonable uptick in the coal pricing. Just curious for the driver of that given how weak PRB prices have been recently.","Paul Farr","Yes so being eliminated from there is coal from the correct facility. So it's Colstrip only and it's looking at the cost plus contract at the mine relative to the volumes and spreading those overheads and so that's -- it's again it's a decently sized range given that in '16 it's all coal stratified. But that mine outside -- that mine production I think you\u2019ve to look at it a little differently that broad based PRB. Not putting on the same economics as procuring from the market because we\u2019re sole sourced from one provider from conveyor belt removal [ph]?","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","And can you remind why the removal of Corette?","Bill Spence","Yes so Corette won't be able to meet and MATS [ph] come spring at last year on any type of economic basis that we see today. So, we just simply can't meet the SO2, mercury requirements for that facility in an economic fashion, so it's going to be shut.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","So it leads to lower O&M at supply a little bit in '16 over '15 as you\u2019ve fewer megawatts but also obviously the loss margin.","Bill Spence","That\u2019s correct.","Operator","We have Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","I would just like to follow-up on the question on the UK reorganization and in terms of the making an impact on a going forward tax burden that you referenced. Can you maybe quantify that and then explain to what extent and how it flows through into the earnings reported in the U.S. just to help us think that through? And I want to confirm it feels like that something you didn't include in your guidance whereas some of the other elements were in the guidance. So I want to make sure I'm right about that.","Rick Klingensmith","With regards to some of the specifics around the tax efficiency that we're seeing, I'll give you some numbers and we think about in an effective tax rate areas. In the past couple of years, 2013 our effective tax rate was about 20%. This year as Vince had mentioned we\u2019re seeing some higher tax on our cash repatriation and this restructuring, we\u2019re going to be slightly over 23% this year on the effective tax rate","As we go out into future, we're going to see an effective tax rate that averages slightly less than 18%. So we're seeing some benefits out into the future, those benefits were included in the '15 and '16 guidance because we had already had plans in place for how to mitigate the REO and the revenue changes that were coming along and this will help us is further out past that period of time when we can average a lower effective tax rate than what we were expecting out in that period.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","So is 19% a good number to use right through the 7-year review?","Rick Klingensmith","Probably not through the entire 7-year view review, but at least through the next five years, 8-year review, I should say. But at least through the next five years that we've gone out in our calculations and our plans.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","So the 18% is the right number, but it was already in the guidance --","Rick Klingensmith","For 2015 and 2016, that is correct. And the second part of your question deal with how does it flow-through earnings from a UK regulated segment, we not only report the earnings that we translate and received from WPD from the UK, but then we also incorporated and include the domestic effects which include some overhead costs here at PPL, but also include the U.S. tax expense on class repatriation. And so the UK regulated segment just in its normal reporting process will incorporate whatever costs there are or whatever benefits there are within our earnings.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","And are those numbers that you just gave the 20%, 23% and 18%, they include both of those tax items, is that correct?","Rick Klingensmith","They include both the UK and the U.S. tax effects that is correct. That\u2019s a combined effective tax rate.","Bill Spence","Thank you Jonathan and thanks to everyone for joining the call and look forward to your questions and comments on our year-end call. Thank you.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Good morning everyone. And thank you for joining the PPL conference call on fourth quarter and year end 2018 financial results. We've provided slides for this presentation in our earnings release issued this morning on the investor section of our Web site.","Our presentation and earnings release, which we will discuss during today's call, contain forward-looking statements about future operating results or other future events.

","Bill Spence","Thank you, Andy and good morning everyone. We\u2019re pleased that you joined us for our 2018 year-end earnings call. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin and Paul Thompson, the heads of our U.S. utility businesses; and Phil Swift, who is recently named Chief Executive of Western Power Distribution in the UK, following the unfortunate passing of Robert Simons in November.","While we are deeply saddened by Robert's passing and he will be sorely missed, we are very fortunate to have Phil who has a wealth of experience with over 25 years at WPD. I have great confidence in Phil's ability to read our tremendous team there, and to continue the company's proven track record of outstanding execution established by Robert over the past 20 years.","Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning begins with a brief overview of 2018 results and PPL's business outlook for 2019. I will also provide a brief update on key regulatory developments. Vince will then provide a more detailed financial review of 2018 and 2019 and a discussion on our earnings guidance for 2021. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions.","Turning to Slide 4, 2018 marked another successful year for PPL as we delivered on our strategy of best in sector operational performance, investing in a sustainable energy future, maintaining a strong financial foundation and engaging and developing our people. We closed the year with strong operational and financial results. As announced earlier today, we achieved the high-end of our 2018 ongoing earnings forecast range or $2.40 per share. 2018 was the ninth consecutive year that we exceeded the midpoint of our guidance.","It was the second straight year that we achieved the high-end of our forecast. We\u2019re very proud of this track record of financial performance. It reflects our emphasis on execution and operational excellence across the regulated businesses, which included minimizing regulatory lag and achieving the allowed returns set by each regulatory jurisdiction, which we accomplished in 2018. This was paramount in delivering a 7% increase in ongoing earnings from 2017 results, while also strengthening the balance sheet post tax reform.","Focused on maintaining a strong financial foundation, we completed 1.7 billion equity forward to mitigate tax reform impacts, strengthened future credit metrics and support our solid investment grade credit rating. As for investing in a sustainable energy future, we successfully completed about 3.5 billion of infrastructure improvements in 2018.","In Pennsylvania, we installed approximately 1.2 million new meters, keeping us well on pace to conclude our advanced metering project in 2019. We also continued to strengthen our transmission system to improve grid security and resiliency. In Kentucky, we continued to make progress on a multiyear project to cap and close ash ponds at our coal-fired power plants. We ramped up investment in smart grid technology on our distribution and transmission systems to quickly detect outages and restore power. And we put the finishing touches on a modernization project at our Ohio Falls hydroelectric facility, increasing the generating capacity from 80 to 100 megawatts.","In the UK, we executed on our asset replacement and thought management plans. We continued to incorporate more automation on our networks and advanced numerous low carbon network projects to enable increased adoption of distributed energy resources. In addition to delivering strong financial results through our infrastructure investments, we continued to make progress in pursuit of our strategy to deliver best in sector operational performance. Our utilities remained among the very best for customer satisfaction in the regions we serve. Both PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities received J.D. Power awards for residential customer satisfaction, achieving the highest overall marks in their respective categories and regions based on customer surveys.","These achievements represent the 46th and 47th J.D. Power awards earned by our domestic utility. Meanwhile, our four UK distribution network operating companies remains the top four performers in Ofgem's Broad Measure of Customer Satisfaction for the regulatory year ended March of 2018. WPD also ranked best among UK operators and stakeholder engagement, and addressing vulnerable customers, which are important areas for Ofgem, and they did this for the seventh straight year.","At the same time, safety and reliability across our businesses remain strong in 2018. All three of our domestic utility companies were recognized as top quartile of public utilities nationwide and limiting the average number of outages per customer. In addition and for the second straight year, PPL electric posted its best year ever for safety. These achievements reflect the common purpose and desire across our businesses to deliver without fail for our customers, to exceed their expectations and to improve performance each and every day.","On the regulatory front, I would like to highlight our efforts in Pennsylvania in establishing a means for alternative rate making for state utilities. We view this as a very important piece of legislation as it grants the ability to develop additional regulatory mechanisms such as decoupling and incentive-based rates. Also in 2018, we continued to invest in our employees, developing the pipeline of future leaders and fostering a more inclusive and encouraging innovation among our employees. While we need to continuously focus attention in this area, I\u2019m proud to report that PPL was recognized by Forbes Magazine as one of America's best employers in 2018. Our Pennsylvania operations were also recognized as best places to work for disability inclusion and received a perfect score of 100% on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index.","Turning to our 2019 outlook on Slide 5. Today, we initiated formal 2019 earnings guidance of $2.30 a share to $2.50 a share. Vince will take you through a detailed walk of 2018 actual to the 2019 forecast earnings later in his remarks. Our projected 2019 results keep us firmly on track to achieve the 5% to 6% growth target for ongoing EPS through 2020, which we reaffirmed today. We also initiated a projected earnings guidance range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share for 2021.","Turning to our dividend. Today, we announced we are raising the annualized dividend of $1.65 per share. PPL has paid the dividends in every quarter since 1946. In addition, the company has increased its dividend 17 times over the past 18 years. We remain committed to dividend growth as it is an important piece of our overall share in a return proposition. We will continue to assess the rate at which we grow the dividend in the context of our yield and payout ratio relative to peers. In terms of network investment for 2019, we plan to put another $3.3 billion into our utilities, which we continue to support the efforts to improve the customer experience and resiliency of the grid.","As reflected in our 2018 results, our investments are driving better operational performance. We expect this trend to continue as we make these additional investments. Finally, we will remain focused on achieving balanced regulatory outcomes that will benefit our customers and our shareowners. In Kentucky, our rate review which seeks a combined revenue increase of $172 million continues to proceed as scheduled before the Kentucky Public Service Commission. Our rate requests are being made to support additional capital investments to make the grid smarter, stronger and more resilient, to replace aging natural gas lines and to support additional power plant performance and reliability improvements. All these investments are expected to further improve service to our customers. In the UK, we continued work with Ofgem to develop the rules that maybe used to shape the framework for the next price control, which begins in 2023 for electric distribution utilities.","Turning to Slide 6, we wanted to clarify and outline some observations about Ofgem's recent RIIO-2 consultation document that pertains to the electric transmission and gas subsectors. That consultation document, which was issued in December, does not apply to electricity distribution network operators, including our UK company, Western Power Distribution or WPD. In addition, it does not impact WPD's current business plans that extend through March of 2023 or it does not impact WPD's operations. It is important to note that this is a consultation and Ofgem is seeking comment from a wide variety of stakeholders to ensure the best outcome.","The comment period on that consultation ends March 14, 2019 with a decision expected by Ofgem in May. In that consultation document, the proposed returns for gas and transmission were lower than we expected. They are based on current market conditions and other proposed methodologies on which Ofgem is seeking input and comments. Also in that document, Ofgem proposes to index the cost of equity to risk-free rates, which are currently negative in the UK. Given we are years away from settling our tariffs or setting them for the electric distribution sector and market rates are currently near record lows, we believe there is potential upside from current market conditions in terms of the cost of equity that we will be receiving in RIIO-ED2. We also expect that incentives will play a significant role in RIIO-2 based on the subsector consultation.","We recognize that this will be an area of key debate as it represents a significant opportunity in driving operational efficiency and returns. While it's not clear how incentives will be structured for electric distribution networks at this time, we expect that Ofgem will be more focused on differentiating returns and provide substantial opportunities for the top performers. WPD is well-positioned with its strong track record of superior customer service and reliability. Further, we see ample opportunity for continued RAV growth through RIIO-2 to support replacement of aging infrastructure and the investment demands of UK electrification and carbon reduction initiatives. PPL and WPD will continue to monitor Ofgem's RIIO-2 consultation process and provide input and engage with Ofgem to ensure the best outcomes for all stakeholders.","Lastly, even though the current consultation for transmission and gas does not apply to WPD, we would still encourage our investors and others to provide their feedback and views to Ofgem on this consultation. It is critically important that Ofgem hears from all stakeholders during the consultation.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview. Vince?","Vince Sorgi","Thank you, Bill and good morning everyone. Let's move to Slide 8 for a brief financial overview before I get into the details. Regarding 2018, I will focus my prepared remarks this morning on the full year results. Please refer to the news release for additional details on the fourth quarter results.","Today, we announced 2018 reported earnings of $2.58 per share compared to $1.64 per share a year ago. 2018 reported earnings reflect net special item benefits of $0.18 per share, primarily due to unrealized foreign currency economic hedges. 2017 reported results reflect net special item expenses of $0.61 per share, primarily due to the impact of U.S. tax reform and the unrealized foreign currency economic hedges. Adjusting for these special items, 2018 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.40 per share compared to $2.25 per share a year ago. A solid execution of our business plan and benefits from weather during the year enabled us to achieve the high-end of our ongoing earnings guidance range.","Looking at 2019, as Bill indicated, we announced formal guidance of $2.30 to $2.50 per share. As you may recall, we accelerated the timing of some planned equity issuances into 2018 and 2019 as a result of U.S. tax reform to support our credit metrics and significant capital investment program. While this results in higher dilution in 2018 and 2019, we continue to expect 5% to 6% compound annual EPS growth through 2020 based on the 2018 original ongoing earnings guidance midpoint of $2.30 per share. In addition, we continue to project growth through 2021 and have initiated a guidance range of $2.50 and $2.80 per share, which I'll discuss in detail in few moments.","Turning to Slide 9 for a detailed review of 2018 financial results. Overall, we continue to deliver strong year-over-year earnings growth at each of our operating companies, driven by our substantial investment and ability to earn our allowed returns. Excluding the $0.07 per share impact from dilution, 2018 financial results grew nearly 10% from 2017 results. The primary drivers for the year-over-year increase are higher adjusted gross margins, the higher foreign currency translation rate and higher pension income for the UK segment. The positive drivers were partially offset by higher income taxes, higher O&M, higher depreciation and higher financing costs. A portion of the adjusted gross margin increase was driven by higher sales volumes due to whether of about $0.11 per share, primarily at our domestic utility.","Turning to the individual segment drivers starting with the UK. Our UK regulated segment earned $1.36 per share, a $0.12 year-over-year increase excluding dilution. This increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margin driven by the April 1, 2018 price increase, higher foreign currency exchange rates in 2018 compared to 2017 of $0.13 and other, primarily due to an increase in expected pension asset returns on higher asset balances. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher O&M and higher income taxes, primarily due to higher U.S. income taxes as a result of 2017 U.S. tax benefit from accelerated pension contributions and the reduction in tax benefits on holding company interest expense due to the lower federal tax rate resulting from U.S. tax reform.","In Pennsylvania, we earned $0.62 per share, a 13% year-over-year increase excluding dilution. This increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins of $0.15 per share, primarily resulting from results on additional transmission capital investments, higher distribution sales volumes, including $0.03 due to weather and higher zonal peak load. Note that adjusted gross margins for both Pennsylvania and Kentucky reflect the impact of lower collected taxes and revenues, which is offsetting taxes and driving the significant tax benefit reflected on the slide. Higher adjusted gross margins in Pennsylvania were partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to asset additions and higher financing costs.","Turning to our Kentucky regulated segment, we earned $0.59 per share in 2018, a $0.04 year-over-year increase from 2017 excluding the impact of dilution. This increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins of $0.16 per share, excluding the effect of tax reform that is offset in tax. The increase in gross margins was driven by higher sales volumes, primarily due to favorable weather of $0.06, higher base electricity and gas rates effective July 1, 2017 and returns on additional environmental capital investments. This was partially offset by higher O&M expense and higher depreciation expense due to asset additions.","Turning to corporate and other. We experienced a $0.07 decrease driven by higher taxes due to reduced tax benefit as a result of lower taxes yield on holding company interest expense and higher financing costs.","Moving to our 2019 outlook on Slide 10. We began with our strong 2018 and adjust for the significant weather benefits experienced this past year, which results in 2018 whether normalized ongoing earnings of $2.32 per share. All units add as a base in explaining the year-over-year drivers for comparability purposes. From that base, we project earnings per share growth at each of our segments, excluding $0.13 of dilution as a result of settling the remaining 43 million shares of common stock under our forward equity sales agreements that we completed in May of 2018. You will see on the Slide that we detailed the $0.13 of dilution by segment.","Looking at the operational drivers, excluding the dilution. In the UK statement segment, we expect to deliver higher earnings of $0.13 per share compared to 2018. This increase is expected to result from higher gross margins, primarily driven by an April 1, 2019 price increase, a higher foreign currency exchange rate and other primarily due to pension. This is partially offset by higher interest expense from incremental debt issuances and higher income taxes. In Pennsylvania, we are projecting higher earnings of $0.02 per share. Higher transmission margins and lower O&M expenses are expected to be partially offset by higher depreciation due to continued capital investments. In Kentucky, we are projecting a $0.04 increase in earnings per share. This is expected to be driven by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily driven by higher base electricity and gas rates and return on additional environmental capital investments. This is partially offset by higher ONM expenses, higher depreciation and higher interest expense due to planned debt issuance.","Turning to Slide 11. Today, we initiated a guidance range for 2021 of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. Our high-level underlying assumptions are reflected on this slide, which begin with our rate base and returns. Rate base continues to grow at a steady pace of 5% to 6% given the substantial investment opportunities we have at each of the utilities. In terms of ROE, our teams have done an excellent job of maintaining strong returns at or near their allowed levels through cost management, utilization of favorable recovery mechanisms and achieving performance initiatives. We are confident that we will continue to execute at that high-level as we have demonstrated consistently.","We have also updated our assumptions regarding UK pension, interest under recovery and various others true-up mechanisms under the UK regulatory framework. In total, we are projecting these adjustments to impact 2021 earnings in a range of negative $0.05 to negative $0.10 per share compared to 2020's estimated earnings. In terms of foreign currency for 2021, we\u2019re using a range of $1.35 on the low side and $1.60 on the high side. A $1.35 represents forward rates and the low end of our bank forecast for 2021, a $1.60 reflects the higher end of the bank forecast for '21 and the historical average for the GDP rate. I will touch on our foreign currency hedging status in a few moments. Overall, our expense activity on a fully open position remains at about a penny change in the currency rate keep growing up a penny change in EPS.","Moving to Slide 12, our planned capital expenditures for 2019 through 2023 are detailed on the slide with infrastructure investment totaling $14.5 billion over the period. In the UK, we\u2019re projecting over $5.5 billion of capital investments over the next five years. There has not been significant changes to our UK capital plan as those have already been accepted by Ofgem through the end of RIIO-ED1. As we think about future spending beyond the current price control period, the electric distribution sector will have significant opportunities to deploy incremental capital given the UK's electrification initiatives.","Turning to Pennsylvania. We are projecting about $4.5 billion of investment over the next five years with the majority of the investment in transmission as we continue our focus on grade resiliency and modernization. There are also no significant changes to report in our Pennsylvania capital plan with a slight increase, driven by additional reliability in other projects in providing our electric service to our customers. Finally, in Kentucky, we are projecting more than $4.5 billion of investment over that period. We made a few changes to the Kentucky capital plan in this update. First, we included some incremental infrastructure projects and some environmental spending related to compliance with fluid limitation guidelines. In total, this was about $425 million of incremental capital.","However, we also updated the Kentucky capital plan to remove about $275 million for the advanced metering system project. We continue to believe the AMS project will benefit our customers, and we expect to continue to seek approval from KPSC for this project. Similar to prior years, we only included identified projects with the high probability of certainty in our capital plan. We will update our capital plan at the appropriate time for normal course along with any additional capital spending opportunities across our utilities as we often identify projects during the execution of our plan.","Let\u2019s move to Slide 13 to close with a discussion on our foreign currency strategy. As we outlined at the beginning of 2018, our foreign currency hedge percentages are back within the rolling 36 month targeted ranges established under our risk management framework. As a reminder, those hedge ranges are as follows; 70% to 100% hedge for the next 12 months; 30% to 70% for the second 12 months; and 0% to 30% hedged for the third 12 months. We remain fully hedge through 2019 and about 50% hedged for 2020 at hedge rates well above current market rates, which should support our earnings translation through the volatile period surrounding Brexit.","We continue to believe that there will be upside to the current rates as we move past the political uncertainty in the UK. We will continue to be opportunistic in our hedging execution as we have done historically. You can see on the right side of the page that most bank forecast remain above the current forwards, especially for 2021. We continue to maintain our budgeted rate for open positions at $1.40 per pound for 2020. And as I mentioned earlier, we are using a range of $1.35 to $1.60 per pound for the low and high ranges of our 2021 guidance.","That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period.","Bill Spence","Thanks, Vince. In closing, PPL delivered another strong performance in 2018 as we continue to execute on our strategy for growth and operational excellence. Once again, we delivered strong financial results. We executed on our financing plan and positioned the company well post tax reform. We provided award-winning customer service and reliability to our more than 10 million customers. With an eye towards the future, we invested in infrastructure to make the grid smarter, more reliable and more resilient, and to advance a cleaner energy future. We continue to deliver on our commitments to customers and shareowners and we will continue to deliver long-term value for those who invest in PPL.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the call up for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha","My first question comes back to one of the assumptions you've made for 2021, which has UK pension income and a couple of other factors. Just wanted to get a sense of how much UK pension income are you currently booking? And that negative $0.05 to $0.10 you assumed in '21. Is that primarily pension income reduction or is it the other factors driving it? And also when will you know for certain what the pension income will be for 2021?","Bill Spence","Let me start and then I'll turn part of this over to Vince. We\u2019re expecting about a negative $0.05 impact from the pension deficit in our base case, so that that is the number that's really associated directly with the pension deficit. As you noted, there are some other drivers which are some other true ups that could impacted, but that's the primary amounts and the $0.05 what\u2019s built into the base case for now. Relative to the amounts that we\u2019re collecting it's about $180 million of revenue that we're collecting in pension deficit funding. Based on the current assumptions and as Vince noted, the lower asset returns and balances we believe are still going to require continued deficit funding certainly over the next several years. So just for sensitivity purposes, as we noted, we stressed another $0.05 in the low case. So the primary drivers to the high and low guidance range that we gave are the FX and UK pension and other true ups, which we discussed. Relative to the more detailed question, I'll turn it over to Vince.","Vince Sorgi","So Ali, when we think about the timing of when we will know what\u2019s going to happen with the pension deficit, we will be setting our tariffs for 2021, 2022 actually at end of this year that will require us to make an estimate of what we think the pension deficit requirements will be really for the remainder of ED1. So by the end of this year, we will know what the revenues for the calendar year '21 will be, but they will be subject to true up once we get through the full tri-annual review with trustees and then with the pension regulator and then ultimately with Ofgem, which we had indicated would be completed at the end of 2020. So any true up that would be required there would be trued up in the '23, '24 time frame. So that just gives you a sense of how this process and how these adjustments will play out.","Bill Spence","And I guess just to conclude the thought here on the pension deficit. We\u2019re not expecting that the entire amount of the pension deficit would go way through the ED1 process. So we think there could be the negative impacts some reductions but certainly don't believe at this point that the majority of it would go away.","Ali Agha","Second question, Vince, just looking at the -- or Bill for that matter. The dividend increase when I compare it to the last couple of year, it was much more modest. Just again wanted to get a sense of your thinking on the dividend and what brought it to a substantially lower growth rate than what we\u2019ve been seeing the last couple of years?","Vince Sorgi","I think it's not just one factor, there is couple of factors. Maybe the first is we look at the dividend in the context of the overall total return that we expect to deliver to the shareowners. And currently with the 5.5% EPS growth and the almost 5.5% dividend growth, we\u2019re looking at about an 11% total return for shareholders, which we think puts us in the top quartile of the peer group. So we think that that's competitive overall with the peer group. The second factor that we typically look at is the payout ratio compared to our peer group. And we're currently at nearly 70% payout, so that's on the high end of the peer group. So we'd like to work that down more in line with peers over time. So those are two of several factors that go into our thought process.","Ali Agha","Last question, Bill, again to you. As it currently relates to UK assets, just wondering are there any other proactive strategic options still left on the table worth looking at, or is it more a sense of just keep executing hunkering down and letting the uncertainties play themselves out over time?","Bill Spence","As I previously have mentioned, we continuously look for opportunities to create shareowner value as we've really done over the past decade. And if there is a clear and compelling path that we can take to drive additional value for the shareowners, we are certainly going to consider it. And I think our track record has clearly demonstrated that. So I think we continue to operate exceptionally well and believe the current business mix and plan is going to generate long-term shareowner value. And certainly, I believe we have a very strong business plan with significant rate base and earnings growth and a very competitive dividend. So I don't think we're compelled to react hastily to political or regulatory aspects that quite frankly are out of our control and take options that might destroy shareowner value not created. So we continue to look at that but that at the moment, nothing clear and compelling to drive additional value for shareowners.","Operator","The next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. ","Greg Gordon","I think you mentioned the question of the pension pretty well. But when you look at the drivers that the overall set of drivers that that $0.05 to $0.10 range, are there other offsetting things in there that are actually positives like thinking about the level of negative delta associated with interest? So I know people tend to be hyper-focused on like this, oh, we can lose $0.20 on the pension. Are there other things going from '20 to '21 in that driver basket that actually could be positive drivers that mitigate that, and having less of a pension deficit?","Vince Sorgi","So a couple of things I would point to. One is and you alluded to it as inflation. To the extent that inflation is driving the RPI or CPI in the UK upwards, which it has been, that's actually a positive, because that creates incremental revenue for us. And certainly, we've seen some benefit from that here lately. I think also incremental cost efficiency, we've done an excellent job, both in the UK and in the domestic utilities, to really try to take cost out wherever we can and that\u2019s certainly an area that we're going to continue to look at. I think the other things are customer and load growth. I think you see that with our year end 2018 on a weather adjusted basis, we did see some uptick in low growth. I'm not sure that that's indicative of what we're going to see going forward but built into our plan is actually slightly negative will grow. So certainly anything flat to positive will be upside to the current plan.","And then of course regulatory outcomes could always, whether it'd be in Kentucky or Pennsylvania could help lift earnings higher as well. So those are just to set some of the other ones that I would add and potentially incremental CapEx towards the back end of the plan. As Vince mentioned, our CapEx plan is really just based on specific projects that we already know about and have high confidence that we can execute on. But I'm sure that there will be additional incremental CapEx as we look towards the back end of the plan.","Greg Gordon","And my next question goes to the attestations you're making with regard to your views on the trajectory of what the negotiation with Ofgem will look like on RIIO-ED2, differences between the way distribution will be -- might be treated versus the way it appears at least with the outset transmission and gas are being treated. When you look at where this 3% number that they are testing to starting at in terms of ROE. How do you think about walking that up to what you think you'll really be what the real earnings opportunity is going to look like? Because I think in prior conversations you've talked about how that really masks an opportunity when you add everything up to get back to the types of returns on equity that are consistent with what we earn here in the U.S.?","Bill Spence","So starting from that base, number one would be probably an expectation that we\u2019re not going to be in a negative risk-free return environment by the time our ROE is actually set. So that would be probably point number one. Point number two would be the upside potential from incentive revenue that we've had a long history of doing very, very well at. The third element would probably be the shift from fast flat to slow flat , putting more of our revenue into the, if you want to call it, the fast flat, the operating and maintenance bucket and a little bit less in the CapEx for slow flat bucket. And I believe that would have been about $140 million that we shifted at about 10% in the current RIIO-ED1 regulatory process.","Other potential upsides we know that Ofgem is going to have a keen focus on how do they incentivize the electric distribution companies to meet some of the clean energy objectives, policy objectives, in the UK. And we believe that's going to result in some other opportunities, whether that'd be CapEx or otherwise. But also in our case, the one element that we do have that we mentioned earlier on the pension deficit funding that\u2019s $180 million that could be converted from arguably less quality earnings to more higher quality earnings through additional CapEx that we could spend and still not raise customer rates, because of that production coming off the pension deficit we can replace it with something that's going to be longer-term an earnings drivers. So those are I would say the major drivers as we look to RIIO-ED2, which again doesn't start for us until April 2023.","Vince Sorgi","Bill, maybe just a couple additional comments. So Greg, when you look at the expected ROREs, which are the RIIO returns in the gas sector, they're projected to be close to 11% for the electric distribution sector, it's projected to be under 9.5%. So I don't think you're necessarily going to see the same level of adjustment for the electric distribution companies as what\u2019s been contemplated for gas. We've in our conversations with Ofgem and they've made it clear in the consultation that this does not apply to electric distribution. They've affirmed that to us in our direct conversations with them. And as Bill said, I think we all agree that there will be additional capital requirements going into electric distribution in RIIO2 as compared to RIIO1, all the electrification needs. And so again our sense is that Ofgem will ultimately for the electric distribution companies come out with their returns to incentivize that investment.","Operator","The next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Arnold","I think most of my questions have been answered. But I\u2019m just curious in your comments on your approach to hedging and the currency. How long will you wait before you start looking in some more of 2020 and start on 2021? And how much flexibility do you have within the policy?","Bill Spence","We do have quite a bit of flexibility. But Vince, maybe you can give some color around that.","Vince Sorgi","Yes, our current projection would suggest that we would need to start layering in around April to be remained compliant with the policy.","Jonathan Arnold","April of '19?","Bill Spence","Correct, for hedges beginning in the backend of 2020.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Michael Lapides","Just a little confused about the 2021 guidance, and then have a question about rate base and cash flow. On the '21 guidance, your range includes an FX range that honestly we haven\u2019t seen in a couple of years. We haven\u2019t seen that since the middle of 2016. So if I would just say what's used current today, you would be at the very low end of the guidance range. Is that the right way to think about it or are there other puts and takes in there?","Bill Spence","Go ahead, Vince, I will let you take that one.","Vince Sorgi","I think that if you just adjust that assumption on its own, it would suggest that Michael. But I would be hesitant to confirm that conclusion, because of all the items that Bill talked about before. So, the regulatory outcomes in Kentucky could come out better than what we are projecting. Again, we use pretty conservative assumptions when we model some of this base stuff out. And so customer and load growth were flat for Kentucky, slightly negative for PA. If we determine that, the solid sales growth that we\u2019re seeing in 2018, is not just the weather anomaly and that actually continues going forward. That would provide some upside to that base number. Again, we talked about the additional capital investment as we go through the plan, none of that is built into the low end of the range. So of course, we have O&M and inflation assumption in there. So, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that if it stayed at 135 we would only be it at 250 in 2021. But clearly, that\u2019s the assumption we put into that low end of the range.","Bill Spence","And I would say just the mixture of that put a point on this, the $1.35. We've certainly seen that number in the forwards for post Brexit. So I think you were probably, Michael, referring to the $1.60 to high end, we haven\u2019t seen since Brexit. So I just want to be clear. And that number is really informed by two things; one is, some bank forecasts that we've seen; and the second is that had been, prior to Brexit, I think around the 10 year average of actually, I think the 10 year average was slightly higher, maybe around $1.65. So, I think it has some basis for our forecast in reality assuming that Brexit is behind us by the time we get to 2021.","Michael Lapides","And then a question on rate base and cash flow. It seems that you\u2019re moderating your rate base growth a little base growth as you extend for the year versus what you gave out at EEI. Is it right to think about one of two things is happening; A, there's just not that much clarity on the back end of the forecasting. Meaning, four or five years is a long way out, CapEx could change a lot between now and then; and two, would that imply that pay, even if rate base growth does slow, it means cash flow would pick up. And if so, how would you utilize that extra cash?","Vince Sorgi","So actually under the existing capital plan that we've presented, we've become cash flow positive in the back end of the plan to you point Michael. And so really that additional cash is reducing the amount of debt and equity that we need to fund the CapEx plan. So at this point that cash would still be utilized to feed the capital.","Michael Lapides","Meaning, it would be utilized to fund the CapEx and potentially to de-lever up top of the holding company?","Vince Sorgi","Correct.","Operator","The next question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Praful Mehta","I just wanted to follow up on the strategic question that was addressed earlier around WPD. You had mentioned that you always look at strategic options as you've done in the past. Just wanted to check, the key constraint always seem to be the tax angle, right, the tax leakage that was related with any strategic transaction around WPD. Has anything changed around that or are there new options that have come up that may limit the tax leakage, in which case, there are more options to consider, or is it status quo around the tax leakage point?","Bill Spence","On the tax leakage, it's pretty much status quo. We have investigated many times different structures and alternatives that would significantly reduce the tax leakage, and none of those to-date at least have made it still shareowner positive, meaning, we're not destroying shareowner value. The other item that we talked about on one of the previous calls was that credit act of the sale -- the potential sale of WPD as being negative as well. So, there'd be both a tax and a credit impact that we'd have to overcome to make this shareowner accretive or in benefit for the shareowners.","Praful Mehta","And so no such solution exists at this point based on your review?","Bill Spence","Correct, none at this point.","Praful Mehta","And then secondly, on the rate base side, you have -- we were just comparing the rate base at EEI or the guidance on the rate base at EEI versus rate base guidance in your -- in your presentation today, and it looks like it's lowered a little bit. Is that -- firstly, is there anything specific on the reason driving it, is it just timing of CapEx or is there something else that should -- that we should be thinking about around the rate base projections going forward?","Bill Spence","There's not really anything major or specific, other than I would say, I believe, we've taken out Advanced Metering project in Kentucky. So that was a fairly sizable one and maybe some of the other projects that were probably lower probability projects that could come back into the plan. But I think it's just -- as we roll forward. It's just refining the numbers that we presented at EEI. And since EEI, we've had more planning done and we've presented our CapEx to our Board of Directors and had the latest numbers approved. So it's really kind of an update, a more specific update than we had at EEI.","Vince Sorgi","Praful, it's really just the math of dropping off a $3.5 billion a year and adding a $2.5 billion a year at the back end until we identify additional capital to be spent out there. So it's really, really just that.","Praful Mehta","Got you, super helpful. Appreciate it. Thanks so much guys.","Bill Spence","Thank you. Well, thanks everyone for joining today's call and we look forward to talking with you on the first quarter call.","Operator","Okay. The conference has now concluded.

With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin and Paul Thompson, the heads of our U.S. utility businesses, and Phil Swift, Head of our Operations at Western Power Distribution in the UK.","Moving to slide 3, given we will see many of you at EEI in a little over a week, we plan to keep our prepared remarks brief this morning. Our agenda begins with highlights of our 2018 third quarter results, including an update to our 2018 earnings guidance. This will then provide an overview of our third quarter 2018 segment earnings results. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions at the end.","Turning to slide 4, today, we announced strong third quarter reported earnings of $0.62 per share, resulting in a total of $2.01 per share to the first nine months of 2018. Adjusting for special items, primarily related to unrealized gains on our UK earnings hedges, third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.59 per share, up over 5% from the $0.56 per share a year ago.","On a year-to-date basis through September, ongoing earnings were $1.88 per share, up about 11% from the $1.70 per share a year ago, driven by higher earnings across all of our business segments.","Given our strong year-to-date results, we have further narrowed our 2018 guidance range from $2.30 per share to $2.40 per share, raising the midpoint to $2.35 from $2.33 per share. In addition to delivering these strong financial results in the third quarter, we took steps at our Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities businesses to support continued infrastructure investment that benefit our customers.","LG&E and KU filed rate requests with the Kentucky Public Service Commission on September 28, seeking approval for a combined revenue increase of about $170 million in electricity and gas-based rates. A more detailed breakdown of our rate requests can be found in the appendix of today's presentation. The requested increases will support continued monetization of the grid to strengthen grid resilience as well as upgrades to LG&E's natural gas system to enhance safety and reliability.","In addition, the increases will support continued investment in our power plants to improve performance and minimize our impact on the environment. Our rate request also includes a proposed Green Tariff, aimed at spurring renewable energy growth and economic development in Kentucky.","The Green Tariff will roll LG&E and KU's existing Green Energy program and solar offerings into one tariff to attract and retain businesses seeking these types of options. If approved by the Commission, LG&E and KU's requested revenue increases would take effect in May of 2019. Even with the increases associated with these proposed investments, LG&E and KU rates would remain well below national averages.","Shifting the focus to Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities ranked among the top 10% of utilities nationwide in a key reliability measure according to a report issued in the third quarter. The report issued by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers found PPL Electric had a lower rate of power outages than all but 5 of 93 utilities nationwide and the lowest outage frequency of utilities tracked in the Mid-Atlantic region. It's also worth noting that LG&E and KU are ranked in the top quartile nationally in terms of outage frequency according to the same report.","This achievement reflects the value of PPL Electric's continued investments in smart grid technology, power line upgrades, vegetation management and data analytics that help drive improvement. The company's reliable service also has led to higher customer satisfaction.","In the area of power quality and reliability, for example, PPL Electric Utilities ranked third in customer satisfaction in a recent national survey. These are just a couple of examples of the excellent operational performance we continue to demonstrate across all of our businesses. And it's that strong performance that gives us confidence in our ability to achieve 5% to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2018 through 2020, measured against our original 2018 ongoing earnings midpoint.","Looking ahead, we remain well positioned to deliver both competitive earnings growth and a secure and growing dividend for our shareowners.","With that, I'll now turn it over to Vince for more a detailed financial overview.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on slide 6 with an overview of third quarter segment results. PPL's third quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.03 per share over the prior year, driven by higher earnings in the UK and Pennsylvania segments. As a result of the warmer weather during the third quarter, we saw higher volumes in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky, which resulted in a $0.03 per share benefit for the quarter compared to 2017.","Corporate and Other was lower by $0.05 per share, primarily due to higher income tax expenses, which includes the timing impact of recording annual estimated taxes in 2017. Through the first nine months of the year, earnings are $0.18 higher than the prior year due to higher adjusted gross margins at our U.S. segments and higher currency rates and pension income in the UK.","On a year-to-date basis, weather has now contributed $0.11 of favorable earnings per share versus the prior year and $0.07 favorable compared to our original forecast.","I'll also note that in September, we drew down approximately $520 million from the May equity forward transaction, resulting in a total of $0.04 of dilution year-to-date versus last year. We expect to draw the remaining portion of the equity in 2019. And as Bill mentioned, PPL's continued strong performance in 2018 enables us to narrow the guidance range and increase the midpoint to $2.35 per share.","Let's move to a more detailed review of the segment earnings drivers, starting with the UK results on slide 7. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.30 per share in Q3 2018, a $0.06 increase compared to a year ago. The increase in U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2017 as the realized weighted average exchange rate for Q3 2018 was $1.34 per pound compared to $1.18 per pound in Q3 2017, higher adjusted gross margins due to the April 1, 2018, price increase and higher other income due to pensions. These positive drivers were partially offset by dilution of $0.01 per share.","Moving to Pennsylvania on slide 8, our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the third quarter of 2018, a $0.03 increase versus a year ago. Excluding the impacts on margins from lower income tax recovery, our Pennsylvania segment delivered higher adjusted gross margins of about $0.03 per share due to higher transmission margins from additional capital investments and higher distribution margins from increased electricity sales, primarily due to weather. The positive margins were partially offset by higher depreciation from additional utility plant additions. Consistent with prior quarters this year, our results reflect an offsetting variance due to the estimated income tax savings for our customers from U.S. tax reform, reflected in both adjusted gross margins and income taxes of $0.04.","Moving to Kentucky on slide 9, our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.17 per share in the third quarter of 2018, a $0.01 decrease compared to a year ago. Excluding the impacts on margins from lower income tax recovery, Kentucky's adjusted gross margin was higher by about $0.02 from higher sales volumes due to favorable weather and returns on additional environmental capital investments. This positive variance was more than offset by higher O&M and dilution of $0.01 per share.","Similar to our Pennsylvania segment, there are offsetting variances for the quarter in the adjusted gross margin and income tax line items of approximately $0.04 per share due to tax reform.","That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Yeah. Thank you, Vince. In closing, PPL's strong performance continued in the third quarter as we executed on our strategy for growth and success. Once again, we delivered solid financial results for the quarter and once again, we increased the midpoint of our annual guidance. Our strong financial and operational performance highlights the value of our investments and what they're delivering to both our customers and our shareowners. We're well-positioned to deliver on our 2018 earnings guidance and our future growth projections.","With that, operator, let's open the call up for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And your first question will be from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. First question, I noticed that if I saw it right, you did not increase any FX hedges for 2020. Just wondering what your current thoughts are on your hedging strategies there.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Sure. That's correct. And I'll ask Vince to comment further on that.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Sure, Ali. You are correct. We haven't added additional hedges during the quarter. The pound continues \u2013 really from a historical perspective is trading at historical lows and we think it makes sense and we can afford to be patient as we kind of think through the hedging strategy here.","We talked last quarter about \u2013 because we hedged so much in 2018 and 2019 and half of 2020 that we were actually outside of the bounds of our risk management guidelines. And so, we've kind of worked our way back into those bands through the completion of the third quarter into October. So, I would expect that we'll start to layer on hedges to be more consistent with our historical practices with our risk management policies, but we don't see the need today to load up on a lot of hedging in the out years at these rates.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And second question. Just wondering what's your visibility, right now, on sustaining this earnings growth beyond 2020? And just from a high-level perspective, given what we know today, I mean any sense of how your earnings profile changes when we transition to RIIO-2 in 2023 just from a high-level perspective?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","So, maybe I'll comment on the first part of your question on the earnings growth beyond 2020. I think you're probably aware, we would typically address earnings for 2021 or the year forward of our current three-year forecast on the fourth quarter earnings call. So, we would continue to use that practice. So, we wouldn't really have a lot to say today on the growth for 2020 or beyond 2020.","Having said that, we're showing you some capital in the plan, we're going to be updating that capital expenditure program probably through the fourth quarter of this year, be able to comment on that as well and update that more after the first of the year. So, relative to the transition after RIIO-ED2, Vince, do you want to make some comments around that?","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Sure. So, I think, we'll, Andy and I will provide some additional color and disclosures around what we see are the pluses and minuses going into ED2 as it relates to the ED1 plan.","Ali, I think, as it relates to earnings guidance beyond 2020, I think the CapEx and rate-based projections are good baseline to start with. But there are other considerations that we need to take into account, obviously, interest rate, taxes, foreign currency. Pensions are a big one as well. And when we look at the pension plans in the UK, they are performing quite well from a return perspective and we have our upcoming review with the pension regulator in March of 2019. That takes some time to get through, but that will ultimately determine how much pension deficit revenues we will be collecting post March of 2021. So, all of those things we will continue to monitor and at the appropriate time provide, I think, that guidance.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I understand. Last question. Bill, just wanted to get your latest thoughts. There's still a huge valuation gap between your stock and your U.S. peers. Just wondering what you're thinking there is. Is this one of those hunker down and wait for things to play out, Brexit, et cetera or something proactive on your end, just what's your latest thoughts there are?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Sure. I think at this point, given where Brexit sits, we're closing in hopefully on a deal for the exit from the EU. And that negotiation between the UK government and the EU Parliament is ongoing and it does seem that our take is that a deal will ultimately, probably get done, but we'll know one way or the other here in the next few months on that.","I think we're also seeing positive commentary around the value that the networks have been providing to consumers in the UK, both in terms of lower cost, better customer service. And I think there's a growing recognition in the UK that there have been great benefits from privatization degree of the electric network. So, I think \u2013 I sense that things are moving in a more positive direction on that front.","So, I think, for now, as I've said previously, we're always open to strategic options that will create value for shareowners, but at this time, we don't see any of those adding shareowners value. So, we're going to continue to focus on the strong business plan that we have, the high growth in EPS relative to the peers and I think there's no need for us to make any dramatic moves at this point.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will be from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Nicholas Campanella - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. It's Nick Campanella on for Julien. Good morning.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Good morning, Nick.","Nicholas Campanella - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Congrats on the quarter. I was just curious on the year-to-date drivers on slide 11, that the $0.20 that you kind of call out in the footnote, is that more timing-related with tax reform? And just like thinking about the 2019 drivers, this isn't something that we back out for your ongoing earnings, right? This is all timing.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Vince is looking at the...","Nicholas Campanella - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","$0.20 year-to-date related to income tax savings owed to customers.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Yeah. Nick, that's just the adjustment in revenues and the reduction in income taxes expense. So, it just drives the variance in those two line items that they net to zero. That's all we were trying to highlight there.","Nicholas Campanella - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Sure.","Nicholas Campanella - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then, just quick on the on the Talen lawsuit with Colstrip. Just any color on your position and the timing for resolution there?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Sure. Given that this is pending litigation, this is what I'll say regarding that, we flatly disagree with Talen. We're confident we acted appropriately in all the transactions related to either the sale of PPL's Montana hydroelectric generating assets or the spin-off of PPL's competitive generation business. And further, we believe that PPL Montana was solvent upon distribution of those proceeds. It's been more than five years since the sale of the hydro assets were announced and almost four years since the sale was completed.","Under the separation agreement related to the spin-off of PPL's competitive generation business in June of 2015, you may recall that Talen Energy and affiliates of Riverstone, which is a private investment firm that acquired 35% of Talen in the spin and later took Talen private, definitively agreed that PPL was entitled to retain these proceeds from the sale of the hydro assets. I don't think that is in any way in question.","At all times, prior to the spin-off, we operated PPL Montana in a prudent manner, consistent within industry standards and PPL had no control or responsibility for what had happened to the company after the spin. These businesses and all associated assets and liabilities belong entirely to Talen and its owner, Riverstone.","Regarding the issue of pension obligations raised by Talen, I think it's worth noting that PPL's pension liability related to the Montana pension assets was nearly fully funded at the time of the spin-off of PPL Energy Supply. In fact, it was 96% funded. And we ensured this when PPL made a large contribution to the PPL Montana pension fund prior to the spin transaction.","So, overall, we're very proud of the record we established in maintaining and operating PPL Montana assets, of our environmental stewardship, including extensive environmental upgrades that we did at Colstrip and of our efforts to strengthen communities during our time in Montana.","In summary, we're going to defend ourselves very vigorously against any of these claims.","Nicholas Campanella - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. That was very clear. I'll see you guys in a week or so.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And the next question will be from Abe Azar of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Congratulations on another solid quarter.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Thank you.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","What do you think is driving the strong sales growth, weather normalized in Pennsylvania and do you expect that to continue and does that change your strategy there at all?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","I'll ask Greg Dudkin, President of PPL Electric Utilities to answer that question.","Gregory N. Dudkin - PPL Corporation","Yeah. I would say that the strong sales growth is really still weather-related. I'm not sure that our weather normalization algorithm is really picking up everything. Just to give you an idea, our heating degree days 2017 to 2018 went up 15% and our cooling degree days were up 26% year-to-year. So, we still believe that the sales forecast is going to be flat to low negative on a ongoing basis and this increase is largely driven by weather.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And just following up on that, how much of a help was weather in the quarter and year-to-date for the whole business?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Just one second.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Sure. So, this is Vince, for the quarter, year-over-year was $0.03 positive, versus expectation or budget was $0.02 positive and then year-to-date versus prior year was $0.11 positive and versus our plan was $0.07 positive.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. That's all I have.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","So, just \u2013 I know you guys feel a little bit constrained on what you're going to say about the lawsuit, but just on the timing of it, it does seem a little odd to me. What do you think triggered the timing at this late date for these issues that as you noted were sort of \u2013 well \u2013 are a quite some time ago?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Well, as I mentioned, it's been almost four years since the sale was completed. In fact, it'll be \u2013 a little bit later this month will have the fourth year. So, my guess is it's probably a statute of limitations type of strategy.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then, this alternative ratemaking thing going on in Pennsylvania, could you elaborate a little bit more about what you think that might \u2013 what opportunities might be there for you, particularly with the fact that it sounds like you guys already sort of are performing pretty well there from what you were describing? So, I'm just wondering what do you think \u2013 how should we think about the potential benefits or risks associate with alternative ratemaking?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Sure. I'll ask Greg to take that question.","Gregory N. Dudkin - PPL Corporation","Yeah. So, Paul, what the legislation will allow us to do is to put forth rate plans for approval to the PUC for things like revenue decoupling, performance-based rate, those types of things. There's a lot of talk about non-wires alternatives we believe that that concept can be handled under this legislation as well. So, the PUC issued some tentative order. We've just supplied some comments within the last couple weeks, but we believe this provides us more flexibility on a going-forward basis.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. But then \u2013 and just in terms of the performance-based ratemaking and what have you, is there \u2013 I guess what should we, I mean, do \u2013 do you have any idea that sort of financially what we might be looking at?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Yeah. That's \u2013 we are still too early in the process to be able to comment on that at this point.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then, back to the UK, you mentioned that there seemed to be less \u2013 some more recognition associated with the benefits of privatization. Has there been any further discussion about nationalization or anything that \u2013 any update there?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","So, not anything, I would say, earthshattering or very significant, but I think what \u2013 my perspective is, just to give you a little flavor on this is our senior team and our board of directors were in England last week and we had some very productive discussions with members of parliament, Ofgem and some of our external political and legal advisors.","And my takeaway was there is growing recognition and understanding that the electric distribution networks have performed very well under privatization and probably importantly that there's recognition that these networks are key to delivering on governments green agendas.","And so, while labor continues to speak of renationalization, it's clear that rail, water and the mail are the areas of focus. Relative to energy, there's been little detail about how any type of renationalization might be accomplished and whether distribution networks are even a target at this point.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Thanks so much. That's my question today. Thanks so much.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Okay. All right. Thank you.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","And I believe that's all the calls we have for today. So, we appreciate everyone's time and look forward to seeing everyone at EEI's Financial Conference in San Francisco.

Thank you for joining the PPL conference call on second quarter results as well as our general business outlook. We're providing slides to this presentation on our website at www.pplweb.com.","Any statements made in this presentation about future operating results or other future events are forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

We will refer to earnings from ongoing operations or ongoing earnings, a non-GAAP measure, on this call. For reconciliations to the GAAP measures, you should refer to the press release, which has been posted on our website and has been furnished with the SEC.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Spence, PPL Chairman, President and CEO.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased that you've joined us this morning. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; as well as the Heads of our U.S. and U.K. Utility businesses.","Moving to slide 2; our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our quarterly and our year-to-date 2017 earnings results. We'll provide an update to our full 2017 year earnings guidance as well as a brief operational overview, including an overview of Ofgem's RIIO-2 process. Vince will then review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial review. As always, we'll leave time to answer your questions.","Turning to slide 3; PPL had another strong quarter with very solid results through the first half of the year, and we are reaffirming our earnings guidance for 2017. PPL's earnings for the quarter and year-to-date are lower compared to 2016, as expected, primarily driven by lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017. Today, we announced second quarter of 2017 reported earnings of $0.43 per share, compared with $0.71 per share a year ago. Year-to-date through the second quarter, reported earnings were $1.01 per share, compared to $1.41 per share through the first half of 2016.","Adjusting for special items, second quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.52 per share, compared with $0.56 per share a year ago. Lower foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted second quarter of 2017 earnings from ongoing operations by $0.07 per share, compared to 2016. The remaining quarterly increase in earnings from ongoing operations of $0.03 per share was due to lower operating and maintenance expenses in Kentucky and in the U.K.","Through the first six months of 2017, earnings from ongoing operations were $1.14 per share, this compares with $1.23 per share through the same period a year ago. Lower foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2017 year-to-date earnings from ongoing operations by the amount of $0.17 per share, compared with last year. The remaining increase in year-to-date earnings from ongoing operations of $0.08 per share was primarily due to the April 1, 2016 annual price increase in the U.K., partially offset by unfavorable weather in Kentucky. Vince will go in to greater detail on second quarter results later in the call.","Moving now to slide 4; today, we're reaffirming our 2017 ongoing earnings forecast of $2.05 to $2.25 per share with the midpoint of $2.15 per share and are providing an updated segment breakdown. We've revised our Kentucky segment ongoing earnings projection for 2017 to $0.56 for the year, compared \u2013 primarily as a result of lower electricity sales volumes due to unfavorable weather. At the same time, the earnings for the U.K. Regulated segment are expected to come in stronger for the year. We're now projecting $1.20 per share in the U.K. due to lower operating and maintenance expenses and lower income taxes.","Looking beyond 2017, we continue to expect 5% to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2017 through 2020 as we execute our business plans, including more than $13 billion in infrastructure investment through 2020. As we look forward, we also continue to target annual dividend growth of about 4% a year through 2020.","Now, let's turn to slide 5 for an update on our Kentucky Utility operations; in June, the Kentucky Public Service Commission authorized a combined rate increase of $116 million for Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Gas and Electric with new rates taking effect on July 1. The Commission authorized a 9.7% return on equity. Consistent with the base rate case, the Commission also lowered the ROE on our environmental cost recovery mechanisms from 10% and 9.8% to 9.7%. We've incorporated the final outcome of the Kentucky rate cases into our earnings forecast, including the lower ROE and the deferred advanced meter capital expenditures of approximately $300 million.","We remain confident that we will be solidly within the 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth range that we projected through 2020. The revenue increase approved by the Commission will support continued investments in safe, reliable electricity and natural gas service. Also in Kentucky, LG&E recently completed its 540-mile, 20-year gas-main replacement, which strengthens the safety and reliability of gas service in Louisville. The project replaced wrought-iron and bare steel natural gas pipelines with durable plastic pipelines. LG&E's project began 15 years before stringent federal regulations were adopted requiring such replacements. Many utilities only began making these types of upgrades within the last five years. Last but not least, our domestic utilities continue to lead the way in customer satisfaction in their regions according to J.D. Power. Kentucky Utilities ranked the highest among midsized electric utilities in the Midwest, with Louisville Gas and Electric coming in second.","Turning to slide 6, for our Pennsylvania operational update; just as we recognized \u2013 we were recognized for superior customer service in our Kentucky Utilities, PPL Electric Utilities ranked the highest among large utilities in the East. In all, PPL's U.S. Utilities have won a combined 45 J.D. Power awards among the Best Utility Companies in the nation. In other highlights, PPL Electric Utilities continues to enhance its Smart Grid capabilities. Prior to this spring, the company already had one of the nation's most advanced distribution automation systems in the country.","We've added hundreds of additional Smart Grid devices to prevent power outages and make our system even more resilient. Similar improvements made in 2016 prevented more than 100,000 customer interruptions last year. We expect our latest enhancements to yield additional benefits for our Pennsylvania customers as we move forward. PPL Electric Utilities also continues to make good progress on its $471 million advanced meter replacement project. This includes the replacement of all 1.4 million meters in our Pennsylvania service territory. Approximately 280,000 meters have been replaced to-date and we expect that number to rise to more than 520,000 by the end of the year.","Moving to slide 7 and the U.K, our U.K. regulator Ofgem issued an open letter seeking feedback from stakeholders as it begins the process of constructing a framework for RIIO-2. This is a standard course for Ofgem. Responses to the open letter are due September 4 and will help guide the proposed RIIO-2 consultation process to begin in the first quarter of 2018. We are very early on in the process and as you know, any changes for WPD would not take effect until RIIO-ED2 begins in April 2023. We view Ofgem's action as a positive development and that we will have the opportunity to participate constructively in shaping the framework associated with RIIO-2.","We've worked well with the Ofgem in the past and delivered positive results for WPD and we have no reason to believe that we would not continue to benefit from the consultation process and the final framework of RIIO-2. The purpose of this review is to build on lessons learned from the current price controls in the gas transmission and distribution businesses and to develop a framework that will be adaptable to meeting the needs of an evolving U.K. Energy sector.","To continue with slide 8; any changes to the RIIO framework are expected to focus on giving customers a stronger voice in setting outputs and assessing business plans, providing fair returns for share owners and good value for consumers, properly reflecting business risks and prevailing market conditions, while incentivizing companies to drive value, innovation and efficiency. To mention a few of the specifics, Ofgem indicated they will consider the length of the price control, which for WPD is currently 8 years, potentially aligning the price controls for gas, transmission, and distribution in terms of timing and the engagement process.","And the process for how it sets cost of capital given the change in market conditions that could occur over a price-control period. As a reminder, the current price-control period for WPD RIIO-ED1 runs through March of 2023 and will not be impacted by this RIIO-2 consultative process. Ofgem has a long history of constructive regulatory frameworks and we believe the consultation process will result in a fair outcome. We've been successful in the past at navigating through new price controls and we believe there is ample time to effectively prepare for the start of RIIO-ED2.","You may recall that we were very successful at mitigating a revenue reset to obviate a sharp decline in our U.K. segment earnings at the start of RIIO-ED1 back in 2015. And in fact, we accomplished earnings growth, compared to 2014. Given how early Ofgem is starting the review process for RIIO-2, we have time to plan for potential changes to the framework. Our strategy for RIIO-2 will be to provide comments on the open letter, have a high level of engagement during the formal consultation process, which begins next year, and construct well-justified business plans that appropriately balance the needs of all of our stakeholders, including our U.K. customers, and of course, our PPL shareowners.","Moving to slide 9; Ofgem also initiated the process of assessing the need for a mid-year review for RIIO-ED1. As previously determined by Ofgem, the scope of any midyear review \u2013 mid-period review would be to look at any necessary changes to WPD's expenditures due to a change in government policy or new outputs required by customers since the start of RIIO-ED1. There have been no government policy changes \u2013 or changes to outputs that was a result in changes to WPD, if a mid-period review is conducted.","At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed look at our quarterly segment earnings. Vince?","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to slide 11. Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were lower by $0.04 per share, driven by lower earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment of $0.05, partially offset by $0.01 in the Kentucky Regulated segment. The Pennsylvania Regulated segment and Corporate and Other both remained flat, compared to a year ago. Weather was not a significant factor for the quarter, compared to bulk budget or prior year. However, domestic weather has negatively impacted our year-to-date results by about $0.03, compared to bulk budget in prior year, primarily in Kentucky.","Let's move to a more detailed review of the second quarter segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on slide 12. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.11 per share in the second quarter of 2017, flat compared to the same period last year. This result was due to higher transmission margins of $0.01, offset by higher depreciation of $0.01. Higher transmission margins resulted from additional capital investments, but were partially offset by a lower peak load billing factor.","Moving to slide 13; our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.12 per share in the second quarter of 2017, a $0.01 increase compared to a year ago. This result was driven by lower operational and maintenance expense due to timing and scope of planned outages, and lower plant operating costs.","Turning to slide 14; our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.31 per share in the second quarter of 2017, a $0.05 decrease compared to the same period a year ago. The lower result was from lower foreign currency exchange rate in 2017, compared to 2016 of $0.07, partially offset by a decrease in O&M, primarily from lower pension expense.","Gross margins in the U.K. were flat for the quarter, primarily due to the April 1, 2017 price reset, which includes lower revenues from true-up mechanisms, primarily related to lower cost of debt recovery, offset by the normal price increase in base-demand revenues. The April price increase and the lower revenues from the true-up mechanisms were all incorporated in our original 2017 earnings per share guidance.","Moving to slide 15; as we mentioned on prior calls, we have incremental hedge value in 2018 and 2019, above our budgeted rate of $1.30 per pound, and we've since added hedges in 2020 that are above budget. We really use this value to protect against the potential volatility in the exchange rate during the Brexit negotiation. During the second quarter, we started moving some of the 2018 hedge value into 2019, while maintaining the same level of incremental value overall.","The 2020 hedges were done by using about $0.01 of 2017 re-strikes and enabled us to hedge 7% of our 2020 expected U.K. earnings, at an average rate of $1.48 per pound, significantly above our budgeted rate of $1.30 per pound. Now that we've begun to layer on hedges for 2020, we can achieve the low-end of our 5% to 6% EPS growth rate, even if the pound hits parity with the dollar.","Moving to slide 16; we've refreshed our currency forecast slide and have included the forward curve as well. The forecast have not moved significantly since last quarter, and the bearish view is still around $1.40 per pound for 2020. And as you can see, the forward curve, which is indicative of the rates at which we can actually hedge is above our budget assumption of $1.30 per pound with the current spot rate for the pound around $1.31. The forward curve stay at this level, it could provide us further opportunity to layer on additional 2020 hedges above our budgeted rate, while retaining the incremental hedge value that we've been able to create.","That concludes my prepared remarks, I'll turn the call back over to Bill, for the question-and-answer period. Bill?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Thank you, Vince. In summary, we had another good quarter and PPL remains on track to deliver on its 2017 earnings forecast. We remain confident in our ability to deliver 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth per share from 2017 through 2020. As you know, we've raised the dividend 4% earlier this year and we continue to target annual dividend growth of about 4% through 2020. We're executing very well on our low-risk business plans. And we continue to deliver for our customers as evidenced by our industry-leading customer satisfaction awards.","With that, operator, let's open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question is from Greg Gordon at Evercore ISI.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Good morning, guys. Good morning. So I mean, I have a hard time not seeing how you are, at this point, either just given how successful you've been at hedging currency and some of the lack of immaterial near to medium-term regulatory exposures, in terms of rate filings. How you're not theoretically above the 6% earnings growth rate, given how successful you've hedged the currency? And so does that mean that we should assume that you are going to take the value in excess of what would drive the 6% earnings growth rate and just continue to roll that forward into the next decade? Or how are you contemplating using that dry powder?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Yes. So that is one option, rolling forward the value into 2020 and beyond. But you are correct, if things stayed as they are today, with the forward curve being above our targeted budgeted rate of $1.30 per pound, we would be at the high-end of our earnings forecast. So you're absolutely correct on that. I would say that probably as we finalize our hedging for 2020, we'll be able to give a little bit more color around how we expect to use the value to the extent it continues to sit out in the forward years, and whether we're going to adjust our earnings forecast through 2020, or push that value forward into future years.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay, that's great. And then I guess, look, the tension in the stock from my perspective and you clearly have tried to address that in your scripted comments is that, while the earnings outlook looks incredibly robust with great visibility for the next three to four years, now there's this overhang of potentially more astringent return environment in the U.K. So, what are the things that you did, maybe you could give us some examples of the ways that you managed through the last transition, so people can understand the tools that you have at your disposal should you face some sort of reset in terms of base return on equity or shaping of revenue streams like you did last time?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Sure. Well, a couple of things there. One is, the tools that we've used in the past, I would say our tax planning and pension planning. So those are things that we've been effective at doing in the past. You mentioned shaping the revenue profile. That's something as we go through the consultation process, we'll look at how we develop our plan and whether that's an appropriate avenue to pursue as well. Vince, I don't know if you have any other comments around that and then, I can ask Robert as well.","Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.","Yes, I would say one of the items within the framework itself is how you set, what we call, fast pot versus slow pot. And that \u2013 you may recall that the U.K.'s cost recovery structure is called toad tax (21:56), it's not capital and O&M, total expenditures. And then, within the business plans, each distribution company can determine how much you want of that toad tax (22:04) to go towards, rate base growth and how much you want in current period recovery.","WPD was at the high-end of the slow pot ratio under RIIO-ED1 at 80%, basically going to the rate base growth and 20% going through the current P&L. That definitely improves the long-term intrinsic value of the company because you're growing rate base, which is the engine that generates return. However, many of our peers were in the 70%, even some were in the low 60%. So that's an item that if returns were, for some reason, to be impacted, maybe we would have to dial that back commensurate with what our peers were doing through RIIO-1.","But it would be stumping that we would have to look at in totality. The business plans are put together understanding the rules for the new price control in totality. And so, I wouldn't sit here today and say we were going to do that. But really depend, it is a lever that we could potential pull down into RIIO-2.","Robert A. Symons - PPL UK Distribution Holdings Ltd.","I think, Vince has got a good point. You have to look at the whole thing in the round, there are so many different things within a price control, and cost of capital is one of them, as Vince has pointed out, as a mix of OpEx and CapEx. Also when you think about the future, you also will consider what's happening in the U.K., and that's a move towards electrification of vehicles.","And Michael Gove announced a couple of weeks ago that from 2040, there would be no more petrol and diesel vehicles produced in the U. K. And that, from a National Grid point of view, their estimate is that generation will have to go up 50%. Its impact on distribution businesses will be quite massive. And so maybe, CapEx plans will be much larger, looking at RIIO-ED2 than they have been in RIIO-ED1.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Great.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","That was a terrific answer. Have a great day.","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","Great, thank you, Greg.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Lapides at Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, guys. I actually, want to turn attention to the U.S. businesses. And especially, when you look at slide 18, which is the slide \u2013 and I'm kind of looking at the 12-month rolling not the 3-month because lots of variations happen in every quarter. Weather-normalized demand in your service territories have been extremely challenging. And it's not just a short-term issue, it's been a couple of years now. How do you think about how you want to change the regulatory construct in both jurisdictions in order to be able to manage an environment where potentially is \u2013 where demand is at best flat, if not down?","William H. Spence - PPL Corp.","So, Michael, I think you may recall that we basically took our load assumption, which was from 0.5% to 1% in the previous business plan down to flat, based on the trends we were seeing at the time. So our current earnings per share forecast through 2020 does include flat earnings growth on a \u2013 and as you know, sometimes weather adjustments are difficult at best. So in terms of the regulatory construct, there are tools that we could look at. And in Pennsylvania, for example, it would be a true up based on volume.","As you know, in the U.K., we already have true ups based on how the weather turns out or the economies are made whole in terms of the impact to revenue. So the Pennsylvania PUC is kind of looking at a broad set of looking at the energy environment as it's pretty dynamic at the moment, what changes to their policies and practices might make sense for the utilities that they regulate. So I think there's probably more to come. I don't think in Kentucky we have a near-term concern. Vic, maybe you want to comment?","Victor A. Staffieri - Kentucky Utilities Co.","I think the best tool for us to deal with demand, which is flat, is our forward rate years. So we take that into account every time we file, you all know we've been filing every two years and so I would expect that would be the best way for us to capture any changes in the flattening low demand.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.","Joseph P. Bergstein - PPL Corp.","Okay.","Joseph P. Bergstein - PPL Corp.","Okay. Operator, it looks like, there no other questions rather in the queue.

Our presentation on earnings release, which we'll discuss during today's call, contains forward-looking statements about future operating results or other future events.","Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the appendix of this presentation and PPL's SEC filings for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements. We will also refer to earnings from ongoing operations or ongoing earnings, a non-GAAP measure on this call. For reconciliations to the GAAP measure, you should refer to the appendix of this presentation and our earnings release.","I'll now turn the call over to Bill Spence, PPL Chairman and CEO.","William Spence","Thank you, Andy, and good morning everyone. We're pleased that you've joined us for our second quarter earnings call. With me today are Vince Sorgi, who was promoted to PPL President and Chief Operating Officer, effective July 1; Joe Bergstein who is promoted to PPL Chief Financial Officer, succeeding Vince in the CFO role; and Greg Dudkin; and Paul Thompson, the Heads of our U.S. Utility businesses; Philip Swift, the Head of our Western Power Distribution business in the U.K. is not able to join us this morning.","Moving to slide three, our agenda this morning begins with highlights of our 2019 second quarter results and a brief review of operational and regulatory developments. Joe will then provide more detailed review of second quarter earnings as well as an update on our foreign currency hedging status. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions.","Turning to slide four, today, we announced second quarter reported earnings of $0.60 per share, resulting in a total of $1.24 per share through the first half of 2019. Adjusting for special items, primarily related to unrealized gains on our U.K. earnings hedges, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.58 per share compared with $0.55 per share a year ago.","On a year-to-date basis through June, total ongoing earnings were $1.27 per share compared with $1.29 per share a year ago, which is in line with our expectations. Based on our solid financial results through June, we remained very confident in our ability to deliver on our 2019 guidance range of $2.30 to $2.50 per share with a midpoint of $2.40. In addition, we remained on track to invest $3.3 billion in infrastructure improvements during 2019 as we work to make the grid smarter, more reliable, and more resilient.","Looking beyond 2019, today we also reaffirmed our projection of 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth per share through 2020 measured against the midpoint of our original 2018 earnings forecast. In addition, we maintained our 2021 earnings forecast of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. We continued to monitor foreign currency exchange rates for potential impacts on our earnings projections, which Joe will discuss in his update.","Shifting the focus to operations, PPL continues to deliver excellent service across all of our distribution networks. Both PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities both received J.D. Power Awards for Residential Customer Satisfaction in July, achieving the highest overall marks in their respective categories and regions based on customer surveys.","This year marks the eighth and fourth straight years respectively that PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities have earned this distinction. All told, PPL's utilities have received 49 J.D. Power Awards in the two decades since the organization has steady customer satisfaction with electric utilities.","In U.K., WPD was also recognized recently by Ofgem as the top-ranked network for the stakeholder engagement and consumer vulnerability incentive and achievement measured against all gas and electricity networks in the U.K. This is the eighth consecutive year that WPD led the industry in this category.","PPL's track record of customer service excellence is a testament to the outstanding teams we have throughout our business and it reflects our strategic focus on delivering best-in-sector operational performance.","In other highlights, PPL Electric Utilities was also named the 2019 Power Players Investor-Owned Utility of the Year by the Smart Electric Power Alliance during the second quarter. The award recognized PPL Electrics work to create a smart grid distribution management system that supports greater adoption of distributed energy resources on the grid. This includes behind-the-meter resources such as private solar and energy storage.","The Utilities new distributed energy resources management system is just one of the many ways PPL companies are working to advance a cleaner energy future. Additionally, PPL Electric Utilities was named one of the most trusted utility brands in the country by a recent study conducted by Escalent, a human behavior and analytics firm. In this survey, PPL Electric Utilities earned the top spot among the electricity-only utilities in the eastern United States. This recognition is yet another example of PPL Electrics commitment to top-tier reliability and service to its customers.","Last but not least, Louisville Gas and Electric recently received the American Gas Association's accident prevention award for safety excellence. Among its peers, LG&E finished 2018 with the lowest rate of incidents resulting in lost time or restricted time at work. We are proud of LG&E's accomplishment, and we remain committed across our U.S. and U.K. operations to continue a safety improvement.","Turning to a brief regulatory update in the U.K., Ofgem in late May confirmed its RIIO-2 price control methodology for the gas distribution, gas transmission, and electricity transmission subsectors. While the announced methodology does not apply to the electricity distribution sector, which Ofgem has continually emphasized, we welcome the opportunity to share our views on some key issues.","Broadly, we believe this update was a step in the right direction and look forward to our ongoing engagement with Ofgem as we plan our next price control, a process that kicked off formally this morning with the open letter consultation. The letter was generally in line with our expectations and consistent with recent conversations with Ofgem.","Vince and I were in the U.K. last week and held another series of productive meetings with members of Ofgem senior leadership team, including Chairman, Martin Cave. We discussed the successes of RIIO-ED1 regulation and how there has been real value delivered to customers in the first four years of the price control.","We also highlighted some of the areas for improvement and how Ofgem can achieve their objective of continuing to drive efficiencies while preparing the network for the future. Overall, we're in agreement that the distribution networks are critical to the ongoing development of the U.K.'s energy infrastructure, specifically to achieve the electrification and decarbonization initiatives.","Network development has become even more important as the U.K. recently announced its commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by the year 2050. This commitment further enhances the opportunities for DNOs, like WPD, to continue their leading roles in building the electricity grid of the future and connecting significant levels of renewable energy sources.","We expect that Ofgem will provide the framework necessary for electricity distribution companies to support these objectives and incentivize the level of investment required to do so as they have done historically.","Our recent dialogue supports our belief that Ofgem will be focused on differentiating returns among electricity DNOs and still provide substantial opportunities for outstanding performers like WPD, during the next price control period.","With that, I'll turn it over to Joe for a more detailed financial overview. Joe?","Joe Bergstein","Thank you, Bill and good morning everyone. Let's move to slide five for an overview of the second quarter segment results. As Bill mentioned, PPL delivered second quarter 2019 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.58 per share, which was $0.03 higher compared to the second quarter of 2018 and in line with our expectations.","Our strong second -- our strong results more than offset $0.02 from share dilution and $0.05 of weather-related variances compared to the prior period. $0.04 of the weather variance was related to strong volumes experienced in the second quarter of 2018 and weather was about $0.01 unfavorable compared to our forecast for the second quarter of 2019. Excluding dilution and weather, we saw higher earnings in each of our utility segments this quarter.","Our U.K. regulated segment earned $0.36 per share, a $0.04 increase compared to the same period a year ago, excluding the impact of dilution and weather. The increase in the U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins from higher prices as a result of the April 1st, 2019, price increase partially offset by lower sales volume, higher other income due to higher pension income and higher realized foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2018 for the second quarter 2019 average rate of a $1.36 per pound compared to $1.33 in the second quarter of 2018.","Moving to Pennsylvania, our Pennsylvania regulated segment earned $0.13 per share in the second quarter of 2019, a $0.03 increase compared to the second quarter of 2018, excluding weather. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, primarily due to returns on additional capital investments in transmission and the timing impact related to U.S. tax reform in 2018 and lower operation and maintenance expense primarily due to lower support cost. These factors were partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to additions to PP&E.","Moving to Kentucky, our Kentucky regulated segment earned $0.13 per share in the second quarter of 2019, a $0.03 increase compared to the second quarter of 2018, excluding the impact of weather. The increase was primarily due to higher base rates effective May 1st, 2019, and lower income taxes due to a state tax credit.","This was partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to additions to PP&E and higher depreciation rates, and higher interest expense due to higher interest rates and increased borrowings. And finally, Corporate and Other remained flat over the quarter compared to the same period a year ago.","As Bill noted, our solid second quarter performance positions us well to achieve our earnings forecast for this year. We provided a similar walk of the year-to-date results in the appendix for your reference.","Before I turn the call back over to Bill, let me provide an update on our foreign currency hedging status, which is on slide six. For the balance of 2019, we continue to be 100% hedged for our ongoing earnings at an average rate of $1.41 per pound.","For 2020, we increased our hedge percentage to 63% compared to 55% on our first quarter call. The average rate for 2020, reflecting these new hedges is $1.46 per pound just slightly lower than the previous average of $1.47. We continue to utilize options in our hedging strategy that preserve upside to the current market rates to develop one-third of the 2020 hedge portfolio being option-based.","We remain open in 2021, and as Bill mentioned we recognized the recent weakness in the exchange rates and continue to monitor potential impacts to our earnings projections. However, independent forecast of future exchange rates remain within the range of presumptions used for our 2021 projections. So, near-term fluctuations in the current year is expected given the current political environment, the majority of analyst trajectory we cover in the currency rates falling at Brexit resolution.","And finally, we have flexibility in our hedging program that does not require to add additional hedges at this time and allows us to take an opportunistic approach to hedging as we monitor the dynamics of the political situation and move towards the Brexit deadline in October.","That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period.","William Spence","Thanks Joe. In closing, all of our PPL companies continue to execute at an extremely high level as evidenced once again by the accolades earned from our customers and industry groups. We remained focused on delivering on our low-risk business plan to build tomorrow's infrastructure and advance a sustainable energy future. And our strong financial performance keeps us solidly on track to achieve our 2019 earnings forecast. These operational successes are underpinned by an exceptional workplace that cultivates an inclusive and diverse workforce.","I'd like to briefly highlight a couple recent honors recognizing these efforts that exemplify the constructive culture and lifeblood of our company. In June, our Kentucky operations were rewarded the highest U.S. government honor to employers for providing exceptional support of National Guard and Reserve employees. The employer support of the Guard and Reserve are ESGR Freedom Award. We were one of 15 recipients of this prestigious award selected by the Department of Defense out of nearly 2,500 nominations this year.","And just last month, PPL was named a Best Place to Work for People with Disabilities for the second straight year, earning a top score of 100% on the disability equality index for its commitment to creating and accommodating an exclusive environment for people with disabilities.","At PPL, we want all individuals to reach their fullest potential and believe that our employees, colleagues, and friends in the community of all abilities help us grow and thrive. We're extremely honored and proud of these achievements and we will continue to advance in these efforts for an inclusive and powering environment for all employees to drive energy forward.","With that, operator, let's open the call for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","The first question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha","Thank you. Good morning.","William Spence","Good morning.","Ali Agha","Good morning. First question, Joe, just to understand the Ofgem process from here onwards, so I know that in the schedule in this open letter that consultation they started currently that they'll have a decision on the open later in November, what is to be expected, what will they decide at that time in November?","And when are you expecting that the key parameters, cost of equity, et cetera will be firmed up? Is that when the strategy consultation decision comes -- just like layout, what we should expect in November on this open letter decision?","William Spence","Sure. So, in November, they're going to provide us with the framework and within that framework, there will be details and I'll let Vince maybe comment on this since he's been following this pretty closely in terms of what those details are likely to include. So, Vince?","Vincent Sorgi","Sure. How are doing Ali? The process really going forward around the open letter we would expect Ofgem to make certain decisions on the questions that they pose. So, confirming the five-year term of the next price control versus some other term, confirming that they're going to stick with CAPM similar to what they're using for gas and transmission, I would not expect that they would, in November, put forth any numbers in terms of what that CAPM process would result for electric distribution that we would project to see when they do the sector methodology consultation, which would kick off mid-next year.","I think, they'll also talk about the framework that they're thinking about in terms of transitioning to DSO, what type of incentive mechanisms might be in place to drive the DNOs to that outcome discussion around whole system outcomes, so things like that as opposed to the actual return numbers that they would be expecting.","William Spence","I think between now and November, what the process really is, is a collection of knowing the answers to the questions that they pose but also additional stakeholder feedback. We'll take all of that, they will then propose a broad framework with more specifics around what their thought is based on all that input and then that will carry forward into next year, which will provide much more specificity on things like ROE and center frameworks. ","Ali Agha","Okay. Second question I had, can you remind us how much of your earnings in this quarter and year-to-date have come from U.K. pension income, the non-cash pension income? And any update on how you're thinking about that as it opens up in 2021?","Joe Bergstein","So, we had two sets of pension income in the quarter compared to higher pension income in the quarter compared to last year. As far as the process for pension deficit funding and the amount that's needed going forward, we're in the process of updating our assumptions and negotiating the expected funding levels with our pension trustees. We expect that to be completed by year end.","We'll then work with Ofgem and the U.K. pension regulator off Ofgem's review and determination of future deficit funding will be known -- we expect by November 2020. But our expectations at this time, well, we haven't changed the year end and our 2021 forecast, we're expecting about $0.05 per share reduction in 2021 due to lower pension deficit funding needs.","Ali Agha","Right. Last question Bill, as I look at the big picture in the U.K., you\u2019ve got Brexit uncertainty, potentially political uncertainty; you've got the currency, obviously extremely weak. As you look at all of this, I mean is there much that you can do about it or are these macro-political factors that's going to play themselves out and PPL just hunkers down and waits for these events to unfold? Is there anything proactively PPL can do, given the backdrop that you have out there? ","William Spence","Yes, it is a challenging political and regulatory backdrop at the moment but there are some efforts that we have -- had underway in the U.K. to basically educate many of those Ministers of Parliament that may not be familiar with specifically with the electricity networks, great track record and that track record includes much lower cost than when the systems were nationalized, better reliability, much better reliability to the tune of about 60% better reliability than when they were under state control.","And also customer satisfaction, which is at the highest level it's ever been. So, we have a great story to tell and another data point is, which is on a positive side is that the Labour Party has really continued to lose momentum politically, and as you know they were one of the -- one of the only political party that had proposed bringing some of the networks back under state control as well as rail and mail and so forth and water [ph].","So, we think that the risk, while it was already very low is even lower than it previously was as the Labour Party has really failed to gain any momentum politically, and certainly there is always a probability that they could regain some of their footing but in our view very unlikely.","So, the other thing that we've been doing is we have a political consulting firm that we use in the U.K. It's been very helpful for us to reach out to some of the other stakeholders outside the parliament to again, educate and inform local community and leaders and so forth. So, I think we're doing what we can to combat some of the broader political forces at play, but it is rather challenging.","Ali Agha","Understood. Thank you.","William Spence","You're welcome Ali.","Operator","The next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Anthony Crowdell","Good morning. Joe and Vince congratulations on the promotions.","Joe Bergstein","Thank you.","Anthony Crowdell","First question, I guess, if I could think of the guidance for 2021 of $2.50 to $2.80 what is the assumption of pension deficit revenues in the $2.50 and $2.80 number or that's the same -- or pension deficit revenues have not change in that range?","Joe Bergstein","We've assumed a $0.05 reduction in the range for -- at the midpoint of pension deficit -- at the midpoint of the 2021 forecast is a $0.05 reduction in the pension deficit funding.","Anthony Crowdell","At the low end of the range though is there a bigger decline in pension deficit revenues?","Joe Bergstein","No, not materially. The range is really driven by FX rates.","Anthony Crowdell","Got it. If I could think about repatriation of cash from the U.K., what are you repatriating now? And I guess is there a sensitivity on currency or on the exchange rate with that?","Joe Bergstein","Right now our forecast through the planning period has an expectation of $300 million to $500 million per year. So, when we think about the impact on currency relative to our cash repatriation and cash position, it's really very minor. So, even at current levels of the pound in the low $1.20, it's only about a $40 million impact to our cash repatriation. So, really very minor and very manageable in the grand scheme of our cash position.","Anthony Crowdell","Great. And lastly, just the company gives out -- we have I guess 5% to 6% growth rate through the 2020. When can we expect to get growth rate post-2020, given the U.K. planning goes out till 2023 could we expect something sooner to find out what the growth is post-2020?","Joe Bergstein","Well, I think, we'll have to consider the currency situation and where we are in the Brexit process and if there's any clarity around that because as you are aware currency is obviously a big driver of our forecast. So, we'll have to wait and see when we provide that longer term guidance Anthony, given the currency situation of the political backdrop.","Anthony Crowdell","Great. Thanks for taking my questions Joe.","Joe Bergstein","Sure.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","The next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey guys. it's actually James for Shar.","William Spence","Good morning James.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. I just wanted to ask could you remind us whether or not tell us under the hedging program when we have to start for 2021?","William Spence","Sure. Go ahead, Joe.","Joe Bergstein","Yes. Well, we have flexibility under our hedging program and as I stated in the prepared remarks at this point we're not required to add any additional hedges throughout October, so we can really see how Brexit plays out as we approach October, end of October deadline.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then are you still assuming a range, I think it was $1.35 to $1.60 in your 2021 guidance?","Joe Bergstein","We are independent analyst forecast continue to support that range and there was in the range that we provided when we provided that guidance. So, we're maintaining that at this point.","Unidentified Analyst","Got you. And I guess just stateside in Kentucky, any updated thoughts on going back for AMI?","William Spence","I'll ask Paul Thompson who heads up our LG&E and KU Business to answer that.","Paul Thompson","Yes. We continue to evaluate that and we have under the prior-commission ruling expanded our testing -- our pilot-testing work in both LG&E and KU, so we have now over 10,000 AMI meters in each utility. And to your question, really, we would anticipate currently that the next rate case, whenever that might be, maybe the time that we would put the AMI back into the request for approval on that.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thanks guys. That's all I had.","Paul Thompson","Thanks James.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bill Spence for any closing remarks.","William Spence","Thank you, operator, and thanks for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with everyone on the third quarter earnings call.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"17579":["PPL Corp. (NYSE:PPL) Q3 2015 Earnings Call October 29, 2015  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Joseph P.

Bergstein - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the PPL conference call on third quarter results and our general business outlook. We are providing slides to this presentation on our website at www.pplweb.com.","Any statements made in this presentation about future operating results or other future events are forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from such forward-looking statements. A discussion of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ is contained in the appendix to this presentation and in the company's SEC filings.","We will refer to earnings from ongoing operations or ongoing earnings and non-GAAP measures on this call. For reconciliations to the GAAP measures, you should refer to the press release which has been posted on our website and has been filed with the SEC.","This time, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Spence, PPL Chairman, President and CEO.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Joe and good morning everyone. We're pleased that you've joined us this morning. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer and the Presidents of our U.S. Utility businesses.","Also with the recent retirement of Rick Klingensmith, the former President of PPL Global, with us today is Robert Symons, the Chief Executive of our U.K. Utility Western Power Distribution or WPD. Welcome to the call, Robert.","Moving to slide 3, you'll see our agenda for today's discussion. We'll begin with an overview of our third quarter and year-to-date earnings results. We'll also address our 2015 earnings forecast which we are reaffirming today. I'll provide an update to our earnings and dividend growth expectations through 2017 both of which we are increasing today. And I'll provide a brief operational overview for our U.S. utilities.","Then I'll turn the call over to Robert to review some new disclosures we are making this quarter to provide more transparency on our estimates for incentive revenues at WPD under the new real model. Vince will then review our segment results and provide more detailed financial overview, as always we'll leave time to answer your questions.","Before I jump into the earnings details, however, let me tell you briefly where we stand with three quarters of the year behind us. Based on the solid year-to-date results, our plans for about $10 billion in infrastructure investments through 2017 and higher expected earnings from our U.K. operations, we're now confident we can achieve 6% compound annual earnings growth through 2017.","We continue to execute well and we are confident in our growth plans. The company had previously projected 4% to 6% earnings growth. Our business plan is low risk and we are confident in our ability to execute the plan and deliver on our commitments.","Moving to slide four. Today we announced third quarter 2015 reported earnings of $393 million or $0.58 a share, a decrease from $497 million or $0.74 per share a year ago. Year to date reported earnings were $283 million or $0.42 per share compared with $1.04 billion or $1.57 per share to the same period in 2014.","Reported earnings for the first nine months of 2015 reflect $915 million loss or a $1.36 per share from discontinued operations resulting primarily from the June 1 spin-off of our competitive Supply business.","Adjusting for special items, third quarter 2015 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.51 per share up 16% from third quarter 2014 adjusted results. Through the first nine months 2015 earnings from ongoing operations were $1.77 per share up 15% from a year ago.","Moving to slide five, driven by the strong performance of our fully regulated portfolio today we are reaffirming our 2015 forecast range for earnings from ongoing operations of $2.15 per share to $2.25 per share. If you've tracked us closely through the years, as I know many of you have, you know that we have a strong track record of not just meeting but exceeding earnings targets.","And as I indicated earlier in my remarks, we are now confident we can achieve 6% compound annual earnings growth through 2017. This increase is driven primarily by higher expected earnings from our regulated operations in the U.K. driven primarily by higher expected incentive revenues and lower depreciation expense resulting from the change in depreciable lives.","Robert will discuss the details of the higher incentive revenues in his prepared remarks. We now expect the U.K. earnings growth to be 1% to 2% through 2017, previously projected to be flat. And we expect 12% to 14% growth in domestic operations including our corporate services organization.","Vince will provide an update on our U.K. earnings projections through 2016 in his prepared remarks. Our overall earnings growth is fueled by about $3.5 billion per year of capital investments in our existing infrastructure and service territories, combined with the constructive regulatory jurisdictions where we operate, which results in over 80% of our CapEx earning a return within 12 months and approximately 76% in less than six months.","Regarding the dividend, we expect minimal dividend growth again for 2016 as we strive to get the payout ratio down into the mid-60% range, at which time we will target a 4% to 6% dividend growth rate, more in line with our earnings growth expectations. We currently expect to be in the targeted payout range by the end of 2016. So our current expectation is that we will grow the dividend more meaningfully starting in 2017, but our current expectation for 2017 is at the low end of the 4 to 6% relative to the dividend. We will expect to maintain at least that level of growth through 2017 but we will assess that when we get there.","Turning to the operational overview on slide six, and beginning with the PPL Electric Utilities rate case, on September 3, we announced the settlement agreement that would provide PPL Electric Utilities an additional $124 million in revenue through a rate increase to be effective January 1, 2016. The settlement will help fund additional reliability improvements as we continue to strengthen and modernize our Pennsylvania delivery network.","Earlier this month an administrative law judge from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission recommended the Commission approve this settlement. Action by the Commission is expected later this year. The settlement is a black box settlement and does not specify an allowed return on equity. The agreement highlights the constructive relationships we have in the jurisdictions where we operate and our ability to work with a variety of parties to secure results that deliver both competitive returns to shareowners and significant benefits to customers. It's the second such settlement we've announced this year.","Last quarter, we highlighted the Kentucky Public Service Commission's approval of rate increases for our Kentucky Utilities following a successful settlement in those proceedings. In both the Pennsylvania and Kentucky jurisdictions, we utilized forward test years which further assists in our ability to reduce regulatory lag.","Also in September, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission unanimously approved PPL Electric Utilities' request to invest $450 million in new, more advanced meters for its 1.4 million customers. The company plans to replace its existing meters between 2017 and 2019 to provide expanded benefits to customers and to comply with state mandated regulations on metering technology. Costs will be recovered with little to no regulatory lag through a special rider. The replacement is expected to increase rate base by about $330 million.","In Pennsylvania, I'd also like to mention that PPL Electric Utilities received another J.D. Power Award for residential customer satisfaction. The company ranked highest among large electric utilities in the Eastern United States. It is the fourth year in a row that the PPL Electric Utilities earned the distinction and the 12th overall in that category. The company has now won 11 J.D. Power Awards for business customer satisfaction as well.","Lastly, turning to slide seven before I move to Kentucky, PPL Electric Utilities took an important step on its proposal to construct a major new transmission line called Project Compass. It's designed to provide significant benefits for electricity consumers in the Northeast. PPL Electric Utilities has filed an interconnection request with the New York Independent System Operator to build a 95-mile transmission line between Blakely, Pennsylvania and Ramapo, New York. The projected capital cost is expected to be $500 million to $600 million. This first section or segment is designed to help make the electric grid more reliable and secure for customers throughout the region and provide substantial savings for New York consumers.","If our interconnection request is approved by the New York ISO, additional approvals for this segment will be needed from the Pennsylvania PUC, the New York Public Service Commission, PJM and several other agencies.","PPL Electric Utilities has extensive experience, as you know, in planning and building regional transmission lines. Just this past spring, we energized the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line which involved the planning, approval and construction of 101 miles of a 500-kV transmission line. On the Susquehanna-Roseland project, we demonstrated our ability to cooperate with multiple state and regulatory government agencies and to partner with a neighboring utility, which built an additional 50 miles of transmission line in New Jersey as part of that project. Expenditures for Project Compass are not included in our current capital projections. Our proposal currently calls for the first segment to be built and placed in service by 2023.","While the first segment can stand alone as a valuable grid improvement, we continue to evaluate and refine the overall plan for the rest of Project Compass. As currently envisioned and based on preliminary estimates, Project Compass in its entirely would extend about 475 miles from Western Pennsylvania into Southeastern New York at an estimated cost of $3 billion to $4 billion. If you turn to slide eight, you will see the portion of the transmission line that represents the first segment between Blakely, Pennsylvania and Ramapo, New York.","Shifting south to Kentucky, we retired the final two generating units at our Green River station on September 30. This marks the completion of our plan to retire 800 megawatts of coal-fired generation in Kentucky. We also continue to analyze the potential impact that the Clean Power Plan could have on our Kentucky operations. The precise impact is difficult to pin down at this point. The final rule is just published last Friday, October 23, and the final impact of the rule will not be known until the state implementation plan or the state's specific federal implementation plan has been developed.","The final rule is already being legally challenged, so this could have an impact as well. In the end, we will develop a plan for our facilities in collaboration with the Kentucky Public Service Commission and the state Energy and Environment Cabinet. Any investment required to comply with the Clean Power Plan would be incremental to our current CapEx plan.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Robert Symons, CEO of our U.K. Operations. He will walk us through our new disclosures on incentive revenues under RIIO-ED1. Robert?","Robert A. Symons - Chief Executive Officer, Western Power Distribution, PPL Corp.","Many thanks, Bill and good morning. We've received several inquiries as to how the U.K. is performing against the tougher incentive targets set by Ofgem under RIIO-ED1. Moving to slide 10 as Bill mentioned earlier, we are pleased to be providing new disclosures to review our current performance. But before we get into the performance details, I would like to provide some background on the incentive framework.","WPD has a long history of operational excellence. And we expect that to continue into RIIO-ED1. Our ability to execute on our plans and achieve incentive revenue has been key to our financial performance. And once again, WPD is on-track to outperform its Ofgem targets in the 2015\/2016 regulatory year. And WPD now expects to earn total incentive revenues that exceed prior estimates for 2017 and 2018.","Our original plan assume between $80 million and $100 million for 2017 and between $60 million and $90 million for 2018. Based on our performance to-date we are raising guidance estimates for the 2017 calendar year to $90 million to $110 million and $75 million to $105 million for 2018.","One of the real benefits of being fast tracked through price control review process is that we've had more time to ensure we were in a strong position to deliver the output included in the business plan submitted to Ofgem. For example, in advance to the RIIO-ED1 period, we adjusted one of our operational targets to less than 12 hours for supply restoration down from 18 hours to align our performance with the new guaranteed standards in RIIO-ED1.","The fast-track award of about $43 million per year during RIIO-ED1 period along with our ability to an incentive revenues are two very strong reasons that the UK regulatory model is considered a premium jurisdiction.","Turning to slide 11, the primary schemes that contribute to incentive revenues include the interruption incentive schemes and the broad measure of customer satisfaction. Interruption incentive schemes include customer interruptions and customer minutes lost.","Both of these schemes are designed to incentivize the DNOs to invest and operate their networks to manage and reduce both the frequency and the duration of power outages. The targets under RIIO-ED1 are specified in our licenses and become slightly more demanding each year.","On this slide you will find results for customer minutes lost on the top-left of the slide and customer interruptions on the top-right. Customer minutes lost measures the cumulative amount of minutes customers are without electricity.","In this chart, we are reporting the cumulative average performance of all four of our DNOs. The line in purple is the Ofgem target and the dotted line is the projected result, with the vertical line showing the maximum reward or penalties.","Customer interruption measures the cumulative amount of interruptions in the customers electricity supply per hundred customers. The chart is using the same basis for reporting an average of all four DNOs, however, this chart represents customer interruptions for 100 customers. You will see for the first six months under RIIO-ED1, WPD is trending towards exceeding the annual targets for customer minutes lost and customer interruptions. These incentive revenues while earned during the 2015\/2016 regulatory year will be received in the 2017\/2018 regulatory year.","So now turning to slide 12. In addition to the interruption incentive schemes, the second scheme, the broad measure of customer satisfaction measures performance against customer satisfaction. Each month Ofgem surveys customer satisfaction for services provided by the DNOs.","On a scale from 1 to 10, this chart provides results against the targets Ofgem has established for customers experiencing interruptions, requesting a new connection or making a general inquiry. This chart shows WPD's performance through September 2015 for each DNO compared to all other DNOs combined, and demonstrates our excellent customer service.","While we have only been performing under RIIO for six months, as I mentioned earlier the benefit of being fast-track afforded us the opportunity to begin to plan our approach to delivering outputs. As we continue to execute on those plans, we are on track to meet or exceed the new targets. We will continue to provide updates to these slides each quarter. And now Vince will walk you through a more detailed look at segment earnings.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Robert and good morning everyone. Let's move to slide 14 for a review of segment earnings. Our third quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased over last year by $0.07 per share, driven primarily by higher earnings from the Kentucky Regulated segment and the UK Regulated segment and lower cost in corporate and other resulting from the corporate restructuring.","Let's briefly discuss domestic weather for the third quarter and year-to-date compared to last year and also compared to our 2015 forecast. Overall, domestic weather was slightly favorable for the quarter and flat year to date compared to the same periods last year. However, compared to our 2015 forecast, weather had a positive $0.03 impact year-to-date and was flat for the third quarter.","Let's move to a more detailed review of the third quarter segment earnings drivers starting with the Pennsylvania results on slide 15. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earnings for the third quarter were flat compared with a year ago. This result was due to higher margins from additional transmission investments and returns on distribution improvement capital investments offset by higher O&M expenses and higher depreciation due to asset additions.","Moving to slide 16, our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the third quarter of 2015, a $0.04 increase compared to a year ago. This result was due to higher gross margins from electric and gas base rate increases effective July 1 of this year, returns on additional environmental capital investments and higher volumes due to inclement weather.","Moving to slide 17, our UK Regulated segment earned $0.29 per share in the third quarter of 2015 a $0.01 improvement compared to the same period last year. This increase was due to lower income taxes primarily from lower U.S. taxes on dividends in 2015 compared to 2014 and lower depreciation expense from the asset life extension we discussed earlier this year, partially offset by increased depreciation from asset additions. These increases were partially offset by lower utility revenues as we transitioned to RIIO-ED1 on April 1 of this year partially offset by higher volumes and higher miscellaneous revenues.","Moving to slide 18, on this slide we provide an update to our GBP hedging status for 2015, 2016, 2017 including sensitivities for a $0.05 and $0.10 downward movement in the exchange rate compared to our budgeted rate of $1.60. We continue to be fully hedged for the remainder of 2015 at an average rate of $1.54.","For 2016 and 2017 the hedge percentages are off the higher expected U.K. earnings that Bill discussed. Thus our 2016 hedge ratio came down a little. For 2017, we continued to layer on hedges during the quarter and have increased our hedge percentage from 40% at the end of the second quarter to 66% today at an average rate of $1.60. You can see from the sensitivity table that there is no exposure for the remainder of 2015, minimal exposure in 2016 and 2017, if the average hedge rate on our open positions is $1.55.","These FX sensitivities do not factor in the potential positive effects from restriking existing hedges which, as you know, we've been successfully doing throughout the year. Also on this slide, we show our RPI sensitivity, which has been updated as well.","As we've discussed previously, under the RIIO model, our revenues for the 2015\/2016 regulatory year were set using a 2.6% inflation rate and our 2017\/2018 revenues will reflect a true-up for the actual inflation rate for the 2015\/2016 period. We're now incorporating a forecasted RPI rate of 1.6% in our current planning assumptions compared to the 2.6% that we were previously using. This 1% difference results in a reduction to 2017\/2018 allowed revenue and affects our 2017 calendar revenue by approximately $0.03 per share. The lower RPI rate and the revenue giveback are fully reflected in our assumptions that drive the 6% EPS growth through 2017.","As a result, the 2017 RPI sensitivity for 0.5% downward movement in the 2015\/2016 RPI is now off the current forecast of 1.6%. Looking ahead to November of this year, our 2016\/2017 and 2017\/2018 tariffs will be based on the forecasted RPI at that time. As you can see on the slide, the current RPI forecasts for 2016\/2017 is 2.8% and for 2017\/2018 it's 3.1%, both of which are in line with the rates used in the forecast to hit the 6% earnings growth.","Before turning the call back to Bill, I wanted to provide an update on our projected U.K. earnings through 2016. As you can see on slide 19, we have increased our earnings projections for 2015 and 2016 from a midpoint in the $1.40 per share range to a mid-point in the $1.43 per share range. The increase for 2015 is primarily driven by the lower depreciation expense from the asset life extension; the increase in 2016 is a combination of higher incentive revenues and lower depreciation. We still expect a relatively flat earnings trajectory in the U.K. through 2017. However, it is now off of the higher 2015 year-end forecast of $1.43 per share.","That concludes my prepared remarks and I'll turn the call back over to Bill.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Vince. PPL continues to be a very compelling investment opportunity within our sector, with competitive earnings growth rate, which we just guided to 6% through 2017, combined with better than average dividend yield at about 4.5% and the ability to continue to grow that dividend, we believe we can deliver a top quartile total shareowner return over the next three years. And I believe most importantly that this is all supported by a low risk business plan.","With that, operator let's open the call to questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instruction] The first question comes from Shah Pourreza of Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Shah Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good morning.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Shah Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","I appreciate the new disclosures around the Compass Project. So how should we think about the remaining miles? Are you looking to potentially segment the rest? And then, is there an opportunity to potentially JV with some of the neighboring utilities to smooth out the process?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I think in both cases the answer would be yes. So there's an ability to continue to segment the line as well as partnering with adjacent or utilities that the project goes through their service territory. So I think in both cases we would look to do that.","Shah Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. And then just on the updated guidance around the growth of 6%. Should we sort of think about that as a new midpoint of a new range, or is this sort of you being able to sort of achieve that top end of the prior plan?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","This is really our ability to achieve the top end of the plan for this current period, the 2015 through 2017 period, and then we will assess and report out on the fourth quarter call our expectations for how that growth rate will continue past 2017.","Shah Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. And then just one last question, under ED1 the updated disclosures which was obviously very helpful. Is this something we can expect an update on a quarterly basis as you report earnings? And is this sort of the trough earnings to that segment sort of being shifted a little bit into 2017 and potentially earlier than that?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, two things, one is we will continue to update on a quarterly basis where we stand relative to those incentive targets. We previously had noted that the U.K. business was expected to be flat from an earnings per share basis. With the new disclosures and now six months behind us in terms of how well we feel about our capability to earn the incentive revenue, we are now comfortable saying that the UK earnings will be slightly positive 1% to 2% type growth rate off of the flat. So we are now looking at that 1% to 2% annual growth rate.","Shah Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Excellent. Congrats on these results.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. Can you hear me?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Julien, yes.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So first quick question, if you can elaborate a little bit on the latest positive development in the UK? Could you perhaps give us a little bit of a sense of how much of that is driven by cost savings, if you will, specifically TotEx?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. The increase in earnings that we are announcing today from the U.K. is primarily driven by the increase in the incentive revenues that we now expect to earn through the period. There really are some other moving parts, the biggest of which is probably the depreciable change that we had in the lives of the assets, and that's in the short-term driving some cost savings there. From a TotEx perspective maybe Robert, you could indicate where we are relative to the filed (29:26) business plan?","Robert A. Symons - Chief Executive Officer, Western Power Distribution, PPL Corp.","Thanks, Bill. Yeah, in terms of TotEx basically, we are on target to deliver the plan. There are various variables, which obviously influence that, connections and other such things, but basically we are on plan.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thank you.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. All right. Excellent. And then perhaps to boot with that, if you will. Where do you stand with respect to solar DG interconnections into the your U.K. system? And how is that impacting the TotEx expectations in the near-term as well as into the mid-period review? And do you expect to have a mid-cycle review potentially to reflect more solar interconnections?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Let me ask Robert to comment, but before he does just to put a little perspective on this. There has been a significant increase in request for connections for distributed generation in the U.K. predominantly driven by some very substantial feed in tariffs that have encouraged a lot of connections. My understanding is the feed in tariffs are coming to an end are being substantially reduced, such that the demand for distributed generation has dropped off very significantly. Having said that, there is a lot of pent-up demand and request on the system and it kind of depends on which DNO you look at. I think of the DNOs that we operate, the four DNOs, the one DNO where we're seeing the most significant request has really been in the Southwest. So with that bit of background, Robert, do you want to provide a little bit more color, please?","Robert A. Symons - Chief Executive Officer, Western Power Distribution, PPL Corp.","Yes, just to give you some idea of scale, the current subsidy on photovoltaic is about \u00a30.06 per unit. That's going down. There's a consultation document out, and potentially that will go down to about \u00a30.01 per unit. So basically it's the FIT tariffs which actually drive demand.","In terms of its impact on TotEx, developers have to pay the cost of reinforcement upfront, and it's only the bit that possibly benefits us in other ways, but it's actually funded out of the TotEx part. So that 95% of the cost of actually putting in or reinforcing the network in order to connect large photovoltaics is actually met by the developer themselves.","So I don't see it as a real big impact on TotEx. I think if there was a change in government policy as to how this stuff was funded then that would be the trigger that would trigger a midterm review if it was the case that companies had to make a larger contribution towards that investment. But given the current situation, I can't really see that happening.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. But just to clarify here, is this a CapEx opportunity in your mind down the line and in the near-term is that one of the reasons that it prevents you from outpacing the current plan in the UK? Just to be very clear about it.","Robert A. Symons - Chief Executive Officer, Western Power Distribution, PPL Corp.","Well, we work under a series of rules, Julien and the rule say that there is no \u2013 the current rule say there's no investment ahead of need. So you can't build a line if you like before it's actually required. So that investment opportunity really isn't there under the current rules. And as I stated before, I think its impact on reinforcement expenditure detailed in the business plan is relatively small currently.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Excellent. Just the last little detail, I'd be curious you all have a good track record in the UK, what are your thoughts to expanding the UK footprint specifically transmission is opening up for competitive bid, obviously we talk a lot about that domestically, just curious to get your initial thoughts.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, at the moment Julien, we would not look to expand into transmission. I think as Robert said, we are great at what we do and we want to stick to what we know best, and so that's our current plan.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Well, congratulations again. Good results. Keep going.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, good morning guys.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Dan.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Just going back to the UK incentive revenues and the updates there, do I take that the new ranges for the next couple of years, those are going to be the high end of what you can earn based on the formulas in the UK because you're performing at the upper bounds of what they're allowing for?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We're not projecting to be at the very top of the band, but based on the projection \u2013 you know we have a range there. So we're near that \u2013 I would say we are in the upper end of the band, but there is probably still a little bit more room to the extent we outperform even more than we are currently projecting.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, Dan. This is Vince. I would say, the midpoint of those ranges would reflect kind of current level of performance, so if WPD is able to continue to improve that would push us probably to the high-end of those bands. But there's also risk that something bumps in the night, and so we took that into account as well. But it's based on current level of performance.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So effectively since the last update you guys have moved your performance from the old midpoint to the high end of the old band. Is this basically what's happening into the (35:17) either way. Okay. And then just kind of, given the shape of when you go from the old RIIO to the new RIIO, the 2019 opportunity, and I know this is far out, but just so we can kind of thinking about the shape of the outlook to the incentive revenue pool, does that shrink when you get out to 2019 given the fast-track design or does that stay about the same level, which you can keep competing for the same amount of revenue contribution?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Robert, why don't you take that?","Robert A. Symons - Chief Executive Officer, Western Power Distribution, PPL Corp.","The pool stays the same, the incentive mechanism stays the same, the targets get slightly more difficult year-on-year and that varies between, which of the full businesses you were talking about, but those, sort of, things have been built into sort of information that Vince chooses.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. So we don't have a contraction in that size. There is still opportunity for you guys to continue and be able to reach the top level in the future?","Robert A. Symons - Chief Executive Officer, Western Power Distribution, PPL Corp.","Yes, you got it exactly right. The opportunity still remains the same albeit the targets get slightly more difficult as time goes on. But one would hope that also investment and (36:24) investment in line and all the rest of it. Automation schemes will actually produce some benefit later on.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Very good. I got that. And then just on Compass real quick. I know it's ways off, but does this get caught up in this Order 1000 workout because it's an economic line instead of a reliability line? Do you get more competition, and people prospectively bid away the cost of capital? Or how do you think you're going to be able to reserve some sort of competitive advantage in this line?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll let Greg take that question.","Gregory N. Dudkin - President, PPL Electric Utilities, PPL Corp.","Yes. So the way this is set up currently under New York law, this would not be considered a FERC 1000 Project, so we are going and making interconnection requests and will be filing our Article VII now. So if the approval path goes down that path there may be an opportunity for competition, but the probability is little bit lower. If the PSC opens up economic window next year then there could be competition, so we'll see how it plays out.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think relative to the competitive nature of this, obviously just having completed a very major line essentially in the same region, I think our capability to be very competitive should we get to that point should be strong.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Very good. Think you guys.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thanks Dan.","Operator","The next question comes from Mike Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Congrats on a good quarter and outlook. I don't know if this is Bill or Vince question or both, when you think about just companywide what's the O&M assumption that's embedded in your guidance growth rate the kind of 6% off of 2014?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Thanks for the question, Michael. I'll let Vince take that one.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. So in general coming \u2013 so obviously you know we've reduced O&M quite significantly coming out of the spin with the corporate restructuring efforts where we're targeting about $75 million and we are comfortable that we've achieved that.","However, we do continue to look at the corporate services organization as well as just operations between PA and Kentucky so see if there is opportunities for continued efficiency there domestically. WPD is already very efficient. And so we just continue to look at that and we built in about another $0.02 worth of opportunity through 2017 in achieving the 6% growth rate.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. And can you just give us the puts and takes? I mean I know the Pennsylvania rate increase, I know the environmental cost recovery rider in Kentucky. But your U.S. utility growth rate puts you kind of well above the norm for traditional utilities. Can you talk about some of the other drivers of that besides those two items I referenced?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think a key one would be transmission. Our transmission is growing at a compound rate of 17%, so that's a significant driver. In terms of the outcomes that you mentioned on the rate cases, I think they were fair outcomes, not terribly inconsistent with our planning assumptions.","I think as we continue to refine our cost structure, as Vince said, both at the corporate level as well as at the utility level, that's going to drive some upside or some improvement there, and that does help the domestic utility growth rate. But I think it's probably worth mentioning that we're not really changing the domestic utility growth rate from the utilities. What we've really changed and up the overall is the corporate services where we're seeing lower costs. So the lower costs in the corporate services, that $0.02 that Vince mentioned, is really what's moving the domestic utilities growth rates up or everything is combined together to get us to the 6%.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Last question in the UK, can you remind us the calendar year expected incentive revenue for 2015 and 2016?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The calendar year, so it's an April 1 start and then it goes on to the March \u2013 the end of March of the following year, and that in terms of the dollars is $130 million.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You wanted 2015 and 2016, Michael?","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. I'm just trying to compare, what you have on slide 10 to what you are expecting for 2015, 2016, and I think what you have in slide 10 is calendar year not the April to March year?","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","That is correct. So 2015 we had $120 million and about $125 million, $126 million for 2016.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks, guys. Much appreciated.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi, good morning.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Steve.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, Bill. Just want to clarify some of the UK changes where it seems like that's where the guidance uplift is. So the incentive benefit which you've given, it looks like it's about $0.01 in 2017 based on the higher on a per share, $10 million or $15 million?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then you did change your RPI guidance, you said down $0.03?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Correct, we did flex it down.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","In the guidance, right.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","In the guidance. So is then all the rest of the benefit, depreciation benefit or some kind of O&M to or what's...?","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Year, so Steven, I would say the 6% as we were going through the planning \u2013 or the $0.06, as we were going through the planning process, we didn't bake, up until now, all of that $0.06 of depreciation upside through 2017 because of the risks around RPI and FX. I would say that the RPI forecast has been holding strong in that 3% range. So we're at 2.8% for 2016 and 3.1% for 2017, so we are feeling pretty good.","The exposure there is really only another month because once that gets set next month, that's really what it will drive for the next two years. So we feel comfortable with that exposure. And then as we continue to layer on the hedges, I think we are extremely comfortable that we can manage the FX exposure and hedge that up to $1.60 through at least 2017.","So as our comfort level on both of those risk factors improved, we were able to put more of this $0.06 upside kind of into the base forecast. So that $0.06 has been there all along, but we were using it as a risk mitigant up until now.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. Okay. So that depreciation benefit you had at the beginning of the year, there's not like a new one on top of that. That's just you're able to see the full benefit of that because you've limited some of the pressures that might been there.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Correct.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. Got it. Perfect. Okay. That was really it. Thank you.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gregg Orrill of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Gregg Gillander Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, thank you. Can you talk about a little bit about the funding needs for the CapEx plan? You have almost $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Would one of the strategies be to work that cash balance down? Or how are you thinking about that?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, that would be the plan. We work that down. Vince, you can probably speak more specifically to exactly how we are planning to fund the CapEx plan.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. So slide 26 in the appendix, Gregg, really details that. It's the same slide that we went through last quarter in terms of funding the growth. So in the UK, I'll just reiterate that the UK business is fully self funding variable with their cash from operations and their ability to borrow in country and maintain their 80% to 85% debt to rev ratios. They are able to basically self fund (45:06) dividends about $400 million of cash a year back to the state.","We take that $400 million, add it to our cash from operations, fund our maintenance capital and we still think we'll have even after we pay the dividend about $250 million and over say the next three years to five years that will continue to grow as the domestic cash from ops grows. So that $250 million will drive either dividend growth that Bill talked about or CapEx growth, and then we'll use debt and a little bit of equity. We still have the $200 million of maxed equity issuances in the plan. Everything else would be funded with debt and we are able to do that and maintain our solid investment-grade credit ratings.","Gregg Gillander Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, Vince.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","The next question comes from Neel Mitra of Tudor, Pickering. Please go ahead.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thanks for updating the RPI assumption. My question is when is the next time, you will be evaluated for? I guess for the 2016\/2017 planning years? So when would the 2.8% be evaluated versus what's actually happening? And would that impact mainly 2018 earnings, if there was a reset?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, the first impact would be showing up in 2018 and 2019 period. It's the regulatory year. So that is correct. And in terms of the next end of the period, I guess when would that be, Vince, in terms of the measurements?","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. I mean, it's the same schedule as the 2015\/2016, so we are truing up the 2.6% to the 1.6% and that giveback shows up two years later, two regulatory years later, so in the 2017\/2018 timeframe. So if 2016\/2017 comes in on an actual basis less than the 2.8% that would be given back in 2018\/2019.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","But also if it comes in higher, we will receive additional revenues in 2018\/2019, so it's not one way.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Right, right. And then looking at the percent hedged for the currency at 66%, and you are assuming $1.60 for the exchange rate, do you have any more flexibility to maybe lower 2015 hedges to benefit 2017, if the exchange rate doesn't go your way?","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So we are pretty much done with our 2015 hedges. However, our 2016 hedges are in the money as well, and there certainly could be an opportunity to re-strike our 2016 hedges and move that value into 2017 and potentially even a little bit in 2018. I would say we probably have $0.03 or $0.04 of opportunity to do that.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then directionally can you guys provide where you are in terms of the exchange rate hedges for 2018 at this point?","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So we are currently 0% hedged for 2018.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome. And I think we're out of time Joe.","Joseph P. Bergstein - Director-Investor Relations","Yeah, I think there is no more questions in the queue. So go ahead, Bill.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Great.

Please go ahead..","Joseph P. Bergstein - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Amy. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the PPL conference call on first quarter results and our general business outlook. We are providing slides of this presentation on our website at www.pplweb.com.","Any statements made in this presentation about future operating results or other future events are forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from such forward-looking statements. A discussion of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ is contained in the appendix to this presentation and in the company's SEC filings.","We will refer to earnings and ongoing operations or ongoing earnings, a non-GAAP measure, on this call. For reconciliation to the GAAP measure, you should refer to the press release which has been posted on our website and has been filed with the SEC.","As a reminder, Talen Energy has filed its Form S-1 Registration Statement with the SEC. And although the registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC, we remain in a quiet period with respect to future prospects of PPL Energy Supply and Talen until the completion of the spin-off as previously announced on June 1.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Spence, PPL Chairman, President and CEO.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased that you've joined us today. With me on the call are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; and the presidents of our four business segments.","Moving to slide three, our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our 2015 first quarter earnings results, an operational overview and a discussion of our 2015 earnings forecast. After my remarks, Vince will review our segment financials. He'll also provide an update on our U.K. operations including our improved currency hedge status, a new look at our sensitivity changes in RPI, or U.K. inflation, and our enhanced ability to repatriate cash. Then we will take your questions.","The first quarter of 2015 marked a successful start to the year for PPL. We achieved strong earnings results overall with solid performance across our regulated utility businesses. The competitive Supply segment also turned in a solid performance despite ongoing challenging market conditions. As I'll describe in more detail shortly, we're on track to complete the spinoff of Supply on June 1.","Turning to slide four. Today, we announced first quarter 2015 reported earnings of $0.96 per share, an increase of $0.47 from our first quarter 2014 results. Adjusting for special items, our regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations were $0.77 per share, up 17% from first-quarter of 2014, adjusted regulated utility results.","If you recall from our 2014 year-end earnings call, we discussed excluding the Supply segment earnings and net costs associated with the Supply spinoff from our ongoing earnings to provide results for our regulated utility operations. This approach provides our investors with a clearer picture of the financial performance of the going forward part of our PPL portfolio.","Consistent with that approach, we've adjusted the ongoing earnings on this slide to focus on our regulated utility operations. With regard to regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations, I'm pleased with the increase we achieved in the first quarter compared with the same period a year ago. Strong first quarter earnings at our U.K. Regulated segment drove the 17% increase. Vince will provide more details on all the quarterly results during his remarks.","Let's move to slide five for a discussion of our 2015 earnings forecast. Based on first quarter performance, we're reaffirming our 2015 forecast range of $2.05 to $2.25 per share for regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations. The midpoint of this range, $2.15 per share, is approximately 5.9% higher than the adjusted ongoing earnings from our utility operations in 2014. Our 2014 adjusted regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations removes Supply earnings and includes the full impact of dissynergies related to the spinoff of Supply, including indirect O&M, interest and depreciation.","Based on the continued excellent performance of our utility operations, the organic growth from planned, and approved infrastructure investments and the results of our corporate restructuring efforts, we remain very confident in our ability to achieve compound annual growth in earnings of 4% to 6% through at least 2017.","As shown here on slide five, for 2015, we're anticipating small increases in earnings in our U.K. and Kentucky utilities and slightly lower earnings in our Pennsylvania utility. The slide also shows the significant improvement in the corporate and other category that we expect to realize as a result of our ongoing corporate support cost reductions, including the $75 million of dissynergies we discussed at the time we announced the spinoff.","At the outset of the year, I mentioned that 2015 is very much a transitional year for PPL. On April the 1st, our U.K. Regulated segment transitioned to the new RIIO-ED1 eight-year price control period. On June 1, the spin-off of our Supply business and creation of Talen Energy will be completed. In Kentucky, we expect our rate case to be concluded in the second quarter with new rates taking effect July 1. And in Pennsylvania, we filed a rate case in late March, and we're working through the Public Utility Commission's review process. All these 2015 initiatives are on track, and we're really pleased with the progress thus far.","Now, let's turn to slide six for an update on our Kentucky Regulated operations. We continue to make progress on our Kentucky rate proceedings, reaching a settlement agreement in April with all the parties in the base rate cases before the Kentucky Public Service Commission. If the settlement is approved by the commission, it will result in an increase of $125 million in annual base electricity rates at Kentucky Utilities and a $7 million increase in annual base gas rates at Louisville Gas & Electric. The settlement focuses on the total amount of costs we can recover rather than establishing a return on equity with respect to base rates.","While this settlement did not establish an ROE for base rates, we will earn a 10% return on equity investment related to the environmental cost recovery mechanism and our gas line tracker mechanism. The settlement agreement also provides for deferred cost recovery on a portion of the costs associated with pensions and Kentucky Utilities Green River plant, which is scheduled to be retired in April of 2016.","We're pleased we were able to reach an unanimous settlement with the parties to the case. As I mentioned, we anticipate that new rates will go into effect on July 1 of this year. We also continue to focus on major capital projects in Kentucky. Recent milestones include the retirement of our Cane Run Unit 6 coal-fired generating unit, the first of three units that are being retired at that facility. The retirement comes as the company prepares to bring its new Cane Run 7 combined cycle gas-fired unit online later this quarter.","Turning to slide seven. On March 31, we filed a request with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission for an increase of $167.5 million in annual distribution revenue requirement at PPL Electric Utilities. This request is driven by investments we're making to renew, strengthen and modernize our Pennsylvania delivery network. If approved by the PUC, we expect the increase to take effect January 1, 2016. We're also set to energize the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line in just a few days. This $630 million project represents a major upgrade to the nation's electric grid. The new 500 KV power line will strengthen reliability for millions of people in the Northeast.","The three-year project created significant economic development benefits in both Pennsylvania and New Jersey, including the creation of about 2,000 construction jobs. This project was one of seven projects nationwide to be fast-tracked by the Obama Administration's Rapid Response Team recognizing its importance.","Building a major transmission line like this requires a tremendous amount of planning, communication and cooperation with many different stakeholders, including government agencies, PSEG, our neighboring utility who partner with us on the construction of the line, local officials and the public. Many people were involved in making this project a success. I appreciate their dedication and the achievement. This project is a great example of our ability to execute major capital projects that add value for both customers and shareowners.","Turning to slide eight, let's briefly discuss domestic weather-normalized sales for the year and the quarter. In Kentucky, weather-normalized sales for the first quarter were down about 0.5% with residential, commercial, and industrial usage all lower compared to a year ago. Kentucky experienced lower sales volumes due to a longer period of cold weather in the first quarter of 2014 versus 2015 as well as more extreme weather last year compared to this year. As you can see, first quarter weather normalized 2015 sales were also lower in Pennsylvania than in the first quarter of 2014. The decrease was driven by lower residential and industrial sales offset slightly by higher commercial sales. The 2015 weather-normalized sales are 1.2% below 2014.","Similar to Kentucky, weather-normalized sales comparisons to 2014 are difficult due to extreme weather impacts. Although the winter of 2015 was slightly colder than the winter of 2014, 2014's polar vortex was much more volatile with more temperature swings. On a rolling 12-month basis, total weather-normalized sales in both Kentucky and Pennsylvania were essentially flat for the 12 months ending March 31, 2015, compared to the previous 12-month period.","Moving to slide nine, we continue to make significant progress related to the spinoff of our competitive generation business, which will be combined with Riverstone's competitive generation business to form Talen Energy. We've now received all the necessary regulatory approvals to complete the transaction including from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Department of Justice, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. We expect to close on the transaction June 1. Talen Energy common stock is expected to begin trading on a when-issued basis on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol TLN WI, beginning on May 18. On June 2, regular-way trading of Talen Energy common stock will begin under the symbol TLN.","Immediately following the transaction, PPL shareowners will own 65% of Talen Energy's outstanding common stock with Riverstone's affiliates owning the remaining 35%. The PPL Board of Directors has declared a pro-rata distribution to PPL shareowners of record on May 20.","The distribution ratio is expected to be approximately 0.125 Talen shares for each PPL share and will take place on June 1. PPL will announce the definitive distribution ratio promptly after the record date based on the actual number of PPL shares outstanding on that date.","Our PPL and Talen transition teams have done a great job of coordinating a transition process that will allow Talen Energy to operate safely and efficiently on day one and result in a lower cost corporate structure for PPL going forward.","Before turning the call over to Vince, I would reiterate that we had a solid start to 2015 and we we're able to reach a settlement in the rate case in Kentucky. And as Vince is going to review shortly, PPL's got a strong foundation for future success as a pure play regulated utility company. PPL is taking significant steps, as many of you know, to preserve and create shareowner value over the last several years. As we approach June 1, which will consummate the formation of Talen Energy, I want to just take a moment to thank all the PPL employees and future Talen employees that have made this significant effort possible and for all the past contributions of our PPL Energy Supply employees.","I'd also like to thank Paul Farr for his leadership, not only with the spin of our Energy Supply business, but also for the seven years he spent as PPL's CFO. I appreciate all they've done and wish them much success.","I'll now ask Vince to provide an update on the first quarter segment results. Vince?","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to slide 10. Today I will be comparing our regulated utility earnings results to our adjusted 2014 results. As Bill indicated, the adjusted 2014 results exclude the earnings from the Supply segment, and adjust for the dissynergies related to the spin. These adjustments are consistent in approach with the full-year adjustments we made to our 2014 year-end results. I will discuss our Supply segment results separately.","Our first quarter regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations increased over last year, driven primarily by higher earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment and in an improvement in corporate and other while the Kentucky Regulated and Pennsylvania Regulated segments remained flat to a year-ago.","Although weather was flat for the domestic utilities compared to last year, it was better than normal by about $0.03. And while earnings from ongoing operations in the U.K. increased significantly in the quarter compared to year-ago, we continue to expect earnings for this segment to be up only slightly on a full-year basis. This is driven by lower utility revenues as we transitioned to RIIO-ED1 on April 1 of this year, offset by improvements in income taxes, depreciation expense and the effects of foreign currency. The increase in corporate and other earnings from ongoing operations was primarily due to the benefits of the corporate restructuring as we expected.","As we've mentioned, corporate restructuring effort is well under way and we are already beginning to see those benefits. At this point, we fully expect to be able to achieve the targeted $75 million in corporate support cost savings we discussed during our previous calls. The Supply first quarter earnings from ongoing operations also remain the same as the first quarter 2014.","Let's move to a more detailed review of the first quarter segment earnings drivers, starting with the U.K. results on slide 11. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.50 per share in the first quarter 2015, a $0.09 increase compared to the same period last year. This increase was due to higher utility revenue due primarily to higher prices, partially offset by lower volumes.","Lower depreciation expense driven by the completion of a periodic useful life assessment of certain fixed assets that resulted in an extension of our network asset lives, which was partially offset by an increase in depreciation due to asset additions. Lower financing costs due to lower interest on our index linked debt, favorable effects from foreign currency and lower income taxes and other from a lower U.K. tax rate and lower U.S. taxes on dividends in 2015.","Moving to slide 12. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the first quarter of 2015, flat compared to a year ago. This result was due to higher gross margins from returns on additional environmental capital investments, partially offset by lower sales volumes due to less favorable weather compared to last year, and higher income taxes.","Turning to slide 13. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.13 per share in the first quarter, also comparable to last year. This was primarily due to higher margins from additional transmission investments, partially offset by a benefit recorded in the first quarter of 2014 from a change in estimate of a regulatory liability. Higher margins were offset by higher depreciation due to asset additions.","Finishing our segment review with Supply on slide 14, this segment earned $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2015, the same as year ago, despite the benefit of the unusually cold weather we experienced in Q1 of last year.","Excluding the $0.03 weather impact from 2014, the results were higher primarily due to higher energy prices, favorable base load generation and higher intermediate and peaking margins offset by lower capacity prices, lower results from full requirement sales contracts and certain other commodity positions. We also had lower payroll cost and lower financing cost compared to last year.","Moving to slide 15. On this slide, we detail our GBP hedging status for 2015, 2016 and 2017 including sensitivities for a $0.05 and $0.10 downward movement in the exchange rate compared to our budgeted rate of $1.60. First, we continue to be hedged at 97% for the remainder of 2015 at an average rate of $1.60. For 2016, we increased our hedge percentage slightly from 70% at year-end to 72% today at an average rate of $1.61.","We also started to layer in hedges for 2017 during the quarter and we are now 20% hedged for 2017 at an average rate of $1.60. You can see from the sensitivity table that there is basically no exposure for the remainder of 2015, minimal exposure in 2016 and about $0.04 of exposure in 2017 if our average hedged rate is $1.55, and $0.07 of exposure if it's $1.50.","Also on this slide, we are showing an RPI sensitivity. Under the RIIO methodology, our revenues for the 2015-2016 regulatory year were set using a 2.6% inflation rate. Our revenues in the 2017-2018 time period will reflect a true-up for the actual inflation rate for the 2015-2016 regulatory year. Current RPI forecasts using the HM Treasury forecast of the U.K. economy would suggest a 2015-2016 inflation rate of about 2% compared to the 2.6% included in our current revenues. Therefore, we are providing a sensitivity for a 0.5% downward move in RPI for the 2015-2016 time period. RPI forecasts for 2016 and beyond are either at or above our assumed 3%.","RPI affects three primary financial drivers for WPD: our revenues, our O&M, and the interest expense on our index-linked debt. The lower RPI we are currently experiencing does not have a significant effect on our 2015 or 2016 U.K. earnings guidance we provided during our year-end call. For 2017, since this is the first year we see the RPI true-up in revenues, the lower 2015-2016 RPI of 50 basis points or RPI of about 2% would have a negative effect on earnings of about $0.02 per share in 2017.","Moving to slide 16, we're providing an updated view of our cash repatriation ability in the U.K. Since our year-end update, we continue to evaluate our ability to repatriate cash from the U.K. We expect to increase our 2015 cash repatriation by about 10% over the information we provided on the year-end earnings call to about $300 million. We believe we have additional capacity beyond that and for 2016 and 2017, we now forecast that we can bring up to $500 million per year. We're showing ranges here of $300 million to $500 million for 2016 and 2017, as we will determine the amount based on our domestic cash needs at that time.","We recognize that at $300 million of U.K. distributions per year, the domestic payout ratio to fund our dividend was over 100% beginning in 2016. With our ability to dividend between $300 million and $500 million a year from WPD over the next few years, we would target to get the domestic payout ratio back under 100% for 2016 and continue to lower that domestic payout ratio in 2017 and 2018. We are confident we can fund the PPL dividend and continue to grow it modestly while we are in this period of high CapEx spending.","Before I turn the call back over to Bill for the Q&A, I also want to provide an update on our expectations for bonus revenues in the U.K., since we receive a lot of questions on this topic. As we enter the RIIO-ED1 price control period, we expect to earn lower bonus revenues as our ability to outperform will be more challenging, given the tighter performance targets under RIIO. Rick Klingensmith has discussed this topic on our previous call. This will result in lower bonus revenues starting in 2017. Our business plan assumes $120 million of bonus revenues for 2015, between $120 million and $130 million for 2016, and between $80 million and $100 million for 2017. And, for 2018, when the full impact of the tighter performance targets is seen, we would expect to earn between $60 million and $90 million in bonus revenues.","That concludes my prepared remarks. And, I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Vince. Before we get to the Q&A, and as Vince just described, PPL is continuing to optimize our U.K. plans under Rio and providing investors with enhanced disclosures. We think this additional information will be helpful to better understand our U.K. business and the exceptional value we feel it provides to our regulated portfolio. We'll continue to enhance our disclosures in the future as well once we get to Talen spin behind us.","And with that, operator, let's please open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Greg Gordon at Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Good morning, gentlemen.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","So, just a few questions on the regulated segments. So, you came in obviously with a big increase in Q1 in the U.K. Regulated segment. So basically you expect the headwinds from the lower revenues to fully offset that in the next three quarters and come in flat for the year or did you come in slightly ahead or behind of your budget, what you expected in Q1?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Vince, you want to take that question?","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. How're you doing, Greg? Yeah, I would say we came in slightly ahead of budget for the quarter, but based on the forecast going through the rest of the year, we would still expect to maintain our original forecast of around $1.38.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. And then this $0.02 headwind in 2017 associated with the 50 basis point sensitivity to RPI, does that assume that you're unable to offset that with any sort of cost reductions? One would presume if inflation is tracking below trend that your costs might also be somewhat flexible and track below trend?","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, that would be net of all three components that I discussed.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Great. In Kentucky, what percentage of that $132 million should you get approval of the settlement, would you expect to flow in the revenue in the second half of 2015?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm sorry, Greg. Could you repeat that question again?","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","How much of the $132 million annualized rate increase that is codified in the settlement would actually flow into 2015 revenue if it's approved as currently proposed?","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. It would be about half, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. And then the timing, sorry.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Let me just rewind a bit back to the answer on the U.K.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Yeah.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think that $0.02 that we're talking about on the RPI would not include any potential offsets that we might achieve based on lower inflation that could impact O&M.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. So, in other words, if inflation is tracking below expectations, costs might also track below expectations and mitigate that $0.02 impact?","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","That is correct.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. And then the timing of the decision in Pennsylvania, based on the filing, when would you expect to get a revenue decision?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Go ahead.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, so, the based on the normal flow, it'd be December we'd get the final ruling from the PUC.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. And then last question. You've given us a couple years of visibility on your expectation for U.K. earnings. Given the headwind of the expected bonus revenue decline from $125 million at the midpoint to $90 million to $75 million, when do you expect to get on a playing field in the U.K. where you would expect to have the opportunity to show growth in the earnings power of that business? Is it the 2018 fiscal year 2019, 2020? When do we get to the point where sort all the headwinds have been mitigated and you start to grow again?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It would really began in around the 2018 timeframe, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. So in 2018, you're confident you could overcome that last negative step-down?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's kind of the base year. I think that's \u2013 yeah, 2018 is kind of the base year, because that's the last year when we do the step-down or reflect the lower new bonus revenue that we just disclosed today and then it would be a trajectory off of that.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. So 2018 through the end of the current rate period?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you, guys.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. You're welcome.","Operator","The next question comes from Daniel Eggers at Credit Suisse.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Dan.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning, Dan.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Good morning. Just a couple questions. One, I guess the U.K. elections are upon us, can you just give any thoughts of what effect that may have on your business or with the RIIO in place, are you guys well protected at this point?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think we feel pretty confident that the U.K. election would have no material effect on us. We would expect, as you've probably read as well, probably a coalition government would get established. As you know, we've have already got our license, it's been approved and well in hand. And on the distribution side of the business, we would really not expect any material change.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, just wanted to make sure. And then with the load growth, you're kind of showing negative on a weather normalized basis. Should we read much into that as it being hard to disaggregate weather in the volatile first quarters the last two years or is there something more structural going on as far as the lack of recovery in usage?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, I think you hit on it. I think it's just a difficult thing to model and so I wouldn't read anything through on the first quarter results at all.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","If we look at the trailing 12 months versus trailing 12 months, it still has some of that same friction, is the first quarter of both years skewing that number enough that we should probably disregard those as well?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, that would be our opinion. Yeah.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And are you comfortable with kind of the low-drift forecast you guys have given previously on a normalized basis?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We are, we've said about 0.5% per year of low growth, and we still think that's a reasonable expectation.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And I guess the U.K. looks a little bit better for this year at this point, and I'm going to guess utilities maybe a little bit behind plan, not much but a little. Are you thinking that the base of the U.K. should cover any sort of load weakness you might have had in the first part of the year?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think it has for the first quarter certainly and we didn't update, obviously, the guidance despite a really strong first quarter, just because we're early in the year. And we've got the summer to go which, obviously, from a weather standpoint, could have a material effect potentially, depending on how the weather turns out, on utility earnings.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Dan, I would just add that I think the domestic utilities first quarter results are very consistent with what we were expecting. They're not behind.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Very good. Thank you, guys.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Weinstein at UBS.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","I was wondering if you could talk about the tax consequences of the repatriation?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Go ahead, Vince.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. No incremental U.S. income tax as a result of the additional cash repatriation.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, a separate question on PJM's capacity auction that's coming up. Wondering if you could kind of highlight what kinds of assets you think might be base versus capacity performance and in your own fleet as well as other assets outside of your fleet, and what you think might be the differential or would cause the differential between the pricing that will count for each category","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Let me ask Paul Farr to address that question.","Paul A. Farr - President - PPL Energy Supply and PPL Generation, PPL Corp.","Okay. For our own fleet as we think about the way the rules came out in more final form in December versus the original October white paper, other than a de-rate for the hydro facilities in PJM, I would see the entirety of our fleet qualifying on the PPL Energy Supply side, really as well as the PJM assets on the Riverstone qualifying for CP.","Which assets would be likely bid based by a generation owner based upon risk and what asset classes like DR \u2013 like limited DR that wouldn't qualify for an annual bid because it's a full-year requirement for CP, but the limited wouldn't. And I think a lot of that it would be tough to group together some of that other DR. So I think a lot of that kind of falls out to base. And then even though we've got really strong EFORds for our fleet, if you've got coal assets that have been very challenged economically and you've not been putting capital into the plan and you have a very hard time forecasting a forced outage rate, so it becomes very difficult to predict penalties. I think you effectively bid those base simply because you're not willing to take the penalty exposure.","And then the other assets that are in the system like our hydro assets that would get de-rated or renewables assets that get de-rated all as well kind of fall out. And if they are bid in, they would be at fractional percentages of their base or name-plate capacity.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Right. So you see all of your assets in the CP category?","Paul A. Farr - President - PPL Energy Supply and PPL Generation, PPL Corp.","That's correct.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","And do you think there will be a big price differential between CP and base?","Paul A. Farr - President - PPL Energy Supply and PPL Generation, PPL Corp.","I think there will be a reasonably sized price differential between CP and base. By definition, if you're in base, if you've got your plan hedged, you still have the LMP penalty of not running your unit and you have sold forward the power. We have that today in the BRA auctions up to this point in payment. (33:47) But because of the penalty exposure of nonperformance in CP, it's very, I think, rational and economically logical that people are going to have to bid that risk into their required results from CP and you're going to see those risks bid into prices and the CP clearing at higher than base.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much, Paul.","Paul A. Farr - President - PPL Energy Supply and PPL Generation, PPL Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Patterson at Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But just, if you could elaborate a little bit more on how you guys went about hedging the currency for 2017. Just in general, are you guys using options or did the forward actually get up to $1.60? Sorry to be so sort of \u2013 I don't have all the data in front of me.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. It did not get up to the $1.60. It did get quite strong there for a while. It's backed off a little bit, but it's still above $1.50 and I think yesterday it was about $1.52. But I'll let Vince describe what tools we're using and how we hedged 2017.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. So, Paul, what we did was for the \u2013 as you know, our 2015 hedges are well in the money, because we hedged those north of, in some cases, $1.60. And so, what we were able to do was basically reprice some of our 2015 in the money hedges, lower the strikes a little bit on those. And that enabled us to basically get in the money hedges out in 2017. And so, the impact of doing that is actually about a $0.02 hit to 2015, but it enabled us to preserve about 20% of our hedge levels in 2017 at our budgeted rate of $1.60.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So, you guys are taking advantage of some in the money hedges this year, and swapping it into 2017, and for what seems to be kind of small cost of $0.02 a share. Does that make, am I getting it right?","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Essentially, yes.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that's a good summary.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, great. That's it, thanks so much.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Paul.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Lapides at Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys, congrats on a good start of the year. Can you talk \u2013 now that you're beginning the first days of RIIO, I mean you've known it's coming for a while. Can you talk about opportunities for O&M or expense management you see over the next couple years in the U.K?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Let me \u2013 Michael, I'll ask Rick Klingensmith to comment on that.","Rick L. Klingensmith - President, PPL Global and PPL Energy Services, PPL Corp.","Good morning, Michael. You're right, as we head into RIIO, we're heading into a new regulatory regime that's primarily related with the revenue side of the equation and how the regulator is rewarding us for both costs as well as innovation and on the incentive standpoint.","From an operating cost standpoint, though, what you've seen us perform in the last couple years, especially with the Midlands properties, will just continue from an operating standpoint into the future. So, our expectation is not a very significant or material change in the way we operate the business and the way we're performing on the business to deliver the high levels of reliability, the high levels of customer service.","We will continue to seek out areas of efficiency and use technology in any other applications that we can going forward and we will expect some level of ongoing efficiencies, but probably not at the same level you saw as we had with the changes that we made with the Midlands properties. And so from a cost standpoint, though, it's almost pretty much business as usual as we move into the RIIO period with the major effect from RIIO affecting how the revenues are paid out.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then in the U.S., how are you thinking about the next cycle of rate cases, meaning you've got a Kentucky settlement, you're into the process in Pennsylvania, what happens now? Do you stay out for a number of years in both places? Do you have a limited amount of time and then you're back in filing in front of regulators? How are you thinking about just kind of the cycle?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well as we continue to deploy capital and look for cost efficiencies, it's an ongoing evaluation of when or if there is a need to go back in. Clearly in Kentucky, we've still got quite a bit of work to do to meet the match rules and conclude some of the plans, but in that case the bulk of that capital is going to be through the tracker mechanisms that we have there. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, this settlement that we have before the Kentucky Public Service Commission would have us at a 10% ROE for that spending. So, it's really just kind of an ongoing evaluation and, at this time, as Greg just filed his rate case in Pennsylvania, that's going to take some time to play out. So, yet to be determined what that cycle may look like in the future.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks, guys, much appreciated.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome. Operator, do we have any other questions in the queue?","Operator","There are currently no questions in the queue, if you'd like to make any closing comments.","William H.

Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. We're very pleased that you've joined us this morning. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer, and the presidents of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses.","Moving to slide 3, our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our quarterly and year-to-date 2016 earnings results. We will also provide an update to our 2016 full-year earnings guidance, which we are reaffirming today.","We will then turn our discussion to the impact that the U.K. decision to leave the European Union has had on PPL. We are also initiating earnings guidance for 2017 and updating our long-term EPS growth rates. Following my remarks, Vince will review our segment results and provide an overview of the assumptions we've used in planning for growth through the end of the decade. As always, we'll leave time to answer your questions.","Turning next to slide 4. Today, we announced second quarter 2016 reported earnings of $0.71 per share compared with the reported loss of $1.13 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Second quarter 2015 results reflected a one-time charge of $1.50 per share from discontinued operations associated with the June 1, 2015, spin-off of our Supply business.","Year-to-date through the second quarter, reported earnings were $1.41 per share compared with a loss of $0.17 per share through the same period in 2015. Reported earnings for the first six months of 2015 reflect a loss from discontinued operations of $1.36 per share, resulting again primarily from the Supply spin-off.","Adjusting for special items, second quarter 2016 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.56 per share compared with $0.49 per share a year ago, representing a 14% increase on a per share basis. This increase was driven largely by higher base electricity rates at our Pennsylvania and Kentucky utilities along with higher transmission margins from additional transmission investments in Pennsylvania.","Through the first six months of 2016, earnings from ongoing operations were $1.23 per share compared with $1.26 per share a year ago, with the lower earnings year-to-date driven by the lower U.K. earnings in the first quarter of 2016 as a result of the RIIO-ED1 revenue reset that occurred in April of 2015. Vince will go into greater detail on second quarter results a little later in the call, but we're very pleased with the results for the second quarter and so far this year.","Moving to slide 5. Today, we're reaffirming our 2016 ongoing earnings forecast of $2.25 to $2.45 per share with a midpoint of $2.35 per share. The higher-than-expected results in all of our business units so far this year gives us a high degree of confidence in our ability to meet our 2016 earnings forecast. We continue to execute our plans for sustainable growth across our seven high-performing utilities while delivering award-winning customer service, strengthening reliability and improving our efficiencies. And to reflect the current market for the pound, our 2016 forecast now assumes $1.30 per pound on our open positions.","Turning to slide 6. Looking beyond 2016, the fundamentals of the business remain strong. And in fact, despite the recent U.K. vote to withdraw from the European Union and the resulting weakening of the British pound sterling exchange rates. The vote to leave the EU has created broader economic uncertainty in the U.K. and is clearly a unique event that has led to significant volatility in the currency and worldwide markets.","Despite this reaction, there is no change in our underlying business in the U.K. Our revenues are set for seven more years. We are essentially sheltered from an economic recession since we would be made whole in future periods for any volume variances that may result from an economic slowdown in the U.K. And as a reminder, our base revenues are also adjusted for inflation using the retail price index, or RPI. The July RPI forecast has actually already increased from the forecast published just a month ago in June. Further, we expect no change to our investment in infrastructure, since our business plans have already been accepted by Ofgem, the U.K. regulator.","The volatility created in the currency markets, however, does have an impact on our U.S. dollar financial projections. The lower pound exchange rate will impact our translated earnings and the WPD dividend coming back to the U.S.","Moving to slide 7. We know that without providing updates to our earnings growth profile, there will continue to be uncertainty for investors as to our longer term earnings profile, given the sharp decline in the British pound exchange rates. With no near-term catalyst that would signal a move higher in the pound, we took action to update our business plans to reflect current market conditions, starting with the monetization of our existing 2017 and 2018 hedges, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly.","Today, we're providing new earnings growth projections and a target dividend growth rate as well as updates to our U.K. cash repatriation and FX hedging strategies, all of which should provide clarity around our earnings and dividend targets through the end of the decade.","The post-Brexit decline in the pound sterling drove our existing foreign currency hedges to be about $450 million in the money, which we don't believe is being appropriately reflected in PPL's stock price. We believe investors are largely valuing the company on an open basis excluding the value of these hedges. As a result, we were looking for an opportunity to optimize the value of these existing hedges. We decided to monetize the gains associated with our 2017 and 2018 earnings hedges, capturing approximately $310 million in value. This monetization in combination with the higher than expected gains on the remaining 2016 hedges will offset lower expected cash repatriation amounts from the U.K. resulting from the lower expected exchange rate, providing about five to six years of coverage and will support the company's future dividend growth.","Cashing in the hedges, though, did result in us remarking our future earnings using current market rates, which is expected to result in 2017 earnings being lower than 2016 earnings. Since we didn't think we were getting credit in the stock price for the hedges, we felt it was prudent to lock in the value of those hedges and protect the dividend growth despite the resetting of our future earnings.","We have reestablished hedges for 2017 and 2018 at current foreign exchange rates at slightly higher hedge levels than existed prior to the monetization. We've updated our business plan to reflect current market conditions including $1.30 foreign currency rate on unhedged positions from 2017 through 2020.","Re-hedging about 95% of the 2017 U.K. earnings at current rates protects the 2017 earnings guidance that we are providing today against any further near-term decline in the pound, and resetting our unhedged earnings in our business plan to the $1.30 exchange rate allows for potential upside to our earnings projections if there is a recovery in the pound.","We're also announcing an update to our cash repatriation strategy, with an expectation of lower amounts being repatriated from the U.K. going forward. On an annual basis, we will determine the appropriate level of distributions from the U.K., taking into account foreign exchange rates, as well as tax rates in both the U.S. and the U.K. But in the near term, we anticipate that we would repatriate about $100 million to $200 million annually.","Vince will provide more details on this updated strategy in his prepared remarks. The actions we have taken reinforce our dividend growth projections and reestablish a baseline of PPL earnings and future earnings growth reflective of the Brexit decision, the current market, and our underlying business growth.","Today, we're providing a 2017 guidance range of $2.05 to $2.25 per share for PPL with the midpoint of $2.15 per share. We now expect per-share compound annual earnings growth of 5% to 6% from 2017 through 2020 based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance.","Moving forward, we will continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and strong cash flows, and our investment-grade credit ratings remain unchanged with a stable outlook.","Finally, as I mentioned earlier, with the cash-out of the hedges, we are not changing our expectation of a more meaningful dividend growth beginning in 2017. We're now targeting dividend growth of about 4% annually through the end of the decade. This will result in our total return proposition being projected to be in the 8% to 10% range over this period.","While we were not expecting the U.K. to vote to leave the EU, after careful consideration and deliberation with our board of directors, we decided to take these actions now as it recognizes the reality of the current market conditions is reflective of the underlying growth of the business and it enables us to focus our attention on providing safe reliable service to customers and delivering long-term value for shareowners as opposed to being overly focused on the FX rate.","Turning to slide 8, we prepared a walk from the midpoint of our 2016 earnings forecast of $2.35 per share to the $2.15 per share midpoint of our 2017 earnings forecast. As you can see on the slide, there's a $0.20 per share decline from 2016 to 2017 directly attributable to the impact of resetting the exchange rate to the updated hedge rate of $1.32 per pound. The U.K. earnings, excluding currency, are expected to be $0.04 lower in 2017 compared to 2016 as a result of lower incentive revenues that we've discussed on prior calls.","The higher depreciation and interest expense is offset by the annual price increase under RIIO-ED1 in the UK. We are forecasting both the Pennsylvania and Kentucky regulated segments to be $0.02 higher in 2017 compared to 2016. In both cases, higher margins are driving the higher earnings. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be relatively flat year-over-year.","Moving on to slide 9, our business fundamentals and investment proposition have not changed significantly. We still expect strong compound annual rate base growth of about 5% from year-end 2016 through 2020 with rate base expected to grow to $29 billion by 2020. The constructive regulatory climate in which we do business is also the same. We still expect about 80% of our $12 billion infrastructure investment over the period to receive real-time recovery. Our core business is growing in support of our longer-term growth projection of 5% to 6% from 2017 through 2020.","At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Vince to walk you through a detailed look at segment earnings and a full review of the detailed assumptions used in planning for our updated guidance. Vince?","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to slide 11. Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.07 per share, driven primarily by higher earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment and the Kentucky Regulated segment, while the U.K. Regulated segment remained flat compared to a year ago. Corporate and other costs were slightly favorable compared to prior year. We should note that for the second quarter compared to prior year, domestic weather was relatively flat and weather was about $0.01 positive compared to budget.","Let's move to a more detailed review of the second quarter segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on slide 12. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.11 per share in the second quarter of 2016, a $0.04 increase compared to the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher gross margins due to higher distribution margins as a result of the 2015 rate case that became effective January 1, 2016, and higher transmission margins due to additional capital investments.","Moving to slide 13. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.11 per share in the second quarter of 2016, a $0.02 increase compared to a year ago. This result was primarily due to higher gross margins from higher base rates that were effective July 1 of last year.","Turning to slide 14. Our UK Regulated segment earned $0.36 per share in the second quarter of 2016, the same as a year ago. This result was due to higher gross margins primarily resulting from higher prices due to the April 1, 2016, price increase, partially offset by one month of lower prices from the April 1, 2015, price decrease from the commencement of RIIO-ED1. Higher margins were offset by higher depreciation and interest expense as a result of continued investment in CapEx, and lower O&M expense of $0.01 was offset by unfavorable FX of $0.01.","Let's move to slide 15 and take a closer look at our earnings growth drivers. As Bill discussed, we are initiating our 2017 earnings guidance range of $2.05 to $2.25 per share, with a midpoint of $2.15 per share. We now expect a 5% to 6% long-term compound annual growth rate off of the 2017 midpoint of $2.15 through the end of the decade.","The key drivers in support of this new guidance include updating the GBP exchange rate to $1.30 per pound for all open positions and updating RPI using the July HM Treasury forecast for the U.K. economy. We have also updated our U.S. and U.K. interest rate and pension assumptions to incorporate a lower-for-longer interest rate environment. And as Bill indicated earlier, we're targeting a dividend growth rate of about 4% per year through 2020, starting in 2017.","Our assumptions for the 6% to 8% growth profile for our domestic utilities includes the same strong growth factors as previously discussed, including domestic rate base growth of about 5%, minimal load growth in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky, transmission spending under FERC formula rates in Pennsylvania of between $600 million and $700 million per year, totaling $2.6 billion over the four years, and between $350 million and $400 million a year of continued environmental investment in Kentucky at an ROE of 10%. Over the four years, we expect to spend about $1.5 billion of environmental CapEx in Kentucky.","Just this week, the Kentucky Public Service Commission approved our $1 billion environmental costs recovery plan with a 9.8% ROE. Moving to the U.K., the updates to the business plan reflect the macroeconomic impact following the U.K. referendum. We now project 4% to 6% growth in the U.K. from 2017 through 2020. The plan incorporates $1.30 per pound FX rate on our unhedged earnings from 2017 through 2020.","With the monetization of the 2017 and 2018 hedges, we entered into new hedges for those years at current market rates. I'll discuss the hedge levels and the average rates we attained when we get to the foreign currency hedging status slide. RAV growth is expected to be 5.4% through 2020, driving segment ROEs in the 12% to 14% range. We've also incorporated an update on the U.K. incentive revenue. Estimates are now $85 million for 2017, between $80 million and $100 million for 2018, and between $95 million and $115 million for 2019 and 2020.","These estimates for incentives were adjusted for the assumed change in exchange rates and RPI as well as expected performance against those targets. You will find our progress against the 2016 and 2017 regulatory year targets in the appendix to the presentation. WPD's performance continues to be very strong and is on track to beat the new target. We've incorporated new RPI assumptions to reflect the latest forecast published by HM Treasury in late July. This forecast shows a slight uptick in RPI from previous forecasts and we continue to expect an effective tax rate in the U.K. of approximately 17%.","Moving to slide 16, I'd like to review our updated cash repatriation strategy from the U.K., as this strategy has been modified beyond just the lower FX rate. Our previous guidance on cash repatriation from the U.K. was to distribute between $300 million and $500 million per year with a target of $400 million, assuming an FX rate of $1.60 per pound. We've previously indicated the amount of repatriation within that range would depend on a number of factors, including the FX rate.","The targeted $400 million per year represented distributions of about \u00a3250 million per year. That \u00a3250 million, translated at $1.30, would result in U.S. dollar distributions of about $325 million. This lower value of $75 million per year does not immediately impact us from a cash perspective, since the (20:38) money hedge value of about $450 million provides about five to six years of coverage against that lower U.S. dollar amount.","But while the hedges kept us whole from a cash perspective, with the historically low FX rate and higher corporate tax rates in the U.S. versus the U.K., we have an opportunity to optimize our cash coming back from the U.K. even further. We are currently planning to repatriate between $100 million and $200 million per year in the near term. This lower cash amount will minimize the amount of translation impact on cash coming back from the U.K. at these historically low exchange rates.","We will replace the lower repatriation level with debt in the U.S. Debt in the U.K., however, will be reduced by the same amount. Therefore, total debt at the PPL consolidated level will remain the same. This shift in borrowing from the U.K. to the U.S. captures the benefit of the tax rate differential between the two countries. This benefit becomes even more pronounced as the U.K. continues to reduce their corporate tax rates.","Since the distributions are reducing our U.K. tax basis, these lower distribution levels also extend our tax efficient cash repatriation strategy well beyond our original expectation of 2021 or 2022; and on an annual basis, we will continue to evaluate the most efficient level of cash repatriation, taking into account prospective changes in the exchange rate, tax rates in both the U.K. and the U.S., as well as our overall tax strategy.","Moving to slide 17. The primary change to our revised capital plan is updating the U.K. projections for 2017 through 2020 based on an FX rate of $1.30 compared to the $1.60 previously used and to an average rate of $1.37 for 2016. We are not projecting any impact on the U.K. capital forecast in local currency as those business plans have been accepted by Ofgem. On a U.S. dollar basis, we are now investing approximately $1 billion annually in each of our three business lines, and the five-year spending plan from 2016 through 2020, it's about $15.4 billion.","Moving to slide 18. We've also updated our rate base growth projections and have shown updated RAV balances to reflect the $1.30 FX rate assumption. Our overall growth rate of 5% has decreased slightly as we have reset our base year to 2016. And to enhance comparability, we have assumed $1.30 per pound for all periods.","Moving to slide 19. As we've discussed earlier, at the same time we monetized the 2017 and 2018 hedges, we've put new hedges on at slightly higher levels at current market rates. You can see our average hedge levels for 2017 and 2018 and the average rates we achieved when we put the new hedges on. We used forward contracts to hedge 2017, which locks in from an FX perspective the new guidance we just provided for 2017. However, we used the combination of forward contracts and zero-cost collars to re-hedge 2018, providing us with some potential upside if the pound appreciates before then. The average hedge rates noted on the slide are based on the forwards and the floors in the collars for 2018.","So we protected the downside below $1.30 but retained some upside potential above the rates shown on the slide. We've also provided updated sensitivities which show there is more upside potential for 2018 than downside risk, given the collars. But the rule of thumb of a $0.01 movement in the FX rate equaling a $0.01 movement in EPS still applies for a fully open year like 2019.","Moving to slide 20, on this slide our updated forecast assumptions are shown for RPI, again using the July HM Treasury forecast of the U.K. economy. The rates for 2017, 2018 and 2019 have been incorporated into our updated revenue projection. As a result, the RPI sensitivity for 0.5% movement is now off our updated forecast and would increase or decrease earnings by $0.02 in 2018.","I know that was a lot of information, so let me just recap. We felt the most appropriate course of action in light of Brexit was to, one, monetize the large mark-to-market value of the hedges, which enables us to preserve our dividend grow strategy for the PPL dividend; two, update our business plan to assume $1.30 per pound FX rate for all open positions, thus rebasing our earnings projections for 2017 forward; three, provide a very clear path for earnings growth beyond 2017 through the end of the decade based on the underlying growth of both the U.S. and the U.K. businesses; and four, optimize our strategy of U.K. cash distributions back to the U.S. by lowering the amount of distributions to the minimum required, capturing the tax rate differential between the U.S. and the U.K., and preserving our tax-efficient cash repatriation strategy for significantly longer. An added benefit of this approach is that if the pound or RPI increases over time, that will be upside to the new EPS forecast and growth rates we just provided.","That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Vince. Before we take your questions, let me just say that we had another strong quarter, and we remain confident on our plans for future growth. I believe today's actions are very important because they provide clarity and transparency in our response to the U.K.'s decision to exit the EU.","By providing longer-term earnings expectations, our actions also illustrate the confidence we have in the strong business fundamentals of our seven high-performing utilities. It was clear to us that the volatility in our stock was correlated to changes in the pound, and the benefits of our financial hedges were not being reflected in our valuation.","By monetizing those hedges, we have not only helped to secure our dividend growth objectives, but our earnings growth is also now clarified on a foreign currency basis that is more reflective of the current market. Clearly, Brexit was a unique event, but our positive view of the U.K. business model remains unchanged. PPL's senior management team is committed to delivering 5% to 6% annual earnings growth through 2020.","The premium utility jurisdictions in which we operate provide us with confidence in our ability to deliver this growth. We will continue to build on this foundation, seeking additional ways to provide value to share owners and our customers.","With that, operator, let's open the call to questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from Greg Gordon at Evercore ISI. Mr. Gordon?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Oh. Hi. Good morning. Sorry about that. So, absolutely the right decision to reset the currency hedges from my perspective. I just have one clarifying question and I thought your presentation was pretty clear, but when you look at the balance sheets of the U.K. versus the U.S. entities, presumably before you were going to be leveraging up a little bit in the U.K. in order to repatriate that cash. Now, you're going to have a higher equity capitalization in the U.K.","But where on the U.S. corporate structure are you going to be issuing the incremental leverage, and how does that change in the capital structure in the U.K. flow through the U.K. earnings? Essentially because you have an eight-year deal, the real cost of capital will essentially now be slightly different than the prior projected cost of capital. I'm sorry I'm asking a belabored question, but I just want a little more details on how to bridge the cash flow.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. No, I understand. So, just a couple of comments and then I'll turn it over to Vince. So, yeah, you're absolutely right. So the capitalization program for the U.K. is going to be different. So, as you recall in the past, we were looking at leverage at the U.K. holding company over time approaching 80% to 85%. That's more likely now to be down around the 75% level. That's going to give us about $1 billion, roughly, of headroom, if you will, for future investments from the U.K. once the exchange rates settle out and we look at the financial strategy for the U.K. going forward. So that's one \u2013 clearly one piece of it. Maybe, Vince, you can take the other elements of the question.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, and I'll just follow up on that. So that borrowing, generally, Greg, was up at the WPD holding company level, so it wasn't part of the rate-making within the U.K. It did help drive the higher ROEs at the segment level because the debt was up at the holding company level, but it doesn't really impact the revenue projections within the U.K. And then the U.S. entity would be PPL Capital Funding would be the one that's issuing that debt to replace the lower amounts coming back.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. And then my second to last question, when I think about post-2017 total earnings growth, the aspiration is 5% to 6%. I know you're through sort of the big reset years in the U.K. under the new rate scheme in terms of having the incentives come down, having to reset and you want to have the incentives come down as you transition, and I see the rate base growth profile in the U.S. Based on your current assumptions and understanding things could change a lot as we move forward in time, do you expect that the earnings growth path to be somewhat linear inside that 5% to 6% growth path or are there like sort of chunky CapEx rate base rate-making assumptions we have to think about between 2017 and 2020?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, good question, Greg. No, we expect it to be relatively linear or consistent year-over-year and not lumpy or chunky over that 2017 to 2020 timeframe.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you, guys.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thank you, Greg.","Operator","The next question is from Jonathan Arnold at Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Two things. I think I heard you mention that you'd changed the \u2013 you'd adjusted the pension to expectation of lower for longer with the guidance reset. So can I just clarify? Does that mean you've put the pension assumption where rates are currently into 2017?","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. This is Vince, yes. We're assuming a below-4% discount rate in both the U.S. and the U.K., and actually our 2017 U.K. discount rate is even below 3%.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you for that. And then just can I \u2013 also on hedging strategy going forward, you're obviously 50% covered on 2018 with this kind of upward \u2013 upside bias and the way you've done it. How should we think about your willingness to keep currency open as we move forward? And are you likely to \u2013 is this kind of 50% of this effectively third year where you would expect to be, say, on 2019 by this time next year or are you kind of ahead of where you'd expect to be, some feel for how you'll do this going forward?","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, Jonathan. I think it would be fairly consistent with the approach that we've taken in the past where we would certainly be highly hedged for the upcoming period in which we give specific guidance. So, in this case, it was 2017, so we thought it was appropriate even though we issued guidance a little bit early to go ahead and hedge that up a little bit further than we normally would at this point.","So looking at 2018, we would begin hedging in or looking to hedge in the rest of 2018 sometime beginning next year, and then probably start to layer in some 2019 hedges next year as well. And we'd probably look to, depending on the volatility in the currency rate and other market conditions, we may look to do something similar with collars like we've done here to either preserve some of the upside and protect the downside or to lock in something above our plan. So to the extent that we can improve upon the growth rate by hedging in at numbers stronger than the plan, that would obviously be something we'd look closely at doing.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. So we should think of you as being a little ahead of what the typical plan will be at this point.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. A little bit, yes.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure.","Operator","The next question is from Gregg Orrill at Barclays.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Gregg.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you. Just, again, your thoughts on how you're doing with the U.K. incentive scheme there and program and if there was any notable change outside of FX for your assumptions.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We're very happy with the performance. Obviously, we've got one full year behind us. We're into the second year, which started April 1, 2016. So I think the team in the U.K. is doing a great job. And I'll let Robert Symons, the CEO of our U.K. business, comment on kind of expectations going forward and what we've built into the plan here.","Robert A. Symons - Chief Executive Officer, Western Power Distribution, PPL Corp.","Yes. Thanks, Bill. Very much on track in the same way as we were last year. If we have storms, then \u2013 if they're of sufficient size, then they're excluded from the numbers. So our ongoing numbers are looking very similar to the previous year. So really no worries where that's concerned at the moment.","In terms of what are we doing, we increase all the time. We're increasing the level of automation. I'm looking at new ways in terms of getting those numbers better year-on-year.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Robert.","Robert A. Symons - Chief Executive Officer, Western Power Distribution, PPL Corp.","One thing that has happened is that we've came top of the pops in terms of social responsibility and time to connect. There are some incentive to actually measure how well companies were doing in terms of how they treat vulnerable customers and also a hot topic in the U.K. is the time taken to connect, and we've come out with the top incentive payment in both those two areas.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. So, Gregg, I would just say that the amount received for those two incentives was significantly higher than what we had originally expected. And so, we did update the incentives for that as well. It's about $10 million, $12 million or so.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Lapides at Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Just looking at the bridge for 2016 versus 2017 guidance, and one of the things that stands out a little bit is the U.K., not the currency side, but, honestly, the fact that your expectation that D&A and taxes other than income taxes, interest, will all offset any revenue change. Just curious, do you view that $0.04 headwind in the U.K. as kind of a one-off deal in 2017; and then beginning in 2018, you'll get earnings growth out of the U.K.? And also, can you talk about expectations for O&M, just local currency, not currency-adjusted, in the U.K. in 2017 and beyond?","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. So, on the revenue and the offsets on depreciation interest, some of that is a one-time transition or specifically limited to 2017. So yes, that's a little bit of an anomaly in terms of that transition, 2016 to 2017.","Relative to O&M, really I don't think there's any change expected in O&M. Much of the work that Robert and his team are doing is very predictable and very kind of standard blocking and tackling type work, so no expectation there. As I know you can appreciate, Michael, the RPI could be an uplift to us because that retail price index is expected to probably go higher as the economy in the U.K. is under some pressure. So that's a potential upside to the plan should it go beyond what we have assumed today. So other than that \u2013 and our revenues would be adjusted for that \u2013 really no other impacts on the negative side.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's really the last leg of the drop in the incentives that's driving this. And then we get through that in 2017 and you see the growth going forward.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. So in 2018, how much would you like \u2013 I'm just trying to think about growth in the U.K., because we kind of know based on the Ofgem data what's supposed to happen on the D&A and taxes other than income taxes side. How much revenue growth on a cents per share basis do you expect like in 2018 and beyond on an annualized basis? Like what's in your guidance to that?","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","You're longer term \u2013 your multi-year guidance?","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. On the top line, I don't have that handy, Michael. But I would say that just like the 5% to 6% growth is relatively levelized or linear, so is the U.K.'s growth, their 4% to 6% that we provided. So we would expect on a net income basis relatively consistent growth starting in 2018 off of 2017 and through the rest of the guidance period we provided.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay, guys. I'll follow up offline. Thank you.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. No problem.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Patterson at Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning. Can you hear me?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just a philosophical question, I guess. I mean, if you're basically canceling out your hedge and taking the money, why re-hedge, I guess? Do you follow me? I mean, if you could just sort of like \u2013 is it just because of near-term volatility and the idea that investors want some protection in that versus being way out of the money? If you could just elaborate a little bit on that, I'd like that.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. That's a good question. So we thought that the opportunity to cash out the hedges would allow us to provide that certainty on the dividend growth rate of 4% that we noted we are committing to or at least targeting, I should say, for the 2017 to 2020 period.","So that was one of the real values of that. Plus it helps to offset from a cash perspective the lower amount that we would be repatriating back from the U.K. in light of the lower exchange rates. So, philosophically that was kind of how we looked at it. Vince, do you want to provide any additional color to that? But I think those are two of the main elements.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. I think as we've also \u2013 when we come out and kind of reset our earnings, we wanted to make sure we had a strong degree of confidence in those earnings that we were coming out within the growth rates that we've provided. As we talk with economists in the U.K., banks \u2013 a number of banks, both in the U.K. and here in the U.S. \u2013 I think there was some view that in the back half of 2016, there could be some additional pressure on the pound. I think the consensus estimate for the back half of 2016 is about $1.28, but I think there are some that show $1.20 to $1.30. And then in 2017, I would say consensus is kind of in that $1.30 to $1.35 range.","Coincidentally, the collars that we put on basically give us an effective collar of $1.30 to $1.36, so right in line kind of with consensus estimates for the pound over the next, say, year and a half. So I think from our perspective, it was a win-win; we got to take the cash. It's also the reason why we didn't take off the 2016 hedges. That's supporting our $2.35 guidance that we reaffirmed today. Plus, again, if the bias is for the pound to go down a little bit more in the short term, those hedges will be more in the money. So I think as we just took the whole position and thought about it holistically, it made sense to put the hedges back on at the current market.","Also, I think when you look at the hedge program and the way the stock trades in normal, say, FX conditions, I think the hedges work very well and we do get the credit for the hedges, except for these (42:45) extreme cases where we tend to trade on a fully open basis, and if $1.30 is the new norm, we would expect and I think investors would expect us to re-hedge.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And then, just \u2013 other than on this tax differential, other than the borrowings that you're talking about, like increasing them in the U.S. versus the U.K., are there any other strategies that you guys might be thinking that could further optimize that in terms of cost shifting or there's some derivative things that could theoretically take place.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I wouldn't think that there'd be anything of a significant or material amount. I think we'll continue to look to tweak the strategy and look for other optimization. But I think, at the moment, I can't envision something that would be very significant. But we'll continue to look at it.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. I mean, the real thing we're looking at is the after-tax cost of borrowing. And so, obviously, the interest rates play into that as well. But interest rates are fairly consistent between the two countries, and it really, at least right now, boils down to the tax effects of those \u2013 of that interest expense. But that's something we'll continue to monitor.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","The next question is from Anthony Crowdell at Jefferies.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Guys, my question has been answered. Thank you.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. You're welcome.","Operator","The next question is from Steve Fleishman at Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. A couple of quick questions. First, on the \u2013 just to clarify a prior answer on the incentives, if you exclude currency and the like, what \u2013 how much have the incentives gone up, I guess, on a non-currency basis from your last guidance?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So as Vince said, on a dollar basis, about $10 million to $12 million.","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. That's the social responsibility. Did we raise it above that?","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Sorry if I missed that.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. That's okay. So, Steve, it would be $10 million to $12 million.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just in terms of your kind of overall rate base growth plan through 2020, are there some \u2013 I recall you in the past talking about some projects or opportunities, maybe, that could be added to rate base growth over time. Are there some things in the hopper that are not included in this plan to 2020 right now?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We do have on our transmission group several projects we're pursuing. The one that we have talked about in the past is Compass. That's a very large \u2013 if you looked at all the phases, $3 billion to $5 billion potential project. The first phase, which is Western Pennsylvania into New York, would still be material.","But most of those, Steve, would be pretty late in this decade into the next decade, so no real significant spending on those bigger projects until probably you get out to 2019, 2020, and even then it would probably be a slow build, and then really more significant in the 2021-2022 timeframe. But we continue to look at some competitive transmission projects both within PJM and outside of PJM, none of which are embedded in our guidance at all, so those projects would all be upside to the plan.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just curious, just are the rating agencies kind of comfortable with your updated U.K. distribution plan, issuing debt at the parent, to cash from the hedges, all that? I'm just curious kind of their reaction to it, if at all?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. So, when the impact of the pound was evident, we did have conversations with the rating agencies, and their initial report was to maintain the ratings with a stable outlook. And our commitment, obviously, as I stated earlier, to maintaining the investment-grade credit ratings is solid, so we wouldn't expect any significant change.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then one last question just strategically. Obviously, this is a bit of a freak event, but I'm curious, Bill, either you or the board, how does this kind of maybe color your view on wanting to strategically get more domestically oriented in terms of mix of earnings, if at all?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, because it is such a unique event, it really doesn't change the view that we have about the strengths of the U.K. business mode, so we're not going to, obviously, overreact to any event like this. So, yeah, it really doesn't change our view of the business mix. As we stated before, to the extent that we would engage in M&A, clearly, we would probably look more significantly at domestic opportunities than we would opportunities in the U.K. But having said that, there are no plans to change the mix at this time.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","The next question is from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Just \u2013 most of my questions were answered. But on domestic growth, it looks like utility growth is slightly down. I'm having trouble finding out, is that just a function of rolling forward to 2019 and 2020 versus your prior plan, or is the CapEx sort of leveling off in 2019 and 2020?","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think it's a combination of the different time frames. So before we were looking at the 2014 to 2018 period, the 24 (49:01) was kind of an adjusted number that we were growing off of. So we've re-based now on the 2017 guidance that we just provided through 2020, so that's probably the biggest driver is just that time period and extending, as you point out, extending it through 2019 and 2020 so \u2013 which, as I mentioned earlier, even though we've got a slightly lower growth rate, we would expect that to be fairly ratable over the years 2017 through 2020, so no real lumpiness to it. Vince?","Vincent Sorgi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, Shar, I would say there's probably two main points in driving the delta. One, as you may recall, we had about that $100 million of corporate restructuring in the 2014 to 2018 growth rate. That's obviously not in the 2017 to 2020 growth rate. And then we were also transitioning in Kentucky from a historical test year to a forward test year back then. Now, we're all on future test years and so you don't get that bump in the initial growth rate that we had back in the 2014 to 2018 period.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. And then just one real last question here on WPD. I know we've historically talked about the business will naturally dilute itself as U.S. utilities grow. But now, it looks like U.K. and U.S. more or less growth almost similar, maybe the U.S. growth a little bit more. I just want to reinforce, Bill, like the board is still comfortable with the WPD business despite this discount continuing.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, they are. I think we, again, have great confidence in the underlying fundamentals of that business and like all the attributes of the regulatory construct there that provides us recovery of and on capital as we deploy it. So I think the very positive attributes of that business really offset, to a degree, any type of downside we see. And again, we believe the Brexit was a unique event and we don't anticipate events like that coming along again in the future. But we are, yes, comfortable and the board is comfortable with the business model.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Excellent. Thanks.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to William Spence for closing remarks.","William H. Spence - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. I'd just like to thank everyone for joining us today. As I mentioned, we believe that the steps we took today were absolutely the right ones for share owners and we look forward to executing on our new plans for 2020 and appreciate the support of share owners as we go forward. Thank you very much.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."]}}
