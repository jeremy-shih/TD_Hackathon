Kratcoski - Snap-On, Inc.","[audiogap] (00:26 \u2013 00:39)","and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.

Nick?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. I'll start with the highlights of our fourth quarter and of our year and I'll give you my perspective on the results, on the environment and on our progress. After that, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.","The Snap-on fourth quarter, sales increases and broad profit gains marking another period of encouraging performance; again this quarter we had opportunities and we had headwinds. We took advantage of those opportunities and we overcame the headwinds.","Overall sales in the quarter were $889.8 million, 4.5% higher than last year. That total included acquisition related volume from Car-O-Liner and Sturtevant Richmont and it also included the impact of $15.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency. Our organic growth in the quarter was 3.6% with gains registered across every group. EPS, it was $2.47, up 11.3% from the $2.22 registered in 2015.","Our OpCo operating margin reached 19.8%, an increase of 70 basis points and those profits include $3.7 million of adverse foreign currency. Financial services earnings of 51.6% (sic) [$51.6 million] (3:27) were also up, leading to a consolidated operating margin including both financial services and OpCo of 23.6%, an improvement of 90 basis points in the quarter. And our markets, well the Automotive Repair segment continues to remain favorable, changing technology, the aging vehicles requiring new tools and more repairs. Our Tools Group \u2013 progress in all geographies, gains throughout the franchise network and the repair systems and information, our RS&I Group, advancements across our businesses serving repair shops, owners and managers. All of them.","Taken together these businesses confirm the ongoing strength of the repair market, and clearly demonstrate the opportunity available. Now for our Commercial & Industrial Group, or C&I, the markets were mixed but overall positive. There were of course headwinds and some still recovering industrial sectors and a few macro-economically challenged geographies but in total, progress was across that group.","U.S. military sales were robust. Budgets restraints loosened, and we are on point to take advantage. And we're ready to act in the future as further opportunities arise in that area. C&I's also the most international of our businesses. And in the period, our overall activity in the regions outside the U.S. increased, overcoming the economic turbulence that exists in Europe, the Middle East, and in some parts of Asia. So across the corporation, I would characterize our environment as mixed but positive, with ongoing strength in automotive repair and some improvement in the afflicted critical industries and the challenged geographies. And we remain confident that our businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on the possibilities, on the opportunities that do exist along our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding our presence with repair shop owners and managers, extending in critical industries, and building in emerging markets.","In looking ahead, we also see clear runways for further improvement. The Snap-on Value Creation Processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement in RCI is continuing to drive significant advantages. Our fourth quarter and our full year results clearly confirm that progress. And our new acquisitions, they provide more opportunity to apply those processes and create value.","Now for the full year, sales were $3.43 billion, an as reported increase of 2.3%. The organic volume gain was 2.9%, with the Tools Group up 5.6%, RS&I rising 4.7%, and C&I slightly ahead of last year. Our EPS in 2016 was $9.20, an increase of 13.6%. And driving those earnings was an OpCo operating margin of 19.1%, up 140 basis points for the full year. And when we include the income from financial services of $198.7 million, which rose $28.5 million, the consolidated operating margin for the corporation was 23%, up 170 basis points. Results achieved by taking advantage of the opportunities on our runways for growth, and by driving down our runways for improvement.","Now let's move to the groups in our fourth quarter. In C&I, sales increased 1.6% from 2015, impacted by $6.2 million of unfavorable currency and helped by $4.2 million in acquisition related volume. Organic sales were up 2.4%, the second straight quarter of increases for C&I but with varied results across the group including gains by SNA Europe and by industrial, and decreases in the power tools and in places like India and Indonesia. C&I operating income was $43.9 million. That represents an operating margin of 15.3%, a rise of 40 basis points. That's our second quarter of 15%s.","Encouragingly SNA Europe again posted increased organic sales, up high single-digits, continuing its progress. Now 13 quarters in a row of year-over-year growth. And the profit climb for SNA Europe was even steeper, now up 15 straight quarters. Snap-on Value Creation at work with innovative new products, and improved new processes creating those extended trends in some what I would call fairly challenging geographies.","Also in C&I our Industrial division moved forward. As I mentioned before, on strong U.S. military sales, and also an array of new products. New products like \u2013 innovations like our radiator cap removal for the railroad sector, a specially designed offering used on locomotive or engine radiator caps replacing field cobble sockets, which were prone to early failure. The Snap-on solution incorporates deep machine grooves which provides the ample engagement and the strength necessary to remove what you might imagine are those very stubborn railroad caps. The new adapter can be paired with a standard ratchet, eliminating the need for the previously used long T-handled tool and therefore requiring less clearance to perform the task, making the job easier in those tight engine quarters. Another productivity solution born from a long list of customer connection made every day, this one for the rail industry.","And for the Aviation segment, our Industrial division launched the Versatorq 2, torque data acquisition system, designed to verify and record torque ratings in tight and even hazardous environments. Places like aircraft fuel lines, the Versatorq 2 allows easy torque measurement deep inside air frames, where access is difficult and it includes an explosive-proof electronics making it safe, even in combustible environments. This unique Snap-on offering enables the technicians to record critical information, storing and recalling up to 3,500 torque readings. And the product is UL compliant for safety, and ATECH certified for use in potentially explosive atmospheres. And based on that, we believe we have a clear winner in the Versatorq.","Our Power Tools division recorded lower sales in the quarter, as I said. That said, it did launch some promising new product. Product like our CTR714, a 14.4 volt quarter-inch drive cordless ratchet. It was launched in December so it didn't drive the quarter, but it has a great future. This latest tool in the Snap-on cordless family includes a tapered head designed for better accessibility, 35 foot pounds of torque output, perfect for applications with fasteners 10 millimeters or smaller that are delicate and difficult, a variable speed trigger for that all important control with those small fasteners, a built-in LED light to illuminate any work area, and new drive materials for increased strength, size, power and durability. Terrific for small fasteners in tight spaces, because of that, because of the size, power and durability and the applicability to tight spaces for small fasteners, we believe we have another best-in-class product with our cordless ratchet. Well, that's C&I.","Now on to the Tools Group. A 3% rise in organic sales. Operating earnings of $73.5 million; a margin rate of 17.6%, up 10 basis points, a gain which includes 70 basis points impact from negative currency. So overcoming that fairly significant negative currency hit.","Now, the volume growth in the Tools Group was not what we've seen in recent periods. The full year average for the group is 5.6%. But importantly, based on what we see in the shops, and what we hear from our franchisees, we don't believe there's been any significant change in the overall auto repair market. It's still robust, and offers abundant opportunity and we don't believe there's been any change in the positive trajectory of the Tools Group growing strength. We often speak of our Snap-on's runways for coherent growth, strategic avenues of sales opportunities. At the top of the list is enhancing the franchise channel, and we believe we're positioned to continue that positive trajectory.","Throughout the year and even in the recent quarter, the Tools Group demonstrated significant progress along that runway, financials trending positively, the franchisee health metrics consistently gaining, both clearly representing a strengthening vehicle repair center, and an improved proposition for our franchisees.","Beyond the numbers, there's a great deal of optimism throughout the network. You can see if you talk to these people. The franchisees attending our 2017 kick-off events held early last month all over the country, display a great deal of enthusiasm about the vehicle repair sector in general, and about their individual businesses in particular. I participated in the kick-off and I believe the level of excitement and confidence surrounding the van channel is stronger than ever. And our optimism was acknowledged by multiple publications, listing Snap-on as a franchise of choice.","Again this year, Snap-on was ranked among the top 50 in Entrepreneur's magazine's list of top 500 franchises, finishing number one in the professional tools and equipment category, and the Franchise Business Review which collects franchisee feedback, satisfaction feedback, franchisee satisfaction feedback listed Snap-on as a top 50 franchise, marking the tenth consecutive year we've received that reward.","Finally, and my favorite, the Military Times included Snap-on in its Best for Vets annual ranking, coming in at number five, and representing the only mobile tool franchise on the list. Now this type of recognition would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of innovative new product, many developed from insights from our customers, guided by Snap-on customer connection and invested with Snap-on technical insight and innovation. And in 2016, for the seventh straight year, the Tools Group increased its number of hit products. Those million dollar sellers developed from direct observations gained in the field.","Take for instance the ATECH 300 electronic torque wrench. Launched in the fourth quarter, this latest torque offering solves an important customer problem. Many light vehicles today, pickups and SUVs, now use fasteners requiring between 250 foot pounds and 300 foot pounds of torque, and specifications for accurate measurements of those higher torques are increasing in number.","The Snap-on ATECH 300 is the first light vehicle half-inch electronic torque wrench to rate at 300 foot pounds. It's lighter, more accurate, and it eliminates the need to add heavy duty tools just to accommodate the new pickup and SUV torque requirements. Designed and manufactured in our City of Industry facility in California, the ATECH 300 incorporates the same great features as our other ATECH models-a reduced profile for better accessibility, a longer handle for easily applying the extra torque, power interruption technology to prevent power resets and protect the data, and a large LCD screen for greater visibility. Franchisee feedback? Well, we launched it late in the year and it's selling out.","We said, I think in many forms including this one that there's growing opportunity in vehicle precision, in torque measurement. As vehicles become more automatic, there's more need for more precision. Even in the fourth quarter we saw confirmation in that trend. Our torque line grew nicely; it's one of the reasons why we acquired the torque skills of Sturtevant Richmont and we expect good things going forward in that growing product line.","Now let's move to RS&I. Volume in the fourth quarter was $319.8 million with an organic rise of 8.9%, significant gains in diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, a mid single-digit increase to OEM dealerships and a low single-digit rise of undercar equipment. Operating earnings of $82.5 million increased $10.4 million to 25.8% of sales, up 10 basis points, overwhelming, overcoming the impact of the newly acquired operations.","RS&I expanded across the repair shop owner and manager sector, across the full sector, but particularly with independents. Our diagnostics and repair information businesses recorded double-digit volume growth with those important customers. Our Mitchell 1 operations offers independent shops leading facility management software, innovative marketing services, and the most comprehensive repair information anywhere.","Using the Snap-on Value Creation principles of customer connection and innovation, our Mitchell 1 team utilizes thousands of customer contacts every year, adding repair information for new vehicles, improving the speed to solution of its pro-demand product, and expanding the literally hundreds of millions of actual repair events in its unique sure-track big database, and in the fourth quarter the RS&I results clearly show the effect of the Mitchell 1 progress.","Now for our diagnostics division, another encouraging quarter, led by ongoing success of recent product launches. We mentioned a couple of these in the third quarter: the MODIS Edge, handheld scanner, very sophisticated handheld scanner, and our thermal imager. A whole new category of vehicle diagnostics will both continue to exceed expectations, and both drove the diagnostic division to strong double-digit gains.","RS&I also advanced its work station product line in the quarter, introducing the new EPIQ diagnostic work station. The EPIQ work station combines two of Snap-on's top of the line products, matching our sophisticated VERUS handheld with our EPIQ tool storage box into one custom platform. This enhanced work station is targeted for shops desiring capability. This combo will address the most challenging repairs. Convenience, everything a technician needs is right at hand. And confidence: the visible presence of the work station tells the customer that this shop is serious and sophisticated and able to tackle the most difficult of repairs. Work station sales are up nearly 40% year-over-year, and the new EPIQ combo is part of that success.","The RS&I Group also includes progress with OEM dealerships. Over the years Snap-on Business Solutions, SBS, has developed an extraordinary level of insight and capability in developing and running electronic parts catalogs for dealerships. And their skills paid off in the quarter. As SBS captured the contract to provide a state of the art EPC for another major vehicle OEM, another win, and more growth for Snap-on in the OEM space.","Finally in the period, the RS&I equipment division registered a low single-digit organic increase with mixed results across our North American and International Undercar operations. That said, we keep driving to expand our position with repair shops, with new products to sell and with strategic and coherent acquisitions.","And in the fourth quarter, RS&I made an important addition to the equipment division with the acquisition of Car-O-Liner. The Car-O-Liner business brings greater capabilities in collision repair and strengthens our overall position in the heavy-duty segment. Given the trends in the collision space, the higher emphasis on shop efficiency and the power of matching Car-O-Liner with our other RS&I divisions, we believe this acquisition will create even more opportunities to expand with repair shop owners and managers going forward. We're excited.","Well, that's our fourth quarter. OpCo organic sales growing 3.6%; EPS $2.47 in the quarter, up 13.6%. Progress along each of our runways for coherent growth, progress along those runways for coherent growth and acquisitions that will give us more to sell and make those runways even wider, and clear advancements down our runways for improvements, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, and Rapid Continuous Improvement driving a 19.8% operating margin, 70 basis points higher than last year. It was an encouraging quarter.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo.","Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.","Thanks, Nick. Our fourth quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $889.8 million in the quarter increased $38.1 million, or 4.5% from 2015 levels, reflecting a $30 million, or 3.6% organic sales gain, $23.3 million of acquisition related sales, and $15.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q4 sales comparisons by 190 basis points. The organic sales gain reflects continued progress in serving the vehicle repair sector, as well as its sales improvements in our Commercial & Industrial segment.","Consolidated gross margin of 49.9% improved 150 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to sales leverage and savings from RCI initiatives.","Operating expenses of $267.8 million yielded an operating expense margin of 30.1% in the quarter, an increase of 80 basis points, primarily due to higher acquisition related and other expenses including operating expenses for Car-O-Liner and Sturtevant Richmont, which were both acquired in the fourth quarter, as well as a 30 basis point benefit in the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily from a gain on sale of a former manufacturing facility.","As a result of these factors, operating earnings before financial services of $176.1 million, including $3.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 8.5% and as a percentage of sales, improved 70 basis points to 19.8%.","Financial services revenue of $74.2 million in the quarter increased 17.6% from 2015 levels, and operating earnings of $51.6 million, including $0.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased 14.7%.","Consolidated operating earnings of $227.7 million, including $4.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased 9.8%, and the operating margin of 23.6% improved 90 basis points from 22.7% a year ago.","Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 30.8% compared to 31.1% last year. For the full year, our 2016 effective income tax rate of 31% compared to 31.7% last year.","Finally, fourth quarter net earnings of $146.3 million, or $2.47 per diluted share increased $14.9 million, or $0.25 per share from 2015 levels, representing an 11.3% increase in diluted earnings per share. For the full year 2016, earnings per diluted share of $9.20 increased 13.6% as compared to $8.10 in 2015.","Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group on slide 7. Sales of $286.3 million in the fourth quarter increased $4.5 million, or 1.6%, reflecting a $6.5 million, or 2.4% organic sales gain, $4.2 million of acquisition-related sales, and $6.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The $6.5 million organic sales increase primarily includes a high single-digit gain in the segment's European-based hand tools business, and a low single-digit increase to customers in critical industries, largely as a result of higher sales to the military.","During the quarter, our European-based hand tools business benefited from broad-based sales growth with particular strength in countries including Sweden, Spain, and France. These organic sales gains were partially offset by a mid single-digit decline in the segment's power tools operations and lower sales in certain emerging markets.","Gross profit in the C&I Group of $115.4 million compared to $107.6 million last year. The gross margin of 40.3% improved 210 basis points, primarily due to benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives, and 100 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $71.5 million in the quarter compared to $65.7 million last year. The operating expense margin of 25% increased 170 basis points primarily as a result of higher cost, including operating expenses for new acquisitions, 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, and a 70 basis point benefit in the fourth quarter of 2015 from a gain on sale of a former manufacturing facility.","As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $43.9 million including $1.8 million of favorable foreign currency effects increased $2 million from 2015 levels, and the operating margin of 15.3% improved 40 basis points.","Turning now to slide 8. Fourth quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $417.5 million increased $6.3 million, or 1.5%, reflecting a $12.2 million, or 3% organic sales gain and $5.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. $12.2 million organic sales increase includes a low single-digit gain in the company's U.S. franchise operations, and a mid single-digit gain in the company's International franchise operations.","Gross profit of $175.5 million compared to $173.7 million last year. Gross margin of 42% declined 20 basis points, as 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects were partially offset by benefits from higher sales.","Operating expenses of $102 million in the quarter were essentially flat compared to last year. The operating expense margin of 24.4% improved 30 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage.","As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $73.5 million including $3.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $1.6 million, and the operating margin of 17.6% improved 10 basis points.","Turning to the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group, shown on slide 9. Fourth quarter sales of $319.8 million increased $39.2 million, or 14%, reflecting a $24.6 million, or 8.9%, organic sales gain. $19.1 million of acquisition related sales, and $4.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The 8.9% organic sales increase primarily reflects a double-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, a mid single-digit increase in sales to OEM dealerships, and a low single-digit gain in sales of undercar equipment.","Gross profit of $153 million compared to $131 million last year. And the gross margin of 47.8% improved 110 basis points, primarily due to benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives.","Operating expenses of $70.5 million in the quarter compared to $58.9 million last year. The operating expense margin of 22% increased 100 basis points, primarily due to a 90 basis point impact from the Car-O-Liner acquisition.","Fourth quarter operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $82.5 million, including $1.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $10.4 million from prior year levels, and the operating margin of 25.8% improved 10 basis points.","Now, turning to slide 10. Operating earnings from financial services of $51.6 million on revenue of $74.2 million compared to operating earnings of $45 million on revenue of $63.1 million last year. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses of 1.3% in the quarter compared with 1.2% last year.","The average yield on finance receivables of 18.2% in the quarter compared to 17.8% last year, and the average yield on contract receivables of 9.3% compared to 9.5% last year. Originations of $260.3 million in the quarter increased 3.3% from prior year levels.","Moving to slide 11. Our year-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.8 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.6 billion from our U.S. operations. Approximately 81% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. In 2016, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew $224 million, or 14.1%. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continued to be in line with our expectations, including a seasonal rise in delinquencies.","In this fourth quarter, we experienced a slightly higher seasonal increase in delinquencies and the allowance was increased accordingly. Overall, profitability in the financial services segment rose by 14.7% in the quarter, reflecting both continued growth of the overall portfolio and higher average yields on finance receivables.","Now turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $151.7 million in the quarter increased $7.3 million from comparable 2015 levels as higher net earnings were partially offset by net changes in operating asset and liabilities, including $20 million of discretionary U.S. pension contributions. Net cash used by investing activities of $229.3 million included $160.4 million for the combined acquisitions of Car-O-Liner and Sturtevant Richmont, $53.6 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables, and $17.7 million of capital expenditures. For the full year, capital expenditures totaled $74.3 million.","Turning to slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $36.3 million from 2015 year-end levels, reflecting higher sales, $21.5 million of receivables related to acquisitions and an increase in days sales outstanding from 60 days at 2015 year-end to 63 days at 2016 year-end partially offset by $13.8 million of foreign currency translation. Excluding acquisitions, days sales outstanding was 61 days.","Inventories increased $32.7 million from 2015 year-end levels primarily support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions and $21.5 million of inventories related to acquisitions, partially offset by $17.8 million of foreign currency translation. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.3 compared with 3.5 turns at 2015 year-end. Excluding acquisitions, inventory turns were 3.4.","Our year-end cash position of $77.6 million decreased $15.2 million from 2015 year-end levels. The net decrease reflects the funding of $915 million of new finance receivables, acquisitions of $160.4 million, dividend payments of $147.5 million, the repurchase of 758,000 shares for $120.4 million, and $74.3 million for capital expenditures. These cash decreases were largely offset by $671.7 million of cash collections from finance receivables, $567.3 million of cash from operations and $134.2 million of proceeds from a net increase in notes payable and other short-term borrowings.","Our net debt to capital ratio of 26.3% compared with 24.6% at 2015 year-end.","In addition to our $77.6 million of cash, and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets.","As of 2016 year-end we had $130 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Since year-end, on January 17 we repaid $150 million of 5.5% senior notes at maturity with available cash and commercial paper.","That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2017. We anticipate that capital expenditures in 2017 will be in a range of $80 million to $90 million. We also expect that our full-year 2017 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our 2016 full-year rate of 31%. This assumes no major changes in existing U.S. federal regulations \u2013 tax regulations. Should there be definitive legislation on corporate tax reform, we will assess the effects of such at that time.","With that, I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Thanks, Aldo. Well, you heard about our year and our fourth quarter. I believe they represent continuing confirmation of the opportunities along our runways for growth and testimony to the possibilities inherent in Snap-On value creation and our runways for improvement. C&I growing again in a very turbulent environment, finding the opportunities where they exist in critical industries, continuing the upward trend in Europe in difficult and uncertain economies, reaching an OI margin of 15.3%, one of its highest, up 40 basis points.","The Tools Group growing, not equal to recent periods, but still displaying the hallmarks of continuing achievement: a robust vehicle repair sector, positive franchisee health, strong product introductions, and a continuing enthusiasm across the franchisees and the customers. And through it all, profit growth, OI margin of 17.6%, up 10 basis points, despite a 70 basis-point headwind from unfavorable currency.","And RS&I, 8.9% organic growth, confirming the strength of vehicle repair, progress with independent shops and dealerships, exciting new products spearheading those advancements, and OI margins reaching 25.8%, up despite the impact of Car-O-Liner and its lower profit levels.","And the acquisitions, Car-O-Liner and Sturtevant Richmont adding more product fuel for growth and providing more opportunity for improvement. It all came together to bring our OpCo operating margin to 19.8%, up 70 basis points. And when you add Financial Services, the overall operating margin was 23.6%, up 90 basis points. It was an encouraging quarter and an encouraging year. And we believe we have the market and the position and the team to continue the trend of extended positive performance through 2017 and beyond.","Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I know, again, many of you are listening. The progress accomplished is a direct reflection of the capability and perseverance you contribute to our effort. For your achievements in the quarter and the year, you have my congratulations, and for your continuing commitment to our team, you have my thanks.","Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll take our first question from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC","Good morning, guys. It's David Kelley on for Bret this morning. Just a couple quick questions. And first on RS&I, strong organic growth in the quarter, Just want to drill down on the double-digit diagnostics growth you pointed out. Was there something specific to the quarter that drove the robust performance there, given some of the cadence of....","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Yes, there was.","David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC","Go ahead.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Yes, there was, there was. Look, the thing is, as we said, we launched two dynamite new products and actually the thermal imager for us is a whole new category of diagnosing a vehicle, not data driven but physically driven by looking at a vehicle. Like, for example, if you're looking for a bad cylinder, it's tough to tell from the electronic diagnostics, but you can tell if you focus the thermal imager on it and see which one is hot. That changed everything. That created a lot of volume in that situation, a lot of attention for diagnostics. And then the MODIS Edge was another extension of our already pretty robust line, but a pretty good tool. So those two really drove the business into that 8.9%.","Then you had the Mitchell 1 had its usual strong performance in terms of selling to shops. And then we had some comeback with dealerships, which can be lumpy. The lumpy side can be dealerships. But mostly, the story is new product.","David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC","Great. No, appreciate the color. And I guess given the favorable secular tailwind that should benefit that sector, how do we think about maybe longer-term organic growth opportunity in RS&I looking out over the next two to three years?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Well, we always say, look, it's 4% to 6%. That's what we're targeting in most environments. We expect RS&I to be in the middle of that, and the RS&I numbers in the last three years are 4.9%, 4.9%, 4.7%. But this particular one with these new products we feel pretty positive.","David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC","Okay, great. Thanks. And then one more from me and I'll pass it along. Just on the Tools growth, I was wondering if maybe you'd be able to give us a feel for cadence in the quarter. I was wondering if there was any pickup late in December or any uptick you've even seen in January year-to-date that's contributing to that confidence in a rebound in 2017 here.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","No. Look, okay, the Tools Group was not equal to its normal trend, but 3% isn't a poke in the eye with a stick in a 1.9% economy. So we still feel okay about that. But you could have reasonably expected more. But everything we look at, the enthusiasm of the market, the strength of our product, our franchisees, how they react, we feel pretty positive about that. So what I'm saying is, is that you look at those numbers and you may say, below trend but in anything you look at from a physical point of view or for a conversational point of view or seeing a product pipeline point of view, you feel confident.","David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC","Okay, great. Again, appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from David Leiker from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Morning.","Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.","Morning.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Guys, just as a follow-up on that last question on the Tools side, is there anything \u2013 obviously, that number is a lot weaker than what we've been seeing here for actually quite a while. Is there anything from a timing perspective or regional perspective or anything as you dig down inside there that could give us a little bit more color?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","No, I don't think so. The timing is not really \u2013 we have up weeks and down weeks. It's hard to make any interpretation in that, David. I think simply stated, I hate to use an analogy like this, but sometimes your clean-up hitter hits a single and a double and doesn't hit a homerun and you still win the game, and that's the way we see this quarter. I wouldn't use the word weaker 3%. I hate to use that word because I think it's a reasonable growth, but yeah, it is below trend and we are unsatisfied with that number.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I know you don't talk about numbers on a go-forward basis, but can you give us any sense of what our proper expectation should get zeroed in on as we look at 2017 for that business?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Well, we always say our growth is going to be in the 4% to 6% range, and that's the kind of thing we think of. And Tools Group grew at 5.6% in the last quarter \u2013 I mean last year, sorry, last year. And so I don't think we see anything to interrupt our trajectory, let's put it that way.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then the second item here is on the credit company. When you dig down into the credit stats, some of them at the margin are getting a little bit weaker I guess. The losses are up, the delinquencies, there's some seasonality there. The originations growth, which I'm sure is tied into the Tools number. But can you talk a little bit about what you're doing there? Your allowances you said you took up a little bit, but it looks like the losses are a little bit. Is this something that's just an adjustment, or do you think this is a start of a trend?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Well, I'll speak to the originations. Look, originations is in the Tools Group (44:02), it follows the Tools Group. And fundamentally in the quarter what you see is high growth in the diagnostics area. The diagnostics products were the hottest, in particular the thermal imager, which tends to be at the bottom end of the diagnostics range, we would still classify it as big ticket. But the origination, the credit penetration in that area of diagnostics tends to be lower. So you fundamentally look at the characteristics of the diagnostic sales and we shake our head and say, yes, lower administration, makes a lot of sense based on what we sold in the Tools Group.","And so that's kind of our view in that \u2013 and It's perfectly explainable in those kinds of situations and seeing what happens with the Tools Group. It's a lot less change next quarter because of the characteristics of what sells and what new products come out. In terms of the reserves, I'll let Aldo talk about that.","Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.","Well, David, if you look at the cash flow statement, you'll see that our provision, if you look year-over-year, it's up about $4.4 million, just to give you a little color on that. If you just still look at what I would call the normal sized growth in the portfolio, that would account for about a third of the provision. So you have, yes, two-thirds of extra growth in the provision relates to the delinquency and characteristics of the trends. So at the end of the quarter, we think the reserve's adjusted accordingly. It reflects that. And as we move forward, we're not alarmed by any of the statistics. These are within the range of deviation that we've seen over recent times, so we're comfortable.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I got a few emails this morning. There are some who are saying that that's a sign that the end market, that your customer is weakening, and that the credit company is the canary in the coal mine.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Well, we don't see the end market weakening, actually. That was the whole point of half of my script here. I don't think we see that to the extent that anything we see \u2013 I was just on a van the other day, two days ago, and it didn't seem that way. I was in the garages and those guys seemed pretty robust in their view of the world, talking about how they've had to turn away business, in fact. I know this is a windshield survey, but in terms of the kickoffs were three weeks ago. And we all go out all over the country and everybody came back saying, our guys are more pumped than ever before. So we don't see that, anyway. We don't see the end-market weakening at all.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then just one quick housekeeping question, Aldo, on the acquisitions. It looks like the revenue contribution there was more than just what you would think given the calendar and the timing of the acquisitions. Is there some seasonality in there that skewed that contribution?","Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.","There is a bit. If you look at the collision business itself, the fourth quarter tends to be one of their better quarters. We owned Car-O-Liner practically speaking for a full two months, Sturtevant Richmont to a lesser extent was really only about a little over about five-, six-week ownership period. But yes, the collision business does skew a bit to the fourth quarter.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. And thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David MacGregor at Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yes. Good morning, everyone. Just a question on the Tools segment. Can you just talk a little bit about the growth you saw in big ticket versus smaller ticket business?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","I think ticket was up, but it was \u2013 when we say that big ticket you can classify it into three pieces or three general pieces, David. You've got the tool storage boxes, right. They're the biggest of the big ticket, and almost all of them get financed. And then you've got diagnostics that goes through a range. And then you have some other dribs and drabs, like we'll sell welders and things like that, but that is not a big ticket item. Big ticket grew faster in Tools Group, but the lion's share of that growth was in the diagnostic product, the MODIS Edges, which are expensive, and they are \u2013 maybe list price is probably $6,000, $5,999, something like that. And then you've got the thermal imager, which was at the bottom of the range. The list price is somewhere I think around $1,300, $1,400. So the thing is, is that you've got a lower end at that level.","So your big ticket was greater than the Tools Group, but more anchored in the lower end of big ticket than in maybe the quarters we've been used to lately. Tool storage was slightly off this quarter. So the tool storage representation was not as strong in this. So thus the smaller originations than it used to because thermal imagers, the penetration, the need for financing is a lot lower than for tool storage box.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","You're talking about stronger diagnostics. I realize in response to an earlier question you said timing wasn't an issue here, but I know you ran a storage promotion in late third quarter. Is it possible you just pulled forward some storage out of 4Q into 3Q, and that's accounting for the slower growth?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","No, maybe. There's a lot of things. I think \u2013 I don't know. Fundamentally these kinds of things are fairly judgmental in that situation (49:23). That's certainly a possibility, although we don't think \u2013 we try not to pull ahead those kinds of things, but certainly launches of new products really affect this kind of thing. And remember that you're talking about difference between 3% growth and 6% growth in the Tools Group, you're talking about one set of sockets once a week for every franchisee. So it's a difficult thing to \u2013 when you're talking about those differences, it's a difficult thing to pin down exactly the results. I would say if you're talking about tool storage, the biggest effect was hot diagnostics taking a lot of attention.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Same question. Just your net income margin continues to grow. You're now up to pretty impressive 16%. Just given the operating leverage in the business, is there an upside to this number in 2017 when materials' costs are going to be re-inflating and maybe big ticket growth in Tools may be slowing?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Yeah. There is. I mean I think we say that we keep driving up the margin, there's a lot of reasons for this. I mean fundamentally we see a lot of opportunities even today for improvement in Snap-On in every division, that's number one. Number two is, yes, material prices are rising, but we don't buy that much and you've never heard me explain on this call variance associated with material costs and we've made a couple of acquisitions now that gives us more grist for the Snap-On value creation mill.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","So I see lots of opportunities there still. So I don't think, by no means have we hit the top anywhere.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Last question for me. Just on the balance sheet. You ended another year with roughly 1 times net debt-to-EBITDA. You're doing bolt-on transactions, you've obviously been successful in augmenting growth. But just given the strength of your free cash flow, is the capacity here to continue to bolt-ons and grow the dividend while also accelerating your share repurchase activity?","Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.","Yeah, Dave, it's Aldo. Our principal focus for free cash flow is to look for investment opportunities whether that be organic or by way of acquisitions, that is what we look to. And, again, our strategy along share repurchase is still more or less to offset dilution. And, again, we continue to make contributions into our pension plan. So as we go forward and things change, we'll reexamine those on a quarterly basis, but that's kind of the pecking order right now.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Gary Prestopino from Barrington Research Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. A lot of the questions relating to the Tools Group have been answered, but, Nick, I mean, with the Rock 'N Roll Express vans, which I understand are the ones that are selling these big ticket storage items, have you been increasing that on an absolute basis? Or year-over-year is it pretty steady in terms of the units that are out there?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Bingo! It was flat, but we increased the Techno-Vans, which sells diagnostics. We moved those up 10% in the quarter, 20% year-over-year. So that's a relevant question. I didn't add that before, but that's one of the things that helped drive the diagnostics business. It all come together, new product and more power in the field's marketing of all this. Now, as I've said in the past, I'm not so sure that has an effect, and the fact that we didn't increase Rock 'N Roll vans doesn't necessarily have an effect because we think we get better every quarter at using them, but the fact is we haven't increased them for some time.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Okay. So that helps. And then the other thing you mentioned in your commentary that it was a record number of hit products this year, which I assume a hit product is one that generates over a million of sales.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Exactly.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Could you give us an idea of the magnitude of that growth on a percentage basis, or just the absolute number of hit products...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","I'll just say, I don't like to talk about the absolute number because I don't want to get pinned to the cross of reporting on hit products every year. But I'll just tell you this, versus 10 years ago we've reached more than 6 times.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Okay.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","And we keep growing on a regular basis.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Scott Stember from C.L. King. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Sure.","Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Could you maybe talk about currency, I know that heading into the back part of the year, before Brexit we were hoping that we'd get some bouncing out or some flattening of currency, but with the sterling falling off the way that it did certainly it started to hurt. But we've seen the pound actually rebound somewhat. Can you maybe just give us an idea of what your reset expectations are for 2017 for when we could start to see a bottom with impact from currency?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Just to ground ourselves, in the fourth quarter we took about a $15 million hit in revenue from currency and about $0.05 or $4 million on the bottom line in currency. And for the full year we had about $50 million, just north of $50 million, $51.5 million and $0.26 or $23 million in currency.","Looking forward, this is the darndest thing; at the end of the year we would have said same stuff. It would have been the same numbers, right. When we looked at it we figured we're going to see more or less the same currency effect that we had last year. You kind of rolled it out maybe a little different in conversation. But since the year-end things have changed, and we think the currency number's kind of half, for ballpark numbers you can kind of look at a half type currency. Look, maybe a little bit more than that early, right now if rates stay right where they are today we think it ends up being about half.","And the interesting thing about this is we talked about delinquencies and provisions in the credit company. The effect of currency, the $23 million, is humongous compared to our noise around that. And of course currencies can always change, so tomorrow I may wake up and this may all be different. But if you took them today, we'd expect some relief. And that relief would be big, would be nice.","Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Got it. And going over to RS&I, you broke out some of the categories. I missed the growth for the independent shop owners. Could you give that number again?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Oh, we're saying double-digit growth for the independent shop owners. The repairs, the diagnostics and software for the independent repair shop owners, Mitchell 1 sells the software in terms of SureTrack with the hundreds of millions of dollars of records of repair. And then diagnostics is the hardware and software-based sale, things like a thermal imager or a handheld diagnostic that will decode everything a car wants to say. So if you take that together it's like double-digits.","Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Right. And just last question, you talked about the undercar equipment business being, I think, you said low single-digits. Could you just maybe flesh that out? Whether weather-related products for the wheel, tire aligners, wheel aligners and (56:42)...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","I don't know. I hear all that, but I'm not sure I believe it. The thing is that every time I go in a garage sometimes the guys will tell me the weather has shafted us, and other people will say, the snow will make it bad for us because people can't get in. Other people will say the snow makes it good because they have a lot more procedures. So I'm not so sure how to play with that. What I will tell you about this is the Europeans tend to follow this. And the European business was much more sluggish compared to the North American business in this particular area. And Eastern Europe hasn't been too good to us in the equipment business either.","Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Got it. That's all I have. Thanks again.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Liam Burke from Wunderlich. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Thank you, and good morning, Nick.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Good morning, Liam.","Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Nick, on C&I you've invested a fair amount in emerging markets. Are you seeing any meaningful move there to help absorb some of that upfront investment?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","No. I wish I could say that I was, but the problem is, it seems like when we take one step forward, we take a step backwards in another place. For example, we're up in China this year, India difficult. I'm sure you're probably familiar with the demonetization in India and people ran out of cash. And a lot of our smaller distributors do a cash business, so our business went \u2013 kind of weakened in the third quarter.","So we're seeing that kind of balance. The turbulence has bedeviled us lately in terms of Indonesia being down and Thailand being up. So we see progress from a physical point of view, I feel better about the business, but we haven't been able to monetize it yet. I'm confident we will, but it hasn't been a meaningful contributor to us.","Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Okay. In terms of RCI...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","It will be though. It will be.","Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","I'm just saying, I'm confident it will be. But it hasn't been yet because we're managing over all those differences.","Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Okay. Got it. And on RCI, you talk about, obviously, the internal processes. You've moved that out to the van channel, Rock 'N Roll Van and \u2013 are some of the examples. Do you have any RCI programs pushed out to the van channel beyond the company-owned vans?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Well, yeah. I mean the thing is, is that a couple of things. Of course, increasingly the franchisees are deciding on their own to add assistants. Now we have about 20% of them up with assistants; I think there's 695 or something like that, up about 20% year-over-year. And that gives them more \u2013 in effect adds time to each van. And what we've done is, we've put programs in place to support them: new computer systems, tablets that allow them to have two people wandering around a garage or separated off the van and can still have a cash register in their hand. And so that's been a kind of positive event. That's one thing I can think of for sure.","And then, of course, just this quarter we expanded the Techno-Vans, another 10% growth quarter-over-quarter, 20% year-over-year. And that saves time because it puts an expert at the beck and call of a franchisee for a short period of time, and it also gives him and expands his selling space. So the Techno-Vans both amplify the time and allow him to time share more space for selling.","So you have those two things going on. There's a number of smaller things which we focus on in terms of how they're going to manage their inventory, how they're going to do other things.","Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Nick.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our last question from Richard Hilgert at the Morningstar. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Richard Hilgert - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thanks, Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to ask about future technologies in the industry. We're hearing more and more about hybrids coming sooner, battery electrics coming sooner, and obviously some of these things are already out there today, along with autonomous features of vehicles. Are you already developing tools for some of these areas, and if so, what are some of the areas that you're already seeing coming through for new tooling and electronics diagnostics?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Sure. I mean we are developing, actually remember: change is our friend. It requires the mechanic to change his tool set and to get new implements to allow him to repair these cars. And make no mistake about it, they need repair. And so we are working on this but just to be clear, unfortunately for us, it ain't happening next Thursday. There are 300 million vehicles on the road in North America and a very micro-percentage of them are really hybrids and electronic, even today.","But we are doing new things. For example, hybrids and electronics, we have a whole line of insulating tools. If you're poking around inside those engine compartments whether they are electric or hybrid, there's a lot of voltage in there, you don't want to get fried. And in fact there's a lot of danger. So a whole set of tools has to be used to particularly do that and we have them available.","In terms of automated cars, that's what I was talking about in terms of torque. Any time a car becomes more reliant on a system, it requires more calibration, more precise adjustment. And torque is one of the things that's more important. Of course, there's a whole bunch of other things like alignment and tire balancing, and a number of things that emanate from precision that opens up a whole new range of opportunities for us. So as cars become more automatic, we're investing in torque. You heard me talk about the AT300. Because of the need for that precision, that's why the SUVs and light trucks are requiring this precise torques of such large numbers. They didn't used to do that.","And in terms of things like lane departure systems or self-parks or adjusting automated cruise control, they all need more of this and that means precision. That's why we're buying in the torque sector because we believe this is a natural emanation of it. And one of the bright spots of the Tools Group in the fourth quarter was torque was up substantially, verifying that, confirming that view of the world.","Richard Hilgert - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. Great. My other question, it deals with some of the questions that I'm getting from investors with respect to the finance operations. Aldo, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the credit policy there and how it works. Some of the pushback I get is that there's concern that the franchisees are given too much credit authority, and that collecting it back might be more difficult for them. Is there any kind of comments you can make about the credit policy standards right now? And the fact that the business isn't necessarily growing because policies are getting weak, it's just a matter of the business and its natural growth rates?","Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.","Yeah, Richard. I think that last word is a good one. The business policy of sorts is to rely heavily on our experience. And when I say our experience that also includes the experience curve of the franchisees themselves. We have a traditional database that you get reports from various agencies and credit bureaus and things of that nature. We have our own internal history, which means a lot, and we keep that as a reservoir of information at the credit company. And we actually stripe and monitor the progress that our franchisees make along their path through a career in this business and track trends, and are able to instill in them some training.","We provide training when we go to the periodic conferences. But they are in a position to meet their customers up close and personal each and every week for the most part, and offer back to the credit company, an informed credit decision that might not be apparent in the bureaus or in the database, such as, what's the peer group feedback on that technician in a garage. What is the garage itself doing? Is there a stream of work or does it look like a garage vulnerable to a downturn? My point is that there's a lot of information resident in the franchisees and their own employees, because some of them do have employees. And we try to incorporate that into our final decision when we make a credit choice.","So as the model evolves, it's always enhanced. As the franchisees attempt to grow, they reach into new spaces, they meet new customers, those customers will have different credit profiles. And you adjust accordingly along the way.","Richard Hilgert - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Very good. Thanks again for taking my questions.","Aldo J.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski. Please, go ahead.","Leslie Kratcoski","Thanks, Lindy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's first quarter results which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today, Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.","As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion. These slides can be accessed under the downloads tab in the webcast viewer as well as on our website under investor information. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript of today's call.","Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs, or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook plans or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.","With that said, I'd now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Thanks Leslie. Good morning, everyone. As usual, I will start the call by covering the highlights of our first quarter and along the way I'll give you my perspective on our results, on our markets, on the progress we made, and on what we believe it all means. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.","We believe that our first quarter provided confirmation of Snap-on's ability to continue its trajectory of positive results, overcoming headwinds, advancing along our runways for both growth and improvement. Our EPS in the quarter was $2.16, up from last year's $1.87. That rise includes an opco operating margin of 18.6%, an increase of 190 basis points. When you combine those opco gains with earnings of $47 million from financial services, it bring Snap-on's consolidated operating margin to 22.5%, up from the 20.1% in 2015.","And that EPS, $2.16, it represents an increase of 15.5% over last year. That improvement came on an organic sales growth of 2.5% and the continuing contributions from our Snap-on value creation processes, the suite of principles we use every day around safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement or RCI. Once again, you can see it in the results, those processes contributed strongly to the earnings climb. Our reported sales in the quarter of $834.2 million were up 80 basis points, and that gain included 200 basis points of unfavorable foreign exchange.","Now currency has been a headwind for some time, both to sales and profit, but we've been able to overcome with the help of Snap-on value creation, especially with innovation and with RCI.","Innovation; taking practical insight and matching it with the latest technology, generating product excitement while making work easier for professionals with an array of new products. You see, that's been part of our DNA from the very beginning in 1920, and we are only getting better at doing it. There are more new products than ever before. RCI; ongoing improvement, finding operating efficiency and achieving cost reduction, up and down and across the corporation. Innovation in RCI; overcoming the challenges, extending the trend of rising profits again.","Now let's consider the markets, the markets we serve. The first quarter once again highlighted the extensive opportunities of the auto repair segment, more solutions to service the growing complexities of new vehicles requiring advanced solutions. And an aging fleet, driving more repairs, both factors in play not only in the United States but worldwide and the numbers of our quarter reflect those tailwinds. They show and -- they not only reflect the tailwinds, they show our ability to take advantage to progress down our runways for growth.","Consider the tools group; organic sales up 8.1%, clearly enhancing the van channel, providing innovative new tools to engage continually changing tasks, making work easier for technicians and our franchise team more prosperous and more powerful. And repair systems information, or our RSI group, expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage, capitalizing on a broader product line, growth across all the divisions but most notably in diagnostic and repair information businesses, in the diagnostic and repair information businesses serving independent repair shop owners and managers.","C&I; it includes the businesses that serve critical industries and is the most international of our groups. And in the quarter the results showed the challenges of turbulent industrial sectors and the difficulties of a few trouble geographies. In critical industries, the headwinds from the fourth quarter continued and they were a bit more pronounced. Sales to the US military and to oil and gas customers were down significantly with both segments showing the impact of ongoing measured spending and budget constraints. At the same time, we saw dips in some international markets, specifically the Middle East, where aerospace project activity was down due in part to macro development in that turbulent -- in that region, pretty turbulent there.","That said, all that said, C&I did demonstrate strength. SNA Europe delivered mid-single digit growth in places like the UK, Spain and the Nordic region, while Asia Pacific registered double-digit increases in countries like India, Thailand and Indonesia. So overall I'd describe our C&I market as mixed turbulence and strength. Deep challenges, but we're also encouraged by the advancements, taking advantage of the opportunities that are available. And when coupled with the string of positive performances surrounding our auto repair related businesses, on a whole, we believe there is clear progress along our runways for growth -- enhancing the van network, expanding repair shop owners and managers, building in emerging markets, and yes, extending to critical industries. Even in this quarter, we can see progress in our growing product line, in our increasing understanding of the work, all of that creating confidence in our forward trajectory across those critical sectors. That's the overview of the markets.","Now let's move to the segments. In the C&I Group, organic sales were down 1.3% with declines in the critical industries attenuated by gains in SNA Europe, Asia Pacific and the power tools division. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income was $41.1 million, representing an operating margin of 14.3%, a decrease of 50 basis points, pretty much authored by lower sales in our higher margin critical industry business. But as I said, we do remain committed to extending in critical industries and we'll keep strengthening our position to capture new business as the segment improves. You can see this particularly in our innovative new products, fortifying our ability to make work easier outside the garage in a range of industrial settings.","One new product family in that category is -- in our collection is the Snap-on three-quarter inch flank drive 12 point impact socket. You pick these up, they are a handful, big, but effective and durable, aimed at power generation, mining and oil and gas sectors; perfect for turning large bolts on wind turbine engines, earth-moving equipment, oil wells, multiple other places, anyplace where heavy work gets done. They are ideal for pneumatic or hydraulic bolting systems and they incorporate Snap-on's flank drive which move stresses away from fastener points, delivering more turning power right in the field without slipping or rounding off a fastener. Those sockets are made down in Alabama at our Elkmont plant, and they are a great addition to our tool line, they fill a vital need for our critical industry customers.","Now in past quarters, I'm sure you may remember that we discussed Snap-on's lineup of tool control solutions, safeguarding the assets and improving productivity. I've spoken about our innovative and sophisticated automated tool control system, or AGC, the smart tool storage unit which electronically keeps track of the who, the when, and the where of individual tool usage, it's popular. In the quarter, our industrial division introduced its latest and another version of tool control, the Snap-on 5S Dual Visual Control Cabinet. The 5S Dual, off-the-shelf or custom-built, utilizes visible control trays to quickly identify missing tools with the help of custom cut foam or with CAD-designed tool silhouettes. It's the perfect addition to any place where work is performed within the site of tool storage, like assembly line, and where the shop is aiming to drive improvements through 5S or RCI.","And I mentioned the strength of SNA Europe and the continuing new advancement there was clearly evident in its mid-single digit sales gains, marking now ten straight quarters of year-over-year sales progress across several challenged geographies. And once again, sales rose but profits were up more, now the 12th straight quarter of margin improvement. And speaking of gains, our Asia Pacific division, an area of strong potential and these days of significant variation, we're building our physical capabilities and we saw progress in the quarter with sales rising compared to last year.","So now onto the tools group; organic sales increased 8.1%. The operating margin of 16.6% was up nicely versus the 15.8% recorded last year. The tools group, the results continue to speak for themselves, ongoing progress along their runway for coherent growth enhancing the franchise channel. And there is abundant evidence of growing strength and of ongoing positive trajectory across that channel, all on display in our franchisee metrics, important financial and physical indicators like cash, like turnover, we monitor those metrics very closely and again this quarter they are favorable across the Board and they continue to trend upward. There is also evidence in sort of anecdotal and direct interaction with the franchisees at events this year like our January kickoff meetings held all over the network, orders were up considerably, and atmosphere, enthusiasm and optimism and a team marked by commitment and energy. When you meet our franchisees, you clearly see they are brimming with confidence, reaching higher and expecting to achieve and grow.","The tools group was marked by growth, but it was also driven by Snap-on value creation. It's always a critical component of the group's progress, offering [ph] innovative new products, sometimes just an improvement on an established line but making work easier, solving new problems, delivering productivity gains from observing the work in shops on a daily basis. An example of that is our Snap-on 312 CF heavy-duty diagonal cutters manufactured up the road in our Milwaukee plant, the next generation of our most powerful diagonal cutting pliers, utilizing Milwaukee sophisticated cold forging technology. They've been redesigned for better overall strength, substantially increased cutting performance, and longer life, more precise cutting edges and a repositioned pivot point for increased leverage.","The 312, using both those edges in a new leverage, the 312 CF cuts material ranging from plastic cable ties to hardened spring steel, tremendous versatility. And the pliers head has been improved. Our designers better pinpointed the failure points, added material in those places, reducing the breakage, tip breakage, even when these pliers are engaged in the toughest task. And we matched it all with the latest in Snap-on cushion grips. Our customer connections showed that there was a great need for pliers with improved versatility, durability, and comfort. The 312 CF provides just that, and we expect strong sales, even in an established category.","Also in the quarter, the tools group introduced the low-profile swivel impact socket set. Now we've been selling sockets for a dog's age, a long time. But this new set expands our line of confined space solutions with a reduced height, provides better -- that reduced height provides better access to fasteners, great for tight engine compartments, underneath dash spaces and any difficult to reach area. The new design also features laser welded pivot points and the weld beads are machines flushed to the socket for improved appearance and safety. It adds a smooth full 30 degree swivel action for more efficient power. Power and access, just what's needed for the tight spaces and the challenging tasks of today's more complex engine compartments.","Snap-on innovation; a tradition in Snap-on since 1920, but we believe getting much better helping technicians perform their work more efficiently and enabling solutions in a rapid changing environment. But the tools group is not just product, it's also based on amplifying the capability of our franchisees and the power of our network. The Rock n Roll pads and the Techno Express are great examples of that. But now we are also enabling our team with the Chrome Express Plus System, supporting multiple mobile terminals. A number of our franchisees have chosen to add an assistant to the route. While Chrome Express Plus enables that add, making it possible to multiply selling time and to reach more customers, it's another clear opportunity for more growth.","And we can't talk about tools group without speaking of its strategic partner, our financial services team, tapping the power and insight of our franchisees, financing big ticket sales, serving as a great assist to our tools business and you can see it in the strategic relationships playing out vividly in the quarter's results.","Now let's speak of RS&I; first quarter organic sales rose 3.1% led by sales to independent shop owners and managers, operating earnings of $69 million, up $5.1 million from 2015. The operating margin, 24.7%, a rise of 120 basis points. RS&I; we're clearly seeing the power of RS&I -- RCI, rapid continuous improvement, driving margin expansion, it's evident again in this quarter in the strong earnings. I often speak of this, the successful handheld -- our successful line of handheld diagnostic units, well received in the market, driving growth throughout independent repair shops.","In the first quarter, that advantage was again highlighted publicly. Our SOLUS Edge and our ETHOS Tech handhelds were honored by Undercard Digest, both recognized by that magazine as a Top 10 tool. The SOLUS Edge, faster processing, larger screen, the power of Mitchell 1 SureTrack, all combining for the fastest fixes. It's the tool for experienced technicians. And the ETHOS Tech with its considerable functionality and attractive price point, great for the first-time diagnostic buyer. Both handhelds were selected by the votes of technicians and shop owners who use these tools every day and who read Undercard Digest.","One clear reason why the RS&I margins have continued to climb all these quarters is the ongoing stream of innovations made possible by customer connections with professional tool users. An example of that in this quarter, RS&I launched its shift -- launched and shipped its new advanced touchscreen diagnostic workstation. It features our most powerful diagnostic tool, the VERUS Edge handheld, and it's paired with a custom roll cart for easy mobility and a large 27-inch touchscreen monitor for increased readability and productivity. This workstation, all of this visibly reinforcing independent repair shops capabilities, building that customer confidence, so important in an environment of rising vehicle technology.","In addition this quarter, our equipment division launched what we believe to be a game changer, the V3300 wheel aligner, a next generation unit targeted specifically at specialty shops and dealerships, faster readings, real-time data to the technician and a significant reduction in cycle time. We've already received enthusiastic feedback in just a few weeks from a wide range of potential customers and we are confident it's another share taker.","Finally, RSI continued its expansion into the heavy-duty segment, strengthening the Snap-on Pro-Link Ultra's position as the go-to handheld in big truck shops, adding coverage, enhancing functionality and building and expanding presence in the heavy-duty repair shops across the U.S.","So that's the highlights.","Continued progress; organic sales rising 2.5%, gains achieved through Snap-on value creation processes, especially innovation in RS&I, strengthening our businesses and driving to an 18.6% opco operating margin, up substantially. And in the face of currency and industry headwinds, EPS of $2.16, up 15.5%, it was an encouraging quarter.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?","Aldo Pagliari","Our first quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $834.2 million were up 2.5% organically, primarily reflecting increases in our businesses serving automotive repair, partially offset by lower sales to critical industries in our C&I segment.","On a reported basis, net sales, which included $16.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $2.6 million of acquisition related sales, increased $6.4 million, or just under 1% from 2015 levels. Largely due to the strengthening of the US dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q1 sales comparisons by 200 basis points. Consolidated gross margin of 49.8% improved 30 basis points from 2015 levels as benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives were partially offset by 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.","Operating expenses of $259.9 million yielded an operating expense margin of 31.2% in the quarter, an improvement of 160 basis points from last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives, lower stock-based mark-to-market compensation and other expenses as well as lower pension expense. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before financial services of $155.4 million, including $7.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency FX, increased 12.7% as compared to the prior year, and as percentage of sales, increased 190 basis points to 18.6%.","Financial services revenue of $66.3 million in the quarter increased 15.5% from 2015 levels and operating earnings of $47 million increased 16.6%. These increases primarily reflect the continued growth of the financial services portfolio. Consolidated operating earnings of $202.4 million, including $8.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 13.6%. And the operating margin of 22.5% increased 240 basis points from 20.1% a year ago. Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 31% compared to 32% last year. For the full year, we continue to anticipate that our 2016 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our full-year 2015 rate of 31.7%. Finally, net earnings of $128.3 million or $2.16 per share increased $17.8 million or $0.29 per share from 2015 levels, representing a 15.5% increase in diluted earnings per share.","Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with commercial and industrial, or C&I, group on Slide 7, sales of $287 million in the first quarter decreased 1.3% organically primarily due to a double-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries. This decline was partially offset by a double-digit increase in the segment's Asia-Pacific operations, a high single-digit gain in the segment's power tools operations, and a mid-single-digit sales increase from the segment's European-based handtools business.","Gross profit in the C&I group of $110.5 million compared to $116.5 million last year. The gross margins of 38.5% decreased 70 basis points primarily due to a decrease in higher gross margin sales to customers in critical industries and 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives.","Operating expenses of $69.4 million in the quarter compared to $72.5 million last year. The operating expense margin of 24.2% improved 20 basis points from 24.4% last year. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $41.1 million, including $2.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, decreased $2.9 million from 2015 levels and the operating margin of 14.3% compared to 14.8% last year.","Turning now to Slide 8, first quarter sales in the Snap-on tools group of $402.5 million increased 8.1% organically, reflecting a high single-digit gain in the company's U.S. franchise operations and a mid-single digit increase in the company's international franchise operations. Sales gains continue to reflect strong demand, including for big-ticket items such as tool storage and diagnostics. Gross profit of $173.2 million compared to $166.3 million last year. The gross margin of 43% decreased 100 basis points for the most part due to unfavorable foreign currency effects.","Operating expenses were $106.5 million in both the first quarters of 2016 and 2015. The operating expense margin of 26.4% improved 180 basis points primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives as well as 50 basis points of lower stock-based cost associated with the Company's franchisee stock purchase plan. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on tools group of $66.7 million, including $4.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $6.9 million and the operating margin of 16.6% improved 80 basis points from 15.8% last year.","Turning to the repair systems information or RS&I group, shown on Slide 9, first quarter sales of $278.8 million increased 3.1% organically. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a mid-single digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products, a low single-digit increases in both sales of undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships. Gross profit of $131.6 million compared to $127.3 million last year. Gross margin of 47.2% improved 40 basis points, primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives.","Operating expenses of $62.6 million in the quarter compared to $63.4 million last year. The operating expense margin of 22.5% improved 80 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives. First quarter operating earnings for the RS&I group of $69 million, including $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $5.1 million from prior year levels. And the operating margin of 24.7% improved 120 basis points from 23.5% last year.","Now turning to Slide 10, operating earnings from financial services of $47 million on revenue of $66.3 million compared with operating earnings of $40.3 million on revenue of $57.4 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.9% in the quarter compared with 17.7% last year. And the average yield on contract receivables was 9.5% in both periods. Originations of $264.6 million in the quarter increased 14.7% from 2015 levels.","Moving to Slide 11, our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.6 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.4 billion from our U.S. operation. Approximately 81% of our US financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. In the first quarter of 2016, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew $53.3 million, continuing to reflect the previously mentioned higher sales of big-ticket items like the Snap-on tools group. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.","Now turning to Slide 12, cash provided by operations of $141.6 million in the quarter increased $63.5 million from comparable 2015 levels due in part to higher 2016 net earnings and lower growth in working investment as compared to the prior year. Net cash used by investing activities of $79.6 million included $56.8 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $19.5 million in the quarter compared with $18.1 million last year.","Turning to Slide 13, days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 61 days compared with 60 days at 2015 year-end. Inventories increased $13.8 million from 2015 year-end levels primarily to support continued higher customer demand in the auto repair sector and new product introductions. On a trailing twelve month basis, inventory turns of 3.4 compared with 3.5 turns at 2015 year-end.","Our quarter-end cash position of $106.3 million increased $13.5 million from 2015 year-end levels. The net increase includes $174.1 million of cash from collections of finance receivables, and $141.6 million of cash from operations. These cash increases were largely offset by the funding of $230.9 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $35.4 million, the repurchase of 157,000 shares for $23.1 million, and $19.5 million for capital expenditures. Our net debt capital ratio of 23.6% compared with 24.6% at 2015 year-end.","In addition to our $106.3 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. As of the first quarter end, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. This concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Thanks, Aldo. That's our first quarter, performance against the wind. We believe it's a period that authors strong confidence going forward, authoring or auguring progress along our runway for both improvement and growth.","Enhancing the van channel, the tools group grew 8.1% organically and the OI margin reached 16.6%, up 80 basis points. Franchisees confident and committed, a stream of exciting new hit products and a continuing line of ways to wield the van channel more powerfully, the Rock n Roll CADs to the Techno Express and now the Chrome Express Plus enabling the franchisees to reach more customers. Expanding repair shop owners and managers. Sales up 3.1%. OI margin rising 120 basis points to 25.7%, great products. The V3300 aligner, the ETHOS and the SOLUS handheld meeting the growing complexity of vehicle repair.","Building in emerging markets, expanding the physicals, sales increasing in a varying landscape. And finally, extending to critical industries. Turbulence, but we still see progress. Clear to us in terms of expanding product lines aimed at solving the critical in those sectors outside the garage.","And you can't look at our quarter without seeing the hallmarks of Snap-on value creation, driving improvement against the difficulties, authoring an OI margin of 18.6%, up substantially versus last year, again. And when you add that opco performance to our financial services progress, it rolls together for an EPS of $2.16, up 15.5%, extending our trend of rising profitability, a 15.5% rise in what most would call a turbulent environment. We believe it was an encouraging quarter, and one which points clearly to continued and significant gains as we move forward.","Now before I turn the call over to the operator, it's appropriate that I say words to our franchisees and associates. Once again, I know many of you are listening, the progress of our first quarter most clearly reflects your extraordinary capability and your unique dedication. For the skills you bring to our company, for the energy you devote to our efforts and for the commitment you give to our team, you have my admiration and you have my thanks.","Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Liam Burke with Wunderlich. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Liam Burke","Thank you. Good morning, Nick. Good morning, Aldo. The auto repair and maintenance end market seems to be working in your favor. The macro trends seem to be strong now and sustainable. Are you seeing any change in the competitive environment?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Not really. I'm sure -- you know, we have a fairly strong position in these markets, as you know. And generally, as I've said many times on these calls, built on I think the overwhelming capability of our van network and the skill of our franchisees, and the ongoing understanding of the repair shop, we generally reflect back on ourselves. So when I talk about franchisees, they almost never really mentioned the competition although I'm sure is formidable. They mention about how we can improve back on ourselves. And I'm seeing no change in that really. And I think the tools group numbers seem to say that. Their numbers look pretty good. They continually make this up. They've been up 6% or greater 23 of 24 quarters.","One of the things I like to say about that, I think one of the investment theses about Snap-on is that Snap-on is a company that is so much more -- so much more to do, so many more places to grow and improve. And the tools group, the van channel, has been around for decades, and yet they have been able to do this by creating a bigger plume and being able to expand so dramatically by creating a greater plume of new product and figuring out through things like these Rock 'n Roll cads and Techno Express and now Chrome Express Plus, how to wield those vans more effectively. That's what's happening with us in the market.","Liam Burke","Thanks Nick. And also on the diagnostic side, you mentioned the handheld as some of the key product introductions and innovation you're getting there. If you look at the diagnostics business in general, is most of the growth coming out of handheld or do you have some innovative products coming into the service station owner and manager?","Nicholas Pinchuk","If you look at RS&I; we are getting growth in a broad range. Diagnostic stuff is growing very strongly. If you look at big-ticket items in the tools group, which is the bigger diagnostics and the tool storage and so on, they are up higher than -- they're growing faster than the tools group. So that looks pretty strong. We keep innovating around handhelds, and that's of course some of the spiffy stuff people like to talk about because people want more diagnostics as the cars get more complex. But also if you look at equipment, you will see that in terms of the new aligners we brought out. And behind the aligners, there's an array of new balancers and so on. And then finally, we keep enhancing our software product like this SureTrack, which accesses hundreds of millions of actual repair events and allows technicians to pinpoint the possible repair and shortcut to that repair through big data. That's an exciting product which is going into the garage at the same time.","Liam Burke","Great. Thanks, Nick.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Sure.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to David Leiker with Baird. Please go ahead, your line is open.","David Leiker","Good morning everyone. A couple of things I want to walk through. In C&I, you still have I think at least another quarter here of tough comps year-over-year. Is that right?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Yes, look, I think at C&I if you look at this, I think you could say you'd be allowed to the fact that oil and gas gets -- it wasn't as we did in the first quarter last year, if you remember, in oil and gas. The second quarter started tail off. So I think oil and gas tends to get a little easier moving into the second quarter. But military was strong and international aviation was strong in the second quarter. So we still have another quarter of batting up against that. It tends to get easier in the third and fourth quarter. I don't want to say easier, but it tends to be less high of a bar.","David Leiker","Yes, and if I remember correctly, your fourth quarter for oil and gas, energy, military, that Q4 tone was slightly weaker than Q3. What does it look like in the first quarter versus Q4?","Nicholas Pinchuk","It's weaker. Both of those are weaker in the first quarter than they were in Q4. I think marginally. I'd say marginally weaker. It's somewhat weaker though. It's hard to say, David, because you've got fourth quarter over first quarter. You might have some mild seasonality flowing through that, but I would say mildly weaker.","David Leiker","Do you think when we get to that point through these comps in the second half that they are more normalized, that those businesses are down single digits instead of double digits?","Nicholas Pinchuk","I'm not in the business of forecasting that, but certainly we'd come back to substantially lower comparisons. And so that by arithmetic changes the whole situation. And then remember, we keep investing in those businesses. We brought out -- I just want to point out, we had a tough year in the military, and we brought out over 700 new products aimed at the military. So, we keep positioning ourselves for this, so we are ready to go. We are all dressed up. When the party comes, we are ready to dance.","David Leiker","And then Aldo, just a question for you on currency, a lot of details you split out there. Is there a way that you can, on the EBIT line, split out how much of that currency effect was translation versus transactional currency? Could some of these cross-currency relationships seem to be a little bit out of balance with what we normally would see?","Aldo Pagliari","We do. I don't want to actually give the internal calculus around that number, but I think, to help you out, as you look forward looking at today's currency rates, transaction will be the greater burden that affects the EBIT calculation so to speak and translation abates a little bit as you go forward using today's rates if you march forward in time.","David Leiker","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open.","David Kelley","Good morning everyone, this is David Kelley in for Bret. Thanks for taking my questions. And a couple ones, and first I guess a follow-up to an earlier question. The US franchisee base posted really another excellent quarter here. And I know there's been some discussion of a sequential slowdown through Q1 from an aftermarket distributor that reported earlier this week. Is that something that impacted you at all either from your franchisees or let's say RS&I sell-through to the non-dealer channel? And I guess to that point, could you give us maybe a general feel for cadence and tools and RS&I performance throughout the quarter?","Nicholas Pinchuk","I don't think we want to give you cadence throughout the quarter, I don't think \u2013 look, I think we are not seeing -- I wouldn't say we are seeing any marked change in the auto repair related businesses. When we go, either in our numbers or when I go out and visit the garage, when I ride these vans. One of the interesting things about our view of the economy is this, is when we look at -- we parse it between auto related and the industrial. We did it in my remarks. But you know, I think one of the fascinating it's about today's environment is it's big to small -- I mean small-to-big. If you're out in the small garage, if you're out in these garages, they are feeling good. They are confident. They are great.","So those businesses, the small businesses, to us in our sectors seem uniformly to be enthusiastic and confident and doing very well. As you rise in the size of business, the amount of cautiousness increases. And you can see that in our businesses as well. So when we are selling to the garage from garage to garage, from dealership to dealership, we see good things. When we are engaging with let's say the OEMs or the manufacturers, that's a little bit more tepid. But to answer your question directly, at the grassroots level, we are not seeing any abatement in this. In fact, our franchisees are only getting more confident as far as I can tell.","David Kelley","Great. I really appreciate that color. And I guess just a quick follow-up. As you talk about the grassroots movement and the strength at the garage level, what do you see as the better opportunity in 2016? Are we selling more to the mechanics or the shop owners with some of diagnostic equipment?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Well, actually, it merged a little bit because what's happening is that it used to be that much of the bigger diagnostic equipment was sold to the shop, and it was spread around. It was shared between technicians. What's happening now is while 40% to 50% of the repairs in a -- of the car-park, the 300 million car, vehicle car-park, 40% or 50% of those repairs require a diagnostic unit. 80% of the new car repairs require a diagnostic unit. So every technician is going to need a diagnostic unit from that ETHOS read and reset to all the way up to our VERUS PRO that will solve the most puzzling of problems. And so we are seeing more sales now to individuals. But we are also seeing -- that's the market situation. But RS&I has only within the last, let's say within the last five or six years started -- five, six, seven years -- started to focus on repair shop owners and managers as a particular customer base. So, you see that opportunity unfold for us as we learn what they need, and we arm our quiver with more products. We give us more to sell to those guys. So I would say the market is going really robustly for the technicians. Shop owners and managers are still buying but we have a particular share gain opportunity with owners and managers.","David Kelley","Okay, great. Thank you. And then one more for me and I'll jump back into queue here. Can you maybe give us some color on the impact of the lower stock-based compensation and pension expense on corporate expense? And then if we think about the last few years, you've run I think roughly $100 million annualized corporate expense. How do we think about the full-year run rate for 2016?","Nicholas Pinchuk","I think we kind of give guidance around $25 million a quarter or so on. So it's interesting. Last year in the quarter, we had a particularly expensive mark-to-market event that drove corporate expense up. I think it was $29 million and change. This year, we had a particularly favorable one which brought it down to $21 million and change. Really the $21 million compares to a $25 million run rate if you really want to think of it in those terms. If you talk about operating expense, yes. In operating expense, there's that mark-to-market and the pension expense that's in there that's making some of the improvements in operating expense. What we do is when we look at our numbers, we say this, yes, we've got good news from mark-to-market but we got bad news from currency. They about balanced, mark-to-market and pension currency, and we still grew EPS at 15.5%.","David Kelley","Great, I appreciate the color. Thanks again.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.","David MacGregor","Good morning, everyone. You caught my attention with the observation of franchisees adding help on the van, and that should drive sales productivity. Do you have a count on -- I know you've got 3,500 trucks running in the United States.","Nicholas Pinchuk","That's a ballpark, it's 3,475. I don't know that number. It's written on might shorts here. That's why I see it every morning.","David MacGregor","Do you have a figure on growth, just to what extent you are selling\u2026","Nicholas Pinchuk","No, I don't want to get in the business of reporting that, but let's just say that that is a small number so far. In the 15% to 20% range of the franchisees have those as systems. As you know, most of them -- and it's a franchisee's choice to make the decision. We enable it with things like Chrome Express Plus and other things. But what I see when I go to these kickoffs or go to the National Franchisee Advisory Council and talk to these, the more the franchisees see the success of other people with these assistance, the more they say, hey, maybe I could do this. I could hire new guys. I could reach more customers. I can increase my sales. And they are looking at that because, now, having grown for 23 out of 24 quarters 6% or greater, they want this growth. They expect it and so they are looking for things which could make their businesses better.","David MacGregor","The other question I had for you was just the disparity in growth rates between your originations on the credit business and the tools growth. And I'm just wondering if you can talk were there any changes within the credit model and the extent to which this has helped you with your most creditworthy customers, drive\u2026","Nicholas Pinchuk","Look, I think there are lots of things floating through here. It depends how long wave you want to look at it. If you look at it in any one particular quarter, you are talking -- first of all, you are talking big ticket items. So, big ticket items in this particular quarter, tool storage, big diagnostic and so on, they grew faster than the tools group, so it's hard to match that. Plus there's a timing question and then a sales tech on top of it. So there is a lot of things that goes on in the individual quarters. If you are saying have we wielded credit more effectively or more broadly, we have, because what we've done is we've spent a lot of time determining, determining, determining who are our best franchisees, and how they are good at credit. There's been no change in the credit model really. There's been no change in the credit model. But we have done a great job I think of using those franchisees who have the best instincts and insight and capability around credit, and enlisting them in the credit company to advance this kind of activity.","David MacGregor","You have a history of managing credit very effectively, so I was more focused on the extent to which this may put more purchasing power in the hands of your customers to buy bigger ticket items going forward.","Nicholas Pinchuk","There is some of that, but we haven't really changed it. It can make it possible for certain people who couldn't get credit before, who happen to be in a route that's superintended by one of the people that we now think is a great credit guy, what we call a Platinum Elite guy. That could make that change. But generally we've kind of held it. We've kind of held that model I think, except for this engaging the knowledge of the franchisee.","David MacGregor","Got it. Thanks very much.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Gary Prestopino","Good morning everyone. Nick, is the Chrome Express Plus, is that the program of putting assistance on the vans? I'm a little confused there.","Nicholas Pinchuk","You know what it is? The Chrome Express Plus is an adjunct to our new computer system. Several years ago, we rolled out a new computer system, point-of-sale system, for the van. And then more recently, we have added Chrome Express Plus, which allows mobile, tablets, multiple tablets to roll out from the van. And what I am saying is the franchisees, the franchisees have looked at their situation and realized that, boy, they would like to add selling time. So they have made the decision, on an individual basis pretty much, it has been a grassroots effort, to try to pick up assistance. And then this Chrome Express Plus is a response to that help enable them. We don't have a program to bring on assistants. We are not sponsoring a program or anything like that. It's fundamentally the franchisees themselves because after all these are independent businessmen who make these decisions. But we have created Chrome Express Plus that really leverages -- if you have an assistant, chrome express plus really helps you. And it really helps the assistants that is there. That's what I was trying to say.","Gary Prestopino","Okay. I was just a little confused on that. And then on the diagnostic side, interesting comments about -- you are saying number of cars or amount of cars that now need some kind of diagnostic usage and repair. But is there something within these diagnostic products that you are putting out that make older ones more obsolete? Is it just computing power, amount of information they can show? I'm just trying to get an idea of how long one of these techs can use a diagnostic tool effectively before he or she has to switch\u2026","Nicholas Pinchuk","In a way, Gary, it's a little bit like a TV. You could still be using a tube, I suppose, but every time there are two pieces here. One is software, we keep updating software. I want to say a couple of times a year we keep updating software. Then we bring out so you could be having an existing handheld and keep updating the software, keep updating the software. Eventually that software might not be run so effectively on some of the older models. That is one, so you would want to change. Secondly, again, it's like a TV. We bring out the newer models, and they have features, touchscreen feature. The new SOLUS, you turn it on, it comes on in like seconds, five seconds. The older one was slower. VERUS Edge, you can get technical service bulletins. You go out on the Internet and you get SureTrack on it, different capabilities. By the way, it's about -- it's substantially lighter and better ergonomics than it was. So you have these two things going on. So if you behold one of these new diagnostics, and this happens all of the time, because people say, gee, I'd really like to use this; it is a lot lighter; it would be effective for me; it's a lot quicker; it's more easy with a touchscreen. So people tend to want to upgrade. So we keep enhancing those. And there is software on top of it.","Gary Prestopino","Thanks. And just for Aldo, did I hear you right that you said currency has negatively impacted net earnings by about $8.1 million this quarter?","Aldo Pagliari","That's correct. That's the bottom-line impact.","Gary Prestopino","Okay. So in terms of translation, which currency is going to have more impact as we go forward? Is it the euro or the pound?","Aldo Pagliari","The euro historically would be the biggest currency, and in 2015 was the biggest decrement to sales. That is starting to wane now as the euro has stabilizes. So as you go forward I think you look at the pound and the Canadian dollar will start to factor in, but I would say that's my best description right now, Gary. I think you'll see less translation negative impact coming from the euro, yet within the Company, there is still some transaction drag that's created from the currency mix that we have.","Gary Prestopino","Alright, that's what I thought. Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Richard Hilgert with Morningstar. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Richard Hilgert","Good morning, Nick. Good morning, Aldo. How are you?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Good morning. How are you?","Richard Hilgert","Doing well, thanks. And thanks for taking my questions this morning.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Sure.","Richard Hilgert","I just wanted to go back to a couple of things. The corporate expense line for coming to operating earnings, that was an $8.4 million reduction from last year to this year. And did I hear you right, this is related to pension expense but it sounded like you were talking about currency too. So am I to assume that this is the\u2026","Nicholas Pinchuk","No, there is couple pieces to that, one is of course pension expense, it's between -- I think that's between $1 million and $2 million, something like that. And the rest is principally marked-to-market around the stock-based compensation. So basically when the stock price goes down, you get good news. When it goes up, you get a mark-to-market. So what happened last year is a little bit misleading because last year -- that difference is versus last year, and last year the stock price went up in the quarter. So we had bad news in mark-to-market. And so you are comparing the bad -- the good news this year with the bad news last year, and so you get an expanded number in the $6 million range.","Richard Hilgert","Okay, got you. So mark-to-market on the stock compensation expense.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Yes.","Richard Hilgert","Alright. And then on receivables in the finance group, you guys did a great job bringing on receivables that were up 17% in the quarter. So really good loan origination going on. I'm curious. You mentioned earlier about Premium Elite status franchisees. Is this because of their efforts to increase the credit portfolio, or is this driven because there is a different mix in what loans are being originated or\u2026","Nicholas Pinchuk","No, no, no. What this means is this is the kind of framework which we've had for some time. The broader characterization is Platinum. These are people who are engaging in the credit program. They are spending time thinking about how to deal with credit. And the better guys, the top end guys, are what we call the Platinum Elite. And what this really means, Richard, is certain franchisees can judge credit, can add to our credit model. We have -- our credit process is like this","Richard Hilgert","Okay, great. And it sounds like these guys, being more adept at credit policy, are better able to identify potential risks that even though you're penetrating your market more so on the finance side, the risk that you are taking on hasn't changed. Is that a fair statement?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Any other -- most other credit facilities, through the eyes of these people, we actually know the borrower very, very well, and that's the essence of how we keep the losses down so low.","Richard Hilgert","Okay, very good. Thanks again for taking my questions.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Okay.","Operator","And this concludes our Q&A session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Leslie for closing remarks.","Leslie Kratcoski","We appreciate you joining us today. A replay of the call will be available shortly on Snapon.com. And as always, we thank you for your interest in the company. Good day.","Operator","And this does conclude today's program. You may disconnect at this time.

And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski, VP Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Leslie H. Kratcoski","Thanks, Mary, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's first quarter 2013 results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.","As usual, we have provided slides to supplement our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on our website next to the audio icon for this call. These slides will be archived on our website along with a transcript of today's call.","Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs; or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections, are forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.","With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll start out by providing my perspective on the results, on our various markets and on the highlights of the quarter. Then I'll turn the call over to Aldo for a detailed review of the financials.","The results and the trends of our first quarter remained much the same as we've seen in the past few periods. We once again had solid profit gains on a sales increase that came in the face of some continuing headwinds. Our EPS in the quarter of $1.40 was up nearly 16% from last year's $1.21. Our opco operating margin was 14.5%, an increase of 120 basis points. And our operating earnings -- and operating earnings from Financial Services was $30.5 million, up $23.9 million in -- up from the $23.9 million in 2012.","On a consolidated basis, the overall operating margin was 17.6%. That compares to 15.7% in last year's first quarter. Now we believe that these increased profits clearly demonstrate the benefit being driven by our Snap-on value-creation processes, the set of principles and tools we apply every day to drive improvement, with a focus on safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, as we call it. They help us move down our runways for improvement, and they are driving results.","Related to the sale -- related to sales, we're up in the quarter by 1.5% organically before a negative impact from foreign currency of, I guess, 60 basis points. There are, of course, always differences from period to period. But from my perspective, the big picture is similar to the last quarter. We're seeing reasonable growth in our businesses serving the Automotive Repair sector, in the Tools Group, in the Repair Systems & Information group -- or Repair Systems & Information, or the RS&I group. At the same time, there's an offset to the -- to these generally favorable conditions in those businesses due to the dual headwinds that are concentrated in Commercial & Industrial, or the C&I group. Those headwinds, restricted military spending and the overall turbulence in Europe were the principal factors in the C&I sales decline.","Importantly, our balanced approach to driving advancement in those areas that we've identified as being decisive to our future overcame the headwinds and challenges. Our focus on expanding into critical industries, building in emerging markets, enhancing the franchise channel and expanding in the garage has authored ongoing year-over-year gains for the past few years despite some challenging macros.","The varied opportunities -- available thoughts along those declined run rates create our ability to offset the continuing headwinds. And in this quarter, we saw particular strength in the critical industries of natural resources and aerospace, continued gains with diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, and a strong uptick in activity with automotive OEM dealerships, especially related to essential diagnostics.","Now let's go on to some discussion of the segments. As I mentioned, the C&I group is where we see the largest impact from the headwinds of military spending in Europe. Similar to last quarter, those main headwinds resulted in an organic sales decrease of 6.3%.","One of the highlights in the quarter, however, was the 11.5% operating margin for the group. That represents increase of 130 basis points, more than overcoming the impact from the volume shortfall, with operating improvements driven by Snap-on value creation.","Speaking to that improved profit margin, our European hand tool business, SNA Europe, was a significant contributor. Over the past few years, we've dedicated a fair amount of restructuring to that operation, and those investments, along with some strong RCI activity, are paying off. SNA Europe actually raised its profits year-over-year despite high-single-digit sales -- despite the high-single-digit sales decline that was similar to last quarter. Clearly, the overall environment in Europe remains challenged. So the rise in profitability was a big help and represents great progress.","Our Industrial business was -- which was once again impacted by the military contractions, saw gains in other critical industries like aviation and natural resources. Based on the domestic growth in oil and gas industry, you might imagine, we have significant potential in serving those customers. And we did see progress in that segment. We've expanded our large tool offering and developed new special tool applications, including tethered tools for use at height. And we recently kicked off a new program to call on key customers out in the oil and gas field, with large specialized trucks loaded with an array of tools specifically for those unique oil and gas applications. We're also working together with fuel service operations to outfit their maintenance trucks with the unique tool kits that match the requirements at these large sites.","One more point on our efforts in oil and gas, it's a global opportunity. You can see that with some of the significant wins we had in the quarter outside the U.S., in places like Latin America and North Africa. See, overall, we can see our efforts in natural resources coming together, building traction in that important industry.","We also saw a gain in the critical aviation and aerospace sector. Hereto, we have uniquely designed vans, mobile aviation technology labs calling on customers, touring the country, visiting sites, providing hands-on demonstration of our product line for those special applications, from tool control units and software, to power tools, to hand tools and specialty toolkits. Whether we access those customers with these mobile labs or with stores in MRO facilities, or with product catalogs integrated within the customer's individual purchasing systems, we are serving those customers more frequently and more effectively. And it's all driving the progress and the progress you can see in this critical sector -- in that critical sector.","Finally, in C&I, I'll speak about Asia\/Pacific. It was a mixed period. We were up in China across all our product lines, and in India. Elsewhere, activity was off, and we didn't get the overall increase we've normally seen across the region. But what we know and what we are confident in is that we are building both the physicals and position in the emerging markets of Asia. I've said it many times, the presence in the physicals, that's what's most important in this region. I mentioned last time, we opened a fourth plant at the Kunshan complex. This one's dedicated to under-car equipment. With those new capabilities, we're launching new lifts, both mid-tier scissors models that serve the OEM and higher-end shops across Asian markets, and lower cost two-post products that are important in the emerging markets for the developing independent repair shop segment. I was just in Asia last week and I saw some of the early production at that new factory, and the product looks great.","Across Asia, we've been establishing our position with a product line at the super-premium level, growing at top-end shops. Now, as we expand with added physicals, we're able to broaden that offering to serve independent garages and larger chains with mid-tier tire changes, wheel balancers and our handheld diagnostics units, which continue, by the way, to add content and vehicle coverage.","As you know, we have a state-of-the-art engineering center in Kunshan, and that team is growing, becoming better able to help localize under-car and diagnostics products. We have more local talent supporting growth in the region, with a focus on new products developed specifically for those markets.","Now on to the Tools Group. Sales were up 3.7% with a 14.4% operating margin, about 20 basis points below last year, but a strong absolute level. The growth wasn't as robust as we've seen in recent periods, but it's not a surprise that the pace didn't continue. Importantly, we don't believe there's been any significant change in the overall market.","Now there were a number of factors early in the period, including the lingering impact from superstorm Sandy, and perhaps some pause as the tax increases were digested at the beginning of the year. But the year-over-year comparison got better each month of the quarter, so the trends are good. The strength of our van channel is evident in the numbers and in the trends. Our franchisee health metrics continue to be favorable. The progress of our franchisee opportunity recently -- and the progress of our franchise opportunity recently received additional validation when the Franchise Business Review ranking was announced by the International Franchise Association. Snap-on was listed among the top large networks, improving our ranking again this year. The importance of this recognition is that it's based solely on franchisee satisfaction and independent survey in areas like training, support, operations and financial opportunity. We believe it's convincing testimony to the growing strength of the network.","New and innovative products have been one of the keys to our progress in the Tools Group. In one recent example, we launched the FLL80 ratchet to build upon the success of our innovative extended reach line. This 3\/8-inch drive ratchet has a total length of 17.5 inches. It includes the strength of our Dual 80 technology. It connects with our technicians customers for making their work easier as they face ever-growing challenges related to tighter spaces and to shrinking accessibility. That new ratchet is long. It's the longest in the industry, and it delivers superior strength and durability. It delivers the superior strength and durability always expected from Snap-on.","Our great new products aren't restricted to hand tools. Just this past quarter, we took our award-winning VERUS PRO handheld unit to the U.K. It was a success in the United States, and that momentum has continued internationally where that diagnostic unit has been extremely well received. So franchisee help, survey gains, innovative new product. We believe they're all testimony to the progress that's being made in enhancing the van network, one of our strategic, decisive runways.","I move now to the RS&I group. Sales in the quarter were up organically 9.3%, and the operating margin of 23% expanded by 150 basis points. Throughout last year, we spoke about the growth of our repair information and diagnostics products with independent repair shop owners and managers. That happened again this quarter.","But this quarter, the overall growth rate also got a real boost by increased activity in essential diagnostic tools for OEM dealerships. For independent shops, the growth is being led by new handhelds, better and easier to use. And by Repair Information Products, helping technicians fix the car faster. One of these is the new VERUS PRO full-function unit which I just mentioned. It's just received more recognition, the Best New Product Award as voted by the -- by Automotive Service Professionals at the recent Vision Hi-Tech Training and Expo, an event which is attended by nearly 3,500 industry participants.","We're building our presence in the garage, but not just at the high end or just in automotive diagnostics. This quarter, we launched with great reception our new entry-level handheld diagnostic unit, the Blue-Point MICROSCAN 3. It's an upgrade from the previous versions, and it includes a larger screen and touch capability for added efficiency. With its basic onboard scanning function, it's another great entree product, helping to make new technicians become Snap-on customers for life.","And outside automotive, in heavy duty, our Pro-Link iQ Diagnostic Unit has been upgraded. Additional repair data parameters and engine test functions with expanded coverage of engines, transmissions and breaks, all while serving an ever-growing number of models and units.","Outside of the independent automotive space, our Snap-on Business Solutions and equipment solutions businesses, which serve OEM dealerships, are also expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage. Just this quarter, we added a new electronic parts catalog -- we added new electronic parts catalog customers in adjacent sectors, industries like motorcycles and power sports. And this goes along with the increased essential diagnostic programs for automotive OEM dealerships that I already mentioned.","When we brought together the various businesses that now comprise RS&I several years ago, we believed we could leverage their capabilities to better serve repair shop owners and managers. And progress along that runway is evident in our results.","Well that's the segments. I'll conclude by sharing one final highlight. Every year in the first quarter, we hold an RCI competition that brings together teams from across the corporation to share best practices and successes in moving down our runway for improvement. In February, we had 34 teams present their story. The day always concludes with dinners -- with a dinner where awards are presented with much excitement. It's quite competitive. And this year, the champion was a team from our Kunshan facility, Kunshan, China. We believe the enthusiasm of that event, and it was evident. And the fact that a team from China was the winner is a great indicator of the depth and the reach of RCI and Snap-on. It's the foundation of our ongoing improvement, and it is strong.","Well, that's our first quarter. Continuing headwinds offset by gains in important areas, diagnostics and information for repair shop owners and managers, essential tools for vehicle OEMs and dealerships and extensions in aerospace and natural resources. When paired with Snap-on value creation, the sum of it all is that opco OI is up 120 basis points, a significant and encouraging performance.","Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?","Aldo J. Pagliari","Thanks, Nick.","Our first quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $741.7 million in the quarter increased 1.5% organically. Higher sales to OEM dealerships, increased sales of diagnostics and repair information products and continued higher sales of the Snap-on Tools Group more than offset lower sales to the military and ongoing weakness in Europe. Consolidated gross profit of $356.9 million increased $9.2 million from 2012 levels, and gross margin of 48.1% improved 80 basis points, largely due to savings from ongoing rapid continuous improvement, or RCI initiatives.","Operating expenses of $249.1 million decreased $1.1 million, and the operating expense margin of 33.6% improved 40 basis points from 2012 levels.","Total restructuring cost of $2.9 million in the quarter compared with $4 million last year. Operating earnings before Financial Services of $107.8 million increased 10.6% and, as a percentage of sales, improved 120 basis points from 13.3% last year to 14.5% this year.","Operating earnings from Financial Services of $30.5 million increased $6.6 million, or 27.6% over prior-year levels. Consolidated operating earnings of $138.3 million increased 13.9% over 2012 levels, and the operating margin of 17.6% improved 190 basis points from 15.7% a year ago.","Our first quarter effective income tax rate was 31.9%. We continue to expect that our full year 2013 effective tax rate will be comparable to our 2012 full year rate of 32.8%, but this quarter's rate benefited from the retroactive extension of the federal research tax credit and certain other business tax provisions included in the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which you'll recall was signed into law on January 2 of this year.","Finally, net earnings in the quarter of $82.8 million, or $1.40 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $71 million, or $1.21 per share last year, representing a 15.7% increase in diluted earnings per share.","Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with Commercial & Industrial, or C&I group on Slide 7, sales of $266.4 million were down 6.3% organically from 2012 levels. The decrease was primarily due to double-digit decline in sales to the military and a high-single-digit sales decline in our European-based hand tools business as a result of ongoing market weakness in that region.","Gross profit in the C&I group totaled $99 million in the quarter, and gross margin of 37.2% improved 160 basis points, primarily due to the savings from ongoing RCI initiatives, particularly in Europe, partially offset by $2 million of higher restructuring costs. Operating expenses of $68.4 million in the quarter declined $4.4 million from 2012 levels. The operating expense margin of 25.7% increased 30 basis points from 25.4% last year, primarily due to the lower sales. This was partially offset by $3.4 million of lower restructuring costs.","As a result of these factors, first quarter operating earnings of $30.6 million for the C&I segment increased $1.4 million from 2012 levels, and the operating margin of 11.5% improved 130 basis points from 10.2% last year.","Turning now to Slide 8. First quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $327.3 million increased 3.7% organically, reflecting increases across both U.S. and international franchise operations.","Gross profit of $143.9 million increased $4.9 million from 2012 levels, and the gross margin of 44% compared with 43.9% last year. Operating expenses totaled $96.7 million in the quarter, and the operating expense margin of 29.6% increased 30 basis points from 29.3% last year.","Operating earnings of $47.2 million for the Snap-on Tools Group increased $1.1 million, and the operating margin of 14.4% compared with 14.6% last year.","Turning to the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I group, shown on Slide 9. Sales of $246.1 million increased 9.3% organically, primarily due to a double-digit gain in the sales to OEM dealerships and a mid-single-digits gain in sales of diagnostics and repair information products.","Gross profit totaled $114 million in the quarter. Gross margin of 46.3% decreased 90 basis points from 47.2% last year, primarily due to a shift in the sales mix that included higher volumes of lower gross margin essential tool and facilitation products to OEM dealerships, partially offset by savings from ongoing RCI initiatives.","Operating expenses totaled $57.5 million, and the operating expense margin of 23.3% improved 240 basis points from 2012 levels. Again, primarily due to contribution from sales volume leverage, including benefits from the shift in sales mix, as well as savings from ongoing RCI initiatives.","First quarter operating earnings of $56.5 million for the RS&I Group increased 16.3%, and the operating margin of 23% improved 150 basis points from 21.5% last year.","Now turning to Slide 10. First quarter earnings from Financial Services increased $6.6 million, or 27.6%. Originations of $171.9 million in the quarter rose 10% year-over-year.","Moving to Slide 11, our quarter-end balance sheet includes $1.1 billion of gross financing receivables including $932 million from our U.S. Snap-on credit operation and $169 million from our international finance subsidiaries.","In the U.S., $745 million, or 80% of the financing portfolio, relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Excluding $5.7 million of unfavorable currency impacts, our worldwide on-book financing portfolio grew approximately $23 million in the quarter. For the 2013 full year, we continue to anticipate that the gross on-book finance portfolio will increase by approximately $80 million to $90 million over 2012 year-end levels.","As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.","Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $75.7 million in the quarter increased $10.7 million from $65 million last year, reflecting higher levels of net earnings as well as net changes in operating assets and liabilities. This quarter, we made cash contributions of $5.3 million to our U.S. pension plans, including $5 million of discretionary contributions.","Capital expenditures of $14.7 million in the quarter compared with capital expenditures of $21.8 million last year. For the full year, we continue to expect that capital expenditures will be in the range of $70 million to $80 million.","Turning to Slide 13, days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 61 days compared to 61 days as of 2012 year-end. Inventories increased $3.1 million organically from 2012 year-end levels. And on a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.9x were unchanged from 2012 year-end levels.","Our quarter-end cash position of $213.6 million, reflects the funding of $144.4 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $22.1 million, share repurchases of $21.7 million in the quarter and capital expenditures of $14.7 million. These uses of cash were largely offset by cash generated from operations, including higher levels of net income and $122.5 million of cash from collections of finance receivables. Our net-debt-to-cap ratio of 29.5% compares to 29.7% at 2012 year-end.","In addition to our $214 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit rating allows us to access the commercial paper markets should we choose to do so. At quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities.","This concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Thanks, Aldo.","Let me just summarize my perspectives on the quarter. We had the headwinds in Europe and the military. We had gains in vehicle repair and critical industries, which more than offset the continuing challenges. But what I view as most significant is that we believe we've strengthened our position along our decisive runways, enhancing the van channel. The network is stronger, and you clearly get that impression when you meet with the franchisees. And franchisee turnover was down again.","Expanding with vehicle repair shop owners and managers, our diagnostics and information products have never been more powerful or better received. Extending to critical industries, you can see our connections with aerospace and natural resources customers growing.","And building in emerging markets, our fourth factory in Kunshan is coming to light, and our Asian engineering center is growing in effectiveness. Our strength increased in each of these decisive areas, and we believe it's that progress which is most important and ensures our continued advancement.","This quarter also clearly demonstrated gains along our runway for improvement, progress propelled by the Snap-on value-creation processes. They have become part of our corporate everyday culture, and you can see it in the numbers, Opco operating margin of 14.5%, up 120 basis points; and EPS of $1.40, rising despite the challenges. We believe that the energy of Snap-on value creation and the strengthening of our positions in the 4 areas of strategic importance will enable our team to continue on its encouraging trend, as we move through 2013 and beyond.","Now finally, before I conclude, it's appropriate that I recognize Snap-on franchisees and associates. As usual, I know many of you are listening. Your enthusiasm, your capability and your dedication made our first quarter possible. For your extraordinary contribution to our performance, you have my congratulations. And for your continuing commitment to your team, you have my thanks.","Now I'll turn the call over to Mary for questions. Mary?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","How much forward visibility do you have on this military order book? And you'd indicated it was down double-digits. So I'm just wondering if that's kind of the pace that's expected over the balance of the year?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes. But what happens is, is that the base shrinks. I think I said in the fourth quarter -- we don't have the greatest visibility. We know that the military isn't the most robust of businesses. Whether we have visibility or not, it's kind of -- you read any paper or anything like that, you see both sequestration causing uncertainty around the Department of Defense, and you see the fact that troops are coming home. The difference there is, David, is that -- and I think I did say this in the fourth -- in the last conference call, the fourth quarter is our biggest quarter, the first quarter is our next highest, and then it reduces as we go to the second and third quarter. And then the second and third quarter last year, as the world progressed, we were already seeing some sort of contraction. So contractions are liable to be big. In fact, they were a little bit bigger in the first quarter than it was on a percentage basis than the fourth quarter, but the base is smaller. So we would expect the impact to somewhat reduce -- attenuate I would say.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","So is the -- so you're still expecting to be down maybe double-digits, but it becomes a less consequential part of the business, is what you're saying?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Correct. And I've sized this for people. People have asked how big it is, and the -- well, we don't give guidance by segments. Or what we've said is, is that the -- it's part of the industrial business, the critical industries, which is roughly, give or take, $400 million, a little bit over $400 million business. And we've identified 5, 6 segments in that business, the critical segments in that business, and this is one of the bigger ones. So you can kind of chop them up into 5 or 6 pieces and say okay, this is one of the bigger ones, and calendarize it like I said, fourth biggest; first, next biggest; and then second and third. That kind of gives you some directional guidance, and that's what I see coming on. We don't have the greatest visibility. And any -- much of our business is in terms of backlog. So...","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","On the RS&I business, I guess it sounds like the facilitation business has come back a little bit, and that was the source of the pressure on the gross margin in that segment? Is the facilitation business back in somewhat of a permanent way now? Or how should we think about the mixed dynamics in that segment going forward?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes. Let me give you a couple of thoughts. One is, strictly -- you have it right. But strictly speaking, the facilitation business in that business is sort of like a distribution business. We're speaking -- that's where we offer distribution services for OEM dealerships. You're appointed by Toyota or somebody else to kind of be their go-to supplier for a wide variety of products for the dealerships, for their dealership network. That's not what we're referring to here. We're referring to the other side of that, what we call EQS business, which is essential diagnostics, where an OEM manufacturer says I'd like to roll out either a hard tool -- I said diagnostics, but any essential tool, either a hard tool or a diagnostics, a laptop for a specific make of car -- and says, Snap-on, I'd like you to develop -- help us develop it and roll it out to our distribution -- well, help roll it out to our dealerships. And what happened here is we got a couple of those products -- we got a couple of those programs in place now that are rolling, and that nurtures this business. It does tend to be lumpy. So you can -- you get an award, it says -- some manufacturer, Rolls-Royce, says I'd like to rollout -- Rolls-Royce doesn\u2019t have many dealerships, but let's say Toyota or somebody, says I'd like you to roll out to my dealerships, and you do it and it takes you 5 quarters. And then there's no -- there isn't a program, so you have to replace it with another program. So it can be lumpy. Overlaid on top of that, though, David, is whether the OEMs themselves are feeling robust or more favorable. And I think -- actually, I think the 2013 forecast in North America are for what? Must be a 5% increase in the auto industry? So a 15.1% to 15.7% or something like that? So I mean, it\u2019s a small increase. So I think they're a little bit more positive here. So we're seeing little positive news there. Plus, on top -- overlaid on top of this lumpy business. Did that help you a little bit?","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. The last question -- yes, that does help. Last question, I guess, just pertains to possible acquisitions. And I guess the question is\u2026","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","What acquisition? Say that again, please.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yes. The last question just has to do with acquisitions, and I guess the question is just how much leverage would you be willing to undertake in support of an acquisition?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Oh, I don't know if I'm -- I don\u2019t know if I want to necessarily speak about that on a call or in this kind of situation. I'd just offer that -- if you look at our\u2026","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Because I'm just wondering if there was softening [ph].","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Credit [indiscernible] and you look at our operating business, we had quite a bit of powder available. So I think that's sufficient to say that. I think those questions, David, always depend on the particular opportunity that's there. It's kind of a happenstance. One of the things -- we have capability in-house who knows how to acquire, because we have people who have experience in this. We have -- I know we have a great integration team available. We are reviewing an ongoing list of possibilities, and we know we have ammo. So I think we would adjust to any kind of situation. So I wouldn't want to pen myself in, in that regard.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Leiker with Baird.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Couple of things. Let's start with the Tool business. And Nick, you had -- and Aldo, you had talked about carryover impact from Sandy and payroll tax increase having an impact. Can you characterize on an exit rate what type of growth you might have been seeing? And I don't want to get bogged down in monthly numbers at all, but were you 0 to 3 to 6? Or some characterization there of how you ended...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I don't want to speak like that, but I would -- it's hard for me to characterize, but let me try it this way. You and I have talked, spoken many times about this, and I think I've said on every conference call that we have had over the last -- I don't know, more than 2 years, when the Tools Group is rolling double-digits, I have cautioned everyone that I don't think that continues. I think we hold to our 4% to 6%, but then there's the question of how fast is the deceleration. Right? I think. And I think everybody recognized that it probably can't grow at double-digits forever, and so how does that transition occur? And that was the $64,000 question. And I think, given -- I would just talk -- and this is speculation and so on, but I would say if we didn't see the lingering effects of Sandy, which we know is a factor, because we know Middle Atlantic was down and there were other places in the regions that were down, but if we didn't see that and if we didn't see what I would consider -- I can't document this, but what seemed to be a pause associated with -- it might have been the payroll tax, it might have been other things around -- it was kind of like a boundary layer when we went over '12 to '13. I think, we would have seen a more cushioned deceleration, let's say. If that helps.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. So do you think we're\u2026","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","More expectable, would have been more expectable. I think people had certain expectations around those things, and I think this would have been a decelerated quarter. But it would have been more cushions, less abrupt.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And what kind of numbers did you see in the U.S. versus the international markets for the business?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, the U.S. -- international was below the -- I mean, international was above the U.S., because the U.S. is where we saw the impact of Sandy and the -- but the international business was also decelerated somewhat as well. So I mean, they were -- but generally, the U.S. was down more than -- decelerated faster than international.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So from your perspective then, it sounds like we've, more quickly than expected guidance to sport a 5% or 4% to 6% kind of range going forward?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, I don't want to say that I expected that. I mean, I don't -- I never knew how we would go into that. I'd simply say that I think we have an event. We had some boundary layer conditions at the end of last year and certainly the beginning of -- mostly the beginning of this year that tended to what I want to say steepen or heighten the deceleration. And I still think 3.7% isn\u2019t chopped liver, I would offer. And so we are not -- if I look at the 4% to 6% myself, I would say look, we always said we'd grow at 4% to 6% over time. We said 3.7% is reasonably inside -- a standard deviation of that, so it\u2019s the kind of variation you'd see around those numbers. So I'm not so surprised about the 3.7%. I'm simply offering that in this particular period, if we didn't have the boundary layer, we probably would have seen somewhat softened -- a softer change.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then on the RS&I side, when you look at the minority interest there at Mitchell 1, I'm suspecting that Mitchell 1 was a very strong performer there for you?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes, it was. It was. Great performance, yes.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Is that something that's tied to these roll out on the essential diagnostics? Or is that something more structural that can grow faster?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","No. Mitchell one -- let me just parse between these 2 things. I mean, make my comment about Mitchell 1. Mitchell 1 has been actually part of our -- been a good success story for some time, and it expanded that success in the first quarter. And that is not related to the essential diagnostics. Essential diagnostics is with OEM dealerships. This is fundamentally with independent dealerships, and they just seem to be growing their position with independent dealerships. They're getting better at what they do, and the dealerships are recognizing it and they're embracing it more. Now when you talk about the minority interest there's a special wrinkle -- that I might want Aldo to comment...","Aldo J. Pagliari","Yes, David. Aldo. Just -- you're correct that Mitchell 1 was a larger contributor, and 15% of Mitchell 1 is owned by outside parties. So there's a little bit more of an elimination in equity earnings for that. You'll also recall that in Q4, Snap-on divested a non-strategic entity. It was a legacy investment that was part of the ProQuest acquisition. So the earnings from that are no longer in equity earnings. So that also accounts for that lower amount that you see.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then on Mitchell 1, just one more item there, has this been driven by a change in the product, upgrading in the product offering, or more effective marketing? Or just normal market recognition over time?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Actually, I'd say both. I think we did change the product. I want to say 6, 7 months ago, we changed to ProDemand. We changed to ProDemand, which was an upgrade, kind of a new model, if you will, of repair information. A lot better navigation, same great database that's wider than anybody else and terrific, but also better navigation. People really have appreciated that. And so that's one. Two, is our marketing has been better. We've driven customer connection into Mitchell 1 pretty effectively. So they're out constantly. They've got a pretty robust process, looking at the field and getting feedback saying, how can we improve? So they've kind of got this ongoing improvement activity that's actually, I think, pretty good for a software business, that's overlaying on top of the sort of upgrades and the software. They're actually improving it based on what the customers are telling them, and we never had that before. So we're doing better at that. And then thirdly, we're expanding a little bit our reach into heavy duty and other places. So we've got a couple of other non-automotive segments in there. So all 3 of those things are in a cocktail, and it's been doing pretty well. And when it came together this quarter with the sort of diagnostic information products, the repair shop owners and managers that went up and we paired it with a pretty robust quarter for -- we've been kind of carrying the OEM dealerships for several quarters. You might remember, last year's numbers were like 0.5, 2.9, 2.7 in RS&I. Now we're up pretty well because we've got -- we're hitting on more like oil cylinders. We're still carrying 25% of European business with that business. And one of the things that happened was that SBS, the parts catalog business, got out from under the consolidation of the dealerships. That was an ongoing tail. We were even receiving some of the impact last year. That stopped now. So that's back to some upward movement.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Nick, can you -- when did you start seeing this military business slide? I'm trying to get at -- where are we at? Are we at the anniversary...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","No, we started to see it, I think -- I wanted to see -- we started to see it sort of in the middle of the second quarter, third quarter last year, like mostly the third quarter, we started to see it roll. Third quarter was weak, but it was a smaller base. It makes -- I don't think it made scrutiny in the third quarter even though it wasn't good for us.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","So really, the fourth quarter year-over-year, we should see -- that's where it kind of anniversaries then, right?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Third quarter, I'd say, too. I'd say. But the fourth quarter, clearly the big anniversary. So -- yes, that's right. That's right.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Have you been seeing the declines increase quarter-over-quarter or\u2026","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes, it increased some, but not -- I would -- arithmetically, it's a greater increase in the second quarter as a percent of a smaller base than the fourth quarter, but I would tend to say that's within the range of government work. You know what I mean? In the range of a variation that you might see on this kind of thing. So I guess it's pretty much the same decline.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then last question is, is the portfolio built to the point now where it's going to really mimic the growth in the Tools Group?","Aldo J. Pagliari","Yes. This is Aldo, Gary. I think you have that correct. There's still a small piece of tailwind that we'll pick up from CIT, but as you can see on the chart, the extended credit portfolio owned by CIT and managed by us is down to less than $10 million. So going forward, it'll mirror the growth in Snap-on Tools. But just recollect that it -- Tools, the portfolio underwrites more big ticket items. So within the Tools Group you can sometimes get a little bit of variation in the amount of big-ticket items that they sell as opposed to the lower-priced items which tend to be underwritten by the franchisees themselves. So you get a little bit of noise quarter-to-quarter. But long run, it should move in concert.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Richard Hilgert with Morningstar.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to ask a little bit more about the margins in the C&I Group for the quarter. Looking back over the past year, we've been in that mid-11% range since the quarter of last year, but the first quarter of last year it was a lot lower. Was there anything special in that first quarter a year ago that had the margins down?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","No, I don't think so. I think generally, we tend to get seasonality around first -- at different quarters. We don\u2019t have great seasonality in sales. But sometimes, you'll get OI seasonality because of -- as you open up a year, you'd be spending on kick-off type things. So you get out, you have distributors, you have people you meet, you have new programs, and you tend to roll them out at the first of the year. So often time, that's an overhang on these -- of those types of quarters. I'm not saying it happens every year, but it happened in many years at C&I, because I used to run C&I. So we think what happened in the C&I is this. You've got what? Is it 130 basis points up? And I'd say, what, 40 basis points is due to lower restructuring. And then I think you can put down the rest to RCI. And the reason there is, is because when you've got a division that's having difficulty on sales, like SNA Europe or -- you tend to be -- put your nose to the grindstone at this stuff, even though it's a way of life. Every place in the corporation, they tend to push hard. You tend to spend restructuring money, and we're seeing that come to fruition. And so we really think that the quarter we see in C&I is -- really reflects to a large degree, the improvement in productivity that we're seeing around, because there is spending associated with this ongoing, associated with the first quarter. So I don't think there was anything special last time.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","The volume operating leverage, obviously with revenues being down 7%, one might not expect you to attain the same kind of operating leverage that we saw in the last 3 quarters of last year. But yet you were still able to do that. How much -- if you didn't have that year-over-year difference in your operating leverage, what kind of margin improvement could we have expected?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I'm not sure. Let me just say -- let me just try to answer your question this way. Look, this is a relatively complex landscape as you know. As I know you know our company, and it is complex. So it's hard to say with definitive -- make a definitive statement on any particular quarter, no matter what you see. But the thing is, is that you -- we have said that if the sales were flat, just flat, we could keep raising operating margins through the effect of our Snap-on value creation. We're confident of that. And this quarter, what we saw on the 120 basis points of improvement was 10 points of restructuring, favorability; 20 points of mix, because RS&I was up and C&I was down, so there were more different profitabilities; and then the rest you can roll up to RCI, which is associated with that. So you can expect us to try to -- not in any one particular quarter, you might not be able to see it. But over time, you'll see an overlay, and you can look back and see it. You can look back and see it. So we have operating improvement every quarter. I think -- I hope that answers your question.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","To some degree. I mean, I was looking for -- well, operating leverage was this kind of a negative impact. But because of RCI, we had this much positive impact. But that's okay. I'm [indiscernible].","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","[indiscernible] how much. I hate to pin myself down on operating leverage. I mean, associated with volume? Yes, I don't like to say it -- I don't like to give you any particular number about that, but you can be sure that if we get -- as we get higher volume, we do get some operating leverage.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Right. Okay. With respect to Europe, at some point, with new car sales being down as much as they are and looking like we're going to have a 6th straight year of significant decline over there, at some point, the aftermarket has to pick back up because people are just going to have to be fixing their cars if they're going to keep them longer. Have you seen any of that yet? Or when are you expecting something like that to start occurring over there?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I'm out of the business of predicting where Europe is going. I think I predicted that it was at the bottom like 2 years ago or something. So I don\u2019t know. But look, I think this, is that Europe was down again for us. Our hand tool business in Europe was down, what, high single-digits, and it was down sort of low double-digits the last time. And we're not all in auto. We're in other businesses. So it's a broad base. Industry, construction, agriculture, a lot of other things. So it's a cocktail of things. I don't know in general when Europe will come back, but I'm confident -- we're pretty confident it will, and we're -- actually, we're pretty positive about this. We think this is one of the hidden gems about Snap-on because what you've got here is you've got a business which is improving its operational fitness. Profit is up when sales are down almost double digits, and yet we know that our customers are out there. We know that our customers still are remaining. So when the Europe comes back, we figure we're going to do pretty well on that. Okay?","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Yes, very good. On Financial Services, you're getting to the point where you're pretty much up to speed with respect to mimicking the tools as you mentioned earlier in the call. I was curious, is there any other opportunities with your Financial Services that you might be interested in pursuing in terms of providing credit services in other areas?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","No. we have said -- I think we have said that our Financial Services is hand-in-glove with our Tools Group -- with our own operations. So we view it as limited to the strategic support of Snap-on operations. We don't view it as a sort of a credit company that provides services to other things, which aren't associated with the rest for the business. We see it as financing our customers and our products and our franchisees, that's it.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from David Leiker with Baird.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Nick, just one last item here. You talked about China and how you're expanding your product range there. What portion of your product offering do you think you have available in China, Southeast Asia to deliver into the market today?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I would say we have 1\/3 right now. Maybe 40%, that kind of thing. Maybe 1\/3. You mean in terms of our overall product line? You mean in terms of the overall Snap-on product line? Is that what...","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes. I'd say about 1\/3. We have entries in virtually every category, maybe less than 1\/3. Maybe 1\/4 actually. So let's say 1\/4 to 1\/3, we are -- but we have pretty comprehensive activity. We're putting our toe in a lot of places. But our product line is quite narrow in each -- is more narrow than we have in other places, simply because you've got to start from 0, and you're trying to build up. And so that's an important thing. And a lot of this is learning the specific characterizations -- character of the customers. Not China, but just -- as we roll out into new markets like China or aerospace, you have to learn. I was just in an aerospace facility down in Indianapolis recently, and it's interesting to walk the floor of that place, 800 technicians, and you realize how different it is than vehicle -- this was our money. It was vehicle -- different from vehicle repairs. Some of the tools are held centrally. Some of them are done -- owned by each technician. The technicians don't necessarily do the same thing, so they need a different set of tools. But one thing is in common, is that they all like Snap-on. I ran into a number of technicians that said -- we had just entered this place. We started to sell there only like 3 or 4 months ago. It's part of the reason why our aerospace is up. And they said \"We're glad you're here.\" The same kind of thing happens in China. You're constantly understanding where the customer base is, what they want and adjusting the product line and then trying to Asian-ize the product line to this. So it's an ongoing process. And I would say, we've got about 25% now.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And do you think it's -- how much of your product offering do you think you could put there? Could it be 100%? Or is it only half of it?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","A version of a lot of it. I can't say. But nothing -- unfortunately, probably nothing goes exactly. We have to make changes to almost everything, and that's what we call Asianization. That's why the product line -- I think one of the mistakes people make is they try to sell what they have. And it doesn't really work. It works at the top end. That's how you enter. We entered with the top end with the super-premium brand, we're selling to the best people, and then what happens -- when you have to deal with the other people, you actually have to make products that they might want and that they -- that fit their actual situations. For example, garages in China are lot -- a lot of the garages in China are a lot smaller. So things like your under-car equipment have to be configured for that. Now it's got the same base, the same actual function, but the physicals, the geometries of it have to change. Now that might not be a tough engineering move, but it has to happen. First, you have to realize it's needed; and secondly, then you have to execute it. So we're constantly doing that. That's why I'm so excited about the engineering center.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then the last item, just following on, on that, what about your geographic footprint in Asia, Southeast Asia? Is that -- how much more work is there to build that out like you wanted to be?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","It's a lot more work in China and India. We've got a lot more work there. I think -- we could tick off the countries, I think we have more work in Indonesia. We have more work in the Philippines. We're pretty good in Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand. Those places were okay. The other places, we've got more -- a lot more work to do.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So you're still very early in this whole revenue stream coming out of Asia?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Sure. Yes. And not to mention, the repair wave is just starting to rise.","Operator","And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call over for any closing remarks back over to Leslie Kratcoski. Please go ahead.","Leslie H. Kratcoski","Yes. Just thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today and for your interest in Snap-on. A replay of the call will be available shortly on snapon.com. And good day. Thanks.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"19642":["Snap-on, Inc.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Sara Verbsky. Please go ahead.","Sara Verbsky","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review Snap-on's fourth quarter results, which are detailed in our press release, issued earlier this morning.","We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results.","After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions. As usual, we have provided slides to supplement our discussion. These slides can be accessed under the Downloads tab in the webcast viewer, as well as on our website snapon.com under the Investors section. These slides will be archived on our website, along with the transcript of today's call.","Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.","Finally, this presentation includes non-GAAP measures of financial performance, which are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for their GAAP counterparts. Additional information regarding these measures including a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and conference call slide deck, which can be found on our website.","With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?","Nick Pinchuk","Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Today I'll start with the view of our fourth quarter, give you an update on the environment and the trends we see, take you through some of the turbulence we've encountered and speak about the progress we've made. As usual, Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of the financials.","Results for the quarter, for the full year, this time include a number of special non-recurring legal tax and debt events that affected our as-reported levels. So to provide greater clarity, we're going to refer to amounts excluding those onetime effects as an as-adjusted number to make everything comparable from an overview level. And when you look through it all, Snap-on did see external turbulence in a number of areas but we offset those challenges by and large and make what I think is recognizable progress.","We saw disparity from group to group and within each group, but overall we're encouraged by our position for going forward. Fourth quarter sales of $952.5 million as reported were down 2.3%, including $17.1 million or 180 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign currency, much different than the beginning of the year.","Organic sales were about flat down 0.6%. Generally shortfalls in the OEM dealership arena and in our international franchise businesses, including the U.K. were about offset by gains in critical industries, our Asia Pacific region and the beginning growth in the U.S. van channel. From an earnings perspective, our OpCo operating income for the quarter, including the onetime benefit from a legal settlement and an offsetting impact of unfavorable foreign currency effect was $182.1 million, increasing 15.3% compared to last year, which also included legal impacts.","OI margin for the quarter, as reported, was 19.1%, up 290 basis points. On an as-adjusted basis, excluding the non-recurring items the OI margin was 18.7% compared with 19.4% in 2017. For financial services, operating income of $56.1 million was up compared to last year's $54.4 million.","As reported OI margin including both the financial services and OpCo was 23%, up 290 basis points. The as adjusted OI margin was 22.6% compared to the as adjusted 23.1% recorded last year. So we're trying to give you a comparable on this. Quarterly as reported EPS of $3.09 was $0.85 or 37.9% above last year's. On an as-adjusted basis, the EPS was $3.03, exceeding the $2.69 from last year by $0.34, an increase of 12.6%. Those are the numbers.","Now let's speak about the markets. Well, we believe the automotive repair environment continues to be generally favorable. Having said that though and in the area of serving vehicle OEMs and dealerships, we have seen some pause. We think that's likely associated with the multiple forecasts for lower new car sales and the uncertainty that often the companies they transition from a strong vehicle industry to a more moderate sales environment. Based on our past experience though, it's not clear how long that uncertainty continues. Lower new car sales can also ignite greater interest in dealer and dealership repair activity.","On the other hand, we've been hearing from our franchisees and from technicians and from the shop owners themselves that there's considerable optimism in the independent repair -- that the optimism in the independent repair shops is strong and unaffected by those the latest OEM forecasts as you might expect. So we believe vehicle repair remains a favorable place to operate.","For critical industries, we're seeing progress, significant progress, strong activity in aviation and general industry. In that arena for us, calendarization of orders can create variation from quarter-to-quarter, but our overall activity trend continues to look quite promising. We do like the trajectory in critical industries. It's very positive. And that positive extended across our C&I group including Asia Pacific, double-digit growth and as seen in the Europe showing mixed, but positive results across the continent more than offsetting the clear impact of Brexit.","We do believe we're well positioned to confront the challenges of this particular period and to make progress along our runways for growth. We're also confident that we have continuing potential on our runways for improvement Snap-on Value Creation Processes, Safety, Quality, Customer Connection, Innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement. They're constant fuel for our progress especially customer connection understanding the work of professional technicians and innovation matching that insight with technology.","We believe -- I'm going to talk about little bit, we believe our product lineup is growing stronger every day and we keep investing to make it so because we believe in our potential. So across the corporation, I would characterize our markets as mixed, positive with significant potential yet turbulent from period-to-period.","Now for the full year, sales worth $3.74 billion, an increase of 1.5% as reported and 0.5% organically, the critical industries overcoming shortfall in the vehicle OEM dealership arena and relative flatness over the year in the Tools Group. As reported OpCo margins for the year were -- was 19.4%, up 140 basis points. Excluding the onetime events, the OpCo margin percent as adjusted was 19.3% compared with an as adjusted 19.3% for last year, maintaining our profitability against the turbulence.","As reported earnings per share for the year was $11.87, up 24.7%. And excluding the non-recurring events, the EPS was $11.81, up $1.69 or 16.7% compared to last year's as adjusted number.","When we include the income from financial services of $230.1 million, which rose $12.6 million in the year, the consolidated operating margin for the corporation was 23.5% or an as adjusted -- or as adjusted 23.4%, up 20 basis points. That's the overview.","Now, let's talk about the individual operating groups and their fourth quarter results. I'll start with C&I. Reported sales for the group including $400,000 of acquisition-related volume and $9.9 million of unfavorable currency grew $2 million or 6%.","Organic sales increased $11.5 million or 3.5%. Robust performances in our Asia Pacific operation and our specialty torque division. I haven't talked about it very much before, but torque is getting bigger where particularly -- those two were particularly encouraging.","Beyond that SNA Europe -- the SNA Europe operation and the industrial division both registered low single-digit growth with mixed results across the industries and the geographies. SNA Europe recorded single-digit increases in most of the core European markets that were partially offset by a double-digit decline in the U.K. overall growth despite the well-publicized uncertainty that's Brexit in this time period.","Now, the Industrial division also showed variation across the business, up for aerospace and general industry, partially offset by some softness in natural resources in military, but overall showing a positive outlook.","C&I operating income was about flat with 2017, $50.8 million, down about $500,000 from last year. Operating margin was 14.8%, down 20 basis points, reflecting the effect of the expansion in Asia Pacific. And Asia Pacific did expand more than offset -- it expanded more than offsetting the turbulence in China by gains in other key markets particularly India but also Thailand and Indonesia.","Advances that were made possible only by customer connection and innovation. Two of our Snap-on Value Creation Processes is driving new products in markets like India, effective products like those in our Blue-Point hand tool offering. This year we added almost 300 new tools to the Blue-Point lineup and it helped drive those expanded sales on the subcontinent.","Another success in India was the Asian Dragon Imaging Aligner ideal for tight spaces. It's a high-end imaging aligner and a compact package perfect for the really small footprints of the Indian repair shops and the customers in India they seem to agree.","Also strong in C&I as I mentioned before is our specialty torque business. It's making encouraging strides, strong growth driven in part by widening array of new offerings developed by -- developed in combination with the SNA Europe and our specialty torque operations, products like our new powerful wireless torque control unit. That is -- that has been co-developed by SNA Europe and specialty torque.","Demand -- there's a demand for efficiency and autonomy across the critical markets. And with that torque precision -- the torque precision is rising in importance and Snap-on combining our long-held experience in that field with the capability of our new torque acquisitions like Sturtevant Richmont and Norbar we're poised to take advantage. And you can see it in this new unit.","The new torque control unit is a great example. It puts together Snap-on SNA Europe's industry-leading ergonomic design capabilities with Sturtevant Richmont's wireless capabilities. It also incorporates Sturtevant Richmont's unique DIN style rectangular connector accommodating a wide variety of interchangeable wrenches allowing to engage a broad array of customers like no other product in the aviation and natural resources and heavy duty and in general industry. It's another timely add to Snap-on SNA Europe's lineup and it clearly matches the industry trends, it's going to be a big seller.","Now let's talk about the Industrial division focused on critical industries, outside the vehicle garage gains now accomplished for nine straight quarters. And that trend's been driven by customer connection extending our understanding of critical work. That progress -- the progress of understanding the work can be measured in the number of new tool solutions we offer each year. Well just last year we added over 5,000 new products to our critical industry lineup. That's quite a few.","So I think you can say with -- we say with confidence, we're rolling the Snap-on brand out of the garage extending to critical industries with greater strength than ever before. Critical industries is a favorable market environment and we're amplifying that opportunity with innovative new products aimed at solving the task of -- consequence that inhabit that space. And the result is encouraging.","Now let's talk about the Tools Group. Organic sales about flat, up 0.4%, but continued growth in the U.S. operations up low single-digits, a positive that was again offset by a decline in the international operations including the U.K.","Operating income in the quarter was $57 million comparing with $67.3 million in 2017. The OI margin was 14.0%, a 240 basis point decrease. You can see that in the recent swing to unfavorable currency transactions from a positive position in the prior quarter and product mix and an increased spending to strengthen franchisee support. Those were all the drivers of that margin.","In the quarter and throughout the year, however, the Tools Group did confirm the strength and the market-leading position of our van network. And that's evident so clearly in the recent financials, but it was somewhat visible in the franchisee sales gain of the vans in the quarter and it was clear in the franchisee health metrics. Those health metrics is monitored each quarter. The franchisees and the networks are strong and the position -- and that positivity was once again acknowledged by multiple publications all listing Snap-on as a franchise of choice.","This quarter we were once again ranked among the top franchise organizations both in the U.S. and abroad. We were again recognized by Franchise Business Review, which is the latest ranking for -- which in it's latest ranking for our franchisee satisfaction listed Snap-on as a top 50 franchise making the 12th -- marking the 12th consecutive year we received that award. We were also ranked number one among all franchisees in Entrepreneur magazine's 2018 List of Top Franchises for Veterans. And abroad Snap-on was ranked number four in the Elite Franchise Magazine's top U.K. franchises for 2018.","So this is -- finishing above a number of prominent international and U.K.-only franchises. Now this type of recognition reflects the fundamental strength of our franchisees and of our van business in general and it wouldn't have been achieved without continuously investing in a continuous stream of innovative new products. And in 2018, we \u2013 once again the Tools Group increased, the number of hit products those million-dollar sellers developed from a direct observation gained in the field.","One is our Flex-Head ratcheting wrench. We just launched a full complement of these powerful problem-solvers, the ratcheting wrenches. And we've been expanding our new line continuously and the Flex-Head is the latest addition. The flexibility of the head makes it possible to access fasteners in very difficult locations alternator brackets, motor mounts, serpentine belts and suspension bolts. And we put that \u2013 the new Flex-Head together with Snap-on's durable gearing extraordinary length and low profile. It all combines for industry-leading strength, power and accessibility. It's another hit product and it makes the line of Snap-on ratcheting wrenches even stronger, even more versatile.","And believe me we've been working hard to strengthen our tool storage line-up migrating some of the premium options like power drawer and speed organizers into to mid-range, equipping our heavy-duty shops with some of the advanced options like AC outlets and USB ports and introducing our KMP1422, the mid-tier with high capacity and small footprint. And this past quarter, we introduced our new flip color schemes creating boxes that shift colors under different conditions and viewing angles, three different patterns with three distinct color shifts burgundy to bronze, blue to purple to orange and gray to blue to gold. They're brand new, but they're catching attention and selling well.","The Tools Group maybe below the growth trend, but we keep investing. We keep building its strength with new product and network vitality and it's starting to bring the U.S. channel back into its growth trajectory. Well that's the Tools Group.","Now, let's move to RS&I. Volume in the fourth quarter was $339.9 million down organically 3.5%, primarily because of high single-digit decreases in our businesses focused on vehicle OEMs and their dealerships. A turbulent \u2013 it's a turbulent period in that lumpy project-driven sector.","RS&I operating earnings of $87.4 million decreased $2.8 million, including $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency. OI margin was strong 25.7% up 40 basis points from last year with growth in innovative software and information products driving that progress.","Along those lines, our Mitchell1 division providing software to independent shops, continues to pursue customer connection and innovation bringing great new products to improve shop efficiency. An example \u2013 as an example, we just added our ADAS Quick Link to the Mitchell lineup. The new Advanced Driver Assistant System or ADAS helps technician diagnose repair and calibrate a variety of driver-assist functions making the required repair information component locations, wiring diagrams, repair procedures and recalibration processes all available with ease with incredible ease and it offers data. It offers data on products for all OEM brands. So it creates that data at the fingertips for the technicians for all the OEM brands.","Our ADAS Quick Link is unique in the industry and it clearly drives shop and technician's productivity. It makes the repair of lane departure warnings adaptive cruise control and other driver assist \u2013 other driver assist much easier. It's already received and it's \u2013 and it will be quite popular in the days ahead. Another example of how Snap-on Value Creation is authoring that continuous trend at Mitchell1. We keep driving to expand RS&I's position with repair shop owners and managers offering more new products to sell developed by the value -- our Value Creation Processes or added by our strategic and coherent acquisitions. And we're confident that it's a winning formula. Well that's our quarter.","OpCo organic sales decreased 0.6% about flat to last year. Significant positives in the critical space that is C&I, favorable trends in the Industrial business, gains in India, Thailand and Indonesia overcoming the China turbulence and the ongoing return of the U.S. van channel to growth. The impacts of near uncertainty transition to lower auto sales and a turbulence of Brexit about offset by those positive gains.","OI margin as adjusted 18.7%, down 70 basis points, still strong, but impacted by the shortfall in the van channel, the unfavorable flip in the currencies and the spending strengthening our U.S. van channel and overall as-adjusted EPS of $3.03, up 12.6%. That's our quarter.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?","Aldo Pagliari","Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide 6. Net sales of $952.5 million in the quarter were down 2.3%, reflecting a 0.6% organic sales decline $0.4 million of acquisition-related sales and $17.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales decrease this quarter principally reflected low single-digit declines in sales to repair shop owners and managers in the Repair Systems and Information segment largely offset by a low single-digit growth in the Commercial & Industrial segment.","Sales in the Snap-on Tools segment were essentially flat, but reflected low single-digit gains in the U.S. franchise operations. Consolidated gross margin of 48% grew 20 basis points, primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by higher material and other cost. The operating expense margin of 28.9% reflected 40 basis points of benefit from the $4.3 million legal settlement Nick referred to earlier. This compares to an operating expense margin of 31.6% last year, which included 320 basis points of negative effect associated with the $30.9 million legal charge incurred during Q4 of 2017.","Operating earnings before financial services of $182.1 million or 19.1% of sales compares to $158 million or 16.2% of sales in Q4 2017. Excluding the effects of the legal items in both years as-adjusted, operating margin before financial services of 18.7% compared to 19.4% last year. Financial services revenue of $82.7 million and operating earnings of $56.1 million, increased $2.8 million and $1.7 million respectively from 2017.","Consolidated operating earnings of $238.2 million and 23% of revenues including $4.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $212.4 million or 20.1% of revenues a year ago. Excluding the effects of the legal items in both years as-adjusted, operating margin of 22.6% compared to 23.1% last year.","Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 22% compared to 33% last year. Our Q4 2017 rate was reduced by 120 basis points as a result of the legal charge recorded in that period, but was increased by 360 basis points as a result of the $7 million charge related to the implementation of the new tax legislation in the U.S.. Excluding both the legal and tax charges, the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 as adjusted was 30.6%.","Finally, net earnings on a reported basis of $175 million or $3.09 per share including a $0.06 unfavorable impact associated with foreign currency compared to $129.5 million or $2.24 per share a year ago. Excluding $0.06 per share for the legal settlement, adjusted earnings per share were $3.03, up 12.6% compared to Q4, 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $2.69 which excluded the legal and tax charges last year.","Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with C&I group on slide 7. Sales of $343.7 million in the quarter increased 0.6% reflecting a 3.5% organic sales gain and $0.4 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $9.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.","The organic increase included a double-digit gain in sales in both our Asia Pacific operations and specialty tools business, as well as low single-digit gains in our European-based hand tools business and in sales to customers in critical industries. Asia benefited from a strong sales performance in India and across Southeast Asia more than overcoming lower sales in China.","Within the critical industries, continued strength in sales into the aerospace segment, as well as in general industry more than offset softer sales to the military and natural resources.","Gross margin of 38.5% decreased 80 basis points primarily due to this higher sales volumes of lower gross margin products, principally in Asia Pacific as well as higher material and other costs, partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives.","The operating expense margin of 23.7% improved 60 basis points primarily as a result of sales volume leverage. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $50.8 million decreased 1% and the operating margin of 14.8% decreased 20 basis points from 15% in 2017.","Turning now to slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $407.4 million decreased 0.4% reflecting a 0.4% organic sales increase more than offset by $3.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales change includes a low single-digit increase in the U.S., partially offset by a low single-digit decline internationally.","Gross margin of 40.2% decreased 120 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to increased sales of lower gross margin products as well as 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects and higher material and other costs.","The operating expense margin of 26.2% increased 120 basis points year-over-year primarily due to higher cost, including efforts to provide greater levels of; field, marketing and technical support for our franchisees. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $57 million decreased 15.3% and the operating margin of 14% compared to 16.4% in 2017.","Turning to the RS&I group shown on slide 9. Sales of $339.9 million decreased 4.7% reflecting a 3.5% organic sales decline and $4.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The lower organic sales, reflects a high single-digit decline in sales to OEM dealerships and a low single-digit decrease in sales of under car equipment.","Gross margin of 47.5% improved 210 basis points, primarily as a result of the shift in sales that included reduced volumes within our OEM facilitation programs, which typically feature lower gross margin products. Gross margin also benefited from RCI.","The operating expense margin of 21.8% increased 170 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the effect of lower OEM facilitation sales volumes and higher other costs. Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $87.4 million, decreased 3.1% from prior year levels. However, the operating margin of 25.7% improved 40 basis points from last year.","Now turning to slide 10. Operating earnings from financial services of $56.1 million on revenue of $82.7 million increased 3.1% and 3.5% respectively from a year ago. Fourth quarter financial services expenses of $26.6 million increased $1.1 million primarily to a -- due to a $500,000 year-over-year increase in provisions for losses on contract receivables and increases in other operating expenses.","Total provision expense for finance receivables of $16 million in the fourth quarter was the same as in 2017. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.3% in both of the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017.","The average yield on finance receivables in the fourth quarter was 17.7%, compared to 17.8% in 2017 driven principally by product mix and reflective of the credit quality of customers originating loans over the past several months. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 9.2% for both 2017 and 2018.","Total loan originations of $267.1 million increased $2.1 million or 0.8% year-over-year due to higher originations of contract receivables principally franchise finance. While finance receivable originations were essentially flat we did see some sequential year-over-year improvement in the United States.","Moving to slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.1 billion of gross financing receivables including $1.8 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio grew $16.8 million in the fourth quarter. As for the 60-day-plus delinquency trends, they are stable year-over-year and also reflect the seasonal increase we typically experience in Q4.","As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, the largest portion of the portfolio trailing 12-month net losses of $52.3 million represented 3.16% of outstandings at quarter-end, up 24 basis points year-over-year, but essentially flat sequentially again this quarter further supporting continued stabilization in the portfolio's credit metric performance.","Now turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $215.9 million in the quarter increased $22.4 million or 11.6% from comparable 2017 levels, primarily reflecting higher net earnings, partially offset by the settlement of the employment-related litigation matter.","Net cash used by investing activities of $60.8 million, included net additions to finance receivables of $38.4 million and capital expenditures of $22.4 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $135.1 million, included cash dividends of $53.1 million and a repurchase of 630,000 shares of common stock for $99.7 million under our existing share repurchase programs.","Full year 2018 share repurchases totaled 1.769 million shares for $284.1 million. As of year-end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $215.7 million of common stock under existing authorizations.","Turning to slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $17 million from 2017 year-end, including $20.8 million of unfavorable currency translation. Days sales outstanding of 67 days compared to 66 days of 2017 year-end. Inventories increased $35 million including $23.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency from 2017 year-end.","As a reminder, the increase in inventory from 2017 year-end included $20.9 million related to the recognition of an inventory asset associated with the adoption of ASU Topic 606 on revenue recognition. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.9 compared to 3.2 at year-end 2017. Inventories decreased approximately $17 million from the end of the third quarter.","Our year-end cash position of $140.9 million increased $48.9 million from 2017 year-end levels. Our net debt-to-capital ratio decreased to 24.5% from 27% at year-end 2017. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter-end we had $177.1 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.","That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2019. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. We currently anticipate that our full year 2019 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our full year 2018 effective tax rate of 24%.","I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?","Nick Pinchuk","Thanks, Aldo. Snap-on fourth quarter, near-term turbulence, the auto sales transition and the associated uncertainty and the effect of Brexit, all of that about to offset by C&I stable trajectory, continuing \u2013 the favorable trajectory of C&I, continuing to extend in critical industries, Asia Pacific progressing, overcoming China's turbulence, and the Tools U.S. recovery.","We believe strongly in our opportunities for growth and improvement. That's why we're keeping increasing our customer connection, working on innovation and launching new products. Looking forward, we see attractive opportunity and we believe we have a strong position to take advantage, a position in products. And an optimistic and capable van network, and a growing penetration of critical industry, and a building array of unique repair databases, and an expanding capability in the broad markets of Asia Pacific, all serving as an effective base for moving forward, for offsetting turbulence and for achieving a positive trajectory through 2019 and beyond.","Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates around the world. I know you more than anyone, see the turbulence today. And I know that we've been able to prevail because of your extraordinary capability, energy and dedication. For your role in our progress, you have my admiration. And for your unfailing commitment to our team, you have my thanks.","Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Curtis Nagle with Bank of America.","Curtis Nagle","Good morning. Thanks very much for taking the question. So I guess the first one. Good morning Nick, how are you.","Nick Pinchuk","Fine.","Curtis Nagle","Could you guys talk -- maybe speak just a little more specifically about why you guys are -- sounds like pretty confident that U.S. franchise business is on a trajectory of sustaining growth after a couple of years of fairly modest results on a revenue basis.","Nick Pinchuk","Yes. Look I think this is the thing. I mean there are lots of goes-ins and goes-outs in this quarter as you can listen. But the thing is, if you look at our franchise business this is the second quarter of positivity, positive growth or returning to positive growth. And we think if you look at the sales of the van, they exceeded the numbers. Now over time, the sales of the van generally equal our numbers, but sales -- our sales of the van they're sales too. Our sales are the sales to the franchisees then they sell to end customers. The end customer sales are pretty strong this quarter and they started to approach where we want the tools business to be. So we were encouraged by that. It's one data point, but we're encouraged. And then we saw how we came out of 2018 towards the end of the year they were positive. So I think we feel good about that. More than that, when you talk to the franchisees, they're optimistic. I spent a lot of time talking to them. And I look at our product line. I think or product line is nonpareil and stronger and getting stronger every day and the franchisees agree.","Curtis Nagle","Got it. And then just quickly shifting to RS&I, I don't know if you specifically commented on this, but how did the diagnostics business fare? And how are you looking at the next year? And when does the MODIS launch?","Nick Pinchuk","Yes. Well, first of all, couple of things. MODIS is an existing product. It's not a launch. It's sold very well in the quarter. The diagnostics business -- diagnostics sells primarily to the Tools Group. The Tools Group sales of diagnostics were up year-over-year. It was a less rich mix which is one of the product mix problems associated with Tools Group margins. But MODIS and SOLUS sold very well through in diagnostics.","And in terms of the Tools Group, if you signal back to the RS&I business itself there is -- the sales to the Tools Group were less than last year, but that just has to do with the inventory adjustments between the Tools Group and RS&I. I would suggest that diagnostics had a pretty robust selling period in this quarter.","If you look at Repair Systems and Information, we -- usually how we described that is the Repair Systems and Information sold to independent shops is fairly positive and they're good margin drivers for RS&I which is probably the reason why you see RS&I 25.7% up 40 basis points.","Curtis Nagle","And then how are you thinking about this year?","Nick Pinchuk","I feel I kind of like our product line when I see it coming out. I like the momentum in this year. So from quarter-to-quarter, you can -- one of the things you find as you follow us over time, you can't really hang yourself in any one quarter in terms of products as you break it down by product, but we like our diagnostic offering. They are better than anything in the market. And it's only getting stronger and providing more options for customers, for technicians. And no one can match them. And we have enhancements coming in the next year.","Curtis Nagle","All right, thanks very much. Appreciate it.","Nick Pinchuk","Good.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn","Thank you. Good morning. Can you hear me?","Nick Pinchuk","Yeah, sure. Good morning.","Christopher Glynn","Okay, great. So at C&I, the 3.5% organic was particularly striking on the comparison. You were up 10% last year. So that stood out. I'm just wondering if that equates as comparisons normalize to increased organic confidence and ability and visibility for C&I as you contemplate 2019?","Nick Pinchuk","Actually 3.5% was nice. I mean, I think if you look at over five -- C&I is one of those businesses, which tends to be more variable in terms of the -- even though it's got positive trajectory, C&I has grown -- take a look at our Industrial business, it's grown over the last five quarters like at 7% -- 7% or 8% organically. But quarter-by-quarter it's been all over the map, mid-teens and some low single digits. Because of the calendarization of those orders. That was the basis of my comments.","So we thought this quarter was nice. We had great order activity. We had -- we did well in aviation and other places, but -- in general industry, but we -- it wasn't as strong as some other quarters. So, this was a little bit of a flat period for C&I, still it was a good -- if you look at the overall trajectory it was very strong.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. Yeah, I thought so given the confidence\u2026","Nick Pinchuk","So I guess another way to say that is we have expected -- positive expectations around C&I.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. And then for SOT between mix and investment, margins were down quite a bit there. I'm just wondering, how we think about the margin run rates currently that you experience for the full year 2018.","Nick Pinchuk","We wouldn't want think something we \u2013 sorry, sorry go ahead. Sorry.","Christopher Glynn","Yeah, and just if there are any sustained headwinds if we should expect little continued pressure there?","Nick Pinchuk","The currency is going to be -- the currency flipped on us. They had 40 basis points of good news last quarter in the currency. That flipped to negative this quarter. So, part of the problem -- I usually don't mention currency, but part of the problem is that flip you can't necessarily adjust in pricing and other things that quickly, and so it was an unusual flip for us. We usually don't see it that quick.","We'll see continuing pressure, but we'll learn -- we'll deal with that in terms of market pricing and so on in RCI and so on. You're going to see some pressure on material cost and that eats up some of our RCI but we have RCI against those.","The margin mix I think was more or less kind of a phenomenon that is hard to forecast, but this was a particularly low point of the quarter. Fundamentally, last year you were selling -- you were pounding ZEUSs into the marketplace.","Diagnostics - our highest-priced diagnostic unit great margin. This time we were pounding the -- we're pushing the non-intelligent diagnostic portion of our lineup, the MODIS and the SOLUS, so those are lower margins that was pretty much what drove that. I wouldn't expect that continue -- to continue in that kind of level going forward. So I suppose that's a long way of explaining why we thought this was a lower point.","Christopher Glynn","Got it. Thank you.","Nick Pinchuk","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from David MacGregor.","David MacGregor","Nick, I guess just looking at the relatively flat Tool segment organic growth in both 3Q and 4Q I'm wondering why do you think the conversion of SFC orders was so disappointing. And I guess overall now what kind of order growth did you see from the 2019 regional kickoffs? And any reason to believe you'll see a maybe a better conversion rate on those orders than you did on the SFC orders?","Nick Pinchuk","Look I think we have said [indiscernible] come home that you can't really get failed from the SFC. The SFC orders are up and they were up, that's an encouraging event. And part of it as I tell you the sales of the van had been pretty good. So, I kind of feel okay about that.","I think if you look at the U.S., we feel -- even though the numbers aren't quite showing it yet, we see the U.S. making progress. The thing that has bedeviled the Tools group in these is the unlooked-for effect of Brexit on the U.K. and some softness internationally, but it really has offset any kind of gain we see in the U.S. And I think the U.S. gain is somewhat muted compared to what the franchisees are saying. So, I feel okay about that. I don't think -- I think the SFC kind of did its job.","David MacGregor","And the regional kickoffs your thoughts there?","Nick Pinchuk","Regional kickoffs the -- if you look at the orders that are currently coming out of the regional kickoffs into the first quarter, they looked pretty good. So, I feel okay about that. And, of course, there're always ups and downs when you go from region-to-region-to-region and from franchisee-to-franchisee, but I think, when we look at the effect -- and what we've tried to do is bring the effect in closer to those events as we did -- as you know we did in the SFC and that seems to have worked some in the regional kickoffs as well as the SFC.","David MacGregor","And you got the lower inventory turns even adjusted for the $20 million year-over-year. I guess do you feel like you're over-inventoried right now in big ticket merchandise? Or just what's the makeup of the--","Nick Pinchuk","No, no. I wouldn't say were over-inventoried in big ticket merchandise. I would say that we're adding a lot of tools. We added 5,000 different line items for Industrial last year. So, we'll keep adding to tools.","Now, you can say okay we are not getting all the sales we want. But if you look at the trajectory of our businesses, if you look at near-term maybe and get in a twist, but if you look at the trajectory of the Tools group over a five, six years, you'll see that it's more than 5%.","If you look at the trajectory of C&I, it's a little bit below where we wanted to be. Look at RS&I, it is where we want it to be. So, you get those trajectories. I don't think while we're working on the quarter-to-quarter, we think we see the long-term good and we -- and adding the number of products is part of that strategy and we see it working overtime.","David MacGregor","Okay. Just second question. You'd referenced the increase of $500,000 of provision for contract receivables. Can you -- what can you say right now about current trends and franchisee credit? And you called out franchisee health metrics. I guess what would you say as being the most bullish of the franchisee health metrics you--","Aldo Pagliari","David it's Aldo. The contract receivable provision largely reflects the leased equipment to garages. The franchisee health metrics have been steady and we experienced historically very, very low losses on the franchised portion of that.","So, -- because you're coming off of a low base, it's just you can get noise one quarter to a next. And when the K comes out you guys get to see in about a week, but you'll see on a full year basis, the provision for contract receivables are actually lower on a full year basis. So, you just get some noise quarter-to-quarter, but in this quarter, most of the adjustment relates to leased equipment to garages.","David MacGregor","Are you comfortable with current trends in franchisee credit? Are you seeing any inflections there that should be--","Aldo Pagliari","I certainly am comfortable. I'm certainly very comfortable.","Nick Pinchuk","We are comfortable.","David MacGregor","Yes. You're not seeing any inflections?","Nick Pinchuk","No. We're not seeing any inflections. In fact, if anything I think it's getting better. So I mean, I don't know \u2013 yeah, sure.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from David Leiker with Baird.","Joe Vruwink","Good morning. This is Joe Vruwink for David.","Nick Pinchuk","Yes, Joe.","Joe Vruwink","I wanted to drill into Tools Group margin a bit more so I understand the dynamic with the diagnostic product category. Can you talk about the power tools growth in the quarter? And then was that subject to additional tariff pressures at all in the quarter?","Nick Pinchuk","Power tools had some tariff pressure in the quarter, but its growth \u2013 it wasn't \u2013 I wouldn't call it a factor in the quarter power tools except that, power tools was one of the places that didn't grow in the quarter in the Tools Group. So power tools didn't have a particularly robust quarter. It had a pretty good quarter last quarter. So we kind of didn't read anything into that, but it didn't have particular growth. So it wasn't \u2013 if you're looking for the tariffs effect of that, I wouldn't call that a factor here.","The factors are the ones I called out the flip. The \u2013 if you look at the currency around the pound and the Canadian dollar and so on where they went in the last quarter and particularly the end of the last quarter, you can see that motion. And so we just didn't \u2013 maybe we should have been better at it, but we didn't get our order quickly enough. And so that 40 to 20 basis point flip was a tough one on them and then they do spin. We want them to spin and by the way we think that's paying off when you see the sales of the van. And then, if you look at the margins, the product mix, it was a particularly weak product mix compared to the ZEUS in the last quarter. That's the way it played out. And so yes you're rightly pointing out that that was a \u2013 arithmetically that was a dominant number.","Joe Vruwink","And then on the franchisee support initiatives, I understand, those are going on all the time, but they typically don't get called out in the quarterly deck. So was it a larger-than-normal investment in the quarter and if that's the case why now?","Nick Pinchuk","That's somewhat larger but the thing is part of it is, is that we \u2013 remember I said that, I wouldn't say it's like what I would call a singularity in the quarter in this quarter. But remember, when you got \u2013 when you have your intelligent diagnostics and we have more of these, I would say more complex product offerings around the new hand tools around Flex-Head ratcheting, so around the FDX, the hand tools around Flank Drive Extra and around the intelligent diagnostic you got to spend \u2013 we made a conscious decision that we had to spend more time helping our franchisees communicate the value of those sort of marketplace. So that's been growing a little bit. And we see the payoffs though. I'm telling you we think we see the payoffs.","I think the \u2013 I like the sales of the van this quarter. So I feel okay about that. Now if this is as you say arithmetically dominant you pointed out arithmetically dominating is that margin shortfall? But part of it is that, but also the margins the product mix is a big thing in that and the reversal on the currency. And then of course, you have some tariffs and some materials eating up some of our RCI.","Joe Vruwink","But I think Snap-on has a pretty good track record of making these corporate investments when you see a growth opportunity. I'm thinking about the Rock 'N Roll Cabs and the Techno vans and some of the early cycle studying the franchisees and increasing their productivity. All of those investments ultimately drove inorganic growth improvement. Is what we're seeing this quarter calling out the investment in the technical skills that are with your franchisees are better positioned to sell diagnostics. Would you expect that drives an acceleration in diagnostic growth during 2019?","Nick Pinchuk","I would expect it would drive a richening of our mix around software which it's doing and presumably a robust diagnostic sales, but also robust hand tools sales. And hand tools were nicely -- were nice in the quarter, so I feel positive about that. It's harder to -- it's harder -- it's not as easy as the Rock 'N Roll Cab because the Rock 'N Roll Cab was very palatable. Anyway, we're pretty positive about the quarter. If -- Joe, if the U.K. and the international businesses didn't find the problems associated with Brexit this would look a lot different I think.","Joe Vruwink","And then my last question on RS&I, U.S. auto sales have been plateauing around $17 million for four years. So this is probably going to be the fifth year around that level. So it doesn't really seem like there's a major change in the end market outlook and yet you're getting feedback from your sales team that the OEM dynamic has changed. Is there something else going on?","Nick Pinchuk","Well I don't know. No, I don't -- I think didn't IHS take down the market below $17 million ? Didn't Native take down the market below $17 million? So I think they forecasted down below $17 million. Didn't GM announce that they're closing a bunch of plants and therefore are drawing in their home. I think everybody's been kind of demuring on this market a lot of very public announcements. And I would suggest that that creates an aura. I'm not surprised at this at all. I think that creates an aura of uncertainty. I'm not saying that this is a long-term thing.","I think this is a shorter-term thing. I think we're feeling pretty good about next year in terms of projects. I think eventually, it's like gas prices. When gas prices go up, everybody stops driving for a couple of weeks, so I think this is the same kind of thing. That's how I view it. Now I could be wrong about this and we could be wrong, but that's the way we see it. The OEM projects have been coming down and we see some opportunities next year. So we think the effect wears off, but I think the -- it's the concern and conservatism over what's going to happen in the future.","Joe Vruwink","And then last question on the -- last question on this. So even though there might be some questions around overall industry volume there are more new vehicles launching in 2019 versus 2018 and that typically is good for your facilitation business. Would you expect that to contribute more in 2019 versus 2018 was a down year versus 2017? Does that come back for you?","Nick Pinchuk","Yes. I think so. I mean, of course famous last words. You know what I mean? But, yes.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.","Bret Jordan","Good morning guys.","Nick Pinchuk","Hi.","Aldo Pagliari","Hi, Bret.","Bret Jordan","I guess on the Tools Group margin again. I guess, I was thinking about that franchise support spend. And I guess, also you talked about lower margin mix. Was there anything I guess either accelerated rate of promotions this quarter year-over-year? Or maybe you could talk specifically about tool storage and whether your volumes were up year-over-year and sequentially in that base?","Nick Pinchuk","Tool storage was okay. Tool storage volumes were up. I don't think there was anything particularly special about the promotions around tool storage. So I would suggest that there were special things around promotions around diagnostics. And I don't think -- we see these things from time to time.","But remember, what we did was, we had been pushing the intelligent diagnostics, the software packages, the Apollo and the ZEUS, with the data packages for, what, three quarters? And so we've been pounding nose. And there are other customers who are a little bit less software receptive and want to look at the non-intelligent diagnostics, the non-enabled products that are MODIS and SOLUS.","And so it came their time and so we pushed those. And generally, when you do that, you do put promotions around it to get franchisee attention and give customers a reason to buy. And that's what happened in this situation. And the comparison to last year, which was rolling out this new product, the ZEUS, the best thing since sliced bread and it is, it's a tough comparison.","Bret Jordan","Okay. And then, I guess, one question on the OEM side. And this is sort of big picture, but do you see the OEM sort of pushing more towards an OE toolset in the sense that, I guess, the Fiat Chrysler is now encrypting the OBD port. They haven't activated it yet, but sort of trying to protect their software internally. And are they -- are the OEMs pushing their own as opposed to outside buys now as the bigger structural?","Nick Pinchuk","I don't think that's a factor. I don't think that's a factor for us. It's always something we watch Bret, but I think for a dog's age, they wanted to take more of the repair back, but they haven't really been successful in doing that. I mean this is -- what you're talking about in Chrysler, is just the latest iteration of that effort I think. We watch it carefully, but I don't think it's an impact on what I'm talking about.","What I'm talking about I think is more or less that fewer projects were done in the last couple of years -- in the last year and I think that had to do with the anticipation of uncertainty associated with this and the dealership themselves. I mean AutoNation talked about restructuring, I think, the other day.","And they're talking about in U.K., they talked about 40% less investment in dealerships. And so, you have all that stuff rolling through the industry. I just think these guys are getting up every day and getting bad news for breakfast and they're pulling in their horns a little bit. After a while, they start saying, wait a minute, I don't have new car sales, but I better get some parts and service sales.","Bret Jordan","Okay. So you don't see it, it's just lower spending, if not a reallocation of where they are spending?","Nick Pinchuk","I don't think so. No we're not seeing that.","Bret Jordan","All right. Thank you.","Nick Pinchuk","Yeah. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time there are no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the floor back over to Ms. Sara Verbsky.","Sara Verbsky","Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com.

Today's conference is being recorded. ","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski. Please go ahead.","Leslie Kratcoski ","Thanks, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on\u2019s first quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning and with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.","As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on our website next to the audio icon for this call. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript of the call.","Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.","With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?","","Nicholas Pinchuk ","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. As usual I'll start today\u2019s call with the highlights of our quarter. I'll give you my perspective on the results, on our markets and on our progress. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.","Our first quarter results were encouraging. They demonstrate clear progress along our runways for both growth and improvement. Our sales were up 6.2% from last year. The operating margin expanded by 100 basis points and the earnings per share increased 15.7% to $1.62. The organic sales increase was 5%. ","Challenger Lifts, which you'll recall, we acquired in the second quarter last year, added another 15.2 million which along with an 80 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign exchange rates brought our total sales for the quarter to 787.5 million. ","The EPS rise included an opco operating margin expansion to 15.5%, up from 14.5% in 2013. Financial services operating income increased to 34.4 million from last year\u2019s 30.5, driving the consolidated numbers to -- operating margin to 18.6%, also up 100 basis points. Both the operating margin and the total margin were up 100 basis points. ","From a macroeconomic standpoint, our automotive repair related businesses, the Tools Group and the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group, they\u2019ve enjoyed a reasonably favorable environment for quite some time. And I'd say there is no real change. Now RS&I overall organic activity was up only slightly. But that primarily reflects the wind down of a major OEM program rather than any real change in market dynamics. You\u2019ll also remember that C&I is where the majority of our headwinds have been concentrated. So that\u2019s an area where I think is worth more -- a more discussion is warranted.","And as you can tell from the group's, 10.4% organic rise, there were encouraging gains backed by some evolution of the environment. In Europe, one of the big highlights of our fourth-quarter was the lessening of our headwinds. And in conjunction with that, the first upturn in sales we've seen in some time for our European-based hand tool business, SNA Europe. ","Encouragingly, our first quarter was up again. So that\u2019s a real positive. And SNA Europe is a solid contributor to C&I\u2019s current growth. But I would characterize the C&I performance this quarter less about market improvement and more about day-to-day business progression. For example, we did see some important advancement in our extension to critical industries. It\u2019s an area we've been focusing on, and it\u2019s paying off. ","At the same time, we\u2019ve moved past the most difficult comparisons related to the reduced military spending and that's allowing the European contributions in critical industry gains to shine through, without as much year-over-year military offset to mask the progress. So many of our markets remain strong and the headwind of Europe is abating. But headwinds do remain. The current situation in Eastern Europe does create an overhang and that did have an impact on our businesses. ","And while the military comparisons are not as challenging, the absolute spending in that sector remains depressed without any near-term indication of a return to past levels. But generally at the end of the day, there will always be headwinds. And we do believe that, no matter the market environment, we're well-positioned to continue advancing down our four defined runways for growth enhancing the franchise channel, extending into the critical industries, expanding Snap-on\u2019s presence in the garage and building in emerging markets. ","And along with that progress, that advancement, we believe that the Snap-on value creation processes of safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement or RCI will extend our positive performance trend and continue to drive us down our ample runways for improvement.","And as I speak of the segment results, I\u2019ll highlight some of the advancements in both growth and in net improvement. Let\u2019s start with C&I. Sales in the quarter were up organically by 10.4%, the operating margin reached 13.5%, up significantly from last year\u2019s 11.5%. Related to those sales, there were gains in each of the group\u2019s operating units and as I already mentioned, one of the real highlights was a second consecutive quarter of growth for SNA Europe. We\u2019re starting to see a trend in Europe and we also saw a double digit rise in our industrial division where we have our primary focus on the spending to critical industries. And in that area, we had some big wins particularly in aviation. Also noteworthy in Asia was solid growth in important markets like India and the Philippines, much of that was driven by our expanding undercar equipment line-up that was made possible by the further significant ramp up of the production at our Kunshan plant.","The C&I quarter saw benefits both from higher sales and from RCI. You can see it in the rise of the OI margin, up 200 basis points. Regarding the margins, SNA Europe deserves mention. Even before the volume started coming back late last year, that operation was contributing some noticeable profitability increases and that improvement continued again this quarter now amplified by the aid of volume. ","As for the industrial division and the robust growth in that business, the activity this quarter with customers and then critical aerospace sector clearly demonstrates traction. That area has been a primary focus of our extension into critical industries and the results are showing through with some large win. I said for quite some time that there is a bit of learning curve in understanding the customers in critical industries with the same level of insight we have with automotive technicians.","Now we are making progress with customer connection spending time in the work places, launching innovative new products based on those observations, for example -- and for example we\u2019re participating side by side at customer sites in RCI events and in safety training, becoming more familiar with the work, with the challenges and with the needs of our customers. You see RCI and safety are often directly related to making the work easier and safer with the right tool, and that\u2019s our business.","Speaking to the right tool, I want to highlight a couple of new products that demonstrate customer connection and innovation applied to (south) [ph] critical test. We recently launched a new design of cutters called the cushion throat cutter. They were designed specifically for use in aviation where aero tools or material commonly referred to as foreign object damage, they can cause big problems in an engine. While we took our standard power edge cutters but added a feature that catches wire other material that was cut -- that other material that gets cut preventing it from flying off and causing troubles. This is a good example of job insight offering new tools and building our presence. In this case in the critical aviation sector a simple idea based on customer connection that makes a great difference.","Oil and gas another area of focus and we have an expanding offering for applications in the oilfields, in power plants and in offshore rigs. Our visits to those sites recently highlighted the field technicians' struggle with making valve adjustments on the natural gas engines that are prevalent in that environment. As a result of that observation, we developed our new pass through socket to solve that particular problem creating just the special geometry that ends the struggle, another clear example of customer connection and innovation coming together to make work easier in a critical application.","So that\u2019s a bit of colour on the C&I progress. Now on to tools, the tools group. Sales were up 6% organically, operating margin up 14.3% compared to 14.4% last year, including in the quarter 50 basis points of unfavourable currency impacts from our operations in Canada and Australia. Our organic growth for the past four years of 9%, 9.2%, 10.7% and 7.6%, certainly speaks to the improved position of the tools group. And the growth this quarter following on the heels of that kind of sustained trend demonstrates the success we\u2019ve had on this decisive runway for growth, enhancing the franchise channel.","But the enhancement is not just about sales, we see the progress in many places in the metrics we track, in the low franchisee turnover, in the high enthusiasm, in the external validation by independent surveys of our franchisees, they all confirm substantial progress. Much of the strength we've seen could be tied to the great innovative new products that Snap-on has to offer when showing up every week at repair shops. Products like the MODIS Ultra handheld diagnostic unit, faster with a bigger full colour touch screen and our Fast-Track Expert information, it\u2019s launched last year in the U.S. it\u2019s been a big success and it\u2019s helping to drive big ticket volume.","During this quarter, we brought the MODIS Ultra to the UK and to Australia, it\u2019s been well received in both markets and has contributed significantly to our international growth. Also speaking on new products and innovation, you might recall the S6810 Flip Socket, the MOTOR Magazine Top 20 award winning tool, we introduced last year. Sounds simple. A two sided socket, 8 millimeter and 10 millimeters on opposite sides, very common sizes on under body panel. ","The new socket can be quickly flipped for convenience, and removing panels with only one tool. It\u2019s a real timesaver and as a consequence, a big success. We have taken that idea and expanded it to other common sizes, adding a 13 millimeter and 15 millimeter combo, and specifically for European mix a 9 millimeter and 11 millimeter combo. And for Asian model, a 12 millimeter and 14 millimeter combo were sold in a set to span a range of vehicles a technician is likely to see, and a design to be used what our Snap-on CT power tool series. That combination is now one of this year\u2019s hit. ","When it comes to new product innovation, you think that there might not have been much opportunity in a product line like a ratchet. They\u2019ve been around a long time. But actually we've been growing in that category over an extended period based on customer connection, innovation and design capabilities. You see preferences differ greatly among technicians depending on the mix of vehicles they encounter and the pairs on which they focus. So we take an advantage of those varying needs by introducing multiple ratchet designs and features against the relatively standard offerings of our competitors. I\u2019ll mention one of those variations.","Our quarter inch drive extended reach series, it incorporates an extra-long handle, we believe the longest quarter inch drive available anywhere. It reaches hard to access areas and allows a greater leverage. It also has a quick release mechanism for those who want speed and I am fortunate incorporates our Dual 80 technology for strength and durability, another hit product, innovation even in a fully established line like ratchet, finely related to the tools group and its growth. ","I want to mention our financial services segment. Aldo will speak of that area in some detail, but I just want to highlight the strategic importance of financial services at Snap-on, and how important it's been to the advancement, especially in those big ticket categories of diagnostics and tools storage. Those products has helped blaze the trail enhancing our franchisees and Snap-on credit continues to be an essential and strategic player in that progress.","Let\u2019s move to RS&I. The results were encouraging, but not as straightforward as for the other groups. Overall sales were up 6.7%, the operating margin at 22.1% compared to 22% last year. We did have higher restructuring charges this year that reduced margins by about 60 basis points, and adding in the lower margin Challenger sales also had an impact. These two items more than offset, was in fact a reasonable profit expansion in RS&I authored by rapid continuous improvement. ","The overall RS&I sales gain included 15.2 million of Challenger lifts with only a small organic increase, reflecting primarily the wind-down of some essential tool programs at the OEM dealerships which we discussed quite a bit last year, if you might remember. As many of you know the essential tool business does tend to be a bit lumpy, thus the tough comparison in the OEM space. I will say that in this year\u2019s first quarter, we also had some new programs. So we actually don\u2019t see the OEMs are pulling back. ","This comparison just reflects the nature of this type of business and that lumpiness largely offsets the real progress with the diagnostics and repair information products we're selling into independent shop owners and managers. We have seen those increases with independents for some time and the gains continues in the first quarter. It\u2019s an encouraging picture. The combination of new handheld diagnostic units, repair information, the expert knowledge of Mitchell 1 SureTrack offering along with under car equipment line up of tire changes, imaging of liners and lifts, have established significant momentum with both individual and independent shops, and with a large multi-location repair chains.","We have also broadened or medium and heavy duty product offering over the past years, adding specially aimed repair information and diagnostic units. And its paid off. We had a significant win in recognition recently in this heavy duty sector when our diagnostic information from Mitchell was integrated into Navistar\u2019s Oncommand Connection Remote Diagnostic and Fleet Management System. The combination is designed to increase vehicle uptime and provide improved fleet management efficiency. ","It will give more shops across to merit a greater access to the broad range of the Mitchell 1 features that make repairing all makes of commercial trucks, class IV through VIII easier with engine fault code diagnostics repair procedures, wiring diagrams, test steps and removal or installation instructions. It\u2019s a one clear example of building positions with garage owners and managers in the heavy-duty space. And that growing presence is driving new business with large organizations that run mixed fleet, car and truck, they need to support both vehicle types, and increasingly Snap-on has the answer. Because of that, we're seeing more fleet business with big companies, with utilities, and with governments both city and state. ","Now the strength of the RS&I portfolio was also evident this past quarter at the National Automotive Dealer Association show, the NADA show in New Orleans earlier this year. Our operations came together under a tool shop solutions, a total shop solutions banner, it allows Snap-on to clearly demonstrate the depth and breadth of our offering to support OEM dealerships and the Challenger acquisition has been an important part of that depth, that portfolio. We believe that operation would be -- we believe when we acquired it, that that operation would be a fine addition to Snap-on and RS&I and that\u2019s certainly proven to be true.","As evidenced, I\u2019ll just point to the lift that Challenger develops specifically for the quick service space that are becoming so common in OEM service centres. It\u2019s gotten some strong endorsements and it\u2019s another example of how we\u2019re able to expand the Snap-on presence with repair garage owners and managers.","So to wrap up RS&I, we see new diagnostics and repair information for cars and trucks and a growing under car equipment line that now includes Challenger lifts, progress with independence with multi-location automotive repair chain and with the important medium and heavy duty segment; we see positive trends and improved position with repair shop owners and managers. So that\u2019s the highlight of our quarter, growth and improvement.","Sales up 5% organically, overcoming the remaining headwinds. OI margins 15.5%, up 100 basis points. C&I strength with critical industry showing their potential, the tools group growing again continuing to enhance our franchise network with success. RS&I building its position and its product line with particular success and independent shops and financial services raising its contribution both financially and strategically. It was another encouraging quarter.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aldo for a review of the financials. Aldo.","Aldo Pagliari","","Thanks Nick. Our first quarter consolidated operating results, I summarized on Slide 6, net sales of $787.5 million in the quarter increased $45.8 million or 6.2% from 2013 levels reflecting sales gains across all segments. Organically, sales increased 5% excluding $15.2 million of sales from the Challenger Lifts acquisition and an unfavourable $5.9 million impact from foreign currency translation. The 5% organic sales increased primarily reflect sales gains in our businesses serving critical industries as well as those calling out automotive technicians and providing diagnostics and information products and independent repair shop owners and managers.","Consolidated gross profit of $378.7 million increased $21.8 million from 2013 levels. The gross margin of 48.1% in the quarter was unchanged from prior year levels. As savings from on-going rapid continuous improvement or RCI, initiatives were largely offset by unfavourable foreign currency effects and the impact of lower margin Challenger products. Operating expenses of $257 million increased 7.9 million while the operating expense margin of 32.6% improved 100 basis points from 33.6% a year ago primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage and the effects of the Challenger acquisition partially offset by inflationary and other cost increases.","As a result of these factors, operating earnings before financial services of $121.7 million in the quarter including $5.3 million or 60 basis points of unfavourable foreign currency effects increased to $13.9 million and as a percentage of sales, improved 100 basis points to 15.5%. Operating earnings from financial services of $34.4 million increased 12.8% over prior year levels. Consolidated operating earnings of 156.1 million including $5.4 million or 60 basis points of unfavourable foreign currency effects increased 12.9% over 2013 levels and the operating margin of 18.6% improved 100 basis points from 17.6% a year ago.","Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 31.6% compared with 31.9% last year. Finally, net earnings in the quarter of $95.9 million or $1.62 per diluted share compared to net earnings of $82.8 million or $1.40 per share last year, representing a 15.7% increase in earnings per share.","Now let\u2019s turn to our segment results. Starting with the commercial and industrial or C&I group on Slide 7, sales of $290.6 million in the quarter were up 10.4% organically primarily due to sales gains the customers and critical industries as well as continued sales increases in our European based hand tools business. Gross profit in the C&I group totalled $112.7 million in the quarter. Gross margin of 38.8% improved 160 basis points over 2013 levels primarily due to benefits from higher sales, $2.1 million of lower restructuring cost and savings from on-going RCI initiatives.","These gross margin improvements were partially offset by $4.1 million or 100 basis points of unfavourable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $73.6 million in the quarter increased $5.2 million over 2013 levels primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 25.3% improved 40 basis points primarily reflecting benefits from sales volume leverage partially offset by inflationary and other cost increases.","As a result of these factors, first quarter operating earnings for the C&I segment of $39.1 million including $3.3 million of unfavourable foreign currency effects, increased $8.5 million from 2013 levels and the operating margin of 13.5% improved 200 basis points from 11.5% last year.","Turning now to slide eight, first quarter sales in the Snap-on tools group of $343.6 million increased 6% organically reflecting mid-single digit increases in both our U.S. and international franchise operations. Gross profit of $148 million increased 4.1 million from 2013 levels while the gross margin of 43.1% decreased 90 basis points from 44% last year, largely due to $2.9 million or 50 basis points of unfavourable foreign currency effects. ","Operating expenses of 98.8 million in the quarter increased $2.1 million from 2013 levels, primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 28.8% improved to 80 basis points from 29.6% last year reflecting benefits from sales volume leverage partially offset by inflationary and other cost increases. As a result of these factors, operating earnings of $49.2 million for the Snap-on tools group including 2.1 million or 50 basis points of unfavourable foreign currency effects, increased $2 million from prior year levels the operating margin of 14.3% compared with 14.4% last year.","Turning to the repair systems and information or RS&I Group showed on slide nine. Sales of $262.7 million increased 16.6 million or 6.7% from 2013 levels excluding 15.2 million of acquisition related Challenger sales and 0.7 million of favourable foreign currency translations. Organic sales were up slightly as gains in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to repair shop owners and managers were largely offset by lower sales to OEM dealerships including the wind down of an essential diagnostic distribution. Gross profit of $118 million in the quarter increased $4 million over 2013 levels. Gross margin of 44.9% decreased 140 basis points from 46.3% last year primarily due to the impact of lower gross margin Challenger products and $1.8 million of higher restructuring cost partially offset by continued savings from RCI initiatives.","Operating expenses totalled 59.9 million in the quarter and operating expense margin of 22.8% improved 50 basis points from 23.3% last year largely due to benefits from sales volume leverage and the effects of the Challenger acquisition partially offset by inflationary and other cost increases. ","First quarter operating earnings of 58.1 million for the RS&I Group increased 1.6 million from prior year levels. The operating margin of 22.1% in the quarter declined 90 basis points from last year as lower margins associated with Challenger and a 60 basis point impact from higher restructuring cost more than offset benefits from the on-going RCI initiatives.","Now turning to slide 10, in the first quarter, earnings from financial services of 34.4 million increased 12.8% and revenues of 50.2 million increased 14.1% in both the first quarters of 2014 and 2013 the average yield on finance receivables was 17.5% and the average yield of contract receivables was 9.5%. Originations of $202.1 million in the quarter increased $30.2 million or 17.6% compared to 2013 levels. ","Moving to slide 11, our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately 1.3 billion of gross financing receivables including 1.1 billion from our U.S. Snap-on credit operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. During the first quarter, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew approximately $28 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to in line with our expectations.","Now turning to slide 12, cash provided by operations of $88.3 million in the quarter increased $12.6 million from comparable 2013 levels primarily as a result of higher 2014 net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $50.9 million included $30.3 million to fund the net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of 18.3 million in the quarter compared with $14.7 million last year.","Turning to slide 13, days sales outstanding for trade and other receivables of 65 days compared with 62 days at 2013 year end. Inventories increased $18.2 million from 2013 year end, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions as well as to improve service levels. ","On a trailing 12 month basis, inventory of 3.8 times remained consistent with our year end levels. Our quarter end cash position of $127.8 million decreased $89.8 million from 2013 year end levels primarily as a result of the March 2014 repayment of $100 million of unsecured notes at maturity. ","In addition, the net decrease in cash also reflects the impacts of funding 169.7 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $25.6 million and share repurchases of $22.1 million as well as 18.3 million of capital expenditures. These uses of cash were partially offset by $139.4 million of cash from collections of finance receivables, $88.3 million of cash from operations and $12.8 million of cash from stock purchase and option plan exercises.","At the end of the first quarter, our net debt to capital ratio was 25.5%. In addition to our $128 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper market should we chose to do so. At quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities. ","With that I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick.","Nicholas Pinchuk ","","Thanks Aldo. Well as I said at the start, we are encouraged by the quarter. We believe the results are more clear evidence of potential and they are added confirmation of what we\u2019ve been saying for some time that as we look forward, Snap-on has abundant and wide runways for both improvements and for growth. We believe the quarter\u2019s performance adds to a long trend which reinforces that outlook.","We are moving down our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise network, sales growing by 6% new products strong franchise metrics and a credit company is amplifying that strength. Expanding repair shop owners and managers, new diagnostics and information products, growing stronger with independent shops, Challenger Lifts giving us more to sell, extending the critical industries C&I growing organically at 10% with over 200 basis with an over 200 basis points increase in OI margins and building in emerging markets, ramping up our new lift factory and growing even in a place like India where economic and election uncertainty are major headwinds today.","We\u2019re also progressing down our runways for improvements, Snap-on value creation, safety, quality customer connection innovation and RCI driving margin gains. So we\u2019re encouraged by the continuing trends, but we believe there is much more ample opportunities and clear runway for growing and improving. And we believe that with the inherent advantages we hold, the investments we\u2019re making and the capable team we\u2019re enlisting, we will extend on a positive trend for the foreseeable future.","Before I turn the call over to the operator, I believe it\u2019s appropriate to speak to our franchisees and associates. I know that once again, many of you are listening. The encouraging results of the first quarter and the positive trends we\u2019re demonstrating are direct result of your extraordinary capability and your continuing commitment. For the role you play in our on-going achievement, you have my congratulations. And for your unfailing dedication to our team, you have my thanks.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll take our first question from David Leiker with Robert Baird.","Joe Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co.","","Hi good morning. This is Joe Vruwink on line for David. I wanted to start, is it possible to quantify any impact weather might have had on the tools group in the quarter? I\u2019d imagine some of the van routes were impacted and obviously fewer repairs are going on, mechanics have less money in their pockets. So, anyway to quantify that?","Nicholas Pinchuk","The short answer is no. My response to that it\u2019s always something. And so yes, we had some tough winter and routes were attenuated in some time and I rode a number of these vans and when you stop at garage, I think I said this on the last call. Some guys say business is great, because we\u2019re tearing up transmissions and chassis are getting bumped around and so there is lot of business here. Other people are saying, hey the business is terrible. So it\u2019s hard to quantify it. Certainly it might have imposed some cauterization on us a little bit. But I think for our perspective, we\u2019re not really looking at it as something that is that unusual, just something that comes up and we manage over it.","Joe Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co.","May be as the quarter progressed, so we obviously started getting better weather in March, April has been a little bit better I suppose, has your sales activity picked up kind of in line with that cadence?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Well yes, but it's hard to quantify Joe because to tell you the truth last year, if you looked at last year we had people seem to go on a sabbatical in early January, so we had a kind of back end loaded cauterization, it tends to happen from time to time from quarter-to-quarter. So there isn\u2019t always great intelligence looking from months to months. So yes, we did see some uptick but I am not sure you can read that much into that.","Joe Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co.","And then just looking at the origination growth and financial services, if I kind of use that as a parameter for activity in the tools business 18% obviously a lot higher than the 6% organic growth for the segments. Is there a way to kind of understand the disconnect there and is 18% so parameter for barometer for just generally\u2026","Nicholas Pinchuk","What I can give you -- unfortunately from quarter to quarter, it\u2019s hard to tie it exactly because there is a -- what we say is and you have probably heard us say this over and over is that the originations should roughly follow the growth of the tools groups big ticket items which is primarily tools storage in some of the larger diagnostics. So a matter of fact over the last several quarters and in again this quarter, big ticket grew greater that the tools group in general so you have that factor.","Now in the full year we believe that comes out roughly parallel as the originations and big ticket sales roughly parallel, tools group big ticket sales and originations roughly are parallel and all work out. But from a quarter to quarter remember, we\u2019re recognizing a sale to a franchisee. He is not necessarily selling it right away onwards, he necessarily doesn\u2019t do the deal, so you have some disconnect in terms of cauterization as you cross over the month, so it\u2019s very hard to tie quarterly numbers between originations in the tools group. I will tell you that it is indications that tools group big ticket sales were sold at higher rates year over year than the average tools group and that\u2019s true in this quarter.","Joe Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Okay. And then...","Nicholas Pinchuk","Other than you can\u2019t really draw much from one quarter.","Joe Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Sure, that makes sense. Switching across the pond and looking at Europe, you talk a lot about runways for growth and I\u2019m just wondering what\u2019s the runway in Europe not only from revenues, but Nick you think restructuring Europe C&I I think your entire 10 year at Snap-on, so what could be the OpEx goal?","Nicholas Pinchuk","It seems like it. I hate to comment on Europe anymore because I am usually wrong. But the thing is look, what happened in Europe, what\u2019s happened in Europe is we have been continually applying Snap-on value creation, improving our productivity and efficiency even in the darkest of downturns, we have said that our customers have not gone away therefore in doing this whether it\u2019s restructuring, in closing facilities or in creating efficiencies we have not removed productive capacity. So as I said in my remarks, that started to come home with positive traction several quarters ago where SNA Europe our European hand tool business was showing improvements and profitability even as the sales were going down. ","And now with the sales going upwards, it adds that, that leverage adds that because there is good leverage because we didn\u2019t take out any productive capacity. Remember that when you talk about where is Europe and as Europe turn the corner and what\u2019s happening in Europe, it\u2019s still down 20% to 25% from the peak. So we\u2019re coming, we\u2019re literally coming off the canvas. So while we\u2019ve had two quarters, I am still from Missouri to see where we\u2019re going for a longer term, still it\u2019s a positive event and it contributed nicely to C&I although it was not the only contributor to C&I.","Joe Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Okay. So when I think about your former peak margin in C&I at 13% in 2008, you're doing 13.5 now and so with Europe 20% or 25% off the top, fair to say that there is still a lot more upside there?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Sure I\u2019ve always said that I believe there is a lot of runway in C&I actually I am pretty bullish about the C&I business, it\u2019s just that C&I been the repository of headwinds I think, they have military, they had the European headwinds and so on, so they\u2019ve had some difficult bumps, but we feel confident about that business, SNA Europe, the critical industries those are great businesses.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Liam Burke with Janney Capital Markets.","Liam Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Nick you talked about the Snap-on tools doing well internationally. Is one country or another doing particularly well or are you seeing just very solid international growth?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Well, generally I would say if you look back over, I think I talked about Snap-on tools growing over the years like 9% and 9.2% and 10.7% and 7.6% last year and if you look over the 16 quarters that are involved in that international grew pretty well in general. This particular quarter, UK grew nicely, better than -- about may be little bit better than the average. Canada grew even more. Australia actually was down slightly, down slightly. Some of that could have been currency. The tools group, man they got hammered with currency in terms of transaction because you\u2019ve got the Canadian dollar weakening and you got the Aussie dollar weakening versus the U.S. dollar where we make the products we\u2019re moving into those markets and U.S. dollars we\u2019re shipping them in, and so does transaction impact. And so that played out a little bit in the Australian volume I think. UK has been across the company, pretty strong. I think on balance, you could say international is pretty good, but color in this quarter, Australia is may be feeling the weight of the currency problem a little bit.","Liam Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, great, and Aldo you had DSO step up three days. Is that timing or is this something different? Is it more international?","Aldo Pagliari","I would say above one-day due to the timing of sales where they fall in the collection cycle. But what you are seeing there, you\u2019re spot on. The international mix is a little bit more robust. The term structurally in the international markets tends to be longer than that in the U.S. And then behind-the-scenes you have the fact that military is a little bit less than what it had been in prior years. The government's pays quick and the governments often times even uses credit cards. So that always helped to be a sole calculation. ","And then finally, if you look at emerging markets, those places that have some spot liquidity issues, places you look like at China, India, Brazil, you have a lot less cash-and-carry business, and the result, in distribution circles there you have to provide little bit more structural terms. That's normal. It goes with the terms, so as those markets mature, in our presence, and then mature, I think you will see a little bit more classic dated outstanding rather than cash-and-carry type activities. ","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And we will take our next question from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.","Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Good morning all, can you hear me, all right, because I am on a cellphone?","Nicholas Pinchuk","We have a little background, but we can hear you fine.","Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","That\u2019s because I\u2019m at the airport but anyway, Nick when you look at that dealer business, you said those re-facilitations were winding down. If you back out some of that business that\u2019s winding down, do you have a sense of just what the growth was just to dealers overall?","","Nicholas Pinchuk","I don't have a dealer overall growth, but I'd say it\u2019s -- if you look at our -- one of the things that I wanted to say was is that I think we said in the call that RS&I would grow without the wind down of the dealerships. And we think it'd be mid-single digits, that kind of growth, if you pull out that OEM lumpiness. If you went back to our earnings calls last year, it was growing, we had some pretty good growth in RS&I; we are saying that some of that was accelerated by some of these movements. So, we said overtime that RS&I, the margins can be moved by that and also the growth can be a little bit lumpy. We are actually pretty pleased with it because the other businesses, particularly in the independent space are growing nicely.","Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, it just makes sense because the dealerships are doing well too overall. And then, in terms of -- do you have any facilities business, et cetera in the Ukraine?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Yes, we have some business in the Ukraine. We have a sales office there. But its peanuts, you know, I mean really Ukraine is not -- it\u2019s a very-very small exposure at the Ukraine. If you talk about the Ukraine and Russia, it\u2019s a little bit bigger, but it\u2019s still a smaller piece of the business, maybe 1% of the total for the organization. And that business, and these numbers are down, already and these numbers are down multiple decades. We have seen -- we saw some headwind here.","Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then lastly I had another question on just the growth in the tool business in Europe, but if you look at your business overall in Europe, you know the southern tier countries had always been very sluggish and declines really the northern countries had been doing a little bit better. Are you starting to see a pickup in places like Spain, Italy, countries like that? Are you starting to see any growth in revenues out of those countries? Or is it specifically all the north countries?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Sure. No-no-no, actually we see revenue growth in our tools business; the SNA-Europe business in Spain and Italy, Portugal, actually France even, and Germany and so on. So we see -- sort of a center of Europe, UK is pretty good. The Eastern European businesses, as you might expect, are weak. There is some growth in Turkey, for example. So that\u2019s kind of pushing it. I will say that, sometimes I think we went so down so far in Spain and Portugal that any kind of growth, just kind of not so big but it's still positive from what we see. It\u2019s so positive and encouraging event, yes. ","Operator","We'll take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research ","","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yes, good morning everyone. Can you talk about the extent to which your growth in international business may have supported the large origination number?","Aldo Pagliari","","I will take that. It was fairly evenly balanced. But the originations are still more influenced by the activity in the United States. So certainly you can look at the International portfolio grew as well, but no one do buy us one way or the other. ","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, and you mentioned that the origination should converge with the tools business over the course of the year, that from a quarter-to-quarter standpoint, you can see divergence a bit over the course of the year that should converge. So does that imply that we\u2019re going to see a fairly substantial reduction heading into 2Q and 3Q here in the origination?","Nicholas Pinchuk","No, I didn\u2019t actually say, what I said specifically was it should converge with big ticket sales in the tools group.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, good.","Nicholas Pinchuk","And so that doesn\u2019t necessarily correlate exactly with the overall tools group number, in fact for many quarters they\u2019ve been higher.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then within that big ticket, you talked about the fact I guess storage and diagnostics are really driving the big ticket within the tools segment as I understand. Do we begin to anniversary something here in the next quarter or two that would create a substantially slower year over year growth?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Well, I don\u2019t know. I think -- look I have said forever that I think we expect our growth to be at 4% to 6% organically and this is at the top end and we grew like I said at 9%, 9.2%, 10.7% and 7.6% in the past year, so that will be outside that. So eventually you might expect the tools group to come down to where I said, but we have some great strengths in the tools group. We are ramping up the innovation engine with customer connection and innovation so we have more new products than ever before. We have these new marketing activities which are breaking the boundaries of the van, the Rock N' Roll Cab that has 56 on the road now and they are breaking the space constraint and adding to that tools storage and we\u2019ve raised the Techno-Vans which support the diagnostic sales to 18. A year ago, those numbers 56 and 18 were 36 and 4 and two years ago were just 18. So we are pumping more support into the tools group. So I wouldn\u2019t want to call for a cooling on the other hand we do say over time it\u2019s 4% to 6%. I am not saying it\u2019s going to happen, that we\u2019d see a reduction next quarter though, I don\u2019t see a lapping being a factor.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Just a couple other questions, I guess on the change in working investments. Aldo you went into some detail about the things that are stressing your DSOs and that was helpful. I noticed though that going back over say the last two years, first quarter \u201912 it was a 13.9 good guy in \u201913 it was negative 55, and in \u201914 were negative 42.5. Is that reflecting just the structural shift so the growing international business, the slowdown in military, the things that Aldo discussed here, is there something else going on there?","Aldo Pagliari","I think the same variables do characterize, you\u2019re talking about just the receivables element in working capital is that [Multiple Speakers] are longer that\u2019s a fact of life. The international mix of business does then impact that, emerging markets as they mature does move from a certain percent of business being as I said cash and carry and short term oriented to more traditional distributor terms. And finally the realization of the government is a little bit of a less of a player in our mix. They were one of the ones that have the most rapid payment terms usually and they do pay properly.","Nicholas Pinchuk","I\u2019ll just jump in here, one of the things that is going on here is, if you shipped to C&I, I think we have of course the great progress in Europe where we\u2019ve gotten another quarter of growth and we have been pounding Snap-on value creation, so we have nice leverage rolling out of that. ","But, there is also a great component of extension to critical industries where we had some big wins in aviation, those are very profitable but they\u2019re not the military business, they change the nature of the payable of the receivables and we are not only in aviation, but we\u2019re also extending internationally. One of the things we worried about in critical industries where we able to project and roll the Snap-on brand out of the garage into aviation and oil and gas and those things, and that\u2019s working. And then further than that, are you able to project it internationally, well that\u2019s really working this quarter and that\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s driven, that\u2019s one of the big factor, may be the biggest factor in driving the 10.4% growth in C&I and a great component of the 200 basis points improvement.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yes, okay. And the last question if I could, just last question, you paid down 100 million of debt in the quarter. Clearly the balance sheet is over capitalized at this point. I don\u2019t want to be the guy to force or pound the table, but you need to do acquisitions I hate to see you stress that. But what is your thought process on just using some of this capitalization capacity to buyback more stock rather than wait for opportunities to surface on the M&A front?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Well, I think we\u2019ve made it clear that, two factors I\u2019ll say, our priorities for cash are; working capital investment and the organic business you just pointed out, some of the requirements we can have as we expand our business to different places. We see it in our working capital today; we\u2019re growing but its eating working capital. We knew this was coming. We are looking at M&A. We view each months, we\u2019re reviewing a list of M&A and we will act on this and we\u2019re confident we can find targets because we keep looking at severely each month; thirdly, we keep our dividend in perpetuity and we know our investors like that dividend, like those dividends and it depends on it, and then the idea of buying back stock to offset dilution. We see that as our cash priority. And I would add on top of that though, that\u2019s our current cash priority, but I would add on top of it, we know that as we generate cash and have capability, we will be judged on how we wheel that, we know that.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Are you considering large transformative acquisitions or are they...","Nicholas Pinchuk","No nothing transformative. We think we can make acquisitions, we\u2019ve seen several large acquisitions that didn\u2019t quite work out that were sort of semi-coherent, on closer look it wasn\u2019t. We believe we can make acquisitions that give us more to sell and more strength with the customer basis that are along our runways for growth, that is the technicians, the repair shop owners and managers, people in the critical industries are in emerging markets. And we can do that without having to transform.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","So if we got to the end of the year and you still hadn\u2019t done a larger transaction, you still had the kind of overcapitalized balance sheet you have today. Would you consider accelerating share repurchase activity?","Nicholas Pinchuk","I am not sure. I\u2019d wait till I get to the end of the year at that.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Richard Hilgert with Morningstar.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc.","","I wanted to ask about, on the military spending, has that now completely anniversaried, in other words the first quarter last year was the quarter where we really saw a big decline in that area of the business, correct?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Actually I think it was the fourth quarter of the prior year, but if the answer is it completely anniversaried, the answer is no, because it keeps going down but the base is smaller. So the impact on us -- it isn\u2019t that it didn\u2019t impact us, it did. But the base on which the reduction is operating is smaller; therefore it\u2019s less of an irritant. It doesn\u2019t create the screen in C&I that it did before. So the way I characterize in my script and I think this is accurate, it no longer masks some of the progress that was happening because it\u2019s smaller.","I mean basically that business is down, more than half, its way down. So it keeps coming down, and was down in the quarter couple of decades of percentages. So it was down again, but the base that it operates thus far.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc.","Is the European hand tools business that you mentioned that improved for the first time in quite a while? Was that down about the same kind of magnitude that military was down?","Nicholas Pinchuk","No, not that much but it was down let\u2019s say 25% in sales.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc.","And then on the Challenger Lift business, is the nature of that equipment and the historic margins such that this would represent, always represent margins that are less than that segment\u2019s average and therefore if sales in that business increase more so than the sales in the rest of RS&I, it would cause margins to be slightly diluted?","Nicholas Pinchuk","If the question is, I mean I think this is the question. Is the Challenger margin -- are the Challenger margins 23%? The answer is no. And therefore for some time and for either substantially lower than that, so for some time growth in Challenger margins, [indiscernible] Challenger sales would be detrimental to the overall RS&I margin numbers. However it might help, it might raise its profitability for the corporation and so on. And by the way, we\u2019ll be working on the Challenger margins over time with Snap-on value creation to keep improving it. But there is a big gap between the Snap-on, between the Challenger margins and the overall RS&I margins.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc."," ","That gap is what is actually I was getting at and what I was getting at is that is Challenger is just the nature of this product and the pricing in that segment of the business such that you\u2019ll never get to the 20 some odd percent that the RS&I group does, it will always be lower than that general mark.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Well, yes, I guess, I mean I think is sure always is a long time even for a guy like me. And I have a lot of confidence in Snap-on value creation, so I think it can move it upwards. So I would never see the idea that never get there. But it\u2019s certainly a long pull. Now remember though, that we lap the acquisition in the second quarter. So we acquired Challenger, I don\u2019t know half way to two-thirds of the way through the second quarter of last year. So once we get into the third quarter, its apples-to-apples. What you\u2019re seeing now with the drag is in apples-to-oranges comparison, that\u2019s why we (want) [ph] it out.","I mean RS&I actually had a pretty good quarter, it had 60 basis points of restructuring impact year-over-year and another multiple decade, a doll-up of Challenger impact and that occluded the relatively strong RCI achievement that it made in the 50 to 60 basis points.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc.","Certainly was an impressive quarter on margin performance. Thanks for taking my questions this morning.","Operator","And we have no further question in the queue at this time.","Leslie Kratcoski ","Thanks everyone for joining us this morning, a replay of the call will be available on snapon.com shortly.

Nick?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. Today, I\u2019ll start with the highlights of our third quarter, give you an update on the environment and the trends we see, and I\u2019ll take you through some of the turbulence we\u2019ve encountered and speak about our physical and financial progress. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of the financials.","We believe that our third quarter again demonstrated Snap-on\u2019s ability to continue its trajectory of positive results, overcoming period-to-period variation. We are encouraged by the results. Like every quarter, we had disparities from group-to-group and within each group.","The van business appears to have stabilized with incremental improvement in organic sales trend, sales gains in the U.S. offset by decline in other geographies. Some segments saw a down period with challenges in our businesses serving independent repair shop owners and managers and sales to OEM dealerships, but once again, our strength overcame.","Organic sales in the quarter were up 0.6%. Sales gains in critical industries in the \u2013 in Asian Pacific, returned to growth in the U.S. van channel, progress in hand tools and power tools and the rise of software. That all combined to prevail against variations and move us forward again.","OpCo operating margin of 19.3% was up from last year as adjusted by 70 basis points. Improved product mix across the group\u2019s, net positive foreign currency and again the benefits of Rapid Continuous Improvement, or RCI, they showed the way.","Financial services operating income was 59.3% \u2013 $59.3 million. That grew $3.3 million from last year\u2019s $56 million. And that result combined with OpCo to raise our consolidated operating margins to 23.7%, up 90 basis points as adjusted. And excluding the one-time tax charge associated with the transition to the new U.S. tax legislation, adjusted EPS was $2.88, up 17.6%.","Now let\u2019s speak about the markets. We believe the automotive repair environment continues to be generally favorable. We did see mixed results from our businesses in that arena, but based on what we\u2019ve been hearing from our franchisees, from technicians and from shop owners and managers, we believe the vehicle repair remains a favorable place to operate and Snap-on, we believe we\u2019re well-positioned to take advantage.","For the critical industries, verticals like aviation, oil and gas, mining and heavy duty, we\u2019re seeing significant progress, activity strong across \u2013 almost across the Board. We like the way the critical industries are sounding and trending. We had further advancements outside the U.S. Our Asia Pacific division registering solid increases in key countries like Japan and India and Indonesia.","We do believe we\u2019re well-positioned to confront the challenges and make progress along our runways for growth. But at the same time, it\u2019s clear that we have great potential on our runways for improvement. The Snap-on Value Creation Processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI. They are a constant driver of our progress, especially customer connection, understanding the work of professional technicians and innovation, matching that insight with technology.","And in this quarter, Snap-on Value Creation, customer connection and innovation drove significant margin gain in the face of turbulence. And led \u2013 and besides that, it led to more prestigious product awards than we\u2019ve ever had, more recognition than in any single year just this quarter.","Snap-on was prominently represented with 18 Professional Tool & Equipment News, PTEN People\u2019s Choice Product Awards, where the actual users, the technicians make the selections, probably the best award. We were also recognized with seven PTEN Innovation Awards and we were honored with two MOTOR Magazine top 20 awards.","An essential driver of Snap-on growth is innovative product that makes work easier. It\u2019s always been our strength and those recent awards have testimony, that great Snap-on products just keep coming driving progress. You can see it in the margins. Well, that\u2019s the environment.","Now we\u2019ll move to the individual operating groups. Let\u2019s start with C&I. Sales of $330.2 million in the quarter. It increased $15.6 million, including $1.6 million related to acquisitions and $6.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Organic growth was 6.7%, gains across all divisions and most geographies.","Operating margins reached 16.1%, one of C&I\u2019s highest, maybe the highest for C&I, representing a 10 basis point improvement from last year. That result reflects the power of our ongoing stream of innovative new products for critical industries, the product development investment necessary to build the future, a robust effort in RCI and favorable foreign currency.","Let\u2019s take the industrial division, focused on critical industries outside the vehicle garage, it showed broad-based gains with strong overall year-over-year performance now accomplished for eight straight quarters. We continue to rise in critical industries and it\u2019s a favorable market environment that we\u2019re amplifying with innovative new products aimed at solving critical tasks and the result is very encouraging.","The quarter saw advancements, driven by great products like our lineup of 14.4 volt cordless tools, spanning everything from ratchets to drills to wrenches to saws to screwdrivers. Each product developer customers both in and out of the garage, they\u2019re compact, they\u2019re powerful and they\u2019re flexible and the customers are noticing.","All of them now include variable speed triggers for maximum control, micro lithium batteries that are lightweight and long-lasting, and those batteries are interchangeable between all the matching voltage Snap-on tools, micro lithium tools, lots of convenience in that.","One of those tools is the CTR-767 14.4 volt, three-inch Drive MicroLithium Cordless Ratchet. It was released at the beginning of this year and it\u2019s one of MOTOR Magazine\u2019s top 20 tools. There\u2019s a long neck and extra six inches, jobs like timing belt changes or work near firewall, jobs that require reach, it makes them much easier, and there\u2019s a lot of those tasks across the workplaces of the world. And that extended neck doesn\u2019t compromise the leverage or power.","The 767 especially rugged construction supports up to 40-foot pounds of torque output, while the robust ratchet mechanism head and neck and \u2013 can handle 158 foot pounds of manual torque. Three\u2019s a available speed trigger for greater control and can reach 275 RPMs. It has the torque to be versatile and that it has the speed to make quick work of the task.","Our customer connection showed us what was needed to make ratchet work easier, speed, accessibility, torque, reach and strength and the CTR-767 has all of that. It\u2019s a different \u2013 it\u2019s a difference maker for working professionals in the market resection confirms it. You can see it in the power tool results.","In this quarter, our City of Industry in California, the plant California torque operation introduced the Snap-on CTECH30 and the CTECH 240 Micro Torque Wrench, the smallest electronic torque wrenches in the market, compact steel bodies, only 10.2 inches in length and less than an inch in diameter, they\u2019re light \u2013 and they\u2019re light just under a pound. That compares to the standard torque wrench, which is 16.5 inches long and 1.9 inches in diameter and weighs nearly two pounds.","The micro torques are designed for aviation, manufacturing and other critical industries, where tight spaces are common and light \u2013 and lightweight is important. The slim micro design enables text to reach fasteners that are resets and \u2013 or obstructed, often eliminating the need to remove components to gain access, saving a lot of time. The short overall length also enables a large swingarm, even in tight spaces, and that\u2019s a big factor for job productivity. And the micros have interchangeable head, that make them useful across a variety of applications for different fasteners and special situation, like those from all the time in aviation where accessibility and flexibility are critical.","The CTECH micros are great tools and the technicians are responding. Products like these aimed at industry needs that help drive our progress across critical industry and keep working customer and we keep working customer connection and innovation. So the advancements will only continue. C&I maintaining its momentum, extending in critical industries, building both sales and profitability.","Now on to the Tools Group. Organic sales, about flat 0.1%, but returned to growth in the U.S. operation up low single digits. And that returned to growth was offset by variation internationally, that\u2019s the story of the Tools Group. Operating income in the quarter was $59.3 million, and that compares to $56.4 million in 2017.","The OI margin was 15.2% and 80 basis point increase, favorable product mix, higher-margin new products, software, the benefits of RCI and the favorable foreign currency, they made the difference. Now the third quarter is, when we hold our annual Snap-on franchisee conference, our SFC.","This year was Nashville and it was the largest Snap-on gathering in our 98-year history. With more than 8,800 attendees, franchisees, family members from over 3,100 routes. For the franchisees, it\u2019s an opportunity for training, promoting new products and for fun. For the company, it\u2019s an opportunity to gauge our franchisees outlook on the business. Order volume was up. Most product categories showing gains over last year.","And I can attest that the franchisees displayed confidence in our business and optimism in their future. And that positive outlook is reinforced once again by the advancements evident in our franchisee health metrics. These are the financial and physical indicators we monitor and evaluate regularly. And they remain favorable and robust, it\u2019s a significant factor.","We do believe our franchisees can continue to grow stronger. And if you are with us in Nashville, you could have seen it clearly. And our real reasons for that confidence, our product lines are getting stronger. You heard about the product awards. Well, beyond that, there\u2019s a continuous stream of great new offerings, attention-getters of hand tools and tool storage.","The third quarter was a strong hand tool quarter. You can understand why when you see innovations like our new TSLF 72 1\/4 inch Drive Dual 80 Technology Speeder Handle Flex-Head Ratchet, a long name for a special product, aimed at decreasing job times and increasing technician efficiency in any shop.","The speeder represents the fastest way to manually tighten or loosen fasteners. The flexible head provides access in tight automotive applications. And the Dual 80 Technology features a dual paw each with seven teeth 8 engaging the gears, so has great strength and [Technical Difficulty] enthusiasm, the kind that will make it another one of our hit products well, $1 million seller in the first year.","[Technical Difficulty] C242, it\u2019s a 36-inch heavy-duty shop cart with five A\/C outlets and two USB ports, a SpeeDrawer and a side panel organizer. It helps text organize and securely charge their tools and devices with tremendous ease. It offers two durable top options, stainless steel or bedliner, both popular features. And it comes in a variety of standard and newly released colors that make it differ.","The KRSC242 has \u2013 it\u2019s already achieved its good products status, and we believe it has much more runway. Well, that\u2019s the Tools Group, enthusiastic SFC, the U.S. returning to growth and a substantial margin increase driven by innovative new products.","Now RS&I. Organic sales were down 4.8%. Due to high single-digit decline in the sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. Sales to independent shops were down, reflecting period of selling diagnostics to the van channel. No one who handhelds were launched in the quarter and the U.S. Tools Group growth \u2013 U.S. Tools grew in the quarter was achieved by franchisee focused on the great new products launched in other segments. And then sales to vehicle dealerships were also down in the quarter, reflecting fewer OEM programs in that lumpy business.","Despite that variation, however, RS&I and OI margin was 25.7%, quite strong, a rise of 60 basis points from last year. Once again, RCI, innovation and software drove that progress. Our Mitchell 1 division continue to advances its industry-leading productivity solutions by introducing text message \u2013 a text messaging feature across the shop management line. It became clear that users see efficiency and having text messaging and capability integrated with the shop management software rather than relying on a general standalone third-party service.","The new integrated feature offers the capability of sending customers automated reminder text about upcoming appointments, thank you notes for the repair business and invitations to participate in online surveys about their experience. The response has been overwhelming and positive, fortifying \u2013reinforcing and fortifying our leadership position in repair shop management software. And we launched other great products in the period like the Car-O-Liner. Our recent acquisition is one of the things we wanted to do with Car-O-Liner and we acquired it. Like the Car-O-Liner CT \u2013 so we launched the Car-O-Liner\u2019s CTR 9, fully automated spot \u2013 automatic spot welder.","Our customer connection efforts showed that with expanding \u2013 with the expanding variation of steels now used in vehicle bodies, collision repairs taking on a new level of complexity. Technicians now spend considerable effort identifying and measuring the specific material before the welding \u2013 the specific materials they\u2019re working on before the welding can begin. It takes extra time and it\u2019s often a source of welding error.","While the Car-O-Liner CTR 9 fixes all that. It measures thickness, determines the electrical resistance and identifies the exact steel being welded automatically. It brings unmatched speed and accuracy to the collision \u2013 to collision repair. It\u2019s a real productivity enhancement. We launched it in Europe at the Automechanika show to considerable enthusiasm and it will be introduced later this year in the \u2013 later this fall in the U.S. and we\u2019re confident it will be quite a hit voting good things for the Car-O-Liner future.","RS&I minimizing the impact of sales variation with innovation, new product, technology and software. That\u2019s the highlights of our quarter. C&I continuing its positive trend of growth and profitability, extending across emerging markets in critical industries. Tools Group, reigniting the U.S. van channel in a registry margin strength. RS&I margin progress despite the challenges in the quarter.","Progress along our runways for coherent growth and advancements down our runways for improvement. OpCo operating income margin up 19.3%, up 70 basis points on an added \u2013 on an adjusted apples-to-apples basis. And an as adjusted EPS $2.88 in the quarter, 17.6% higher than last year. It was another encouraging quarter.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?","Aldo Pagliari","Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results were summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $898.1 million in the quarter were down 0.6%, reflecting a 0.6% organic sales gain, $1.4 million of acquisition-related sales and $12.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales gain this quarter principally reflected broad-based growth in the Commercial & Industrial segment and low single-digit growth in the U.S. franchise operations of the Snap-on Tools Group.","Consolidated gross margin of 50.5% improved 80 basis points, primarily due to a shift in sales mix, savings from RCI initiatives and 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency, partially offset by higher material and other costs.","The operating expense margin of 31.2%, compared to 32.8% last year, which included 170 basis points from the $15 million legal charge that was incurred during Q3 of 2017. As a result, operating margin before financial services of 19.3% was up 240 basis points on a reported basis and 70 basis points on an as adjusted basis, respectively, from Q3 of 2017.","Financial services revenue of $82 million and operating earnings of $59.3 million increased 3.8% and 5.9%, respectively, from 2017. Consolidated operating margin of 23.7% of revenues was up 250 basis points on an reported basis and 90 basis points on an adjusted basis, respectively, from last year.","Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 24.0% included a charge of 90 basis points, or $1.8 million, related to newly issued guidance associated with last year\u2019s U.S. tax legislation. Excluding this charge, the effective tax rate for the third quarter as adjusted was 23.1%. This compared to a rate of 30.7% last year on an adjusted basis to exclude the 60 basis points of benefit from the legal charge.","Finally, net earnings on a report of basis of $163.2 million, or $2.85 per share, compared to $133.4 million, or $2.29 per share a year ago. Excluding $0.03 per share for the tax charge, adjusted earnings per share was $2.88, up 17.6%, compared to Q2 \u2013 Q3 of 2017, adjusted per share of $2.45, which excludes the $0.16 per share legal charge last year.","Now let\u2019s turn to our segment results. Starting with C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $330.2 million in the quarter increased 5%, reflecting a 6.7% organic sales gain and a $1.4 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $6.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.","The organic increase was broad-based and included a double-digit gain in the sales of power tools, high single-digit gain in the sales of our Asia Pacific operations, a mid single-digit gain to customers in critical industries and slightly higher sales in the European-based hand tools business.","Gross margin of 39.6% decreased 70 basis points, primarily due to higher sales volumes of lower gross margin products, principally in Asia Pacific and power tools, as well as higher material and other costs, partially offset by benefits from RCI and 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency.","The operating expense margin of 23.5% improved 80 basis points, primarily as a result of sales volume leverage. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $53 million increased 5.4% and the operating margin of 16.1% improved 10 basis points from 2017.","Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $389.8 million decreased 0.7%, reflecting slightly higher organic sales growth more than offset by $3.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales change includes a low single-digit increase in the United States, largely offset by a high single-digit decline internationally.","Gross margin of 43.6% improved 180 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to 50 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects, increased sales of higher gross margin products and benefits from the company\u2019s RCI initiatives.","The operating expense margin of 28.4% increased 100 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to cost and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $59.3 million increased 5.1% and the operating margin of 15.2% improved 80 basis points year-over-year.","Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $314.4 million decreased 5.7%, reflecting a 4.8% organic sales decline and a $3.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The lower organic sales reflects a high single-digit decline in sales of diagnostic and repair information products and a mid single-digit sales decrease in sales to OEM dealerships, while sales of undercar equipment were essentially flat.","Gross margin of 48.7% improved 140 basis points, primarily as a result of a shift in sales that included lower volumes of lower gross margin products and benefits from RCI. The operating expense margin of 23% increased 80 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the effect of lower sales volumes. Operating earnings for the RC&I Group of $80.7 million decreased 3.7% from prior year levels. However, the operating margins of 25.7% improved 60 basis points from last year.","Now turning to Slide 10. Operating earnings from financial services of $59.3 million and revenue of $82 million increased 5.9% and 3.8%, respectively, from a year ago. Third quarter financial services expenses of $22.7 million were down slightly year-over-year, as higher operating expenses were more than offset by $700,000 and $400,000 of lower provision expense for financing contract receivables, respectively.","On a sequential basis, total provision expense of $12.5 million was down $1.7 million from $14.2 million in the second quarter, reflecting further stabilization in the credit portfolio metrics. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.1% and 1.2% in the respective third quarters of 2018 and 2017.","The average yield on finance receivables in the third quarter was 17.7%, compared to 17.9% in 2017, driven principally by product mix and reflective of the credit quality of customers originating loans in the quarter. Respective average yield on contract receivables was 9.2% for both 2017 and 2018. Total loan originations of $267 million decreased 1.8%, primarily due to a 2.1% decline in originations of finance receivables.","Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.1 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.8 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio grew $35.6 million in the third quarter. As for the 60-day plus delinquency trends, they are stable year-over-year and increased sequentially reflecting typical seasonality.","As it relates to extended credit for finance receivables, the largest portion of the portfolio trailing 12-month net losses of $52 million represented 3.18% of outstandings at quarter-end, up 41 basis points year-over-year, but essentially flat sequentially, further supporting continued stabilization in the portfolios credit metric performance.","Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $129.8 million in the quarter increased $34.3 million, or 35.9% from comparable 2017 levels, primarily reflecting higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $48.6 million included net additions to finance receivables of $22.7 million and capital expenditures of $29.9 million.","Net cash used by financing activities of $71.3 million included cash dividends of $46.1 million and the repurchase of 493,000 shares of common stock for $85.7 million under our existing share repurchase programs. Year-to-date, share repurchases totaled 1.139 million shares for $184.4 million. As of the end of September, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $306.5 million of common stock under existing authorizations.","Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $3.1 million from 2017 year-end, including $14.5 million of unfavorable currency translation. Days sales outstanding of 65 days improved one day from 2017 year-end. Inventories increased $51.8 million, including $15.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency from 2017 year-end.","As a reminder, the year-to-date increase in inventory included $20.9 million related to the recognition of an inventory asset associated with the adoption of accounting standards update Topic 606 on revenue recognition. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.8 compared to 3.2 at year-end 2017.","Our quarter-end cash position of $122.2 million increased $30.2 million from 2017 year-end levels. Our net debt to capital ratio increased \u2013 decreased to 23.8% from 27% at year-end 2017.","In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter-end, we had $154 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.","That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Thanks, Aldo. The Snap-on third quarter. Turbulence and variation across some of our businesses, but we overcame and made progress. The U.S. Tools Group return to growth continuing on its improving trend. C&I extending to critical industry is achieving progress across all its operations. RS&I did encounter challenges, but there are positive points throughout that operations, particularly in the information and software. And with all that, margins were up again in each group.","C&I 16.1%, up 10 basis points, possibly the best ever. Tools 15.2%, up 80 basis points and RS&I 25.7%, up 60 basis points against the wins. And our overall margin, it was 19.3%, up 70 basis points, all demonstrating again the power of Snap-on Value Creation, customer connection and innovation offering profitable new product and RCI creating productivity, runways for improvement that drive margin consistently. It was an encouraging quarter.","And we believe the results of the period confirm that Snap-on has the opportunities to progress, the capability to take advantage and that team to improve even in difficult environments. And we\u2019re confident that those qualities spread across our operation will drive continued progress through the end of this year and on through 2019.","Before I turn the call over to the operate, I\u2019ll speak to our franchisees and associates. I know you\u2019re listening. Encouraging performance of this quarter reflect your skill, your intensity and your contributions to our company, for your encouraging achievements, you have my congratulations, and for your unrelenting and unfailing support for our team, you have my thanks.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn","Thank you. Good morning.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Good morning.","Christopher Glynn","Nick, you sounded pretty confident and excited about the new product lines getting stronger at SOT. I\u2019m wondering if you would note that, that translates to improving visibility for the Tools segment to get back into the target growth range in the short order?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Well, I think, look, it certainly looks like it\u2019s going to trend that way. And we\u2019ll \u2013 based on what we hear from the franchisees, we see the impact of the new product in the quarter and we saw the SFC. The SFC was very enthusiastic. Now that\u2019s a windshield survey. It\u2019s kind of a qualitative view.","But I will tell you, the \u2013 if you\u2019ve walked around that floor and I\u2019ve never seen it busier. And the \u2013 while the \u2013 all the product lines, we saw we had a muted results in diagnostics, which we explained everything was fairly strong.","So the response of the SFC to the new product was good. Now that isn\u2019t selling on to the end users, that\u2019s the franchisees like the product, the power tools and the hand tools and the tool storage. Now we saw some of that come through though in the third quarter, reflecting much of that. So I feel pretty good about this.","Christopher Glynn","Yes. And what about the international? That wasn\u2019t a slim negative and it sort of seem to come a little bit out of the blue?","Nicholas Pinchuk","I\u2019ll tell you what, I\u2019ve said for a long time that the third quarter was kind of a variable quarter and that\u2019s particularly true in our international businesses because of the way the vacations run through that. And then they go back and actually \u2013 now we did this. You go back and look at the third quarter, there\u2019s a lot of variations in the third quarter \u2013extreme variations in our third quarter in the \u2013 in those international businesses and then a couple of those lined up this time in the same direction and that created this kind of variation and turbulence.","Christopher Glynn","So you\u2019re not concerned about that in terms of trends?","Nicholas Pinchuk","I\u2019m not really concerned about that. I think, I have said often that the third quarter, particularly in international, isn\u2019t a trend driver. You can\u2019t really \u2013 particularly outside the United States, you can\u2019t fully bank on that being a trend.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. And then\u2026","Nicholas Pinchuk","We\u2019re not really concern about that.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. And last one, also sticking with the Tools segment. I\u2019m just wondering if you are able to track the aftermarket among franchisees with their route customers. And if you think at the margin that kind of recirculation of aftermarket tools is maybe becoming a bigger piece in the franchisees\u2019 stock and trade?","Nicholas Pinchuk","You mean second hand tools?","Christopher Glynn","Yes.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Is that what you mean? I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think so. I mean, that they\u2019ve always been there. I mean that \u2013 we don\u2019t see that increasing. I\u2019m not hearing that, so I don\u2019t really believe that to be the case. I mean, certainly, it\u2019s been always a factor in diagnostics and tool storage, the bigger ticket items. But I don\u2019t see anything that tells me that, \"Boy, that\u2019s a bigger number.\" I just spoke to a couple of franchisees a couple of days ago. And they didn\u2019t seem to mention that they were very robust about our product line, including the diagnostic product line, yes.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Stember with C.L. King.","Scott Stember","Good morning, guys.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Good morning.","Scott Stember","Can we maybe touch on the RS&I? Last year, in the third quarter, I think you posted a high single-digit organic sales number and...","Nicholas Pinchuk","[Multiple Speakers]","Scott Stember","Yes. That was it, yes. And you\u2019ve always warned that it\u2019s a lumpy business. How much of it is difficult comps, lumpiness, maybe just give us a little bit more detail? I think you also\u2026","Nicholas Pinchuk","That\u2019s certainly some of it. Look, I think, there are two big factors in diagnostics really driving the reduction in this quarter. One is \u2013 the easy one to deal with is the sales, our OEM programs business, where we get essential tool programs commissioned by OEM manufacturers, and that is quite lumpy, and driven by technology, new launches and regulation of those things and that tends to go up and down.","We had a particularly strong couple of quarters last year, where we got a lot of those programs coming out of the OEMs. And we\u2019re in a period and particularly this period where there\u2019s a few \u2013 a smaller number of those, and so that creates a comparison vacuum. And then you look at \u2013 really if you want to talk about comparison and we had, I think, maybe our first or second best diagnostics quarter ever last year, because we launched the ZEUS at the end of the quarter.","And so we had a great product launch, good SFC, lots of enthusiasm. And so comparing to that, it wasn\u2019t \u2013 I hate to talk about year-over-year comparisons, but that\u2019s part of the thing. That\u2019s part of what drives that. Now remember, the Tools Group still grew even though it\u2019s diagnostics didn\u2019t. It sold other things. And really what happened at the SFC is, we didn\u2019t have new product and we had an edge in diagnostics. We had great new products in tool storage and hand tools and power tools and other things. And so people paid attention to those. That\u2019s really the tail of the tape in this situation.","Scott Stember","And can you maybe speak to the visibility that you have, I guess, in the upcoming quarters with some of these larger programs of the OEMs? Would you expect anything to pop-up?","Nicholas Pinchuk","No, we don\u2019t really give guidance, but boy, it seems to be on the floor right now. So I kind of believe this is that, the industry keeps being robust in automotive sales in the United States in North America. So we would expect some recovery off of these as we move forward. In fact, I\u2019m confident of that.","The time constants of that, I\u2019m not sure of, but I\u2019m pretty confident that, that happens. These things happen from time to time. You see ebbs to flow, which is why we classified a lumpy business. We\u2019re not actually concerned about it, but it does \u2013 if it lines up with something like diagnostics having a muted quarter, you end up getting the results you have. But I still think \u2013 I like to think that RS&I did a great job, 25.7% is the second highest OI margin ever for diagnostics.","Scott Stember","All right. And just \u2013 last question just, so it sounds as if you\u2019re still comfortable with the \u2013 I guess, the long-term growth rate of the business, which I think you\u2019ve said in the past is in that mid-single-digit range. That hasn\u2019t changed, correct?","Nicholas Pinchuk","No, no, that really hasn\u2019t changed. I mean, we had, like you said, we had an eight last year. In fact, we had a pretty good year, maybe five quarters or four quarters. It was a little bit over the range 7% to 8%. I always said that I thought it was a 5% business and it kind of came back a little bit, but it\u2019s those specific reasons why that. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re ringing our hands on this at all. When you talk to franchisees, they like this \u2013 our product.","Scott Stember","Got it. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","Good morning, everyone.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Good morning.","David MacGregor","Yes, congratulations on the SFC. It sounds like you were pretty pleased with attendance. I\u2019m just wondering what did the shorter SFC fulfillment window contribute to third quarter Tools segment growth?","Nicholas Pinchuk","It\u2019s hard for me to say that. I mean, we \u2013 you\u2019re saying that we \u2013 but let me make sure you\u2019re asking what. So fundamentally, we didn\u2019t drive SFC orders out into next year. We kind of let them be through December and then \u2013 for government work, and then not so much into the next year. That\u2019s we \u2013 I think we talked about that on the other call. I\u2019m not sure how much that really contributed.","So I guess, if you do the arithmetic and you say, \u201cOkay, you compare year-over-year and as we did, you would say you did better than last year in your SFC orders. And you did better, because it was a shorter \u2013 and it was spread over fewer months, you would think you would contribute to that arithmetically, right?\u201d And so I think that\u2019s true. But that to me that was tremendously encouraging, because we had less \u2013 we \u2013 our guys, when they were ordering, we\u2019re thinking of less time to be able to liquidate this kind of product. So we felt pretty good. I think that was a real positive for us.","David MacGregor","Okay. Within the Tool segment, how did the size of the average ticket compared to third quarter a year ago? And also maybe how did the number of transactions compared to third quarter a year ago?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Say that first part again, David, please?","David MacGregor","Sure. Within your Tools segment in your U.S. business, how did the size of the average ticket \u2013 sales ticket that your guys grow? How did that compare year-over-year? And then also\u2026","Nicholas Pinchuk","Look, I think it\u2019s probably a little smaller. I think, RA was \u2013 what we call RA, the smaller ticket items and hand tools was very strong and power tools are very strong. So the thing is, if you \u2013 how we interpret these things is we roll off the product and hand tools was very strong off the SFC. I think you felt this yourself, but power tools was also very strong and we kind of get this reinforcement. And those two are generally smaller ticket items. Although you can have a big ticket item in a power tool depending on which one it is, generally, the smaller ticket items.","David MacGregor","Okay, but the number of transactions perhaps?","Nicholas Pinchuk","It\u2019s got to be. I mean, the thing is, their sales were \u2013 they are deliberate. The sales off the van were about the same as the U.S. sales, so they were up about the same. So if they\u2019re selling those, those hand tools and power tools and then the number of transactions are higher, I think, that\u2019s probably true.","David MacGregor","It just looks from me\u2026","Nicholas Pinchuk","I haven\u2019t looked at it pay to myself. I\u2019m just extrapolating logically.","David MacGregor","Right, that makes sense. If organic sales remained slow, are you likely to respond with acquisition growth, or is it possible we could see an extended period of below target growth?","Nicholas Pinchuk","I think, we\u2019re coming back. I think, the Tools Group has started to solve its problems. I mean, if you look at the U.S., everybody was focused on that like a heat-seeking missile and it grew at 2.4% in the quarter. And I think we would say not where we wanted to be, but a lot better than it\u2019s been. So it appears to me, you would conclude that if you look at the history of the last three quarters in the Tools Group, it\u2019s got better every quarter. The second derivative of its growth has gotten better. So I think, we\u2019re going back towards there. The RS&I situation, we see as a positional thing, and C&I has been doing pretty well.","David MacGregor","Yes. One more if I could there. [Multiple Speakers]","Nicholas Pinchuk","I see it.","David MacGregor","How did your storage business compare year-over-year?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Storage business in the quarter \u2013 the \u2013 was about flat, down slightly. So it\u2019s kind of flat. The SFC was good though. The SFC was stronger. So, it takes a while sometimes for that stuff to work its way through the system. So that\u2019s kind of what we saw in the storage business.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from\u2026","Nicholas Pinchuk","Sure.","Operator","\u2026 David Leiker with Baird.","David Leiker","Good morning, everyone.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Hi, David.","David Leiker","Nick, if we look at on the international side of Snap-on tools, I mean, you saw primarily in three regions. Are you suggesting all three of them struggled a bit in the quarter?","Nicholas Pinchuk","No, I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m suggesting \u2013 I can tell you that. two or the three struggled in a quarter. One was up. We \u2013 I think, that sort of what I was saying in the prior call. This time a couple of them lined up negatively. We always see a lot of variation in this quarter. And thankfully, it\u2019s been mostly more \u2013 sometimes positive, sometimes negative, but this time, we had two negatives line up. So that\u2019s what drove this kind of thing. I don\u2019t think we see anything in this. So we\u2019re thinking it\u2019s just the \u2013 just third quarter.","David Leiker","And then in the diagnostics and information, you seem to be saying that\u2019s more of a comp issue versus last year and I think you had said ZEUS launch in that. If you look at it sequentially, is there \u2013 what\u2019s the tone of business in that, and that\u2019s part of RS&I?","Nicholas Pinchuk","I think \u2013 look, I think, the tone of business was about \u2013 was down somewhat, because you\u2019re getting further from the product launch of Apollo, which was the beginning of the second quarter. I think, the situation was one, comparison to itself year-over-year; and two, comparison to being in front of all these other product lines that we\u2019re launching at its primary stage, which is the SFC.","Remember, the thing is that, the diagnostics business has only a few SKU, a relatively small number of SKUs. So when you launch a new product, if it is at the SFC, it gets a lot of attention. When you launch a new hand tool, it\u2019s one of many. We\u2019ll launch a new power tool, it\u2019s one of many.","So those tend to reap of the SFC or the kick off. So at the SFC, I think, we had a set of compelling new product \u2013 new products associated with power tools and hand tools and they captured the attention of the people, and we just didn\u2019t have anything new. And so in diagnostics and so that tended to be a little bit of mute. And it was comparing to last year, which was kind of a pretty strong quarter.","David Leiker","Okay. And then if we look at\u2026","Nicholas Pinchuk","[Multiple speakers]","David Leiker","Okay. And then if we look at the Snap-on credit, the provisions are a little bit lower. Was that just kind of mark in the market with what your actual experience is or something else there?","Aldo Pagliari","So I got it, David. So it\u2019s reflective. There has been attenuation of losses. There\u2019s less charge-offs for the provision that\u2019s required to be a little bit less. So sequentially, you see improvement. Now, again, if you look at the absolute year-over-year, it\u2019s still higher, but sequentially it\u2019s been improving and the trends there are going in the right direction.","David Leiker","And then just one more number question, the corporate expense number came out a little bit light, good thing, but that helped the margin there a bit, anything in particular there?","Aldo Pagliari","No, mostly it\u2019s the legal expense if you look at year-over-year. Our tendency is still \u2013 corporate expenses per quarter run between $20 million to $25 million. You\u2019re right, this year we\u2019re at the lower-end of that range. Last year, if you look and exclude the legal charge, you see we fell at about 23-ish or something like that. So nothing really has changed there.","David Leiker","Okay, great. Thank you much.","Aldo Pagliari","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Gary Prestopino with Barrington.","Gary Prestopino","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Good morning, Gary.","Gary Prestopino","Nick, most of the questions have been answered. But I guess, could you maybe talk about, you mentioned that in the conference in Nashville, orders were up a certain magnitude. You \u2013 could you maybe give us a range of what those orders were up vis-\u00e0-vis last year?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Yes. Look, they ranged \u2013 they really ranged from high-single digits to, in fact, some people were double digits to a couple, we would say, mid single digits or maybe edging on both single digits. It\u2019s a pretty strong quarter. Diagnostics was not up, but everything else is pretty, pretty strong.","Gary Prestopino","Right. And that was all hand tools and power tools, right?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Yes, power tools. We have other things like compressors and air conditioning units. We sell things like that.","Gary Prestopino","Okay. And then\u2026","Nicholas Pinchuk","Tool storage.","Gary Prestopino","Tool storage, okay. And then given what we\u2019re seeing as far as the \u2013 you mentioned some of the lumpiness in the diagnostic business as you had tough comps and no new products. Is that really portend that, that this is more driven by new product introductions with that business\/","Nicholas Pinchuk","Look, I think the answer is unfortunately a little more complicated than that in this quarter. It is driven by new product introduction. So when you introduce a new product, particularly intelligent diagnostics, which electrified everybody.","Gary Prestopino","Right.","Nicholas Pinchuk","The thing is those things tend to be tough comps. But then when you compare it, like I said, in an atmosphere of the SFC, where everybody else is laying out their best \u2013 putting their best foot forward and diagnostic has already introduced two in less than a year. That\u2019s the kind of thing you see.","Now you still see sell-through in the Apollo, both the Apollo and the ZEUS did better than their predecessors. They\u2019ve rolled out better than their predecessors, but it\u2019s just that situation of ZEUS lapping last year\u2019s incandescent introduction is one of our best diagnostic quarter, maybe the best diagnostic quarter ever. And the idea that they\u2019re up against for a franchisee attention, some of these other products that simply is.","Gary Prestopino","Okay. And then really, I think, you might have mentioned this, but the feedback from your franchisees is that the environment is still pretty positive in the automotive?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Yes. Yes, I mean, like I said, I keep talking to them and they keep saying, yes. They\u2019re talking about two-bay shops now expanding to four, people being robust. Now if you look at the BLS data in terms of the amount of spending on car repair and the technician wages are all favorable.","Gary Prestopino","Okay. Thank you.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.","Bret Jordan","Good morning, guys.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Good morning.","Bret Jordan","On the diagnostics question, and I guess, you said incandescent launch of ZEUS, is the trajectory of Apollo, I guess, lower than the launch trajectory of ZEUS? And is that part of the diagnostics challenge?","Nicholas Pinchuk","No, I don\u2019t think so. I think, look, I think, ZEUS was \u2013 the reason I may regret using the word incandescent. But look, I \u2013 it was a big launch, because it\u2019s the \u2013 everybody got excited. It was the first time we talked about intelligent diagnostics. So that was the roll out of the $100 billion database. And so that got everybody talking more. I think that\u2019s more or less that. Both of the \u2013 both of those products have exceeded their predecessors and their predecessors were pretty successful.","Bret Jordan","Okay.","Nicholas Pinchuk","ZEUS is \u2013 and the other thing Bret is that, ZEUS is a higher price point.","Bret Jordan","Right.","Nicholas Pinchuk","So you got our guys out there pounding away at a $12,000 price point. It tends to distort the situation. Everybody gets really excited a little bit more. It\u2019s as qualitative as that, I think, but the Apollo was just successful.","Bret Jordan","Okay. And then a question, obviously, we talked a lot about tariffs, now you\u2019re relatively immune to that, given your low country of origin or your local manufacturing. But I guess, if you think about the assembly of the contents and its country of origin, do you see any pressure on your input costs? And I guess, as you think about the inverse of that, how do you stack up relative to your competition in your mix of imported assemblers versus theirs?","Nicholas Pinchuk","It \u2013 I can\u2019t speak for the competition. But look, I think we make quite a bit of what we sell off those vans in America. We say like 75%, 80%. So we have a lot of U.S. competition. But don\u2019t \u2013 when I say, we have a thin wedge relative to other people versus peers. Don\u2019t mean, we\u2019re completely going to hit them, but we\u2019ve been dealing with material costs for [indiscernible].","I mean, our \u2013 we\u2019ve been giving salary increases. For example, people are talking about labor increase. We\u2019ve been given pretty robust salary increases for a decade to everyone and been managing it. We\u2019ve been absorbing it, except for the people in this room. And then we\u2019ve been \u2013 we have seen material costs. For example, we source U.S. Steel, but U.S. Steel rose, I think, 30% in the last 18 months and we\u2019ve absorbed it. We have some of it in our P&L this time, but our margins were up 70 basis points.","Bret Jordan","All right. Thank you.","Nicholas Pinchuk","So I think, you will see some of this in the future, but I think, we\u2019ll have to deal with this. Maybe I\u2019ll be explaining on our future call that we got zinged by some of it, but I think this is part of what we do is manage this. And one of the things we have, Bret, that\u2019s different is, I think, we\u2019re quite vertically integrated. So we have a lot of opportunity for RCI because of that vertical integration.","Bret Jordan","Okay, great. Thank you.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Richard Hilgert with Morningstar.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Richard?","Richard Hilgert","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Good morning.","Richard Hilgert","The RS&I group, is there \u2013 you talked about how we\u2019re seeing some expansion out there going from two-based, four-based that kind of thing. So there\u2019s this potential for more investment out there. Is there anything out there on the horizon that causes somewhat some uncertainty among general managers and shop owners that might cause them to curtail any of their spending? Is there any of that out there anywhere?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Well, I don\u2019t think in the independent repair shops. I think, those tend to roll pretty well. I mean, I think, over the years I\u2019ve seen them tend to be robust. Of course, people get different views. And during the recession, they were cash rich and confident. So something can happen to puncture their balloon of confidence, but I don\u2019t see it right now. For OEM dealerships, they can ebb and flow depending on how good and I guess, new car sales are.","But one of the great thing is that, the movement towards information and data and software is moving in a direction that plays in our advantage. And we see one of the stories behind our market is that our software business keeps growing. The software content keeps growing. Software the Tools Group was up significantly because of the intelligent diagnostics products of ZEUS and Apollo and some other things. And software growth in Mitchell 1 are repair information and shop management is up again. So the RS&I software grow. So component of our margin gain is \u2013 part of it is our software business is growing and that\u2019s contributing to margin rate.","Richard Hilgert","That\u2019s great, and that\u2019s a great segue for my next question. How \u2013 on your revenue for each of your groups, you have your organic growth. You have your impact from acquisitions and your impact from currency. On your margins, with revenue being slightly softer, that would convey to me potential negative operating leverage for your margin. But then you\u2019re offsetting it, part of that coming from the mix of products, some of that software. Is there anyway to quantify, here\u2019s how negative the operating leverage was? Here\u2019s how positive the impact from software is, or here\u2019s how positive the impact of RCI is? Do you have any kind of information you can or color you can give us on that?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Well, that\u2019s kind of a more detail. I will say, look, over \u2013 I\u2019ll just give you a little bit of thought. We\u2019re up 70 basis points as reported. 30 basis points was currency and we had some bad news associated with \u2013 the volume wasn\u2019t down. The volume was still up on an organic basis. So on an apples-to-apples basis, it\u2019s still up.","So we didn\u2019t have any deleveraging in that. We had some material cost increases. We had some other cost increases associated with the SFC. So you\u2019re ending up with RCI and margin mix is about equal to the 70 basis points, a little bit better than 70 basis points that you had overcome in some of that bad news.","Richard Hilgert","Okay, great. Thank you.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we have no more questions. I\u2019ll turn it back to Leslie Kratcoski.","Leslie Kratcoski","Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. A replay of the call will be available shortly on snapon.com. And as always, we appreciate your interest. Thanks a lot. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect and have a great day."],"19645":["Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 17, 2019 10:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Sara Verbsky \u2013 Vice President-Investor Relations","Nick Pinchuk \u2013 Chief Executive Officer","Aldo Pagliari \u2013 Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Gary Prestopino \u2013 Barrington Research","David Leiker \u2013 Baird","Bret Jordan \u2013 Jefferies","David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research","Curtis Nagle \u2013 Bank of America","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","Scott Stember \u2013 CL King","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, good day and welcome to the Snap-on Third Quarter 2019 Results Investor Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sara Verbsky, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma\u2019am.","Sara Verbsky","Thank you, Abby, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review Snap-on\u2019s third quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning.","We have on the call today, Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we\u2019ll take your questions.","As usual, we have provided slides to supplement our discussion. These slides can be accessed under the Downloads tab in the webcast viewer as well as on our website, snapon.com, under the Investors section. These slides will be archived on our website, along with the transcript of today\u2019s call.","Any statements made during this call relative to management\u2019s expectations, estimates or beliefs, or otherwise state management\u2019s or the company\u2019s outlook, plans or projections, are forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements.

Both can be found on our website.","With that said, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?","Nick Pinchuk","Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Today I\u2019ll start with the highlights of our third quarter. I\u2019ll give you update \u2013 an update on the environment and the trends we see. I\u2019ll take you through some of the turbulence we\u2019ve encountered and I\u2019ll speak about our physical and financial progress. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of the financials.","We believe that our third quarter again demonstrated Snap-on\u2019s ability to continue its trajectory of positive results, overcoming periodic and regional variation. The full third quarter results did demonstrate encouraging elements of progress that were somewhat attenuated by turbulence and challenged geographies and by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency. Like the last quarter, we had continuing progress in the U.S., up overall 3.2% with clear growth across our operations and across our groups. And again, this quarter that advancement was muted by a continuing pause in Europe, primarily in the UK, but also in country \u2013 in the Nordic countries, in Germany and Italy, several of the bellwether markets.","And as I\u2019ve said, there was also a meaningful impact from currency translation and transaction. So we had significant headwinds, but once again, our advantages prevailed. Organic sales were up 1.4%. Sales gains in the critical industries in OEM dealerships and diagnostics and information for independent repair shop owners and continued growth in the U.S. van channel; advancements in hand tools, diagnostics, repair information, customized tool sets and software. It all combined to meet the turbulence and the variation and it moved us forward again.","Opco operating income before financial services of $167.7 million compared to $173.1 million last year, and it included $4.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency. RCI was evident in the quarter, but it was not \u2013 it wasn\u2019t able to offset the negative foreign currency, the weakness in Europe and the investments that we\u2019re making in the field \u2013 in field support and training for the Tools Group that\u2019s aimed at enabling our powerful new products.","For financial services, operating income of $61 million grew $1.7 million from last year\u2019s $59.3 million. That result combined with opco for a consolidated operating margin of 23.2% compared with 23.7% last year. Quarterly EPS at $2.96 was up $0.11 or 3.9% above last year \u2013 of last year\u2019s $2.85 or 2.8% above last year\u2019s adjusted EPS, which excludes the one-time U.S. tax legislation transition charge that was in the 2018 third quarter results.","So now let\u2019s speak about the markets. We believe the automotive repair environment continues to be favorable. The Tools Group had registered a similar performance to the second quarter with a rise in the U.S., being offset by turbulence in international geographies. We believe we occupy a position of significant potential with the Tools Group. Vehicles are getting more complex. Our products are clearly keeping pace. The face to face positioning of our franchisees are perfect to guide technicians in wielding those powerful devices effectively. It\u2019s a great advantage in this changing environment and a considerable opportunity as we train our franchisees to provide that special guidance efficiently.","On the other side of automotive repair \u2013 of auto repair, Repair Systems & Information or the RS&I Group, encouraging progress in the quarter, expanding Snap-on\u2019s presence with repair shop owners and managers with a broad range of continually improving products; more intelligent, more comprehensive and more capable. The shops are changing and upgrading both dealerships and independents, and RS&I is capitalizing on that trend, helping the shop fix vehicles right the first time and it\u2019s paying off. For the critical industries, verticals like military, education, aerospace, important segments, we see significant progress. We like the quarter for critical industries, we like the way they\u2019re sounding and we like the way they\u2019re trending.","We do believe we\u2019re well positioned to confront the challenges and make progress along our runways for growth. At the same time though, it\u2019s clear that we have ongoing potential on our runways for improvement. The Snap-on Value Creation Processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI, they\u2019ve never been more important than these periods of multiple headwinds. They\u2019re a constant driver of our progress, helping counter the turbulence, especially customer connection, understanding the work of professional technicians and innovation, matching that insight with technology. And in this quarter, Snap-on Value Creation, customer connection and innovation drove growth in the face of challenges and led to more prestigious product awards.","Just in this quarter, Snap-on was prominently represented with 13 Professional Tool & Equipment News, PTEN, People\u2019s Choice Awards. These are the awards where the actual users, the technicians make the selection. We have 13. We\u2019re also recognized with six PTEN Innovation Awards, and we were honored with three MOTOR Magazine Top 20 awards. An essential driver of Snap-on growth, Snap-on\u2019s power, is innovative product that makes work easier. It\u2019s always been our strength. And these awards, hard won, are testimony that great Snap-on products just keep coming, matching the growing complexity of the task, maintaining forward progress. That\u2019s the environment.","Now we\u2019ll move to the individual operating groups. Let\u2019s start with C&I. Sales of $335.3 million in the quarter, increased $5.5 million, including $1.1 million from acquisitions and $5.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Organic growth was $9.5 million or 2.9% and that was gained pretty much across all the divisions.","Operating margins were lower 14.4% versus the 16.1% recorded last year. That\u2019s primarily reflecting critical \u2013 the critical industry sales being more weighted in this quarter towards the lower margin military sector. From a broad perspective, C&I focused on critical industries, outside the vehicle garage showed broad-based gains with another year-over-year increase now accomplished for 13 straight quarters.","We continue to rise in critical industries. We see it as a very good positive. It\u2019s a favorable market environment and we\u2019re addressing it with innovative new products aimed at solving tasks of consequence and results encouraging. The third quarter did see advancements in new products like our new power tool, our new CT9075 half-inch cordless impact wrench, the best balance of power and weight in the market, a five-amp power lithium battery, 900 foot pounds of sustained bolting force, 1,250 foot pounds of breakaway torque. That\u2019s big power.","But beyond the power, the CT9075 it\u2019s been designed and manufactured for long service life with best-in-class key components, high torque brushless motor, a full body impact hammer and a very robust anvil, with both the hammer and the anvil, key components for any power tool, any impact power tool, manufactured in our Murphy, North Carolina plant using special alloy steel, a material employed when superior toughness and superior strength are paramount.","We believe and testing shows that our new impact has a clear durability advantage, holding its power for many more cycles even when removing the most tightly torque fasteners. When the work is critical, the CT9075 is the answer faster, more powerful, tougher. Now we only released it to a few of our regions, but where it\u2019s been available, it\u2019s been a huge hit. Word travels fast, and technicians all over the country are pumped. They want this tool. It\u2019s already hit our $1 million product list and it\u2019s on its way to much, much more. Customer connection showed us what we needed to make a difference, speed, durability and power and the CT9075 has all that and the market reception confirms it.","In this quarter, from our FASTORQ acquisition, we also added to our industrial torque and tensioning key product lines from penetrating industrial \u2013 the critical industries. We added offerings by \u2013 torque and tensioning offerings by introducing the pneumatic SpinTORQ 360 degree torque wrench, utilizes a double-enveloping worm gear design. It\u2019s unique. It\u2019s a unique and focused product developed for critical industries and offering a significant speed advantage over standard ratcheting hydraulic wrenches because the SpinTORQ continually rotates the fastener, while \u2013 rather than turning what hydraulics \u2013 rather than doing what hydraulics do, turning a few degrees, ratcheting back and forth, and then repeating. Bolting time with the SpinTORQ is greatly reduced.","But the new wrench, not only faster, it\u2019s also operates with higher accuracy. A built-in torque control stall system delivers a bolting tension within plus or minus 5%, an uncommonly narrow range. It\u2019s also safer. The secondary trigger design focuses operators, forces operators to keep their hands away from pinch points, avoiding serious accidents that can happen. It\u2019s especially effective in oil and gas, power generation and mining where downtime is critical and higher travel distances for fasteners can be a significant time challenge.","We launched SpinTORQ in July and as expected the reception of critical initiatives has been strong. Products like these aimed at tasks of increasing complexity that help drive our progress across the critical initiatives and we\u2019ll keep working customer connection and innovation. So the advancements keep coming. C&I maintaining its momentum, extending in critical industries, moving Snap-on outside of the garage and it\u2019s working.","Now onto the Tools Group, organic sales flat, down 0.3%, continued growth in the U.S. up low single-digits, continued growth in the U.S. up low single-digits was offset again by variation internationally. Operating income in the quarter of $53 million, including the effect of negative foreign currency and the cost of investing in \u2013 was affected by negative currency and negative foreign currency and the cost of investing in more field support and training that compares to $59.3 million in 2018. Now the third quarter is when we hold our annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference or SFC.","This year, it was in Washington, more than 8,000 people were there, franchisees, their guests and the Snap-on team. We had sales and profit growth seminars and extensive training and intelligent diagnostics. It was all combined with 141,000 square foot product expo, showcasing our latest innovations. For the franchisees, it\u2019s an opportunity for learning, for touching and ordering new products and for recharging their Snap-on batteries.","And for the company, it\u2019s an opportunity to gauge our franchisees\u2019 outlook on the business. Well, one measure order volume was up mid single-digits off the SFC with most product categories showing gains over last year. And I spoke to with many of the franchisees during the weekend and I can attest they display a lot of confidence in our business and considerable optimism in their future with Snap-on. We do believe our franchisees continue to grow stronger and we\u2019re continuing to invest in their future.","And if you are with us at DC, you could see it clearly. We\u2019re investing in field support and training. We\u2019re investing in building our franchisees\u2019 ability to use their direct interface with technicians to communicate the unique capability of the Snap-on product line. We did that at the SFC and the diagnostic training session, well attended and well appreciated and it was a clear success.","We have confidence in the power of our product line and there are real reasons for the confidence. You heard about the product awards. Well beyond that, there\u2019s a continuous stream of other great new offerings, attention getters that make repairs easier and most of the challenges and attention getters that make repairs easier and meet the challenges of increasing vehicle complexity.","You\u2019re convinced of this when you see the innovations like our Snap-on FJ175, an exclusive 1.75 ton high performance aluminum jack manufactured in our Elkmont, Alabama facility. It\u2019s only 47 pounds. One of the benefits of having aircraft grade aluminum chassis components, at that lightweight, it\u2019s very portable, perfect for off \u2013 on the road repairs outside the garage. It\u2019s capable of lifting up to 3,500 pounds. It elevates up to 18 inches and features a low entry point of 3.4 inches. It can accommodate the range of vehicles, low ride to hard ride, low ride to high ride that challenges the repair shops of today.","It\u2019s got a premium pump, improved hydraulics and higher compound ratio so it works effectively even with one hand, a considerable field advantage actually. The diamond knurl handle improves the grip and the unit\u2019s portable design makes it great for a wide variety of situations.","Now let\u2019s talk about tool storage, among the new products launched, the SFC \u2013 SFC was the highly anticipated double-bank EPIQ utility vehicle both massive storage capacity of over 128,000 cubic inches. It\u2019s dubbed the EUV. It\u2019s a giant box. That includes our signature SpeeDrawer and Power Locker features that are aimed at making it easier for customers to keep their drawers organized and their power tools fully charged with five outlets and two USB ports.","The new unit has clear visual appeal. It\u2019s a design that evokes a race team pit way and everybody wants one. Striking 17 \u2013 it\u2019s got striking 17 inch wheels and a number of unique custom details like a special Snap-on logo center wheel cap, a distinction that\u2019s only available on the EUV. It\u2019s available in several colors and it is a mobile monster and it\u2019s still like it. It\u2019s designed to handle the very large tool loads by reinforcing the standard corner gussets in a scene construction with additional top, bottom and side support, it\u2019s our strongest ever roll cab and I kind of test, it was a center of attention at the SFC tool show, innovation and eye appeal, a winning combination. Well, that\u2019s the Tools Group, enthusiastic SFC, continued growth in the U.S., and innovative new products driving the way forward.","Now RS&I, organic sales were up 3.2% with mid-single-digit increases in both sales to OEM dealerships and sales of diagnostics and repair \u2013 sales of diagnostics and repair information to independent shops. Those gains were partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in the sales of undercar equipment, particularly reflecting weaker sales in Europe. Despite the higher mix of sales in OEM, essential programs, which tend to have a lower operating margin than the group average, RS&I OI margin was 25.8% quite strong, a rise of 10 basis points from the last year.","Once again, RCI innovation and software drove the progress and overcame the headwinds. Our Mitchell 1 division continued to expand its array of industry-leading productivity solutions by releasing its latest edition of our pro-demand repair information software, which includes new enhancements to wiring and proponent diagrams, select the replacement part, pro-demand now opens a specific component diagram of that item, no needed to scroll through multiple pages, a big time saver. The new software also clearly highlights related wires in the surrounding harness, more time saved. Both of those productivity features are industry first and they\u2019re quite popular.","We also launched other great products in the period, products like our M525F enhanced digital multimeter, another of our next generation horizontal multimeters. The units has a larger four inch color display for easier reading and quicker symbol identification. Today, interpreting a wide range of electrical impulses is necessary for diagnosing the circuit or component problems of today\u2019s vehicles. The new enhanced multimedia measures ohms and AC, DC voltage and true RMS, AC, DC amperage frequency and capacitance, and a rate covering most automotive electrical needs, and it\u2019s safe. It\u2019s safe for use on hybrid that\u2019s confirmed by its CAT III 1,000 volt and CAT IV 600 volt hybrid safety ratings.","In addition, it\u2019s got some clever special operating conveniences like test lead storage and built-in tilt stand. Initial product launch was strong and made the multimeter another of our hit products. So to wrap up RS&I, growth in OEM dealerships improving position with repair shop \u2013 independent repair shop owners and managers, expanding product lines, maintaining and improving strong margins. Well, that\u2019s the highlights of our quarter.","C&I; continuing its positive trends, extending across critical industries, Tools Group; matching the rise in vehicle complexity, RS&I, expanding in the shop, building sales and profitability. Progress along our runways for coherent growth and advancements down our runways for improvement and EPS $2.96 in the quarter, 2.8% higher than last year, progress hard won against turbulence is encouraging.","Now I\u2019d turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?","Aldo Pagliari","Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results have summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $901.8 million in the quarter were up 0.4% reflecting a 1.4% organic sales gain, $2.9 million of acquisition related sales and $11.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales gain this quarter reflected low-single-digit growth in both the commercial and industrial and the Repair Systems and Information segments.","Sales in the Snap-on Tools segment were essentially flat, but included low-single-digit gains in the U.S. franchise operations. Similar to last quarter, on a year-over-year basis, sales to customers in the United States increased across all segments while sales in Europe, particularly the United Kingdom, continue to exhibit weakness. Consolidated gross margin of 49.7% compared to 50.5% last year. The 80 basis point decrease primarily reflects increased sales in lower gross margin businesses, 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives.","The operating expense margin of 31.1% improved 10 basis points from 31.2% last year. Operating earnings before financial services of $167.7 million, including $4.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $173.1 million last year. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 18.6%, including 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to 19.3% last year.","Financial services revenue of $84.1 million and operating earnings of $61 million increased 2.6% and 2.9%, respectively, from 2018, primarily reflecting year-over-year growth in our financial services portfolio. Consolidated operating earnings of $228.7 million, including $4.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $232.4 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 23.2% compared to 23.7% last year.","Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 23.5% compared to 24% last year. During Q3 2018, our tax rate included a 90 basis point charge related to the implementation of tax legislation in the United States. Finally, net earnings on $164.6 million, $2.96 per share, including a $0.06 unfavorable impact associated with foreign currency compared to $163.2 million or $2.85 per share a year ago. In Q3 2018, excluding a $0.03 per share charge related to taxes, adjusted earnings per share was $2.88.","Now let\u2019s turn to our segment results. Starting with C&I Group on Slide 7, sales of $335.3 million in the quarter increased 1.5%, reflecting a 2.9% organic sales gain and $1.1 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $5.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic growth included a mid-single-digit gain in our specialty tools business, as well as low-single-digit increases in both the segment\u2019s European-based hand tools business and to customers in critical industries, particularly sales to the U.S. military.","Gross margin of 37.9% decreased 170 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to increased sales and lower gross margin businesses, including the aforementioned sales to the military. The operating expense margin of 23.5% was unchanged from last year. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $48.3 million decreased $4.7 million from last year, and the operating margin of 14.4% compared to 16.1% in 2018.","Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $385.2 million decreased 1.2%, primarily due to $3.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Organic sales were essentially flat, reflecting a mid-single-digit decline internationally, partially offset by a low-single-digit increase in the United States. Gross margin of 43.4% including 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects decreased 20 basis points from last year. The operating expense margin of 29.6% increased from 28.4% last year, primarily due to higher field support investments.","Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $53 million, including $2.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, decreased $6.3 million from last year, while the operating margin of 13.8%, including 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to 15.2% in 2018.","Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $322.7 million increased 2.6%, reflecting a 3.2% organic sales gain and $1.8 million of acquisition related sales, partially offset by $3.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase includes mid-single-digit gains in both sales to OEM dealerships and in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. These increases were partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in sales of undercar equipment, reflecting weaker sales in Europe.","Gross margin of 47.7% decreased 100 basis points from 48.7% last year, primarily due to the increased sales to OEM dealerships through the equipment solutions operation, which tend to have lower gross margins and lower operating expenses associated with such activity. The operating expense margin of 21.9% improved 110 basis points from 23% last year, primarily due to the aforementioned effect of higher sales to OEM dealerships and benefits from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings from the RS&I Group of $83.3 million increased $2.6 million from last year, and the operating margin of 25.8% compared to 25.7% a year ago.","Now turning to Slide 10. Operating earnings from financial services of $61 million increased 2.9% versus the third quarter of 2018. Revenue of $84.1 million was up 2.6% from a year ago. Financial services expenses of $23.1 million compared to $22.7 million last year. As a percentage of the portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.1% in the third quarters of both 2019 and 2018. The average yield on finance receivables was 17.7% in the third quarter of 2019 and in the third quarter of 2018. The average yield on contract receivables was 9.2% in both periods.","Total loan originations of $253.5 million decreased $13.5 million or 5.1%, primarily due to a decrease in originations of finance receivables, resulting from lower year-over-year Snap-on Tools franchisee sales of big-ticket items that utilize extended credit.","Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.1 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.8 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio grew $12.3 million in the third quarter. The 60-day-plus delinquency rate of 1.7% for U.S. extended credit remains stable and reflects the seasonal increase we typically experience in the third quarter. As it relates to extended credit for finance receivables, the largest portion of the portfolio, trailing 12 month net losses of $49.9 million, represented 2.97% of outstandings at quarter end, down 3 basis points sequentially, supporting continued stabilization of the portfolio\u2019s credit metric performance.","Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $131.1 million in the quarter, increased $1.3 million from comparable 2018 levels, primarily do the higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $76.8 million included net additions to finance receivables of $15.4 million, capital expenditures of $29.6 million and $29.6 million for the acquisition of Cognitran, which specializes in flexible, modular and highly scalable software as a service products for OEM customers and their dealers.","Net cash used by financing activities of $49.5 million included cash dividends of $52.3 million and the repurchase of 400,000 shares of common stock for $59.7 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of the end of September, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $390.6 million of common stock under existing authorizations.","Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable decreased $7.8 million from 2018 year end. Days sales outstanding of 66 days compared to 67 days in 2018 year end. Inventories increased $79.7 million from 2018 year end, primarily to support higher levels of demand across critical industries, including demand for U.S. manufactured hand tools, new products as well as to improve service levels to our customers. On a trailing 12 month basis, inventory turns of 2.6 compared to 2.9 at year end 2018.","Our quarter end cash position of $167.5 million increased $26.6 million from 2018 year end levels. Our net debt-to-capital ratio decreased to 23.5% from 24.2% at year end 2018. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities as we entered into a new five year $800 million multi-currency revolving credit facility on September 16, which amends and restates the previous facility. As of quarter end, we had $218.8 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding, an increase of $41.7 million since year end 2018.","That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance, and I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?","Nick Pinchuk","Thanks, Aldo. Well, that\u2019s our third quarter. The results demonstrate encouraging elements of progress attenuated by turbulent geographies and by unfavorable perms. Overall organic growth at 1.4%, the results of progress in the U.S. growing at 3.2% challenged by slippage in Europe, where sales decreased and slide \u2013 and there was slides in the UK, the Nordic countries and German. The Tools Group about flat, decreasing 0.3% continued modest growth in the U.S. offset by international turbulence, increasing vehicle complexity matched by powerful new products and investment in training, making it possible for the franchisees to sell our enhanced offerings and the unique capabilities that they have effectively. Enabling franchisees to leverage their face to face advantage.","C&I up 2.9% organically, with each division contributing to the continuing extension in critical industries and RS&I rising 3.2% organically, further progress and expanding with OEM dealerships and independent shop, hardware and software driving growth. Overall OI margin of 18.6%, down 70 basis points, but still strong given the turbulence. It all came together for an EPS of $2.96, up 2.8% as adjusted, despite the challenges.","Our markets, vehicle technicians, critical industries, emerging economies, and repair shop owners and managers offer ongoing opportunity and we believe we have the position, the capability and the focus to take advantage of those possibilities and to continue our positive trend through the end of this year and on into 2020 and beyond.","Before I turn the call over to the operator, I\u2019ll talk directly to our franchisees and associates. I know many of you are listening. When I speak of position of capability in a focus, I speak of you. The gains we\u2019ve made and the advancements we anticipate reflect your extraordinary contributions. For the progress you\u2019ve achieved, you have my congratulations and for your unfailing commitment and dedication to our team, you have my thanks.","Now I\u2019d turn the call over to the operator. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.","Gary Prestopino","Hey, good morning everyone.","Nick Pinchuk","Good morning, Gary Prestopino.","Gary Prestopino","Thanks. Hey Nick, could you maybe just give us your best guess and your thoughts on if we get a Brexit deal, how that is \u2013 how that impacts your UK, as well as your European business?","Nick Pinchuk","It\u2019s hard to judge, but what \u2013 it\u2019s like this, the pound, just talking about the pound, it\u2019s worth 40% of the profit impact and about a third of the sales impact. UK, if you think about it, the way our business is a rig, we have a number of businesses in UK, but it\u2019s a place where technicians own their own tools. So Tools Group has a particularly strong position there. So a lot of the markets were kind of exposed in the UK, I think it might be the second or third largest market for us.","If it gets better, first of all, if the current goes positive, that\u2019s one good thing for us. And then secondly, I think, my view is, is that there hasn\u2019t been an organized areas, an organized economy, an economic or commercial angst that equals Brexit in a long time. And so you can hear it from the marketplace that people are worried about the future, what\u2019s going to happen commercially and therefore they focused more on the items that only have short paybacks, that gets resolved all that changes.","So I think they\u2019re \u2013 if you think about it as our second or third largest market, it comes back to normal I don\u2019t know the time constants to which it comes back to normal, but I have to believe it\u2019s pretty good. Pretty quick.","Gary Prestopino","Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s all.","Nick Pinchuk","Okay. Sure.","Gary Prestopino","And then, could you maybe just comment on what kind \u2013 did you see any growth in the tool storage area year-over-year? Given that you\u2019ve put out a whole bunch of new products out there?","Nick Pinchuk","Yes, well the tool storage, what you want to look at is the tool storage out of the SFC and we did see growth out of the SFC, so that\u2019s the big events in this quarter. I\u2019ve always say the third quarter is squarely, you can\u2019t figure any \u2013 you can\u2019t extrapolate any trends out of the third quarter, particularly because we had people coming back from vacations and the distributors in Europe are off for part of it, but also because we have the SFC and that creates variations in the behaviors of the franchisees, they usually wait for this and a lot of it has to do with \u2013 the success with tool storage has to do with how it came out of the SFC and it came out okay out of the SFC.","Gary Prestopino","Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much.","Nick Pinchuk","Good.","Operator","We will take our next question from David Leiker with Baird.","David Leiker","All right. Good morning everyone.","Nick Pinchuk","Good morning.","Aldo Pagliari","Hi, David.","David Leiker","Nick or Aldo, on the Tools Group, we\u2019ve talked about this, but I just want to dig through this. The higher spending level is not driving revenue and that\u2019s a missing part of the equation of this story. So I guess \u2013 is the issue there that, that spending \u2013 how do you measure the effectiveness of that spending, if that\u2019s working?","Nick Pinchuk","Well, here look, I think, actually it\u2019s pretty simple. You\u2019re looking for more sales. So I think that\u2019s certainly it. So the ultimate measure is to see more sales and we did see diagnostics, this sort of \u2013 we had pretty good focus on diagnostics to the SFC, those seminars were well attended. The feedback we got, I got personally and we got generally from the people in the surveys is very good about the attendance and the roll out of the SFC to take up out of the SFC was pretty good.","Now what happens is the SFC product ends up being late in the quarter, so you can\u2019t really judge by the third, it\u2019s a very iffy thing and it rolls into the fourth quarter and so on. So it\u2019s hard to judge whether that particularly had an effect on sales or not, but that\u2019s the ultimate test. We\u2019re doing it, so sales go up, you know what I mean? We\u2019re convinced though, that, part of this has to do with the products are getting more complex and it takes unless you\u2019re very, very practiced at selling it, it eats up time.","And I\u2019ve been saying for a dog\u2019s age, how much the time of a franchisee is a scarce resource, so it bumps up against our selling capacity. Actually, the motion of the market bumps up again and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do, we\u2019re trying to unleash that. But sales are the basis for it.","David Leiker","Yes. So this spend I think is predominantly in the U.S. market, right?","Nick Pinchuk","Pretty much. Because \u2013 look, despite this U.S. market we think is okay, the other markets are kind of afflicted.","David Leiker","Yes. So if you look at the U.S. market, I mean low-single-digits here, I think you might\u2019ve been mid-single-digit the quarter before, does that imply that spend is working the way you want it or are you trying to get sales higher?","Nick Pinchuk","We\u2019re trying to get sales higher.","Aldo Pagliari","The sales were also low-single-digit in Q2.","Nick Pinchuk","Yes. They were low-single-digit, we\u2019re trying to get sales high. That\u2019s true, I mean that\u2019s the whole thing. This is a situation that we believe the market is there. We believe we have the products that can take that market. We see those products having some frictions in the way our business operates in terms of the way they sell. And so we have to make it more efficient, that\u2019s why we\u2019re spending on this. But we\u2019re pretty confident that that\u2019s going to work. And by the way, the franchisees tell us, I just had a franchisee tell me that he got training and then he conducted training for technicians. It\u2019s all about telling the technicians how to wheel these products and he sold a lot of diagnostics.","So we hear a lot of windshield surveys about this kind of approach working for us and the training having positive effect. But it hasn\u2019t played out in the numbers yet because I don\u2019t think we saw after the SFC the \u2013 we haven\u2019t got a full results there for the SFC based on calendarization","David Leiker","So let me ask you one other piece on the same topic. So the spend isn\u2019t driving the sales, is that because there is a lag between those and we\u2019re still waiting on that? Is that because of what you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t working, you need to continue to tweak it and find something else? What\u2019s your thought?","Nick Pinchuk","No, look, I think we think our \u2013 it\u2019s working better. We will continue to tweak it every quarter, we\u2019ll continue to tweak it, because this kind of thing, you need to keep making it better and better, that\u2019s the thing. But it\u2019s not because we don\u2019t think the current \u2013 we actually were very encouraged by the results \u2013 by the feedback we got after the SFC. But in terms of reporting, we got to see the sales and if we don\u2019t see the sales, we\u2019re start tweaking again and we\u2019ll probably keep tweaking anyway, like we tweaked the Rock \u2018n Roll Cab. All that time it was growing, it wasn\u2019t static.","David Leiker","Okay. And then just one other item, although on the working capital you went through some of the comments as it relates sequentially, quarter-to-quarter, if you look at the year-to-date number or even year-over-year, there\u2019s about a $100 million that went into working capital. Some of that\u2019s going to be currency, some of that\u2019s going to be acquisitions. But can you talk about what the pieces of that are and break that a part for us?","Aldo Pagliari","Sure. David, actually, you and Nick have been talking about a big piece of it. Actually, if you look at the year-over-year variance, 65% of the increase is attributable to the Snap-On Tools Group. If you look at it in the quarter, 85% of the variance is related to the Snap-On Tools Group. So one thing, we think there is more opportunities to be had. The inventory is there to try to capture those opportunities as they manifest themselves.","Second, what makes it \u2013 the order is taken to the SFC, we\u2019re well above the sales that we had in terms of the quarter. So while orders don\u2019t necessarily equals sales, we like having stronger orders coming out of the SFC and that\u2019s why we feel pretty good that the inventory we have built as a home to go to as we roll through the future quarters.","David Leiker","Okay. Thanks.","Nick Pinchuk","Sure.","Operator","We will take our next question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.","Bret Jordan","Hey, good morning guys.","Nick Pinchuk","Good morning.","Aldo Pagliari","Hi, Bret.","Bret Jordan","Nick, I guess all those questions for you. On corporate expense and obviously controlled number this quarter, should we be thinking about sort of a lower corporate expense over time? I think you used to sort of guide to that and the number was north of 90, but is something structurally going on now?","Nick Pinchuk","I think the right ongoing pace of corporate expense, if you look at it runs between $20 million to $23 million per quarter, so we\u2019re under that. I hate to say the reason we\u2019re under it, because variable compensation is down significantly, actually accounts for most of the differential. So obviously, if we start to achieve the type of sales targets and you\u2019ve heard us talk about and operating performance, we would expect that to return to a more normal level. And so I\u2019m not going to give you a quarter-by-quarter estimate. We still hold true to our long-term run rates, that corporate would be in the $90 million to $95 million range would be more appropriate. This year we just hit our own targets.","Bret Jordan","Okay. And then on \u2013 question on sort of follow-up question on the inventory, the working capital question. I think in the prepared remarks you talked about it being higher for \u2013 anticipate a critical industry demand, but then on that last response you were talking about a fair amount of the working capital growth being tools related. Do you have visibility on this critical industry ordering that the inventory that you\u2019re building is going to get sold out? Is there sort of a build of inventory in advance of the sale or is this sort of more speculative inventory growth?","Nick Pinchuk","Actually, on the critical industry side it\u2019s less speculative, it\u2019s actually more made to order the problem that you have, I guess, you can say it here, the fact that we manage \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a happy problem or a difficult problem, hand tool volume in the Tools Group has never been higher. It\u2019s putting a lot of demand for all the resources that we have in our manufacturing plants that are dedicated to hand tools.","In addition, the projects that are very specific that are in the hands of our industrial division that serves a critical industries have a lot of hand tool content. It\u2019s a nature of the timing of how these projects unfold, many times you\u2019ve bid them as much as a year earlier when they\u2019re finally awarded and get funding, sometimes it takes quarters of lag. So what you have is you\u2019ve doubled down on demand at the same time coming out of our hand tool factories. So to answer your question, on the industrial side, it\u2019s not speculative.","You can always argue that on the tool side, while we try to control the pace of demand to some extent with our product offerings and our promotions and what we intend to offer, it is a little bit more short-term in that will live hand to mouth in the Tools Group, right, in terms of the order book. On the critical industry side, there is more of a backlog, so we know what our customers want, we have the Tools Group that actually has to supply to both, but the Industrial Group itself doesn\u2019t have factories. The Tools Group is the key supplier to the Industrial Group.","Bret Jordan","Yes. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","Yes, good morning everyone. Just to hang up on the inventory discussion while we\u2019re on that topic, how does this 2.6 times turnover compared with targeted levels? What is \u2013 how should we be thinking about kind of a normalized number there?","Aldo Pagliari","Well, I think the question is more like this, is that, I don\u2019t think, we kind of look at ourselves to make sure that we have the appropriate inventory in place, and it\u2019s not so much a target. I wouldn\u2019t say the target is an independent variable. What we target is the return on net operating assets because one of the situations where we keep expanding our product offerings, so that keeps adding to inventory. Our principal, primary drive is the RONA bit calculation as opposed to the inventory turn calculation.","David MacGregor","Okay. Conspicuous \u2013 I guess conspicuous is the absence from the discussion of the Tools segment this quarter was RCI. And I guess the question is do you feel you\u2019ve kind of approached the limits of what\u2019s achievable in the near-term in terms of margin there?","Nick Pinchuk","No. I think I said in \u2013 you can\u2019t cover everything in these calls. So I \u2013 the thing is it\u2019s like this is that generally, RCI is operating pretty well, but this is a time of periodic challenge. There are a lot of things going on. For example, you have currency. You have some of these higher costs in investing in the Tools Group. Both of those are in great factor in the Tools Group. On the other end and as well, you do have some material costs floating through. Normally we don\u2019t mention material costs, but they\u2019re not matched with such other challenges. So RCI didn\u2019t really offset those, so we didn\u2019t talk about them. RCI was a counterbalance though to some of them.","I mean if you look at the Tools Group, one of the things that\u2019s kind of interesting of the Tools Group, if you look at the gross margin, the gross margin is down 20 basis points, again, 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. So at the gross margin level, you can see, if you just hone in on that, you can see the effects of RCI.","David MacGregor","On the operating expenses, I guess you talked about higher field support investments. I guess a question for Aldo, how long will it take these investments to leverage in the margins?","Aldo Pagliari","Well, it\u2019s a good question. I don\u2019t want to give you a quarter-by-quarter guidance. To kind of indirectly answer this or I directly answered it, I guess, earlier on, we believe in what we\u2019re doing. It doesn\u2019t mean you meet with immediate success. One key differentiator, David, for Snap-on, as you well know, is we\u2019re up close and personal. That\u2019s what we\u2019re all about. That differentiates us from the crowd.","In terms of our franchisees, that means to have to be on-site delivering great expertise to help customers solve problems out of the variety of.42,000 SKUs that they represent in the backdrop, which means we have to make sure that our guys are trained to be effective in delivering that message and do it in a very narrow time constant. They only have so many minutes that they can spend. So we find there\u2019s better ways to do it, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been embracing.","We accentuated that at the SFC, and we are very pleased that we had, I think, well over 1,200 attendees at our \u2013 as an example, our diagnostic training session, which tends to be a complicated product. So we believe the franchisees recognize the importance of ongoing training for themselves and when they have assistance, their teams, and we\u2019re going to continue to reinforce that and we\u2019re not going to abandon our approach to differentiate Snap-on on that basis. So I hope we get the returns very quickly. I can\u2019t guarantee that and we\u2019ll continue to invest in that channel though to make sure that they are par excellence as opposed to the competition.","Nick Pinchuk","So we see it as a kind of strategic advantage. One of the things about it, cars are getting more complex. The way to fix them are with these very elaborate products, but the elaborate products cannot actually be effectively wielded without face to face guidance and training and coaching that our franchisees are well positioned to do. The problem is if they\u2019re not really good at it, it\u2019ll eat up a lot of their time. That\u2019s why we\u2019re so high on this training and focused on it. Take advantage of that strategic\u2026","David MacGregor","Thanks for that detail. Last question for me is just we keep talking about organic growth in the Tool segment and it\u2019s been a real challenge and frustrating for you, I\u2019m sure. I guess I\u2019m trying to understand some of the structural underpinnings behind the situation. I wonder if you could just talk about the extent to which you feel franchisee attrition is a headwind in achieving that 4% goal.","Nick Pinchuk","Okay. A lot of \u2013 there are a lot of ways to think about this. I mean, franchisee attrition can be a headwind. I mean, certainly to the extent you have retirement, where the people who have been in place for a long time, sometimes it\u2019s hard to \u2013 to replace them. So certainly in one point in time if you have more turn-ins, even if you \u2013 and like this quarter, we basically had turn-ins and we didn\u2019t lose any franchisees and we filled up those routes immediately, but there is a startup period. So that\u2019ll set you back a little bit.","But on the other hand, in many cases when you put a fresh pair of hands in, an enthusiastic fresh pair of hands that\u2019s starting out, they are smoking and the numbers go up. So I think you kind of balance those two. I\u2019m not sure you can say for sure, it might be a temporal situation for a short period of time, but I kind of think when we replace people it\u2019s okay.","David MacGregor","Thanks, guys.","Nick Pinchuk","Sure.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Curtis Nagle with Bank of America.","Curtis Nagle","Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks very much taking the call.","Aldo Pagliari","Good morning, Curt.","Curtis Nagle","How are you guys doing?","Aldo Pagliari","We\u2019re surviving, buddy.","Curtis Nagle","Okay, good. So, yes, just I guess two quick ones on capital. It looks like CapEx, I think kicked up a little bit. Just curious what that\u2019s accounted for.","Nick Pinchuk","Yes, new product. I mean, the thing is that we\u2019re expanding products. So you heard, I think we both mentioned that hand tools are pretty strong in the quarter, and so you\u2019re expanding that. And all that new product I went through in my discussion that is often backed up by factory positioning, but particularly the hand tool business, which is very highly integrated. So that\u2019s what\u2019s driving that a lot.","And then also we invest because we turn out so many new products, we tend to invest in the ability to just to design those products and to figure out how we can prototype faster and so on, things like direct laser metal sintering and 3D and so on. And Mitchell 1, we\u2019re expanding in Mitchell 1, we\u2019re putting them in a bigger building because they\u2019re so profitable and has done so well. Mitchell 1 has been \u2013 if you\u2019ve been listening to the calls, have been every quarter doing very well and they\u2019re a high profitability company, so we want to enable them as much as possible.","Curtis Nagle","Okay, understood. And then, yes, just kind of on a related topic, in terms of executions for buybacks. Looks like it\u2019s a good bit below last year, at least up through 3Q. So I guess, how should we think about that? Perhaps you\u2019ll have a pickup in 4Q? Or is there something else that\u2019s holding you back at the moment?","Aldo Pagliari","Actually, I\u2019ll answer that, Curtis. Actually, it\u2019s a little bit more similar than you realize. If you look back in Q3, there was a lot of share option exercise that occurred in the quarter. So if you look at the net share repurchase, it actually is very similar. It was $58 million this year versus $59.9 million last year. So actually similar in that regard.","Having said that, we look at share opportunities in terms of repurchase effort, we look at where the stocks at relative to the market, what is the backdrop, how much volatility is in the marketplace and things of that nature. So it\u2019s hard to say with exactitude what one\u2019s going to buy in any quarter, but it was an opportunity to buy in the quarter and we did. And if you look on a trailing 12-month basis, we\u2019ve been on pace to buy a little over 2% of the outstanding shares of the company. So it\u2019s something that we look at each and every quarter and talk to the Board about what we should devote to this activity and we have authorization to be flexible. So at this point in time we\u2019re in pretty good shape.","Curtis Nagle","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","We will take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn","Yes, good morning. Thanks. Wondering where you might be seeing macro impacts of the well known economic slowdown there \u2013 out there. I know many of your markets sync to their own tune to a little bit of a degree, but you are diversified. So wondering where you\u2019re seeing some of those impacts.","Nick Pinchuk","Say that again. Where you\u2019re seeing the impacts of economics on the markets?","Christopher Glynn","The slower macro there, with the caveat that I know some of your access to markets operate a little independently of short-term macro fluctuations. Just wondering\u2026","Nick Pinchuk","Yes, look, I think, we \u2013 okay, I got it. I think we think the U.S. is pretty good. I think U.S. business is \u2013 if you look at the macros in the U.S. in terms of technician wages, went up 3.6% year-over-year. And the investment \u2013 the nominal investment in the car \u2013 the real investment in the car repair went up 2.5%, so \u2013 and the miles driven went up. So I think that\u2019s pretty positive. And we kind of feel that when we do the windshield surveys out in the marketplace. So we think that\u2019s a good business.","I mean, the industrial business in the U.S. was okay for us in the quarter. It again was very good. I think when you talk to people in industrial and the bigger companies, they\u2019re a little more muted in their views of the world, but still we think that\u2019s okay. I think Europe, the UK and Germany were particularly more difficult. I don\u2019t know, I think that\u2019s all Brexit related though. Both of those are related in terms of Brexit.","In Asia-Pacific, China is a kind of, I would say squirrely market these days. And it was kind of flattish this quarter, maybe down just a little bit, but you see China having a little bit more difficulties in terms of the \u2013 I suppose in psychology of commercial advancement these days. So I think you see that. I think Australia; we\u2019ve seen Australia coming off the bubble I think commodity related and so on, the latest commodity downturn.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. And on the SOT margins\u2026","Nick Pinchuk","Yes.","Christopher Glynn","As it\u2019s been sort of a flattish or below target for some times as just addressed, I\u2019m wondering if that your \u2013 there\u2019s maybe a structural reset in the margins we should anticipate as you kind of create a cost structure to see the next succession of higher organic compounding, and maybe the channel investment you\u2019re putting in now is maybe a step in that direction. Just curious wanted to float that concept by you.","Nick Pinchuk","Well, I think, look \u2013 I think, Chris, the gross margins now okay, generally. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of variation. Like I said, those margins has been okay and we\u2019re investing a little bit in the business, and so I do believe we\u2019re going to stay at that level for some time. Even if sales come back, the plan is we\u2019re investing in that, we\u2019re enabling the franchisees and the sales go up. As a percent of sales, they don\u2019t \u2013 you kind of fall away and of course profitability goes up. That\u2019s the idea. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re looking to \u2013 that is an ad which we\u2019re going to keep for awhile, but we are \u2013 that\u2019s what we think is going to work.","Christopher Glynn","So you\u2019re not working out a fundamental resizing of the SG&A side, necessarily?","Nick Pinchuk","No, no, no, no, because we think we know the problem.","Christopher Glynn","Okay, great. Thank you.","Nick Pinchuk","Yes.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Stember with CL King.","Scott Stember","Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions.","Aldo Pagliari","Hi, Scott.","Scott Stember","Aldo, you made a comment about within tools that the hand tool demand was \u2013 has never been higher. Can you maybe just give us some of the sub-segments within Tools how hand tools ditch tool storage, power tools and all that kind of, and diagnostics?","Aldo Pagliari","Sure. Hand tools is and has been the biggest category for the Snap-on Tools Group. And again, it\u2019s had a very robust year. By design to some extent, I mean, because we\u2019ve introduced a lot of new products in that area. We\u2019ve put together a lot of nice promotional packages in that area. It\u2019s resonated with the franchisees and seems to be resonating in the uptake of their customer base. So again hand tools has not dissipated whatsoever even with the advent of more complexity in cars.","Next important product lines, typically is the tool storage and diagnostics. Tool storage tends to be right up there. And this quarter diagnostics was actually better. Diagnostics did quite well off the Tools Group. And again, you\u2019ve been hearing us talk a little bit about emphasis. So any quarter, Scott, you get variation depending on what the team is emphasizing. In this particular quarter, diagnostics was a little bit more accentuated; training that we\u2019ve talked about already and things of that nature.","And power tools is more an issue of timing. Power tools was not as big in the quarter for sales to the Tools Group, but the order book for power tools looks pretty good. And Nick talked that like \u2013 some of the new product features on the half-inch impact and we expect that\u2019s going to have pretty good fourth quarter even though we don\u2019t give guidance kind of in the future quarters. So that\u2019s kind of the lay of the land.","Nick Pinchuk","See, the thing about hand tools is it\u2019s been up strong for several quarters. But that\u2019s what leads to the Aldo\u2019s comments that the demand is very, very robust because that\u2019s been pretty steady, higher and higher. It\u2019s going fairly well because of the expansive things like the FDX, the Flank Drive Extra, spreading out over the wrenches, get people to say, oh, I need a new set of wrenches because this is the new wrenching system and it\u2019s much more effective. So they sign up for that. So the hand tool product line has been particularly robust and has resonated with customers and it\u2019s been for several quarters. That\u2019s what leads to the question of the factories.","Scott Stember","Yes. And just \u2013 could you just give us some commentary up mid singles, high singles and maybe for a couple of the other sub-segments as well, some actual numbers?","Aldo Pagliari","You\u2019re talking about Tools Group or the other groups now?","Scott Stember","Yes, within Tools Group, maybe how the hand tool was up mid singles, high singles?","Aldo Pagliari","Our hand tools was up mid-single digits and diagnostics is up strong, even stronger than that. Power tools as I said, it was down for them in the quarter and tool storage was more reflective of timing down a bit, but again, the order book for tool storage looked pretty good at the show. So again, orders don\u2019t necessarily equal sales, but a nice order book coming out of the SFC related to tool storage.","Nick Pinchuk","And in the third quarter, the general view was more or less what happens in the orders out of the SFC. And generally, they were mostly \u2013 in fact, I think they were, all those categories we talked about were up mid \u2013 lower mid-single digits. So it came out relatively strong. I think the SFC itself was up mid-single digit.","Scott Stember","All right. And within RS&I, could you maybe just quantify how sales work in your company versus outside of the Tool Group, meaning to outside whether it was a dealerships, just quantify what the numbers were?","Nick Pinchuk","Wow. I think that the intercompany sales is principally the sales of diagnostics. There\u2019s some equipment that sells through there too. I think the diagnostics were up reasonably strong in the quarter, reasonably strong in the quarter. They get sold not exclusively, but principally to the Tools Group and they were up I think mid-single digits in a quarter, so we had that. And then, Aldo already told you that the sales by the Tools Group was positive, so that\u2019s a nice balance.","And then equipment I think was flat to down, a little bit down in the quarter for the Tools Group. And those were the primary intercompany sales. The rest of the stuff, like I said, you had actually, the way you think about RS&I is, is the sales to the OEM businesses generally tends to be a little bit low margin \u2013 little lower margin, lower SG&A. That was up about double digits I think really well. The sales to the independent repair shops with the software diagnostics were also up mid single-digit. So \u2013 and the equipment business was down a little bit driven by weakness in Europe.","Scott Stember","Got it. And lastly on FX, last quarter, last couple of quarters you gave \u2013 the earnings impact was to the bottom line. What was it this quarter? And also \u2013 go ahead, I\u2019m sorry.","Nick Pinchuk","It was about $0.06.","Aldo Pagliari","Yes. Previous quarter, Scott, it was $0.08 of bad news. This quarter it got a little better at $0.06 and I expect that trend is kind of what I\u2019d look at in Q4. Again, currencies never stay where they\u2019re at. But if they do, it\u2019ll be slightly less headwind than the bottom line and Q4 currencies stay where they\u2019re at the end of the quarter here.","Scott Stember","Got it. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks, again.","Nick Pinchuk","Thank you.","Operator","And with no additional questions, I would like to turn the call back to Sara Verbsky, for any additional or closing remarks.","Sara Verbsky","Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s call and we thank you for your participation.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference to Ms. Leslie Kratcoski, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Leslie H. Kratcoski","Thanks, Augusta, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review our fourth quarter 2012 results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.","As usual, we have provided slides to supplement our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on our website next to the audio icon for this call. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript of today's call.","Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements.","Additional information on the factors that could cause our results to differ materially are contained in our SEC filings. With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. We're going to follow the usual agenda for these calls. I'll provide my perspective on our results on our various markets, as well as on the progress we made during the fourth quarter and the year, then Aldo will provide a detailed review of all the financials.","I believe the results in the quarter and throughout all of 2012 were encouraging and provide abundant evidence of advancements along our runways for growth and improvement.","Our EPS in the fourth quarter was $1.43, up from $1.27 in 2011. That rise reflects an OpCo operating margin that improved to 14.8%, along with a strong increase in operating income from financial services, which rose to $29.3 million. It all added up to a consolidated operating margin of 17.7%, which compares to 16.3% in the prior year.","Sales in the quarter were $753.2 million, a 2.5% organic increase before a slight offset of, I guess, about 20 basis points due to unfavorable foreign currency. That gain does include a continuation of the generally favorable trends we've seen in our automotive repair sector and the Tools Group and in the Repair Systems & Information Group. So we've seen the automotive repair sector strong. Now the 2.5% was somewhat less than what we've seen in the past periods. That's reflective primarily of the increased headwinds from restricted military spending in the Commercial & Industrial Group.","I think everybody's well aware of the situation that existed as we approached the year end and the fiscal cliff, which, by the way, remains an overhang going forward. We're still dealing with potential sequestration. That uncertainty, along with the generally reduced spending from the wind down of the troop deployments, are what's behind the military weakness.","The fourth quarter did highlight the fluid and fragile environment we've seen in the worldwide economic picture, and there was turbulence from place to place. Overall, however, outside of the military contraction, our year-over-year sales comparison in the quarter can be characterized as similar to past periods, somewhat weaker in certain areas, but within a normal range of variation, the kinds you would expect to see from period to period. So as always, there are headwinds. That's nothing new. Europe difficulties have been there for some time, but now we see a larger military contraction. But there are positives as well: strength in our automotive repair sectors, opportunity in emerging markets and progress in serving critical industries. We're encouraged by the advancements being made along our defined runways for growth, areas that we've identified as being decisive for our future: extending into critical industries, building in emerging markets, enhancing the franchise network and expanding in the garage. Gains in each of these strategically important areas have enabled us to more than offset the various spots of weakness throughout 2012 and are testimony to the balance and the breadth of our coherent growths.","Along with the advancements in those areas of opportunity, we're also seeing clear benefits related to our Snap-on Value Creation Processes, a set of principles that we focus on every day to drive improvement in safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and RCI. You can see that in the encouraging results of the quarter.","You can also see the progress in the full year results, a 4.6% organic sales gain, overcoming a number of headwinds, most notably Europe. At the same time, the full year OpCo operating margin rose to 13.9%, an increase of 40 basis points, in spite of nearly $14 million or a 50-basis-point impact from higher mark-to-market accounting adjustments related to changes in our share price.","So now let's take a look at the highlights of each of the segments. The Commercial & Industrial Group, or C&I -- or the Commercial & Industrial C&I Group is where we're bearing the brunt of both the European and military difficulties. The impact is evident in the 6.2% organic sales decline after being up mid-single digits in the first 3 quarters of the year. In spite of that sales decline, however, the operating margin, at 11.6%, was reasonably encouraging as we are seeing benefits from RCI across the group and further improvements at SNA Europe, specifically in part because of the restructuring actions we've taken as the challenges of the European economies linger.","Sales in SNA Europe were down double digits compared to last year, a somewhat weaker comparison than Q3, but not a clear indication of the changed environment. As I mentioned, the significant double-digit decline in military activity in our industrial division was clearly a much greater headwind than we've seen in the past couple of quarters. On the other hand, our industrial business did post gains in critical industries outside of the military. We're extending our reach by developing new products and programs to specifically serve customers in sectors like aviation, oil & gas, mining, power generation and technical education. We're gaining strategic position in each of those areas. One of the real highlights of our expansion into critical industries this quarter, and in fact every quarter of the year, was the double-digit growth in Aviation & Aerospace. Importantly, much of that growth is international, from manufacturers to maintenance and repair and overhaul facilities and to a wide variety of flight operations.","And certainly, no discussion of progress for us would be complete without mention of our Asia-Pacific operation. Once again in the quarter, we posted double-digit gains in the emerging market of that region, broad increases. Thailand was particularly strong. Indonesia also contributed nicely. The quarter was much the same story as it has been throughout the year. We're building our presence across the region.","In both China and India, clearly important markets, our crucial undercar and equipment and hand tool product lines led the way with strong gains during the year. In November, this last November, I was in China to attend the opening of our fourth plants at our site in Kunshan. It's a state-of-the-art facility dedicated to undercar equipment for the region, appropriate, we believe, given the substantial growth and opportunity that's available in that segment.","Last month, I also attended a number of reseller and associate new year kick-off meetings in Asia. I can tell you, the enthusiasm regarding our expanding presence and regarding our product line is encouraging and it's contagious. I believe it bodes well for our future as the repair wave rises in emerging markets.","Let's move to the Tools Group. Another quarter of strong growth. Organic sales for the group were up 9.3%, with a similar rise in the U.S. Operating margin in the quarter was 14.2%, up 70 basis points. The fourth quarter was a continuation of the progress we've made throughout 2012. Enhancing the van channel has been a primary focus for quite some time, and that focus, along with the associated investments we've made, has driven results. Clearly, one of the big advantages is our wholly-owned Financial Services company, Snap-on Credit. Aldo will talk in some detail about the positive financial results for the operations. I'll just say, by working closely with the Tools Group, our financial arm has been instrumental in helping drive the van sales increases we saw throughout 2012. We've had a string of gains in big-ticket items, and much of that activity is enabled by Snap-on Credit.","But beyond the financial results, there's other evidence of progress. I often mention the internal metrics we track related to franchisee health. They've been on a positive trajectory for some time. That's more confirmation of a strengthening network. And we've also seen external validation of our improved position in the network. Entrepreneur Magazine recently published a ranking of top franchises, with a focus on financial strength and stability, growth rate and the size of the system. Well, we've moved up, with Snap-on coming in at #26 out of the 500 top franchises. Also in the quarter, Franchise Direct listed Snap-on as #11 in its 2012 top 100 global franchise ranking. And finally, Franchise Business Review, a leading research firm in franchising, ranked us among the top 100 opportunities for veterans. We like that. I'll just add that in each of these listings, Snap-on ranks ahead of all tool franchise systems.","When you couple these with awards for innovative new products that I highlighted last quarter, the improvements are clear. In January, we also had our kick-off meetings in the U.S. for the Tools Group. I attended, and I can tell you that among our team and our franchisees, there was widespread optimism and enthusiasm, just what you would expect given the progress of 2012.","Now let's go on to the Repair Systems & Information Group, or RS&I. Organic sales were up 2.9%, while the operating margin at 22.9% was up 210 basis points. The general weakness in Western Europe continues to have an impact on RS&I because we do have a significant undercar equipment business in that region. But importantly, we saw more progress with strong gains for our undercar equipment lineup in the emerging Eastern European and Brazilian markets, and we continue the upward trend in selling repair information and diagnostics products to independent shop owners and managers, while at the same time, our activity in the businesses that primarily serve OEM dealerships posted increases in essential diagnostics and tools programs. For RS&I, all of these widespread positives more than offset the challenges of Europe and undercar equipment.","This past quarter, we continued to see the benefits of our strategy to expand Snap-on's presence in the garage. We highlighted that effort a number of years ago when we first put this portfolio together. It's been reinforced since then with investments in innovation, and it's paying off with winning products and improved positions. Along those lines, our new VERUS PRO, launched this August, has been a great addition, lighter, faster, smarter. It's added to our broad, strong array of repair shop innovations, handheld diagnostics, undercar equipment and repair information. And RS&I is rolling all those products together into a cohesive and improved offering aimed directly at shop owners and managers.","And in the quarter, there were a number of significant wins with national repair shop trains. Our product bundle was a big factor in those wins.","Let's talk about fleets. We're better able to support the broad vehicle mixes. We've expanded our medium- and heavy-duty offering to accommodate a wider range. Coupled with our already strong automotive offering, our suite of products enabled fleet customers, private, government or utilities, to more efficiently serve their varied vehicle lineups. One recent note, just this past quarter, we enhanced our NEXIQ-branded heavy-duty diagnostic handheld to include a full-service scan capabilities for a variety of antilock breaking system. It's all bundled together now in one place. Obviously, that's an important system in the fleet space. It's been a well received enhancement to what was an already strong lineup.","Also on RS&I, Snap-on Business Solutions continues to find opportunities in near neighbor sectors outside the automotive space. For example, on heavy power equipment used in construction and agriculture, for those industries, our electronic parts catalog, or EPC, is proving to be an attractive productivity enhancer. In the fourth quarter, we launched a new EPC for a major global OEM in that adjacent space, and our expansion in those segments provide an important opportunity, and we're taking full advantage. All in all, RS&I had a positive quarter, innovative products and clear customer focus, overcoming continuing headwinds and leading to strong profitability.","Well, that's some of the highlights of the quarter. 2.5% organic sales increase, somewhat less than prior quarters, but that's largely reflecting the military. Advancements along our runways for growth, extending into critical industries, building in emerging markets, enhancing the van channel and expanding in the repair garage, overcoming the headwinds. And our Snap-on Value Creation Processes, our focus on safety, quality, customer connection, rapid continuous improvement in innovations author another quarter of improved profitability. OpCo OI margin up to 14.8% and EPS of $1.43, representing a 12.6% increase from 2011. Overall, it was an encouraging quarter.","Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for a review of the financials. Aldo?","Aldo J. Pagliari","Thanks, Nick. So our fourth quarter consolidated operating results is summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $753.2 million in the quarter increased 2.5% organically. Continued higher sales in the Snap-on Tools Group and in the emerging markets of Asia, along with higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products, more than offset lower sales in the military and continued weakness in Europe. For the full year, 2012 net sales increased 4.6% organically.","Consolidated gross profit of $352 million increased $16.2 million from 2011 levels, and gross margin of 46.7% improved 110 basis points from 45.6% last year, largely due to savings from ongoing RCI initiatives and lower restructuring cost.","Operating expenses of $240.6 million were up $8.6 million from last year, primarily due to higher volume-related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 39.1% in the quarter increased 40 basis points from 2011 levels.","Restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of last year totaled $4.4 million. No restructuring costs were incurred in the fourth quarter of 2012. For the full year, however, restructuring costs of $16.5 million were up $4.3 million year-over-year.","Operating earnings before Financial Services of $111.4 million in the quarter increased $7.6 million, and as a percentage of sales improved 70 basis points, from 14.1% last year to 14.8% this year.","Operating earnings from Financial Services of $29.3 million increased $7.2 million or 32.6% over prior year levels.","Consolidated operating earnings of $140.7 million in the quarter increased $14.8 million over 2011 levels, and the operating margin of 17.7% improved 140 basis points from 16.3% a year ago.","Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 32% compared with 33% last year. For the full year, our effective income tax rate was 32.8% as compared with 33% for full year 2011.","Finally, net earnings of $84.6 million or $1.43 per diluted share in the quarter compared to net earnings of $74.3 million or $1.27 per share last year.","Now let's turn to our segment results.","Starting with the Commercial & Industrial or C&I Group on Slide 7. Fourth quarter sales of $275.6 million were down 6.2% organically from prior-year levels, primarily due to double-digit declines in sales to the military and in our European-based hand tool business, reflecting continued market weakness in that region. These sales decreases were partially offset by sales gains in other critical industries and a double-digit increase in sales to customers in the emerging markets of Asia.","Gross profit in the C&I group totaled $105 million in the quarter, and gross margin of 38.1% improved 210 basis points from 2011 levels, primarily due to lower restructuring cost and savings from ongoing RCI initiatives, particularly in Europe.","Operating expenses of $73.1 million in the quarter were essentially flat with the prior year. The operating expense margin of 26.5% increased 170 basis points from 24.8% last year, primarily due to the lower sales. As a result of these factors, fourth quarter operating earnings of $31.9 million for the C&I segment decreased $1.1 million from 2011 levels, while the operating margin of 11.6% improved 40 basis points year-over-year.","Turning now to Slide 8, fourth quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $321.6 million increased 9.3% organically, reflecting high-single digit sales gains across both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations.","Gross profit of $135.8 million increased $11.9 million from 2011 levels. Gross margin of 42.2% in the quarter compared with 42.3% last year.","Operating expenses totaled $90.2 million in the quarter, and the operating expense margin of 28% improved 80 basis points from 28.8% last year, largely due to benefits from sales volume leverage.","Operating earnings of $45.6 million in the quarter for the Snap-on Tools Group increased $6 million or 15.2% from 2011 levels, and the operating margin of 14.2% increased 70 basis points from 13.5% last year.","Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I group, shown on Slide 9. Fourth quarter sales of $241.6 million increased 2.9% organically, primarily due to low-single digit gains in both sales of diagnostics and repair information products and sales to OEM dealerships. Gross profit totaled $111.2 million in the quarter and the gross margin of 46% increased 140 basis points from 44.6% last year, primarily due to savings from ongoing RCI initiatives and lower restructuring cost.","Operating expenses totaled $55.8 million, and the operating expense margin of 23.1% improved 70 basis points from 2011 levels, reflecting benefits from sales volume leverage and contributions from ongoing RCI.","Fourth quarter operating earnings of $55.4 million for the RS&I group increased $6.2 million or 12.6%. The operating margin of 22.9% improved 210 basis points from 20.8% last year.","Now turning to Slide 10. Fourth quarter earnings from Financial Services increased $7.2 million or 32.6%, primarily due to continued growth of the on-book finance portfolio.","Originations of $165.6 million in the quarter rose 7% year-over-year, reflecting both higher sales in our Snap-on tools segment and increased participation in our credit programs.","Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes $1.08 billion of gross financing receivables, including $913 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation and $172 million from our international finance subsidiaries. In the U.S., $731 million or 80% of the financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians.","Since the beginning of 2012, our worldwide on-book financing portfolio has grown approximately $150 million. Approximately $127 million of the expanded portfolio relates to the United States, while $23 million is associated with growth at our international finance subsidiaries.","For 2013, we anticipate that the worldwide gross on-book finance portfolio will increase by approximately $80 million to $90 million over 2012 year end levels. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.","Now turning to Slide 12. Fourth quarter cash provided by operations of $102.9 million in 2012 increased $30.6 million from $72.3 million last year. In the quarter, we made a discretionary cash contribution of $12 million to our U.S. pension plans. This contribution was in addition to the $42.7 million of discretionary contributions made earlier this year. Last year, also in the fourth quarter, we made a discretionary $48 million U.S. pension contribution.","Capital expenditures of $19.9 million in the quarter and $79.4 million for the full year included the completion of a fourth factory at our Kunshan, China location, as well as continued investments across our operations, which enhanced our capability and flexibility in providing products and services to our customers in a timely and complete manner.","As seen on Slide 13, days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 61 days compared to 58 days as of 2011 year end. In constant dollars, days sales outstanding increased by 1 day.","Inventories increased $13 million organically from 2011 year end levels, primarily to support continued higher demand, largely in the United States. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.9x compared to 4.2x at 2011 year end, reflective of the higher inventory. Our year end cash position of $214.5 million increased $28.9 million from 2011 levels. The year-over-year cash increase reflects higher levels of net income in cash generated from operations, as well as $445.5 million of cash collections from finance receivables.","In the fourth quarter, we also received cash proceeds of $27 million related to the sale at book value of an equity investment in a nonstrategic, unconsolidated affiliate. These cash increases were partially offset by the funding of $569.6 million of new finance originations, dividend payments of $81.5 million, capital expenditures of $79.4 million and share repurchases of $78.1 million.","Our net debt to cap ratio of 29.7% compares to 34.3% at 2011 year end. In addition to our $215 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit rating allows us to access the commercial paper markets should we choose to do so. At year end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities.","This concludes my remarks on fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2013, as outlined in this morning's press release.","We anticipated that capital expenditures in 2013 will be in the range of $70 million to $80 million. During 2013, we intend to make required contributions of $10.0 million into our foreign pension plans and $1.6 million to our domestic pension plans. Depending on market and other conditions, we may elect to also make discretionary contributions to our domestic pension plans. Finally, we anticipate that our full year 2013 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our 2012 rate.","With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Thanks, Aldo. Our fourth quarter was encouraging again. Progress in the midst of European and military headwinds. Results that bear the hallmarks of advancement along our runways for growth and improvement. We recognize that this is a period of turbulence, but we believe in the strength of our businesses and in the potential of our runways. Enhancing the van network, the health of our franchisees are reaching new levels and sales in that channel were up 9.3% in the quarter.","Extending to critical industries, there are some strong headwinds in this space, but we believe our strategic position is on the rise.","Expanding with repair shop owners and managers, increases in diagnostics and information products and RS&I OI margin up 210 basis points. And building in emerging markets, stronger physical presence, another factory in China, more products, more distribution, more sales. And our Snap-on Value Creation Processes are driving improvements, with OpCo OI margin reaching 14.8% in the quarter and coming in at 13.9% for the year, both representing improved performance.","The fourth quarter and the full year are testimony to the capability of our team to execute and to the abundant opportunity for the growth inherent in Snap-on's fundamental strategic strengths. And we believe that those advantages will continue to author ongoing positive trends as we go forward.","Before I close, it's appropriate that I recognize Snap-on associates and franchisees around the world. As usual, many of you are listening to this call. The positive performance of the fourth quarter and of the full year is a reflection of your capability and your dedication. For your contributions to our past, for your participation in our present and your commitment to our future, you have my admiration and you have my thanks.","Now I'll turn it over to Augusta for questions. Augusta?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from David MacGregor of Longbow Research.","Rachel Huber","This is actually Rachel Huber on for David. Just in regard to the RS&I margins, was there something in particular, or just the higher mix that contributed to the higher print this quarter, and is that something that you guys are expecting to be repeatable in 2013?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Actually, the mix is -- 210 basis points, the mix only contributed about 15 to 20 points. The rest was a couple other things, but RCI, our Rapid Continuous Improvement Snap-on Value Creation Processes, was the big winner there, contributed 150, 160 of those basis points. That's straight improvement.","Rachel Huber","And is that something that you expect to continue into '13, then?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well -- and of course, there was -- on top of that, there was 50 basis points of restructuring, that's what I -- so let me recap. It was 15 points of -- 15 to 20 points of mix, 50 of restructuring, of lower restructuring, then the 150 of RCI. We expect RCI each and every quarter the amounts that are going to roll through by division, by quarter are -- change and vary from place to place. But we do consider that we will have good, strong contributions every quarter from RCI.","Rachel Huber","Okay. And then -- yes, just going on to C&I. I don't know if you had broken this out at all. How much of the decline did you attribute to military versus just general European weakness?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, military was the big piece, the biggest piece of that. So we haven't really broken it out in total, but I think you can conclude that it was the lion's share of that -- European weakness was a piece of that. And there were a couple of other divisions in there that go up and down from quarter to quarter, but the military was the big mover. In the quarter -- what happens in the military, the fourth quarter is the strongest quarter of all. Military fiscal year ends in, for us anyway, military ends in the third quarter -- military fiscal year ends in the third quarter. People book business in the third quarter and right up to the end, and then it comes out in the fourth quarter. This year, this didn't happen to as great an extent, so there was a pretty big variance.","Operator","Our next question will come from David Leiker of Baird.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess I want to start off just to follow-up on the comments on the military, just to make sure I heard something correctly here. I think you said that your total corporate organic growth of 2.5% would have been in line with what you've seen in recent quarters, excluding the military decline?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","That's what we said.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Did I hear that?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes, that's correct, David. If you took out the military, you're looking sort of the same thing, the same kind of quarter. The military was just a big changer...","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then on the Snap-on Credit, I know it's not a big number, it's not a big move, but the delinquencies have been inching up here a little bit. One of you give just a little color on that? And second, have you done anything in terms of changing your reserving on that?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I don't think there's anything in that regard. It has inched up, but you look at -- it's a kind of seasonal thing, the fourth quarter, people run into the holidays. They tend to roll it up. We look back at the last 4 years, it inched up every period, every quarter like this. Maybe this is a little bit more. I don't think it's anything significant.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, Nick and Aldo, you guys, you've got several years under your belts here of pretty significant business model improvement, margin improvement. If you take those 2 items, what inning do you think we're in, in terms of where you think you can take the business model, and then secondly, where you think margins can go?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, look, I still think there's a lot of opportunity at Snap-on. I think I've said this to you and many others, when you walk around here, you can see a lot of things that can be improved. So I would say we're now in like the fourth inning or something like that. We have a lot more runway in terms of Rapid Continuous Improvement and the Snap-on Value Creation Processes. And we have said -- we have targeted that we will be at the mid-double digits, which I think we define as mid-teens. We're almost there. I don't see a point in setting a new target, but I also have said that I believe strongly, I think our management team believes strongly in the quality, the inherent strength of our position in terms of the brands we have, the product we have, the legions of loyal customers and the possibilities for coherent growth. So we would be disappointed if we did not march ourselves to be among the highest rank of industrial companies in terms of profitability. I allow you experts to figure out where that would be.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then if you look at the business model improvement, you've found ways of selling more products through the van channel. It looks like on RS&I, you're expanding beyond the traditional auto repair to other end markets. In terms of driving that business model to new levels, where do you think you are in that process?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, actually, in terms of, I think, in terms of the Tools Group, in terms of the van business, we're hitting on all cylinders. Those guys are doing very well. Now I want to quickly give a caveat here like I do every call, that I think that double-digit growth is probably not going to go on forever. Well, in fact, it didn't. It was 9.3% this quarter. But we've said that the Tools Group will be on a 4% to 6% range. I think that's more likely to be the long-term future of the Tools Group, but still, they are understanding how to reach more customers through productivity and how to sell more through different marketing. They're doing that pretty well, and I think they really know how to do it now. And so it's just a matter of keeping it going. In the RS&I group, as in the C&I group, we're focusing on a different customer base, changing from a product focus to a customer focus, and I would say, in there, we're like in the bottom of the second. We still have a long way to go in both of those businesses.","Operator","Our next question will come from Liam Burke of Janney Capital Markets.","Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Nick, you talked about the finance driving the growth in the franchisee channel and how you would draw in more big-ticket items. Could give us a little more detail on some of the other things that are driving this high-single digit, low-double digit revenue growth here?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, sure. Look, you've got good growth in the big-ticket items like tool storage and the bigger -- when I say big-ticket, Liam, just to be clear, I include high ticket diagnostic units like SOLUS Ultra and the VERUS PRO that I mentioned, and then you've got hand tools, which were up quite a bit in the quarter. And so those, that troika of products are doing pretty well in this group. And that's this quarter. In other quarters, we've seen Power Tools come in there and be a big factor. So maybe that quartet of product lines have moved forward, and yes, it's some of the special marketing like we talk about the past, the Rock 'n Roll Express mobile display unit for tool storage has helped, but other things about training programs for diagnostics and innovation around exciting hand tools that solve special problems that people get on the van and get very excited about. I was just on a van ride in Burlington, actually in a snowstorm, and it's very interesting about the -- I ran into this one young guy who was just out of school, and he said, \"I've become almost the senior tech in the house,\" And I said, \"Why?\" And he said, \"Because I bought a SOLUS Ultra, Snap-on SOLUS Ultra, which is a diagnostic unit.\" And what he said was they had a shop unit there which was a competitor's. It was shared by all the technicians, and they had spent 4 days trying to solve a transmission problem in this house with one of these competitor units. This guy bought one himself, he invested in a Snap-on, like a mid-range Snap-on unit. He said, \"I plugged it into the car, it told me what was wrong, it told me how to fix it and it gave me the part number to order to fix it.\" He said he raised his status in the shop immensely. And so that's the kind of thing that those kind of products are adding to the marketing that's driving some of our sales.","Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Great. Aldo, on the cash flow statement this year, if I took net operating -- cash from operating activities, backed out your CapEx and then netted your additions and collections of finance receivables, you generated about $125 million in free cash compared to roughly negative cash flow of $95 million a year ago. Is this a trend of positive cash flow generation now that most of the credit business has been bought in-house?","Aldo J. Pagliari","Yes, Liam. Well, one thing I just want to call your attention to because you're a little bit newer to the story. Last year, we did have, in Q2 of 2011, an $89 million repayment in regard to settlement of a CIT arbitration matter. So when you're looking at the full year cash flow, that's something that impacted 2011 that we didn't have this year. So it's one thing if you're looking at the full year column. But now to answer your question, the on-book portfolio, as I mentioned earlier, we expect will still grow $80 million, $90 million in terms of 2013. And though we don't provide guidance, we'd like to call that out because we know that people have followed us and are trying to model the transition of the formerly-owned CIT portfolio to Snap-on. That is largely behind us. If you look at the chart, you'll see that, I believe, there was about $53 million left at the end of the year that was owned by CIT, and $11 million to $12 million of that is extended credit. That is about the remainder of what transitions over to us. So that is largely behind us. Snap-on Credit will continue to use cash in 2013, but not nearly to the same rate as what it did in 2012 and 2011.","Operator","Our next question will come from Gary Prestopino of Barrington Research.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","In terms of -- and I always ask this with Europe. In terms of the headwinds there, it's been constant for quite a while. But Europe's kind of moved out of the headlines here?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","And just wondering, is it at least a stable decline or is it continuing to decline for you?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes. No, it's pretty much -- I tried to have that come through in the remarks. It's pretty much stable. It's down a little bit. The landscape in Europe is sort of -- to go back to a geometric concept, it's not congruent, but it's similar to what it was in the third quarter. South is down double digits, strong double digits, the core is down single digits and the Eastern Europe is up. Now that's the same in this quarter. The difference in this quarter was the core was down a little bit more. I think, look, France was down, Denmark -- for us, anyway, France was down, Denmark was down, the U.K. was down, Norway was down, so a few of those -- and when you look at the GDPs, why? The U.K. flattened out, France is now negative, Denmark is negative, and so you can see it reflected in the GDP, so it's kind of not surprising. But when you're looking at saying, well, the third quarter versus the fourth quarter, Europe was a headwind in both quarters, but only slightly bigger in the fourth quarter. So it's kind of stabilized as just one continuing pain.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","One continuing pain. Okay. And did you mention just what, year-over-year, your emerging market revenue growth was?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","We did not mention that. We said double digits, actually, but we didn't mention exactly -- we did -- it's double digits. So we grow faster than the GDPs of the region. We said that -- actually, we got some -- normally, we don't talk about places like Thailand and Indonesia, but they were pretty good. So we kind of highlighted them there. Everybody always talks about India, which was up nice, and China and so on. But really, really, we're getting -- we saw some nice broad growth there this year. And like I said, we opened a new factory, so we can see our strength building stronger. And if you were at the Reseller's Meetings, which is like the Distributor's with several hundred resellers, you would have been, I think, impressed with the enthusiasm they have there for our product because they see the repair wave rising. It hasn't started yet because the installation of product is just starting. Everything is new there and the repair is starting, so they see themselves getting in on a ground floor something good.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Did you -- could you give us an idea of what percentage of your sales were coming from emerging markets?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","It's getting upwards close to 10%, that kind of thing, right now. And like I said, that's why I think that's -- they're underrepresented in our number now because our business really -- and when I say business, I mean the broad industry, that what we do hasn't really taken off in importance yet in that region. I expect it to be a much bigger percentage of our total pie when that wave starts to rise.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","That was my next question. Like, say, on a 5-year basis, what are your expectations for what percentage of sales would be coming from these emerging markets?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Geez, I don't know. I don't want to do that. I think you guys can figure that out. We're growing faster than GDP. We think we can continue that for a while.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Adam Brooks of Sidoti & Company.","Adam Brooks - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Just a few questions here. You mentioned in the Tools Group that eventually you trail down to that 4% to 6% range, but it sounds like you could stay above that range for the next year. So is that reasonable to assume?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I did not say that. I said that I expect it to be 4% to 6%. I think they are managing the business superbly. I think they are -- I whisper, I think they are gaining position, if not share. But I would say that we still see it in that range. When that happens, I'm not going to speculate.","Adam Brooks - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. Fair enough. But, two, on the military side, can you give us a sense, as a percentage of C&I, what that business is?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, I can give you a percentage. Look, we don't give -- I have resisted over the years giving out numbers for segments. But I'll just do this. Look, they're part of the critical industries division, the industrial division. This is a $420 million business. We've mentioned 5 or 6 segments in that business. You can kind of split them up. This is -- because we started the focus on military first, this is one of the bigger ones, and then you have to understand that the fourth quarter is the biggest of the quarters for that business. You start to do that, you can start to triangulate to roughly how big it is.","Adam Brooks - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And then real quickly, just maybe a comment on cash flow for 2013, expectations as far as working capital?","Aldo J. Pagliari","So working capital tends to be about 25%. It was a little bit higher than that in terms of the sales revenue. I think it was more like 25.9% in the quarter. But it tends to be up and around that area. Certainly, there's always opportunities to improve working capital performance, but I would suggest that I would use that ratio still going forward.","Operator","We'll go next to Richard Hilgert of MorningStar.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on the delinquencies, wanted to talk a little bit about C&I and also a little bit about the military spending. On the delinquencies, the fourth quarter, on the extended credit side in the U.S., actually went up a little bit versus the fourth quarter of 2011. Conversely, on the internationals, it went down a little bit in the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2011. So I'm wondering -- that kind of seems counterintuitive given what's happening in Europe versus the recovery that's been going on for the last 3 years here in the U.S. On the C&I margin stuff in conjunction with the RCI initiatives, C&I has historically had the lowest margins of the group, and I'm wondering if the increases that we've seen bringing it more closer to the hand tools business, the traditional Snap-on Tools business, I'm wondering if RCI is the factor here or if it's the mix of product or if it's a combination of both? And if that's the case, if RCI actually gets the C&I group closer to the hand tools margin. And then the third issue, the military spending. I'm assuming, obviously, with all of the different budget talks and sequestration and everything in D.C. that this was the impact there. So I'm wondering, if we get past the sequestration here over the next couple of months, is there some pent-up demand maybe there in the military? And we might see second or third quarter actually doing better than expectations?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, I'll answer 2 of those, and I'll let Aldo deal with the delinquency question. Look, well, who knows what's going to happen in Washington. And so I don't think anybody can speculate there. We have -- our military business is biggest in the fourth quarter, and the first quarter has historically been sort of the second biggest quarter in that regard. So if we don't get this sequestration, if it doesn't break loose, we'll have a comparison that's not as tough as the fourth quarter, but easier than the -- more difficult than the second or third quarters, going out there. But I don't know about pent-up demand. We're in a funny time in the military, and I don't think you can speculate there. That's one possible future. I suppose it's one possible future that everything gets solved and the floodgates open and things happen. I'm not sure. I think it's a you pick them type thing. You can't really forecast that. But that's a possibility. It's a possibility. I think the other thing you have to think about, though, is the sequestration, and then on top of that, there is the longer-term sort of bias associated with the troop wind down. So you have some of that on top of it. So you have those 2 things in play. The military business is not dead, though. There is a future for it, and we think it will be a good business going long-term. That's certainly the big question. Now in terms of the margins associated with the C&I, there's -- any quarter, there's goes ins and goes outs, and there's more profitable businesses and less profitable business, so there can be a mix effect, but you can generally -- if you're talking about long-term trajectory in C&I, you are talking pretty much about the idea of RCI and the question of volume leverage. We say generally that our Snap-on value creation systems allow us to make more money at flat sales. And then we get leverage on top of that. So that helps the situation. For example, in Europe, we've been lowering the breakeven. So if we get more volume, we get some leverage on that. That drives up those numbers. But I guess you would come back to saying lowering the breakeven is RCI-driven. So the long -- the short answer to this is C&I rises through RCI drive, and we expect to, over time, to do just that. Aldo will talk about the [indiscernible].","Aldo J. Pagliari","Yes, Richard, briefly on the portfolio performance. As we said, it's well in line with our expectations. Generally speaking, if you look at the -- a little bit of seasonality, they tend to run up the 60-day delinquencies as they get closer to the Christmas holidays, and payments slow a bit. And you're correct, it was 1.5% this year. It was 1.4% last year. If you go the year back, it was 1.6%. However, we like to look at the allowance for doubtful accounts, as we call it, and that we look more at the life cycle of these loans because they tend to run 36, 37 months. And if you look of that, it actually nominally improved. It's still about 3%, and that's the number that we've been talking about as we go on the road over the past year, but actually slightly improves. So the performance characteristics in the U.S. portfolio are well within the range of our expectations. As you point out, on the international side, we're still learning how to grow at risk-based analytics. So we're a little bit more selective historically on the credit risk that we take in the international markets. We're trying to flex and leverage some of the learnings we have in the United States. However, the United States is not the same as the United Kingdom or Australia. There are differences, but we're trying to introduce some of those lessons learned based on our years of experience here in the U.S. We'll probably get a little bit more aggressive on some of our credit positions and grow sales, but that will be a nominal effect on the gross portfolio in total. So I hope that answers your question.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Yes, that's very helpful. Just one follow-up, if I could, please, on the Financial Services portfolio. Now that you've had a good couple of years of experience with this, have you been able to roll out any particular programs or special financing deals that you wouldn't have been able to do having outsourced this in the past?","Aldo J. Pagliari","Not really. I'll say that in 2 ways. One is we always have new programs, but they're within the confines of working hand and glove with the Tools Group. It always was that way before. There's a little bit more energy and positive alignment because it's a wholly-owned operation, yes. But I'd say we're still working within the bounds of how we did it before.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Let me add to that. I think having -- when you run businesses, there's a big difference between having a wholly-owned business and a 50-50 joint venture. As close as we worked with the 50-50 joint venture with Snap-on Credit, we worked much closer with them when they became wholly-owned. And so what Aldo says is correct. From a financial structure point of view, from a strictly financial antiseptic point of view, we haven't changed really anything in terms of how we deal with the franchisees. But the Tools Group is very cooperative with the -- I mean, the credit company is very cooperative with the Tools Group to kind of package programs and time them and present them in ways which will excite the franchisees. That kind of cooperation has increased at an extraordinary level, and it's part of what is driving some of this success.","Operator","We'll go next to Dax Vlassis of Gates Capital Management.","Dax Vlassis - Gates Capital Management, Inc.","So I'm just kind of wondering with -- basically, you're at the finish line with bringing on the CIT portfolio. You had the best -- one of the best free cash flow generation quarters in years in this last quarter. The cash flow uses for CapEx and the CIT portfolio look low, relatively speaking. Are you contemplating, now that you've sort of gotten past most of the bringing on the CIT business, are you looking more strategically at acquisitions now? Is there any more of a focus on this from management? And also, what about -- as far as the dividend policy goes, can you discuss your current thinking on the current dividend? I know it was raised recently, but looking at the stock price and looking at the yield, it's sort of low relative to where you've been historically, and given all the cash you're generating, can you talk about rewarding shareholders by giving us more of it?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Look, I think our priorities for -- just let me state probably what I've said on another call, that our priorities for use of cash are organic growth around capital expenditures. I'm not married to the -- necessarily the capital expenditure numbers. It can go up over the years. Secondly, the idea of organic growth around capital expenditures and those things, working capital, which Aldo talked about, then things like M&A, which you are quite correct that we are kind of passing through the period where we've managed through the largest acquisition this company has ever made. And so we have more energy to focus on things like acquisitions. And so you can talk about that. And then the dividends, we raised the dividends 11.8% just in November, and you might remember that we have paid a dividend every quarter since 1939 and we have never reduced it. So our kind of dividend policy is make sure we can maintain perpetuity on the dividend, and that's what we do. And then finally, there's share buyback for dilution, and we think that matches our cash flow reasonably well. We think with all those of things, we can put our cash to work.","Dax Vlassis - Gates Capital Management, Inc.","Yes, I understand that, but if you look at the OpCo sort of balance sheet, I mean, you're almost debt-free, net debt-free at that entity, and that's the way I look at it. I know there's other ways other people look at it. But if you look at that, I mean, you're woefully underleveraged, and I'm just wondering if you guys don't have the capacity to make acquisitions, you don't have a team, you don't understand the economics of it? Because, I mean, at some point, the lack of leverage on the OpCo, it starts to diminish equity returns.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Actually, actually...","Dax Vlassis - Gates Capital Management, Inc.","I realize there's a point that it gets too much and it gets risky, but, I mean, it's -- I mean, you're not even at half a turn on the parent company cash flows, so can you just address that?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","We understand that. I think we understand. I -- actually, I think we look at it in many ways, and one of the ways to look at it is that OpCo is debt-free, and that would say that we have substantial firepower for acquisitions, and I can assure you we know how to use such things. We have people here who would've been quite experienced in acquisitions. And so acquisitions...","Dax Vlassis - Gates Capital Management, Inc.","Well, experienced, Nick, and actively looking and finding deals and putting the other deals, you haven't really proven the ability to do that. I mean, I haven't -- you haven't really done any. I mean, you could call CIT an acquisition, but you already knew the business. It was already -- you already managed it previously, so you kind of knew what you were getting there. I'm just wondering if you have the resources there and whether you're actively out in the marketplace looking, or whether this is just an exercise, if something comes along and somebody makes a phone call to you, that you'll respond to it?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, I'm not actually -- I can assure you that we are -- we have the resources, and it has our attention. I'm not going to detail what we actually do, how we're approaching this, to you, certainly. But I can assure you that it's getting our attention.","Operator","And it appears that's all the time we have for questions today.

Nick?","Nick Pinchuk","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I\u2019ll start the call by covering the highlights of our first quarter. Along the way, we\u2019ll look at results, the markets, the progress we\u2019ve made and I\u2019ll give you a perspective on what we believe it all means. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financial.","We believe that our first quarter has convincing confirmation of Snap-on\u2019s ability to continue its trajectory of positive results to overcome period to period variations from business-to-business to offset macroeconomic headwinds and to still keep advancing along our runways for both growth and improvement.","Our reported sales in the quarter of $887.1 million were up 6.3%, including $29.1 million in acquisition related sales, partially offset by $9.6 million in unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales growth was 4.1%, with increases registered by every group. Those gains together with continued contributions from Snap-on Value Creation Processes, the principles we use every day, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI, combined offer another encouraging quarter.","Our EPS was $2.39, up 10.6% from last year\u2019s $2.16. The increase includes an opco operating margin of 19.1%, 50 basis points higher than last year and that rise overcame a 50 basis points unfavorable impact from acquisitions. When you combine those current opco gains with earnings of $52.5 million from the financial services, it brings Snap-on\u2019s consolidated operating margin to 23%, up from the 22.5% in 2016.","Now let me pause here to note that these acquisitions may be margin attenuators at this point, but they\u2019re actually landscapes that are fertile ground for Snap-on Value Creation. As we go forward, they\u2019re actually great opportunities to achieve margin improvement \u2013 margin growth.","Now let\u2019s look at the markets. We believe the auto repair market remains relatively robust. The Tools Group, organic sales growth somewhat lower than in previous quarters, but still positive, solving technician problems and making our franchise network more prosperous and more powerful.","And in the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I group, another vehicle repair business, encouraging strength in the quarter, expanding Snap-on\u2019s presence in the garage, capitalizing on a broader product line. Within innovative new tools like the digital thermal imager and new acquisitions like Car-O-Liner, all leading to growth in independent repair shops as well as OEM dealerships across the group.","C&I, the businesses that served critical industries, a wide range of industries and is the most international of our groups. And in the quarter, the results showed progress despite some challenged industrial sectors and some troubled geographies, and critical industries improvement in the natural resources segment overcoming the continuing economic turbulence in places like the Middle East and the impact on our international aviation business.","At SNA Europe, mid-single-digit growth with strength in places like the UK, Spain, France, Italy, and the Nordic region, mitigating difficulties in Eastern Europe. And from our Asia Pacific division, solid increases in key countries like China and India.","So overall, I described our C&I markets is improving. Challenges still exist, but we took advantage of the opportunities that were available, and we\u2019re encouraged by our advancements in the quarter. And those activities, together with our auto repair related businesses combined to drive overall progress along our runways for growth, enhancing the Van network, expanding the repair shop owners and managers extending to critical industry, building an emerging market. Advancements leveraging our widening product line and increasing our understanding of work, growth and critical sectors and important geographies. That\u2019s an overview of the markets.","Now let\u2019s talk about the segments. In the C&I Group, organic sales were up 3%, with mid-single-digit growth in European hand tools business and low-single-digit rise in volume to our customers in critical industries. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income was $41.6 million representing an operating margin of 13.9%, a decrease of 40 basis points, which reflects higher investment spending for product development and engineering activities in that group.","As part of C&I, we remain committed to extending in critical industries and we\u2019ll keep strengthening our position to capture new business opportunities in those areas as they arise.","Along those lines, we\u2019ve seen some recent gains with natural resources customers, helped by our line of innovative new products, designed especially to make work easier in that uniquely challenging Industrial setting. Oil and gas can be tough, we have the products. One example is our collection of Snap-on 3\/8\u201d drive torque adapters, manufactured in our Elizabethton, Tennessee plant. It\u2019s a new product family, used in applications where access is difficult and precision is critical, and natural resources in mining on a variety of large earth moving equipments.","Produced from special high alloy steel, precision-forged and especially heat-treated, these tools have a double hex 12-point that allows fasteners to be engaged every 30 degrees instead of the standard every 60 degrees, a feature that provides better angles for grip and easier operation in restricted areas. The adapter length, crucial for measuring torque is very precise and it\u2019s etched on the tool for easy reference. The new torque adapter family is a great addition to our lineup and it fills a vital need for our critical industry customers.","Now I already mentioned SNA Europe\u2019s mid-single-digit organic sales growth. That progress was broad based across the landscape and including some, what I would say were fairly difficult regions and countries. SNA Europe\u2019s positive trend to performance now extends 14 straight quarters with year-over-year sales growth, and actually include 16 straight quarters of margin improvement. It\u2019s quite a record in a region that\u2019s marked by so much uncertainty.","Now on to the Tools Group. Organic sales up 2.5%, the operating margin was 17.2% \u2013 the operating margin of 17.2% was up 60 basis points versus the 16.6% recorded last year, and that\u2019s despite 70 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. Let me say that again. 17.2%, up 60 basis points against 70 basis points of unfavorable currency.","The Tools volume story simply put our Techno-Vans keep \u2013 kept coming \u2013 our Techno-Vans kept coming, but the Rock \u2018N Roll vans cabs were less effective and that big-ticket combination was less favorable than usual. We do believe however, that this runway for coherent growth, enhancing the franchise channel remains very strong and there\u2019s evidence of that strength of an ongoing positive trajectory across the Van channel.","And our franchise metrics, the important financial and physical indicators that we monitor them very closely and again, this quarter, they remain favorable. There\u2019s also a testimony in our direct interactions with the franchisees, at events like this year\u2019s kickoff meetings, held all over the network.","At the very recent meetings with the National Franchisee Advisory Council and at separate interactions with individual franchisees, all of these have been marked by enthusiasm and optimism. Our franchisees, all of them, entrepreneurs and professionals are confident in reaching higher and optimistic regarding the upcoming opportunities and some of that enthusiasm rests on a new product that\u2019s rolling out to drive new excitement.","For example, the great addition to our tool lineup is the Snap-on [indiscernible] 3\/8\u201d drive ratchet. Again, manufactured in Elizabethton, Tennessee, comes with a flexible head, extra long handle, better access in tight automotive applications and additional leverage within those that\u2019s what the long handles for, additional leverage within those cramped spaces.","It\u2019s got a sealed head to keep lubricants in and contaminants out, and that bodes a longer life. And of course, it includes the Snap-on\u2019s patent. Our patented Dual 80 technology, featuring 80 teeth gear for minimum swing arch, and dual pawls for strength. You put this 80 teeth together, small swing and the arch, dual pulls make it strong, you got the long handle for leverage, a design for flexibility, strength and compact operation.","We believe we\u2019ve got a great hand tool in our new 3\/8\" extra-long flex head ratchet. And you heard me talk about hit products before. It will be one of this year\u2019s hit products. We\u2019re also rolling out a new tool storage program. A brand-new color, striking trim options, some great new promotions, we all know that tool storage activity thrives on excitement while our new package is aimed at creating that buzz and it\u2019s based on early reactions, it\u2019ll do the job.","Also just recently launched was the Snap-on PT850 1\/2\u201d drive impact wrench. It\u2019s a signature product, a top-of-the-line pneumatic offering that is a power of MG725, but providing more enhanced balance for comfort and control and durability. Comfort in a lighter weight package, better grip positioning for improved balance with ergonomic improvements to reduce fatigue when you\u2019re using it all day.","Control, a compact design with a favorable trigger for applying the right torque for the job. Easy to control, even while wearing gloves in the shop. And durability, two-piece housing with an aircraft grade aluminum nose, solid steel impact mechanism, forged steel frame and hammers and a precision cast, hard coated aluminum cylinder. That\u2019s going to last for a long time.","Made in our Murphy, North Carolina facility, a new Snap-On PT850 1\/2\u201d drive impact, this is a great wrench, power, comfort, control and durability. These are the features our customers want in the power tool and early sales confirm that this tool is right on target.","Now let\u2019s speak of RS&I. First quarter organic sales rose 7.8%, with high single-digit gains registered pretty much across the board with diagnostics and information product independent shop with the business focused on OEM dealers and with undercar equipment. And on a reported basis, RS&I\u2019s $21.3 million acquisition-related and are reported basis including the group\u2019s, the RS&I\u2019s group $21.3 million of acquisition-related sales. First quarter volume rose 14.3% compared to last year.","Operating earnings of $78.7 million increased $9.7 million from 2016, and operating margin of 24.7% was flat with last year, but with strong volume and RCI improvement, offsetting 140 basis points of negative impacts from the acquisitions. As I said before, fertile ground for margin improvement. We\u2019re clearly seeing the potential of our runways for growth in the RS&I group, expanding Snap-on\u2019s presence in the garage with coherent acquisitions providing greater reach like in collision repair in Car-O-Liner\u2019s and new \u2013 really new capabilities and products for our team and they can wield them.","RS&I\u2019s organic growth in the quarter was broad. It was broad based across every division. I just mentioned the progress with independent shop owners, and those gains were clearly evident in the ongoing success of our powerful MODIS Edge handheld and the spread of the digital thermal imager. It\u2019s becoming an essential product for top-flight mechanics.","The rise can also \u2013 that rise, that gain can also be seen in our latest software release, which not only contains expanded new model coverage, but also incorporates additions like motorcycle information and enhanced key fob reprogramming. It\u2019s sold quite well and it\u2019s fortified our advantage in our clear advantage in comprehensive repair, people repair information.","For undercar equipment, sales were up high single-digits. Contributing to that increase was RS&I\u2019s introduction of the smart speed tire changer, the new unit \u2013 this new unit incorporates Snap-on\u2019s proprietary and patented technology to minimize floor to floor or tech time needed to mount a tire. A big factor in shops was handling a lot of tires, and there and are quite a few of those high-volume locations.","You can see them everywhere. Tires are more sophisticated and more difficult to change than ever. Low profile tires for example, make up 25% of the market and are growing and their rigid construction makes them more susceptible to handling damage and require much more \u2013 they require much more care during the tire changing process. Our smart speed systems eliminate a great deal of that risk.","It continuously monitors the power to the motor and automatically selects the turntable speed at which the motor has the correct amount of torque, that mount the tire without harm and in the fastest time. We often speak of customer connection activities and observation in the workplace, gaining insights to make work easier for our customers. Well, repair shop owners and managers are continually seeking the highest possible throughput.","We observe that tire damage by torque mismatch is a big contributor to delay in those shops. So for owners and managers, the smart speed tire changer that matches that torque to the tire, makes life easier and saves time and saves money. It\u2019s a great addition to the equipment line and initial customer feedback has been quite enthusiastic, really enthusiastic.","Finally, RS&I got a real boost in the quarter by the increased activity from OEM dealerships, up high single-digits, driven in particular by several significant essential diagnostic and essential tool programs for large automotive, heavy duty trucks and agricultural OEMs. It appears as though the focus on repair across the industry continues to be robust.","So those are the highlights of the quarter, overcoming headwinds, continued progress, organic sales rising 4.1%, gains that change through our Snap-on Value Creation Processes, strengthening our businesses and driving to its 19.1% opco operating margin up 50 basis points overcoming the acquisition, and EPS of $2.39, up 10.6%. It was an encouraging quarter.","Now let\u2019s turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?","Aldo Pagliari","Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $887.1 million in the quarter increased $52.9 million or 6.3% from 2016 levels, reflecting a $33.4 million or 4.1% organic sales gain, $29.1 million of acquisition related sales and $9.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.","Foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q1 sales comparisons by 130 basis points. The organic sales gain reflects continued progress in serving the vehicle repair sector as well as further recovery in sales to Industrial market segments in our C&I Group. Consolidated gross margin of 50.5% improved 70 basis points, primarily due to the benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives.","Operating expenses of $278.5 million yielded an operating expense margin of 31.4% in the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points as operating expenses for acquisitions and unfavorable foreign currency effects were partially offset by benefits from sales volume leverage.","As a result of these factors, operating earnings before financial services of $169.5 million, increased 9.1% and as a percentage of sales, improved 50 basis points to 19.1%.

Nick?","Nick Pinchuk","Thanks, Aldo. Well, that\u2019s our first quarter. C&I with organic growth of 3%; OI margin, 13.9. SNA Europe, continuing its bellwether trends, sales up, profits up again industrial, critical industries coming back with broader gain. Tools up 2.5% organically, OI margin of 17.2%, up 60 basis points against the currency headwind of 70 basis points.","RS&I Organic sales up 7.8% with increases across this customer base, each of its customer base. OI margin of 24.7% flat versus last year, but with RCI and volume offsetting 140 basis points of acquisition impact.

And we believe as we\u2019ve said for some number of quarters that we\u2019re well positioned to continue that trend. Great new products are entering the mix, aimed at customer needs and customer excitement, all drivers of progress along our runways for growth. And Snap-on Value Creation continues to drive our runways for improvement. And now, we have new landscape for our acquisitions, providing expanded possibilities for further margin improvement.","We believe we have abundant opportunity for both growth and improvement. And we believe we possess the capabilities and the intent to take full advantage and continue our positive trend going forward to 2017 and beyond.","Before I turn the call over to the operator, I\u2019m going to \u2013 I\u2019d like to speak to our franchisees and associates. I know many of you are listening. The encouraging quarter we\u2019re announcing today reflects unique skill and commitments. For all your many contributions to our progress, you have my congratulations. And for all your extraordinary dedication to our team, you have my thanks.","Now turn the call over to the operator. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instruction] We\u2019ll take our first question from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks good morning.","Nick Pinchuk","Good morning","Christopher Glynn","Yes, just with the Tools Group, you\u2019ve had some deceleration recently, but the comparisons were pretty tough in the first quarter, and it starts to get a little easier. So right now, you\u2019re a little bit below what I think you\u2019d call normalized. Is there a reversion that based on the comparisons that you expect?","Nick Pinchuk","Well, look. We always say that we expect the 4% to 6% growth for our divisions and there could be variations from quarter-to-quarter. We never necessarily predict the reversion based on comparisons. This particular one was a difficult comparison that you said, I think the better thought is, look, we feel pretty confident about the new products we\u2019re rolling out.","We\u2019re kind of pumped about the whole idea of the long handle ratchet and the new tool storage program and color and the excitement that will generate and the idea of the PT850 half inch impact, which is a signature tool, and everybody loves it. We like those. And so at the end of the day, it comes down to product, and we\u2019re kind of optimistic about that, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll say.","Christopher Glynn","Okay, and then any update on franchisees, inventories and sell through against contracted sales to franchisees.","Aldo Pagliari","No, I\u2019d say the \u2013 we\u2019re in line with franchisee movements more or less. There\u2019s always some variation in the inventory levels, but pretty much in line and reflective of our sales.","Nick Pinchuk","Yes, and that moves from time to time. That goes quarter-to-quarter, the franchisee sales particularly match ours. It really depends on how we\u2019re feeling in the programs and so on.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. And then with the originations and sort of a flattening trend, but portfolio continues to grow, can you talk about any trend of restructuring or re-aging the loans and how you view that?","Aldo Pagliari","We don\u2019t restructure the loans. I mean, the loans stand by themselves and the originations, I think, largely reflect the pattern of what\u2019s being demanded in that channel and as Nick has mentioned earlier, our tool storage, which is the most popular product to be originated on the contract was not as robust the quarter in that regard.","Christopher Glynn","Okay, great. And then just, do you have any data on the net charge-offs and the ending allowance?","Aldo Pagliari","Yes, they were up slightly. If you look at it year-over-year, but stable and actually on a sequential basis, we saw a bit of improvement over all. So again, somewhat stable trends in line what our expectations.","Nick Pinchuk","Yes.","Christopher Glynn","Okay thanks guys","Aldo Pagliari","Sure","Operator","Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","Yes, good morning everyone.","Nick Pinchuk","Good morning","David MacGregor","Yes. Good morning, Nick. A lot of good things this quarter. I wanted to just \u2013 I wanted to ask you about the storage and I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what\u2019s going on there with your assessment of the negative growth in storage. Is this demand easing? curtailed to credit availability with respect to this category?","Nick Pinchuk","No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any of that. Sorry, I don\u2019t think actually, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any of that. I mean, there always can be factors, from time to time. My assessment is first of all, tool storage has been growing a longtime. This quarter even though with the down, it\u2019s one of our top 10 quarters ever still in tool storage. But having said that, now we\u2019ve had two quarters of tool storage less than robust positioning, and we conclude, maybe it needs a little more excitement, maybe \u2013 at the end of the day, these are product-driven.","And you roll out a product and some \u2013 if some of them are singles and doubles and some are home runs. And when we look at the tool storage in general, you might be tempted to say that we look at the tool storage offering across the network. It\u2019s down in 4 to 5 places where we have vans, and they aren\u2019t affected by any of those things that you\u2019re talking about, if you observe those markets over the years, they wouldn\u2019t be affected by, let\u2019s say, credit or so much by credit or by saturation. And so we conclude the tool storage line up just need a little goosing. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m talking about this new program rolling out, new colors and so on. It\u2019s as simple as that, I think.","David MacGregor","As there been any change in the number of Rock \u2018N Roll Cap Expresses on the road?","Nick Pinchuk","No, we haven\u2019t change them. So that\u2019s another thought. I mean \u2013 but we \u2013 I tend to think it\u2019s for our \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 this tends to be \u2013 there is a lot of factors, David. And of course, everything I say isn\u2019t true everywhere. But the thing is, I think if you look across the networking and you see the behavior of tool storage and when it happens for two \u2013 for more than one quarter, it starts to get your attention. We say, \"Hey, let\u2019s accelerate a little goosing.\" And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.","And so I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve encoded in the tool storage situation. It\u2019s not been ticked because diagnostics is rolling. Diagnostics is having a great quarter, had a great quarter, another great quarter. So that isn\u2019t it. It isn\u2019t the big ticket situation, just \u2013 and you see it from time to time. It doesn\u2019t show up so clearly, but when we look at it at a granular level, we see positives and singles and doubles and triples.","David MacGregor","I want to ask you about the acquisitions because hit you finally you got a lot of margin up side there, I guess I was going to ask you if you could just quantify your best guess on what the margin upside is? Do these acquisitions get back to kind fled average margins? Or could they surpass that? What\u2019s the upside?","Nick Pinchuk","Well, I don\u2019t really want to speculate on that. All I know is we ought to moving them upwards. You\u2019ve got a year where they come in. You kind of have a year where they start to \u2013 their comparing to the year before where they weren\u2019t in the number, but then after that given you Snap-on Value Creation and so on, you expect to have that effect, start moving them upwards.","And I don\u2019t know where the upside is I mean you got Car-O-Liner is there which is a kind of equipment level business, which is at the bottom of RS&I\u2019s \u2013 OI margin. Remember, RS&I is a variance of several thousand basis points. And so OI margins and equipment is at a sort of bottom end of that because it\u2019s hardware-based. And Car-O-Liner starts out a little bit lower than that. We think we got a lot of upside in those businesses. And so \u2013 but I wouldn\u2019t want to quantify it. I am just happy to get a good chunk every year.","David MacGregor","Did I hear you correctly?","Nick Pinchuk","No limits to the upside.","David MacGregor","Did I hear you correctly that it takes about a year to integrate but that for a year you \u2013 they should not be\u2026","Nick Pinchuk","I don\u2019t mean integrate. I don\u2019t mean integrate. I just mean that\u2019s the arithmetic. In other words, if you have a lower margin business and you\u2019re comparing to the year, the year before, you don\u2019t have it in your numbers in the year before. So it stands out like a sore thumb. It\u2019s a variance. And then when you \u2013 so you don\u2019t \u2013 it might be less impact for the next quarter even if it gets better and less impactful, but it\u2019s still going to be dilutive for a couple of quarters. But then, you start to have comparisons where it\u2019s in the base, and you see your improvements standout visibly still that mean.","David MacGregor","Yes, absolutely. You got a very good free cash flow storage your acquisitions become a more predominant part of the growth as we go forward from here?","Nick Pinchuk","Well, I think we\u2019ve always said that we\u2019re going to acquire along our runways for growth, and we have a sort of a list of acquisitions we\u2019re reviewing constantly. I think acquisitions \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t necessarily think they\u2019re going to become more a greater part of the growth, but we\u2019re constantly reviewing them and you can see us take advantage when the opportunities are there.","David MacGregor","Last question is just, how do you promote growth of a second associate on the truck, when all those trucks where you do have a second associates, it seems like your getting superior growth to those that don\u2019t have it. How do you incent your franchisees?","Nick Pinchuk","Well, I think it\u2019s stuff like \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 we do two things, one is we try to make sure that there\u2019s a sharing of best practices is that at colloquial meaning like the kickoffs, like the NFAC people are representatives, and they\u2019ll go back and share it with their regions. And then of course, at the SFC, the Snap-on franchisee conference were pretty much all of them come, we try to make sure we trumpet the effects of those things and talk about and provide seminars on how to select and manage those people.","And also, on our own, we try to provide packages that will support them. They\u2019re not our employees, and we don\u2019t urge these \u2013 it\u2019s a situation. It\u2019s important to say, \u201cThis is not our program.\" But we provide the support programs that make it possible.","David MacGregor","Got it. Thanks, Nick","Nick Pinchuk","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Liam Burke with Wunderlich.","Liam Burke","Yes good morning Nick. Good morning Aldo.","Nick Pinchuk","Good morning, Liam.","Aldo Pagliari","Good morning.","Liam Burke","Nick you\u2019ve put a lot of upfront investments in emerging markets in the C&I business. You highlighted the fact that in the \u2013 India and China are doing well. Are you starting to see any kind of positive operating return of those upfront investments?","Nick Pinchuk","Well, they\u2019re profitable, but we keep investing. So I mean, the thing is, the balance is still about where it\u2019s always been, so we don\u2019t necessarily see \u2013 I don\u2019t see a time where we\u2019re going to see huge upside coming there. Because we still see opportunities. So in terms of top end, so we keep trying to reposition ourselves in terms of blue point stores, for example. We had another one this quarter as part of the C&I expense category.","And so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing a boost out of them in terms of the financials yet. This is just our view that they\u2019re going to give us returns, and our approach is still, Liam, that we want to build the physicals, because we have confidence that as that wave comes and it starts to come, it starts to come, we\u2019re going to see returns. But we don\u2019t view it as a huge profit opportunity in the near-term, more or less as a positioning opportunity.","Liam Burke","Great, thanks, Nick. And Aldo, on the cash flows, just touching the return in there. Even when I\u2019m adjusting for some of the onetimes, your cash flow is starting to grow, it\u2019s starting to accelerate. Beyond the acquisitions, where is the priority for cash allocation going to be?","Nick Pinchuk","Well, the first priority still always remains serving our organic growth. So we\u2019re not afraid to make investments. We talked a little bit about that in the C&I segment. But when there\u2019s opportunities to invest internally, we\u2019re willing to do that as well. And of course, Snap-on credit still is growing. That\u2019s been the use of our cash to some extent, and then as Nick mentioned already, support of acquisitions.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you, Nick. Thank you, Aldo.","Aldo Pagliari","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Stember with C.L. King & Associates.","Scott Stember","Good morning, guys.","Nick Pinchuk","Good morning.","Scott Stember","Can you maybe talk about some of the new programs or the new tools and products you talked about in the Tools Group? Really, just talking about the new tools, the new cabinet program, new colors. Is there anything else to this new program outside of color? And maybe just talk about the timing of when these new products will touch showing up in your numbers.","Nick Pinchuk","Well, we\u2019re talking about sort of the beginning and sort of like as we go forward into the second quarter and you\u2019re talking about trim as well as programs that wrap around it, so you have kind of programs that try to make sure that people focus on it as well. And so those things are what wraps around the kind of thing. It has to do with, one an attraction that gives someone a reason to buy. This is what we say in the Tools Group. There are \u2013 they\u2019re ongoing types of programs, a lot of programs that roll through this, but we\u2019re talking about it\u2019s aimed at the Tools Group, aimed at a new product that\u2019s going to get peoples\u2019 attention. And we wrap merchandising program around this and promotion program around this and maybe throw in some sort of hat or something like that, that gets people.","So you give people a reason to pay attention to it. And we think when they pay attention to it, they see those colors with that trim, with the features that are available, this becomes a seller. And the Algona plant has, I think, an incredible amount of different options that can added on to this kind of thing. So we feel pretty good about it. It\u2019s a new \u2013 like I said, it\u2019s a new set of \u2013 it\u2019s a new appearance that people won\u2019t have seen before, and we think that drives excitement. One of the things that does, if you\u2019re in a garage and a guy\u2019s got a box, you like the appearance of a different box. You like some of the features of a different box. He wants trade out because he wants to get attention in his ward. This is what generates the activity.","Scott Stember","Got it. And then the RS&I side, you\u2019re starting to see some continued growth here in the \u2013 with the new car, the OEM dealers. Can you maybe just talk about what you\u2019re seeing there? Are they sustainable trends. And the high single-digit growth that we\u2019re seeing in this segment, if this is something that can persists throughout the year?","Nick Pinchuk","I don\u2019t know. Look, I think these are program-related. So that particular segments of the business with OEM dealerships tends to be more lumpy than others, because you get a program. And sometimes, that program lasts for 3 quarters and it runs out and you don\u2019t hook onto another program till you get out to the fifth quarter. So there\u2019s a gap quarter in there. That\u2019s \u2013 if you listen to these calls enough, you hear me talk about that stuff.","But what I am encouraged about this time is, we have vehicle OEMs. We have heavy-duty OEM\u2019s. We have heavy-duty OEMs. We have agriculture OEMs doing this. So it\u2019s a kind of broad view of repair. We haven\u2019t seen that so much come together. So it\u2019s kind of positive in that regard. Now I can\u2019t testify that these are going to continue, because as I said, this tends to be a lumpy portion of our business. But the fact that it\u2019s spread across 3 different places, pretty good.","Scott Stember","All right, and last question on currency. Brexit happened, I believe, in the end of the second quarter last year. Is this still a good assumption that in the back half of the year, we should expect the currency comparison to ease?","Nick Pinchuk","Yes, although the second quarter, we think \u2013 look, we state today, if the currency stays the way it is today, the second quarter will be somewhat tougher from a currency point of view because the other currencies were stronger in the second quarter then they deteriorated. But you\u2019re right in terms of \u2013 it gets \u2013 the comparisons get easier as it flows out. So what we would \u2013 again, it will probably \u2013 the chance it stands right where it is today is probably low, but if did, we see some rise in currency difficulty going forward to the second quarter and then abatement in the third and fourth quarter.","Scott Stember","Got it, that\u2019s all I have. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Tom Hayes with Northcoast Research.","Tom Hayes","Hi thanks, good morning gentlemen.","Nick Pinchuk","Good morning.","Tom Hayes","Just wondering if we could dig into the C&I segment just a little bit. Last year, we were talking about three of the end markets: energy, military and avionics. Certainly a bit of challenge in 2016. Just want to see kind of what your thoughts are coming out of Q1 and for the balance of the year for those three segments?","Nick Pinchuk","Actually, I\u2019m pretty encouraged. C&I is a big place for us. We got SNA Europe, which I just \u2013 if you\u2019re going to talk about C&I, SNA Europe is a bellwether. That thing has become a monster. It\u2019s growing 14 quarters in sales and 16 quarters in profits. And Europe, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed lately, isn\u2019t the most certain of places, so it\u2019s done pretty well. But if you want to go to critical industries, like I think you\u2019re referring to, which is about 1\/3 of the business in C&I, we did focus on military and national resources and aviation. And natural resources came back for us.","And what I like about this quarter is, it is about the same growth in the critical industries as past quarters. Although sequentially, it looks pretty positive, but also, it\u2019s a little bit more broadly based.","Last quarter, we had growth, but there are more eggs in the military basket, the military got better by wider \u2013 by a pretty wide margin last quarter, and that delivered the critical industry\u2019s basket for us. This time, we have gains in natural resources in places like wind and mining and places like that oil and gas, and gains in heavy-duty and gains in general industry, a little more broadly based. Military is more tepid. In fact, it\u2019s down a little bit this quarter, difficult to predict where military has gone quarter-to-quarter.","I said that for a dog\u2019s age on these calls. And then aviation still isn\u2019t solved because for us, the Middle East, the international aviation business is kind of on its back because a lot of that business came out of the Middle East and it isn\u2019t working for us right now. So you\u2019re going to see some kind of recovery outside. You got military, which is chronically variable, and the rest of them are kind of recovering. Aviation, we still haven\u2019t quite solved yet. So think positive, positive. I\u2019m really encouraged.","Tom Hayes","Okay. And then Aldo, you start on the financial services piece. I think you kind of covered a little bit. I just want to make sure I understood the components. You said that EBIT margin go down year-over-year from about 70.9 to 68.4. I think you called out it was manpower and additional write-offs. Was that kind of the driver of the change there?","Aldo Pagliari","You\u2019re talking about financial services?","Tom Hayes","Yes.","Aldo Pagliari","Yes. No, financial services are certainly these higher provisions for receivables over the last couple of quarters. We had that phenomenon in Q4. All I\u2019m saying is that if you look year-over-year your provisioning is higher, I will be at a little bit less than what we had done in Q4 and you\u2019re seeing a little bit of progress on the 60 plus day delinquency indicator.","Tom Hayes","Did you also mentioned, I thought you mentioned in your prepared remarks. You \u2013 Do you add manpower to the financial services business?","Aldo Pagliari","Yes. Little bit of additional\u2026","Tom Hayes","Okay. Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Leiker with Baird.","Joe Vruwink","This is Joe Vruwink for David.","Nick. Pinchuk","Yes, Joe","Joe Vruwink","Can you maybe comment on growth trends in the tools channel as the quarter progressed? And I\u2019d be interested in whether these tax refund delays maybe impacted February at all, and do you start to see activity come back in March as refunds came back?","Nick. Pinchuk","No, I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t \u2013 we didn\u2019t see the tax refund delays. We didn\u2019t hear anything like that. Generally, the week-by-week or month-by-month trends in our quarters don\u2019t really mean much. We have quite a bit of variation. It\u2019s sort of like quarter-to-quarter \u2013 quarterly variation in the month.","So it really doesn\u2019t mean so much. What I will tell you though is that I met just \u2013 we had \u2013 we box part this quarter. In the beginning, like middle of January, we met with the franchisees as they were booming. And then at the end of the quarter, a couple of weeks ago, I met with the franchise \u2013 the National Franchise Council for the U.S. they were really enthusiastic.","So at least from the windshield surveys, I felt pretty good about it. The numbers are what they are. I still think the growth was \u2013 it was fairly positive for a retail business. But again, we had \u2013 and we had \u2013 so we don\u2019t think it\u2019s the market. The market is very positive for us, we think.","Joe Vruwink","So when I look at your loan origination growth and let\u2019s say that\u2019s flat, therefore big ticket sales are flattish to do 3% organic growth, and tools implies the core hand tool category, which is obviously the majority of what you\u2019re selling is maybe mid-single-digit growth directionally.","Nick Pinchuk","Look, first of all, let\u2019s talk about \u2013 let\u2019s talk a little bit about big ticket. Big ticket, you got diagnostics up. What drives the originations is big ticket. But there\u2019s a new kind of wrinkle in this, and that is the thermal imager in diagnostics. This is a smaller-end diagnostic in effect like in the $1000 range. And what has been in diagnostics almost uniformly being financed is being \u2013 by the credit companies is being \u2013 some of that is being financed by their franchisees, because now they are strong enough to finance something like that.","So that\u2019s part of what\u2019s going on in the originations activity. And there are other categories besides hand tools. There\u2019s power tool, there are some other stuff, which we call shop and tech and so on. So I don\u2019t think you can make just that view of the world. You can \u2013 you could kind of step back and make it. But you can\u2019t just look at originations in this case and say that big ticket is completely flat, because you have that thermal imager in there this time, which makes it different.","Joe Vruwink","So I guess \u2013 yes, so this is what I\u2019m trying to get at. The industry, it seems to be growing at a mid-single digit pace. When you listen to your peers talk about their growth, seems to be mid- single. And when I look at Snap-on and consider that a lot of the products that have seen strong growth this cycle that are tied to originations, those have flattened out. If I look at the other stuff in the Snap-on portfolio, it would seem to be growing mid-single, so at the end of the day Snap-On still growing in line with its market. It\u2019s just we\u2019re weathering these comparisons right now where you have a particular big ticket category you called out tool storage, that is just going through a bit of a soft patch.","Nick Pinchuk","Yes, there\u2019s some of that. That\u2019s directionally probably correct. I think our big message here today is, we think the market is pretty good.","Joe Vruwink","Yes. Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Nick Pinchuk","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.","Bret Jordan","Good morning, guys.","Nick Pinchuk","Good morning.","Bret Jordan","On the corporate expense, the 21 and change, that\u2019s pretty well-controlled. I think a year or two ago, you talked about it sort of being $100 million annual run rate. Should we think about that being more along the lines of 20? Or was that $5 million lower pension contribution the driver to the low level.","Nick Pinchuk","Okay. Look, I think \u2013 the way I would say it is, I think we spent something \u2013 let me think. I think we spent about $94 million last year in the corporate expense. I think you could say it\u2019s going to be in that ballpark, maybe uplifting it slightly. That\u2019s the kind of number I would expect. These things ebb and flow back and forth from quarter-to-quarter, so I would model it in that range, if I were you.","Bret Jordan","So the $5 million lower pension contribution was sort of just a timing issue around the first quarter.","Aldo Pagliari","No. Just to clarify. It\u2019s Aldo. The pension contribution doesn\u2019t really impact expense directly in the short run. Pension is relatively flat year-over-year. That\u2019s just the contribution goes to the pension plan. So that\u2019s not a direct cause and effect. So if you look at corporate expenses, they\u2019re kind of flattish really the last year in Q1. Pension is up so slightly over year-over-year. So I\u2019d say, you\u2019re trending directionally to be, as Nick said, $95 million to $100 million range is still for modeling purposes, not unreasonable.","Bret Jordan","Okay. And then a question, I guess \u2013 I\u2019m sure the franchisees are communicating with their customers daily. Is tool storage, is that \u2013 I mean, obviously, it\u2019s more of a discretionary transaction versus diagnostics where you need the current technology to complete the job. Is there an issue there that this is sort of an indicator of mechanic sentiment? Or is it just that there\u2019s nothing new enough and the channels just spur them to buy again.","Nick Pinchuk","Look, I think it\u2019s always the case. You can bring out a new power tool or a new diagnostic threat and it can be, let\u2019s say, double as my \u2013 by baseball analogy instead of a home run. I\u2019m not saying that our offering is tremendously better. It\u2019s \u2013 we think it\u2019s strong, but it may not be as compelling as it was the last iteration. It may not be the home run. That\u2019s a difference. I do think you\u2019re right in that tool storage is a little more emotional. You look at that box, you say, \"I remember being on an event once. A guy came at a fair, where this guy said, hey, did you see that white box with a sapphire trim? I really love it. I think I\u2019ve got to buy it.\" He was so excited by just the appearance of the box. So that is the fact in this kind of thing. It\u2019s not a saturation thing.","Bret Jordan","What\u2019s the color that\u2019s coming out?","Nick Pinchuk","I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m allowed to reveal that, actually, but Bret\u2026","Bret Jordan","I mean, I\u2019m going to wait to buy my Snap-on box if I see the new color of that.","Nick Pinchuk","Yes, you\u2019re right, right.","Bret Jordan","On average yield and it\u2019s up 10 basis points, I mean, I think it was a year ago this quarter we talked about some of the platinum franchisees allowed to be more flexible I think in their decision, their credit decisions. Is yield up because we\u2019ve got \u2013 we\u2019ve change the borrowing base a little bit? Or is that yield just up because we have seen some interest rate increase year-over-year?","Aldo Pagliari","Look, I think it\u2019s more reflective of the actual credit profile, what we\u2019re doing the underwriting on. And as I said, it\u2019s actually down 20 basis points from last quarter. So 18%, 17.9% is kind of the natural range that settles in that, so there really hasn\u2019t been a lot of movements on yields of over the recent turn.","Bret Jordan","Okay. All right, great. Thank you.","Nick Pinchuk","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Robert \u2013 or excuse me, Richard Hilgert with Morningstar.","Richard Hilgert","Thanks for taking my questions. Good morning, everybody. Just curious with the administration talking about tax reduction. I\u2019ve noticed your tax \u2013 effective tax rate consistently runs about 5 percentage points below the corporate average. If we were to see a reduction from the corporate rate of 35%, down to a 25% number, would your effective tax rate move the same amount or \u2013 are there anything \u2013 any things in your taxes that would change that ratio? Would it be less of a change? More of a change?","Aldo Pagliari","Well, first off, Richard, when you look at the overall rate of 31%, you have to remember, we\u2019re about 80% influenced by the United States, 20% influenced by \u2013 let\u2019s say the outside world\u2019s tax rates. So you\u2019re right. If you go back to the 35% statutory federal rate Snap-on takes advantage of probably around 250, a little bit more, slightly more than that of deductions, such as the manufacturing deduction, the R&D tax credit, things of that nature.","So if you took a step back and look strictly at U.S. taxes as written today, you\u2019d say, \"Well, we\u2019re in the 33% range, maybe the 32.5% range.\" So in theory, if a statutory rate is reduced from 35% to something less than 30%, Snap-on should actually stand to benefit on the U.S. effective tax rate. As you know though, these are pretty complicated items being discussed, so you see the actual rollout of the tax law, it\u2019s really hard to opine on what the impact will be.","Richard Hilgert","Understood. Just for clarification, on the C&I group, Nick, you\u2019re saying military was a slight headwind, aviation was a headwind, but natural resources were positive. The European region was positive, doing very well. Is that the correct summary?","Nick Pinchuk","That\u2019s correct.","Richard Hilgert","Okay, great. And then I was curious, with the way that the growth rates have been going in RS&I, and you were mentioning some of the dynamics of the big ticket items. Could you maybe describe the growth rates there, more in terms of what\u2019s been your experience with respect to the overall pricing in that group versus the overall volume in that group? And how much does each one affect the growth rate.","Nick Pinchuk","Wow. I don\u2019t know. I mean, the thing is, look, all I can say is, we haven\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t have pricing generally as one of our line items in explanation. We don\u2019t see much motion in pricing. And so generally, when we \u2013 and at both ways, when we price, we tend to do it around the new model which we set the value proposition and therefore, the prices get reset. We don\u2019t like to reduce our prices to get volume, and so we resist that. And we do so in equipment. And so from time to time, it can happen. But in general, you are not seeing us knock down the prices. And if you doubt that, remember what I said, 24.7% OI margin against 140 basis points negative year-over-year impact from acquisitions, that means something \u2013 happen that was worth of 140 basis points.","Richard Hilgert","Right. And you mentioned one item that you thought would be on the hit parade this year in the hand tools group. Given the kind of tapering off there, the last couple of quarters, your \u2013 what you said about your hit parade in years past is that you\u2019ve got $1 million per year coming in from the hit parade from the new items that are going out, has that kind of tapered off in the last couple of quarters and then we can expect to see more of that kind of come back a little bit above that? Or how has that all playing out right now?","Nick Pinchuk","I don\u2019t know. What we actually measure, Richard, is the number of million-dollar products, not the amount. So you can have Transformers, and you can have some other small \u2013 you can have the Jack Reacher, both of which make some money but aren\u2019t necessarily a lot \u2013 are quite different in terms of the amount of money they\u2019ll have. Transformers is a huge blockbuster, Jack Reacher made some money so that kind of thing, and so that what\u2019s happening in these things. Maybe a fewer the hit products didn\u2019t make us much, maybe a few of tool storage that\u2019s came out didn\u2019t sell quite a much, and they still were hit products.","What I\u2019m talking about in this particular one is, is that, that\u2019s going to be hit product. We say it\u2019s going to sell a lot more than that particular one. It will sell a lot more than $1 million. Our numbers of hit products though have continue to be pretty good, so they\u2019re not really abating. It\u2019s just the amount that are being associated with it. And hit products aren\u2019t the whole thing, it is that the hit products that drive everything. Hit products drive the excitement through the whole bunch of non-hit products that are driving excitement some of which are former hit products that are older.","So it\u2019s a more complex \u2013 the revenue add up is a more complex thing. I don\u2019t think you can look at a trend in the big new success \u2013 difference really.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session.

The slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript of today's call.","Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.","With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start today's call with highlights of the quarter's results. I'll provide my perspective on the operations and on our various markets around the world then Aldo will cover the financials in more detail.","The results in the quarter were encouraging again. EPS of $1.26 and our organic sales increase of 4.6% from last year. Performance from our operating company or OpCo, as we call it, was strong with 13.5% operating margin. And as expected, Financial Services also had expanded profitability, growing its on-book portfolio. FinCo OI of $27.9 million was up from the $20.8 million of last year. And I believe that all of these are encouraging absolutes.","As we highlighted on our release, there is a year-over-year comparison impact that results from the substantial movements in our share price in the third quarters of both last year and in this year. As a result of the related mark-to-market effects, this year, there was an unfavorable $4.4 million adjustment. Last year's third quarter included a favorable $7.8 million mark-to-market adjustment. Absent this $12.2 million unfavorable swing, our OpCo operating margin in the quarter increased 170 basis points from 2011 levels, an encouraging apples-to-apples rise.","Now the sales increase in the quarter came against clear headwinds. Those gains generally represent a continuation of the same progress we've been registering over the past few periods. We're not really seeing much change in the overall market dynamics. Europe, for sure, remains tough. It's our most significant challenge and it has been for some time. And we also have other headwinds, I'll speak about those in a moment in the segment discussion. But when you operate in diverse geographies and markets, there will always be some challenges. Our strengths though, are more than overcoming those headwinds, with a clear focus on the 4 areas we've  identified as being decisive for our future: building in emerging markets, extending into critical industries, enhancing the franchise network and expanding our presence in the repair garage. We're making progress in each of those areas and you can see it in the results.","Along with the growth, you're also seeing improved performance that's being authored by what we call the Snap-on Value Creation Processes. We drive them every day: safety, quality, customer connection, Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI, and innovation. These disciplines of improvement are a powerful set of tools. They are enabling our progress. And I do just want to touch a little deeper on 2 of the most important components of Snap-on Value Creation: innovation and customer connection.","Snap-on was founded on innovation more than 90 years ago, and we've continued and expanded on that tradition through the decades. It's evident in our brands. Of course, in the Snap-on name, the symbol of pride for professionals but it also extends to brands like Bahco, the first in the world to offer adjustable wrenches and on our John Bean brand, a legacy rooted in the first wheel aligner. And that innovation is enabled by the significant advantage we have in customer connection with 4,800 franchisees around the world and the hundreds in our direct sales force, we reach into 600,000 repair shops in the U.S. and Europe and into countless workplaces of other types. And with that presence, we observe work and make it easier. You can see that innovation and customer connection coming together in the Wisconsin lab that we call Innovation Works. We use that facility to bring technicians in, our engineers and designers watch them work, get them engaged and we develop new products to make them more productive. It's an active place, it's had more than 12,000 visitors in last -- in 2.5 years since it's been opened -- and it's a great demonstration of customer connection and innovation in action, and it's driving results.","You can see innovation supported by customer connection in our new offerings. Just recently, we launched several new products in our Power Tools line, like the extension of our successful CTS family of compact tools, with more power than ever before, new impacts and new drills. And also, our new pneumatic ratchet, the longest available for greater accessibility and the fastest for increased productivity. These were big contributors in the quarter.","Innovation and customer connection also play out in the recognition that our products receive. Snap-on was just awarded 3 Top 20 tool awards by MOTOR Magazine for 2012. Almost at the same time, Professional Tool & Equipment News recognized an additional 2 Snap-on products, citing them for extraordinary innovation.","We believe that these awards clearly demonstrate the success we're having in using our unique customer connection and turning those ideas into successful, new, innovative products. And as our results show, this does drive sales.","Now let's have some discussion about the segments. In the Commercial & Industrial Group or C&I, organic sales in the quarter were up 4% from last year's level and the operating margin of 11.9% was up a strong 130 basis points. The story here is much the same as the second quarter, Europe being the biggest macro headwind had a significant impact on C&I by way of our European hand tool business, SNA Europe. That business was down mid-single digits in the quarter, with particular weakness in the South, in places like Spain, which is a big market for us. Outside of that operation, our progress in serving customers in critical industries and in the emerging markets of Asia, along with a particular strength in power tools as a result of those new products, were able to more than offset the SNA Europe impact.","Speaking of Asia Pacific, we saw encouraging growth there again in the third quarter, high single-digits overall. We often speak of India and China, but at this quarter, Indonesia and Thailand deserve special mention. They performed quite well, contributing to the overall results. With respect to product, our undercar equipment and hand tool lineups led the growth in our Asian markets. And as I said in our last call -- but it's worth repeating -- undercar equipment is an important, high-visibility, high-value product line. It allows us to clearly showcase our advantage, and our advantage is in innovation. That's a feature of great importance in growing our position in Asia Pacific and it's working for us. Critical industries are already largely served -- are also largely served in the C&I group through our industrial division. And that operations has headwinds of its own, areas of restricted government spending like the military, which is weak due to troop withdrawals and the overall funding constraints. On the other hand, gains in serving customers in the critical aerospace and the natural resources sectors more than offset that military challenge. Actually, the overall industrial growth was one of the key factors in C&I posting a reasonable gain in spite of the European and military headwinds.","Let's move to the Tools Group. Double-digit gains again, up 11.1% from last year, with an operating margin of 13%. I believe that kind of growth in the current environment clearly reflects the strength of our franchise network. It's evident in the detailed statistics we call franchisee health metrics. We monitor them closely and I'll tell you that franchisee sales and profits are up, route turnover is low and so are the delinquency rates at Snap-on Credit. And the strength and the enthusiasm in the network could be seen in the quarter when we held our Annual Franchisee Conference -- record attendance and orders. That event serves many purposes. It's part training session, part new-product and tools shows and part pep rally. It's a reunion of professionals where we get a good feeling for the business at the grass roots level. And discussions I had with franchisees were very positive, positive both on the current conditions and positive on their prospects for their future. An important part of our progress is that we're working closely, more closely than ever with our franchisees to improve their business. Consider that 4 of those 5 awards from MOTOR Magazine and Professional Tool & Equipment News enabled the tools group.","Many our new power tools were developed specifically for automotive technicians. We have the traveling tool fair we call the Masters of Metal Tour, which I spoke of last quarter, and we are expanding our fleet of new Rock 'n Roll Cabs specifically -- specially outfitted trucks filled with tool storage units, aimed at driving those big-ticket sales. That effort helped drive increases for tool storage at rates well beyond the overall Tools Group growth. And those sales are also aided by our wholly-owned credit company. Snap-on Credit focuses precisely on supporting those big-ticket transactions and it's a real advantage for us and for our franchisees.","We also have teams of people working to improve franchisees' productivity, finding ways to make their business easier, stronger and more profitable. All of these initiatives are coming together and it's clear that they're achieving ongoing gains.","Now to Repair Systems & Information Group or RS&I. This is where we primarily serve automotive repair shop owners and managers. Organic sales in RS&I were up 2.7% and the operating margin of 22.3% expanded by 270 basis points. The relatively modest overall growth rate, I think, requires some explanation because the market dynamics across the different businesses vary quite a bit. Our strength in expanding our presence in the independent repair shops is clear but it's being muted somewhat by lower activity with the OEMs and by the impact of Europe. We do continue to see solid gains, high single digits in repair information and diagnostic units for the independent shop technicians, owners and managers. And we appear to be gaining position, driven by new products like Mitchell 1's ProDemand repair information software and also with an array of popular handheld diagnostic units. In fact, our SOLUS Ultra, a groundbreaking diagnostic unit, is one of the products that was just recognized by MOTOR Magazine. And we're keeping that momentum expanding and going. At this year's franchisee conference, we also launched the VERUS PRO, setting a new industry standard for top-of-the-line units, enhanced diagnostics capabilities, faster performance and a thinner design, and the reception has been strong.","On the other hand, we continue to see lower activity with the automotive OEMs, especially in Europe. Last year, we had some fairly large European programs that are now winding down. That's the nature of that business and we believe the overall negative macroeconomics in Europe are creating reluctance by the OEMs to launch new programs, making for some weakness in this already uneven segment. Speaking of Europe, our RS&I does have a sizable presence in that region with undercar equipment. Now the past several quarters, I've mentioned the business being down in the mature markets of Western Europe, no surprise, given the troubled environment. And while that area was down again mid-single digits, our overall undercar business was up from last year's level, based on the growth in North America, in Russia and in Brazil. So the overall comparisons in the Undercar business were somewhat better than the past few quarters. And that's also been aided by new offerings. In fact, our John Bean Integrity Test Drive system was another one of the products recognized by the MOTOR Top 20. This is a unique system, and it highlights several of our capabilities from diagnostics to alignment that we brought together in the RS&I group. The Integrity performs a complete vehicle inspection in just minutes. It checks alignment, the battery, the brakes and the diagnostics code and it generates a condition report that helps greatly in communicating with the customer right in the shop. We're excited about this product and it's winning awards and it certainly does make the technician's work easier.","Well, those are the highlights of the quarter. Organic sales gain of 4.6%, in our range of expected growth; OpCo margin increase of 170 basis points after adjusting for the impact of mark-to-market; FinCo continuing its profit increase and clear evidence of progress along our strategic runways for improvement and for growth. All in all, another encouraging quarter.","Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo.","Aldo J. Pagliari","Thanks, Nick. Our third quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales totaled $711.6 million, representing an organic sales increase of 4.6%. This increase included positive organic growth in each of our operating segments. Consolidated gross profit of $340.4 million increased $11.1 million from 2011 levels and gross margin of 47.8% improved 60 basis points from 47.2% last year, largely due to savings from RCI initiatives, including benefits from restructuring. Operating expenses of $244.2 million were up $9.2 million from last year. As a result of the increase in the quarter-end Snap-on stock price, operating expenses in the third quarter included an unfavorable $4.4 million of stock-based mark-to-market expense.","Last year, you may recall, operating expenses in the third quarter were partially offset by $7.8 million of benefit from mark-to-market as a result of a decrease in the Q3 2011 quarter-end stock price.","The operating expense margin of 34.3% in the quarter increased 60 basis points from 2011 levels, as favorable sales volume leverage was more than offset by the $12.2 million or 170 basis points of higher mark-to-market expense.","Restructuring cost totaled $2.3 million in the quarter compared to $2.9 million last year. Operating earnings before Financial Services of $96.2 million increased $1.9 million year-over-year despite the $12.2 million of higher mark-to-market expense. As a percentage of sales, operating margin of 13.5%, including the adverse 170 basis points impact from higher mark-to-market expense, was unchanged from last year.","Operating earnings from Financial Services of $27.9 million increased $7.1 million or 34.1% over prior year levels. Consolidated operating earnings of $124.1 million in the quarter increased $9 million over last year's levels, and the operating margin of 16.5% improved 70 basis points from 15.8% a year ago.","Finally, third quarter net earnings of $74.1 million or $1.26 per diluted share compared to $67.8 million or $1.16 last year.","Now let's turn to our segment results.","Starting with the Commercial & Industrial or C&I group on Slide 7. Third quarter sales of $280.4 million were up 4% organically from 2011 levels. This growth resulted primarily from mid to high single-digit sales increases in the businesses serving customers in critical industries and in the emerging markets of Asia, coupled with a double-digit increase in sales of Power Tools. These increases were partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in our European-based hand tool business as a result of continued market weakness, particularly in Southern Europe.","Gross profit totaled $103.7 million with gross margin of 37%, improving 10 basis points from last year. Operating expenses of $70.3 million decreased $2.9 million from 2011 levels and the operating expense margin of 25.1% improved 120 basis points from 2011 levels, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage and RCI initiatives.","As a result of these factors, third quarter operating earnings of $33.4 million for the C&I segment increased 12.8% from 2011 levels and the operating margin of 11.9% improved 130 basis points from 10.6% last year.","Turning now to Slide 8. Third quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $308.8 million increased 11.1% organically, reflecting double-digit sales increases in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations. Gross profit of $131.3 million increased $6.1 million from 2011 levels. Gross margin of 42.5% in the quarter declined 230 basis points from 44.8% last year, primarily due to increased promotional programs associated with sales gains, including expanded participation at this year's Annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference.","Operating expenses totaled $91.1 million and the operating expense margin of 29.5% in the quarter improved 260 basis points from 32.1% last year, largely due to sales volume leverage. Operating earnings of $40.2 million in the quarter for the Snap-on Tools Group increased $4.6 million or 12.9% from last year's levels and the operating margin of 13% increased 30 basis points from 12.7% last year.","Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Third quarter sales of $222 million increased 2.7% organically, primarily due to a high single-digit increase in sales of diagnostics and Mitchell 1 repair information products and a mid single-digit increase in worldwide sales of equipment. These increases were partially offset by a mid single-digit decline in sales to OEM dealerships, particularly in Europe. Gross profit totaled $105.4 million, with gross margin of 47.5%, increasing 200 basis points from 45.5% last year. This improvement is primarily due to savings from ongoing RCI initiatives, as well as a more favorable sales mix that included higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products.","Operating expenses totaled $55.9 million with the operating expense margin improving 70 basis points to 25.2%, reflecting sales volume leverage and contributions from RCI. Third quarter operating earnings of $49.5 million for the RS&I group increased $5.8 million or 13.3%. And the operating margin improved 270 basis points year-over-year to 22.3%.","Now turning to Slide 10. Third quarter earnings from Financial Services increased $7.1 million, primarily due to the growth of the on-book finance portfolio. Originations of $179.6 million in the quarter rose 17.7%, reflecting both higher sales in our Snap-on Tools segment and increased participation in our credit programs.","Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes $1.06 billion of gross financing receivables, including $893 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation and $169 million from our international finance subsidiaries. In the U.S., $714 million or 80% of the financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Since the beginning of 2012, our on-book financing portfolio has grown approximately $128 million. Approximately $108 million of the expanded portfolio relates to the U.S., while $20 million is associated with our international finance subsidiaries, including $6 million of positive currency effect. For the remainder of the year, we anticipate that the worldwide finance portfolio will grow by an additional $20 million. Regarding finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.","Now turning to Slide 12. Third quarter cash provided by operations of $69.7 million in 2012 increased $27.7 million from prior year levels and includes the effect of $16 million of additional third quarter discretionary cash contributions to our U.S. pension plans.","This contribution is in addition to $26.7 million of discretionary contributions made earlier this year. Depending on market and other conditions, we may elect to make additional discretionary cash contributions to our U.S. pension plans. Capital expenditures totaled $19.7 million in the quarter and $59.5 million year-to-date. We anticipate full-year capital expenditures will be in the range of $75 million to $80 million, including the construction of a fourth factory at our Kunshan China location, which is expected to be completed by year end.","As seen on Slide 13, days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 59 days compare to 58 days as of 2011 year end. Inventories increased $31 million from 2011 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher demand largely in the United States. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.8x compare to 4.2x at 2011 year end. Our quarter end cash position of $176 million decreased $9.5 million from year-end levels, primarily due to the continued year-to-date funding of new loans originated by Snap-on Credit, U.S. pension contributions of $61 million, share repurchases of $61.8 million, capital expenditures of $59.5 million and dividend payments of $59.4 million. These year-to-date uses of cash were largely offset by cash generated from operations.","Our net debt to cap ratio of 31.9% compares to 34.3% at 2011 year end. In addition to our $176 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets should we choose to do so. As of quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities.","This concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I'll now turn the call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Thanks, Aldo. Well, that's Snap-on's third quarter. Clear progress along our runways for growth and for improvement, overcoming the turbulence of Europe and the general economic uncertainty. Snap-on value creation is driving improvement. Our innovation and customer connection processes are combining to create product excitement and real customer value. And when combined with RCI, they enable progress. Adjusted for mark-to-market, OpCo OI margin rose significantly. And we are moving forward along our runways for growth, recording solid organic gains. Those results confirm that our efforts are paying off in each of the 4 areas we've identified as decisive for our future. Consider the quarter's performance, building in emerging markets -- we had strong gains in places like Thailand, Indonesia and Russia. Extending into critical industries -- we saw significant growth in sectors like aerospace and natural resources, overcoming the challenges in the military and offsetting the weaknesses of Europe. Expanding in the repair garage -- diagnostics and repair information up strongly in independent garages, more than balancing the unevenness in the activity with the OEMs. And undercar equipment sales in Russia and in Brazil and in North America, overcoming the ongoing challenges due to the European macros. Enhancing the franchise network, double-digit gains in the U.S. for the ninth straight quarter. An enthusiastic network that showed up in greater numbers than ever before at our Annual Franchise Conference, celebrating their success, while training to further improve their businesses. That's thousands of small business owners, energetic, invested and optimistic. Optimistic about their place on the Snap-on runway for growth.","Yes, there are challenges but just like past periods, Snap-on's progress in the areas of opportunity have overcome the difficulties and achieved a favorable balance. And because of that, we are encouraged and clearly confident. Encouraged by the ongoing results and confident of our possibilities for growth and improvement as we move forward.","Before I close, I want to recognize our associates and franchisees. Many of you, I know, are listening. I know that third quarter results and the favorable trends reflect your effort, your capability and your commitment to our team. For all of that, you have my congratulations and you have my thanks.","Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  We'll take our first question from David Leiker with Baird.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to start on the Snap-on Tool business, in particular, international. You have got a great track record under your belt here in the U.S. with the performance there. That double-digit gain in the international breaks the trend there of low single-digits for a long time. Can you talk about what specifically on the international side has changed that and whether that's something that is sustainable going forward?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","We think it is. Well, I don't know. Double digits I -- even though we've had a run of double-digits, David, I think I've been pretty consistent on these calls to say I'm not sure that kind of -- I would say, stratospheric -- growth can continue, but I think the strength in those places are pretty solid. The U.K. has improved substantially in the last, I would say, over the last couple of quarters and that is driving this. We've made great strides forward in terms of improving our product line and our relationship -- productivity with our franchisees there. Australia has been contributing quite well. And Canada has been very strong. We've actually spent a lot of time and a lot of focus, maybe off-camera a little bit, focusing on those areas and what you're seeing is the result of that focus, doing the same kinds of things adjusted for the -- that we did in the United States -- adjusted for the local market. So it\u2019s a sum of Canada, U.K. and Australia all doing better.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","On the U.S. side, in terms of the sustainability, the track record you put there, could you characterize at all? I mean obviously market share is a piece of that, but between market share, kind of deeper market penetration areas you haven't been, the product offering, can you put those into buckets of the contribution to that great performance in the U.S. at all?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","No. I don't think I can actually. But there clearly are 2 elements of it. One is we are, because of our new ways of marketing, able to sell more to the same customers. I think the idea of the traveling -- the idea of the Rock 'n Roll Cab Express, and I think we're at the end of the quarter, we're at 28, we're going to go upwards almost -- we're going to expand that quite a bit going forward and -- because they've been so successful. So that's clearly a kind of wrinkle on the Van business in allowing us to sell more to pretty much our existing customers. Then on top of that, as I've said often, we are calling on more customers because our vans are becoming more productive and our product line is becoming wider and appealing to them. I can't put those into buckets. And I hate to talk market share because it's a very imprecise exercise when you're talking about tools and you start to have such a wide universe of possible products, it's very difficult to describe. I do think though, we're making great gains in the Tools group now. It's clear, after 9 quarters of double-digits, the Tools Group team has got this businesses, which is one of the world's great businesses, I think. That team has got this business resonating.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","[indiscernible] with the Rock 'n Roll Cab Express, do you think you're getting folks to buy more products than they normally do buy or are they buying it at Snap-on instead of at Sears or Lowe's?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I think there's both of those things. I think we think they're buying it from us as opposed to possibly, other places. But there's both of those things. I mean, David, as you know, it's like a new car purchase. All of a sudden, we now have showrooms in the field as opposed to catalogs. And so that's generally it. You were buying the thing, they were buying the thing from more or less from a catalog and now, they have showrooms. And you can think about how that excites people and it wins customers and it also accelerates the buy from some people. I mean, I think that some people probably are buying toolboxes, already have Snap-on toolboxes, they see a new one, they say boy, I can't live without that one, I'm going to have it. And then the other people were competitors and they see what the quality offerings we have. And we believe we have some really great offerings that are superior to the competitors based on innovation and they're coming over to our side. But I can't tell you how much -- which is which.","Operator","We'll go next to David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Just while we are on the topic of storage, with that organic growth of 11.1%, how much of that was storage?","Aldo J. Pagliari","Well, I don't like to talk about that, but -- to give those numbers, but -- in that detail -- but I will tell you that the tools storage product line grew substantially higher than the 11% of the U.S. business or the overall tools business -- if it gives you any view.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","And is there any way for us to think about that? I mean, you talked about 28 showrooms that I guess, we can call them and you're going to growth that. At what rate does that grow and how does the productivity from that grow?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I don't know. I mean, that will be too precise for -- I'm not smart enough to say that, I think. I think it's like this, I believe that every one we add gets more sales. At least as far as we can see now, that's why we're doing this, that's why we're doing it. But, but, but we'll keep doing it until we see diminishing returns, I believe. So far, we haven't seen anything in the way of diminishing returns.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","That makes sense. Well, congratulations on the success of that program. You talked in the C&I business about pricing being up mids to high single digits. I was just wondering, my guess is probably not a lot that was in Europe, although maybe I'm wrong, but can you just help us understand how that experience might have played out over critical industries versus emerging markets?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Say that again. You mean...","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","The pricing in the C&I, you said was up mid to high single digits, I'm just wondering across those 3 businesses -- my guess is there's not a lot in Europe, but maybe I'm wrong on that. But can you talk about pricing, critical industries versus emerging markets?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Sales were up. Sales were up mid single-digits. That's a component of our emerging market growth. Emerging markets are now about 10% of our business and critical industries are a significant piece of that. I'd say that -- let me see if I can help in this way. The C&I Group grew at about 4%, the emerging markets, which is about 10% of our total business, which is mostly in C&I grew close to double digits.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Maybe I could follow up with you offline on that. Then on the RS&I business, you said there was a high single-digit increase in the diagnostics and Mitchell 1 business, I know you've got a lot of innovation and new product in that business right now. Was there anything there last quarter or is this all just sort of emerging...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Actually let's -- for government work, the RS&I business looks sort of the same as last quarter in mix. Mitchell 1, the Repair Systems & Information business was up sort of right close to double digits. In fact, I think it was just over the double-digit boundary and that's the Repair Information business driven by what I call ProDemand repair information software. It's a new offering which has more information and the navigation is much simpler than anybody else's anymore. So it's a very attractive offering, combining state-of-the-art navigation with the best database available and people are lining up to subscribe to that. So that business has been growing pretty well and the diagnostic business -- and that happened last quarter, too, happened last quarter.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Nick, does it accelerate into the fourth quarter?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Accelerate, I don't know. But I think we feel encouraged by our prospects there. I think we feel positive about our position looking at independent garages. The diagnostics business, I was going to say that's the handheld, the software, the hardware and software business, the laptops for cars grew at mid or high single digits. And those have been the same for a couple of quarters, give or take, a few basis points. So I don't know, I mean, we don't really give guidance but we feel good about our position.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","That sounds great. And the last question, just on the tools business, aside from the storage business, I was just wondering if you could talk about trends and big-ticket sales off the truck?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Looks okay. I think it looks okay. I mean, that's one of the things we always watch. So I suppose the operative question is this, is that, are you seeing downturn in big-ticket which would precursor maybe a cooling off of everything? And I don't think we do. Now you might say well, do you have visibility because you've got this new marketing program and are you able to pierce the veil of the marketing program to see what's actually happening in what I call just a pre-demand type activity in the marketplace? And I think we can and I don't think we see a downturn.","Operator","We'll go next to Mike Wherley with Janney Capital Markets.","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Obviously, the Tools Group has been very strong for many quarters now, and I'm just wondering do you -- when you're looking forward 1 quarter, 2 quarters, 3 quarters, when do you feel like there might be some tough comps that are going to be difficult for your business to sort of keep the growth going? I mean, not that it's going to grow at double digits, but might it flatten out altogether if you run into tough comps?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, look, I think we've said in many forums that we expect to grow as a corporation, 4% to 6% organically. I didn't mean by that, that we would do it every quarter, although we have been able to do it most quarters. I think probably, almost all quarters -- but we feel confident of our ability to keep growing at that rate. I'm not saying we'll do it every quarter, I mean, that's not what I mean. But I mean, if you're talking about the trend, we feel okay about that. Yes, the comps get tougher, but they got tougher last year and the year before that and the year before that. So I don't think we're so worried about that. Now it's a challenge, but we're not wringing our hands over it.","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. What about the -- just sort of thinking about it this way, just to be devil's advocate. If you're talking about selling more to the same customers and you're talking about this Rock 'n Roll Cab Express that's selling big-ticket items, that maybe some of these wouldn't have bought if this Cab Express didn't roll into their garage. I'm wondering now, at what point does selling more to the same people lead to a smaller wallet in the future?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I mean, well, I don't think it leads to a smaller wallet but it might lead to people who have used up their capacity to, you might say, it's led to their people -- people to use up their capacity to buy. I don't think we've seen the bottom of that yet. I don't think we believe we've seen the bottom of that yet. But it's a reasonable point, as you lay out over distance, but what you have there is a couple of things. First is, is underlining this business, repair is a good solid business. Every quarter for a number of quarters, the household spending on automotive repair has been up. So the underlying demand is good. By the way, that's in independent shops and so our core customer is growing and getting more business, that's number 1.  Number 2 is we keep -- the cars keep changing, we keep changing the products, they can see ways -- I was just out on a van on Monday, I was out on a van on Monday and you can see these guys talk to you. They say, gee could you get me -- it's like customer connection. You go there and they say, I need a special tool to help me pull this engine so I can do some work on it because this particular vehicle has some particular geometry, and if I do that, I can make more money. So part of the key here is every time they pay, every time they give us money, they make more money. So the more they spend with us, the better they -- the more money they make. So there's a kind of offset to the idea of the wallet reaches an end, that's 1. And not just from attenuation [ph] but 2, we have said that there are customers out there that we don't call on. Maybe they were Matco customers for a time, maybe they were Mac customers, maybe they were geographically undesirable, maybe they were in places that weren't target-rich and because we have more productivity and a wider product line, we are going to them and that's going on here too. So I'm optimistic about the Tools Group possibilities. Now, I'm not here to sign up for continuous double-digit growth though, in the Tools Group. I think I said, I'm signing up for 4% to 6% for the total corporation over time. We feel confident about this.","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","But do you think the Tools Group can sustain something higher than what you've said? Can it sustain 5% to 6% on its own?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","They're starting to make me look dumb, aren't they? But I still say I like our other businesses. I like the opportunities of C&I to grow at the high end of that. I like RS&I, we're seeing a particular time when they are muted by Europe, 33% of C&I is in Europe, 17% of it is in Southern Europe. All right? And it's still growing at 4%. 25% of RS&I is in Europe and we got the OEMs kind of nervous and so we got this lumpy business. So I see the opportunities of those businesses to grow.","Operator","We'll go next to Richard Hilgert with MorningStar.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions here on my end. In the European market, obviously, the U.K., new car sales are doing pretty well there. I would imagine that they're not experiencing some of the economic issues that the mainland Europe is experiencing, aftermarket probably isn't doing quite as bad there either and so I was wondering if you could kind of compare and contrast between the two. And also, in Europe, it seems to me like the European downturn is harsh enough that we're going to see consumers postponing aftermarket repairs for quite some time. And I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the correlation between when we start -- when should we start to see the aftermarket coming back, when people would start making repairs again versus when you see new-car sales start to improve coming out of an economic trough?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","It's tough. But I'll say this. For my money, for my money, there's no correlation between new car sales and our business. We don't see that, really. I think, to the extent that new car -- I suppose you could say that to the extent new car sales go down, we may see a slight burst. But generally, the thing is, in the U.K., as in the United States, what are new cars sales in the United States? This year they're forecasted at 15.2 million or something like that, well there's -- North America, rather. There are 300 million vehicles on the road. So new car sales are kind of like a blip in the after -- I think driving our aftermarket business anyway. So we don't really see it that way. It is true though, you are right though, that the U.K. is a stronger market. We found it to be uniformly for all our businesses and this is businesses both in automotive repair and critical industries, to be a better market for us than the rest of the -- than the continent, for sure. And so, we were kind of cautiously positive about that view. And I don't know if that continues or not, I think part of it is that people in the U.K. -- I think people don't necessarily postpone repair, I think they postpone new purchases. So I don't really see a downturn in repair there so much. Now remember, in Europe, our businesses are broader-based than in the United States so we have less of the business in automotive repair and more in the industrial and other places like agriculture. So we're more broadly based in terms of vertical industries in Europe. So you got to take that into account. Now, if you say the rest of Europe and when is it going to recover and when are people going to start spending again? I'd give you two thoughts, I think the South -- in fact, I'll just say traditional Europe, Western Europe, I'm not making any predictions. On one of these calls, I said once that Spain, I thought, had hit the bottom. Well, that was wrong and that was like 2 years ago. So I don't think anybody can actually predict this. All we can say for sure is our base customer base. Our base customer base seems to be intact so we believe it comes back. Now if you talk about the periphery of Europe, if you talk about Eastern Europe, you talk about Turkey, you talk about Maghreb countries, those businesses by and large, they have their ups and downs in every quarter, by and large, they've been pretty good for us. I don't know if that helps you any but I get -- in summary, I think the U.K. is okay and reasonable. I think nobody knows what's going to happen in Continental Europe, and I think the periphery is pretty good.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just the follow-on to an earlier question about the same size wallet, putting out more for additional tools. It seems to me like part of that, that you have to figure into that equation is the advancement of technology over time. For example, Nissan is talking about launching within the next year, Drive-by-Wire in its Infiniti brand. This is going to the first mass-produced use of this technology and that means that the tools and the diagnostics and things that are going to be needed to work on that kind of thing in the garage are going to have to change and you're going to have to come out with new tools. So it seems to me like the kudos that you're getting from the industry magazines all the time and industry studies being done and the drive from the innovation that you do is part of getting that additional amount for the same set of garages that you're already in. You mentioned also earlier in the call, how you have the research that you do there in Wisconsin where you're bringing in people and you're observing them working on vehicles, do you do that kind of thing and is the innovation is as strong over the European market because obviously, you've got a different product set over there that you have to deal with versus what's here in the States.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes, we do it in Europe and in places but the landscape in Europe, for example, our share of automotive repair is much larger in the U.K. than it is say, Germany or say, Sweden. So we do it. If you're talking about the garage and our observation in the garage, U.K., that model is pretty good, but we don't have a center like we do here. But let me offer this, is that the big customer connection flow, the information flow is not really in Innovation Works. Innovation Works is where we brought observations together with product design closer than ever before. But the by and large -- the blocking and tackling of innovation and customer connection, is every day when the franchisees and our salesmen go into garages and factories and repair facilities and see how things are working, that's how it happens, more than just having it here. And we have that in U.K. Now, what you said about innovation and change, this is our bread and butter because if you think about it, just think about hand tools, we guarantee hand tools for life. So if we didn't have -- if there weren't requirements, different requirements, we wouldn't have a business. So for 9 decades, we've been staying -- we've been having a business based on just the very kind of innovation you described. Nissan changes their cars, we got the best tools.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Great. Last area I wanted to talk a little bit about was credit and I was wondering if, first of all, if you could give a little bit more details on the increase in delinquencies, is that Europe and because of the economic conditions over there or something else causing that? And was also curious is how do you handle the differences between -- credit is a very legislated industry and you've got some major differences now between the U.S. and Europe and how do you look at the policies for the 2? How are they distinguished? And in the U.S., with the consumer protection agency now getting really ramped up into more full activity, is there anything coming along there on the credit side that you're going to have to look at when it comes in terms of your policies for setting credit out in the field?","Aldo J. Pagliari","Richard, Aldo here. Let me just jump in and take -- I'll take the easier one of your questions first and that's -- let's talk about delinquencies. Actually the delinquency trends have a seasonal element to them and they're tracking right where we expect them to be in a favorable manner. They will tend to run up slightly up until after the Christmas holidays and when people start getting their tax refunds back in March -- I'm not making this up, you'll see that we usually get a trend that starts to go in other direction. So the trends, if you look back over prior years, it's fairly consistent with our expectations. So if you go back to the quarter Q3 of last year, they were exactly 1.4% as well. So that's a good point. Your questions regarding compliance, sure. Watching compliance is a complicated area and we keep our eyes open but I want to remind you, we are commercial lenders and we strive to be interpreted as such under whether they be state regulations, a U.S. government regulations or are the same in other fields of -- other country operations. And again, there's always new compliance, rules and regulations on the horizon. We do our best to stay abreast of that. We feel we do a good job of complying with that. Should we add some incremental expenses to deal with that, we go with -- we pay that as we go. So we feel pretty comfortable that yes, it's an area that will continue to see more regulation and we're prepared to deal with it accordingly as it comes up.","Operator","We'll go next to Alek Gasiel from Barrington Research.","Alek B. Gasiel - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of things. Gary -- I'm sitting in for Gary, but kind of getting back to the whole promotional thing in the Tool group, are you able to actually substitute that for the under -- for areas that the van are under-penetrated in? Or is that...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","No, that's not -- I don't think that really is how it happens. One of the things, we did have more promotions in the quarter in the Tools group, but one of the things that -- one base knowledge that's useful, I think, in this is every month, every week, in fact, we have promotions throughout the Tools group. It's part and parcel with the activity there. It's kind of an excitement builder that rolls through. And so fundamentally, what happened in the Tools group is basically, we're more active in promotions in the quarter. Some of that had to do with the SFC, the Franchisee Conference, where it's kind of the most exciting promotions are sometimes there. We had more people at the Franchisee Conference than ever before, the take-up rate was high and the promotions we offered there, and so that tended to drive some of that increase. That's really it. Those weren't aimed at reaching out to other new technicians or anything like that. The reaching out is more a productivity issue, actually.","Alek B. Gasiel - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Are you seeing an increase of people wanting to sign up to be franchisees now?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I think we are but we're being very selective. We're not looking to increase the franchise. I mean, you will see the odd franchise, I think we probably went up 1 or 2 vans this quarter and so that happens. We're being very selective and we're happy with the people we're getting. What we're trying to do is make sure -- try to make sure we can anticipate who wants to retire and match up a person in that jurisdiction at that time. That's really the trick now, is to reduce the time to open. We eventually get a guy, but we want to reduce the time. And so, you can appreciate if somebody wants to -- if the franchisee in Tuscaloosa, Alabama wants to retire, you got to have a guy in Tuscaloosa. A guy in Des Moines doesn't help you and so we're working on that now.","Alek B. Gasiel - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And you commented about the muted OEM dealers particularly in Europe. I wonder if you could provide any color on North America. What are you seeing...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","What I meant by that, if I said OEM dealers, I didn't mean that. I meant OEM manufacturers. What happens is, is that in that particular business, the OEM manufacturers decide to commission an essential tool, often like a special diagnostic unit, a laptop for cars, say Toyota might do it or Honda, or somebody like that, that might say make this diagnostic unit for just my vehicle and distribute it through my dealerships. And they'll have programs that they author and the program might last 8 months, 9 months, a year or something like that where they say they are going to roll these out. And then once it's rolled out, it's over. And then you wait -- you have to get another program to continue the business and we have a series of programs. All we were saying was, is that the programs in Europe are running out and the European OEMs, we believe, are a little bit keeping their powder dry, looking at the economics. Even though new car sales are not so down in Europe, I think they're down about 8% -- but still, I think they're being very careful. And so that's what we're seeing in Europe. In the United States, we're seeing less of that, but it's down slightly, down slightly. And I think that's partially because new car sales aren't bad, but the sort of economic uncertainty, the fiscal uncertainty is dominating whether you want to invest in a long-term program like that.","Alek B. Gasiel - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then, I keep reading about the headline risk and the softness reporting in China. Does that have any impact on you?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, it can from time-to-time. I mean, we sell into factories, factories are closing down and we sell some into factories. It can from time to time, but we have some offsets to that -- we sell into Repair and the Repair business moves up. So I think our direct linkage to that is unclear and kind of nebulous.  GDP was down, I think it was 7.8% but if you looked at power consumption in China, the Industrial business, the industrial consumption of power was down but the consumer consumption was up. So that kind of says that well, the industrial sector is weakening, but the consumers are rolling up and in that balance, I'm not sure how that would affect us really. The big thing is China is a great opportunity for us and we keep building physicals there.","Alek B. Gasiel - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","One last question. And I know you provided already some color on this. Just on Europe, what is their -- what are you hearing in some of the attitudes from the people you talk to there?  And, I mean, just kind of looking at certain pockets of areas, I mean, are Scandinavian countries still holding up or I know...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","You know, look -- sorry, go ahead, keep going.","Alek B. Gasiel - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","And I was just going to say I think you commented that Western Europe was down single digits, right?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes. I would characterize it like this. Of course, the South, Spain and Portugal and those places and Italy and so on, know they are in bigger trouble -- and Greece. They know they've got problems. So when you talk to people, whether your customers -- and our customers are businessmen in most -- by and large, either small or large. And our people, they're very, very, I would say, muted. But they have confidence that they're going to muddle through, they're going to get through this. If you talk to people in what I'll call the other areas of Europe like the U.K. or Scandinavia or France or Germany, they're more positive. They just view this as hey, this is a bump in the road, we're going to batten down the hatches and we're going to go forward. I think our view of -- I think if you read the U.S. papers and you look at Europe, you get more alarmed about the long-term than the impression you get when you walk the grassroots path in Europe. Now I'm not sure who's right, to tell you the truth but you don't get -- I would say, you don't get, I would say, fatalism in Europe. Our people, our customers believe the world's coming back and we believe they're coming back with us.","Operator","We'll go next to David Leiker with Baird.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just a couple of quick follow-ups here. I hope [indiscernible] On RS&I, Nick, on this OEM dealer business, what's the scale of that these days? How important...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I don't know. But by and large, the OEM facing business, the pure OEM facing business is about 1\/3 of the business. There are types of the segment -- sorry, the segment, yes. Sorry I misspoke. It's roughly like this, David, the OEM facing business is 1\/3, the independent facing business is 1\/3, and equipment, which plays in both territories is another 1\/3.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And is that -- given the lumpiness of that business, are those returns such that, that's a space you want to stay in or not?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, the business can be lucrative for us when it's rolling. It is lumpy, but it's not unprofitable now for us. It's just less profitable than the other ones. And one thing that comes through, we like being at least, some of our business, close to the OEMs because we believe it informs us about what's going on for forward thinking around innovation and what's coming in the OEM's product lines. We believe that [indiscernible] something to us.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then on the power tools side, how much -- do you have any sense of the tools your franchisees sell off the truck? How many of those tools are your tools versus somebody else's and if there's still an opportunity for you to penetrate that deeper?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I don't have hard numbers for you but I believe now, a huge share of the tools, the power tools we sell off the truck are Snap-on. I believe, a huge share.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And how important has that been to driving it as opposed to end markets or products or other elements?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","It wasn't a factor in this quarter. But over time, I can't tell, but not that significantly. When I'm talking about over time, I'm talking about back when I was in C&I, we used to talk about bringing it home, and that now, we're talking what? 2003, 2002, 2004, we used to be -- I ran the business that had power tools in it. We used to talk about gee, we need to get our franchisees confident in our tools so they won't sell other people's, and we did. And that happened gradually over that time.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then the last item here as we look at the balance sheet, the manufacturing company here is essentially debt-free. The asset base on the credit company has been rebuilt back to where you wanted it to be. With this cash flow you generate now, what are the priorities for that going forward?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Priorities are first, organic growth and we had some pretty good organic growth in some places, dividends and acquisitions and offsetting dilution. Those are the 4 priorities.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And in the organic growth, I mean, the business is essentially self-funding I mean, you throw off more money than you generate there...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, we're starting to, for sure, yes. I mean, I think you'd be fair to say that we'd start to build up some cash sort of next year, towards the end of next year sometime. And we can put that cash to work.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then on the dividend, you're paying about 25% of your earnings. Are you implying that, that number can go -- I mean once upon a time, you're paying out almost half of your earnings.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes, but that was because our earnings were lower. I think the denominator was changed. I think, look, we don't have a set number as a percentage. Our unifying principle around dividends is that we have paid the dividend every year, every quarter since 1939 and we have never reduced it, and that's it. And so every quarter, we assess whether we want to bring our dividend upwards and that's basically what we do.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then lastly on the acquisitions, you haven't really made anything significant since the Business Solutions business. What are your priorities or where your focus areas in terms of acquisitions?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Okay, first, may I simply say though, before I say that is that I kind of view the credit company as a pretty big acquisition. If we had goofed it up, people would've been talking about integration and things like that. So I think it was a kind of acquisition in a way. But look, here's our priorities: we would do -- we will acquire anything along the 4 decisive strategic runways for growth, enhance the network if we acquire anything in that way. Now it's not so clear there would be things there but we would do. And then emerging markets, positions in emerging markets, more strength in the repair shop owners and managers and that customer base or more gravitas in critical industries. Those would be our priorities. And I don't mean in any particular order there. I just think those are -- we'd be looking at all of those areas.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And understanding that timing of those things can be challenging, is that something that's 3 years from now, you hope to be able to execute on some of those or is it -- if something comes along it comes along?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, I think we believe there's opportunities. We believe we're coming out from under the credit company, we believe we turn the cash on other things. I mean, I think it's timed by the credit company coming out of getting fulfilled. And so that's when we start looking at that. I think I've been saying this to other people for a while. But I think as I said, sort of next year, we're starting to get in that situation where we're looking very aggressively at these kinds of things. And we -- most us have quite a bit of experience integrating and acquiring companies. So I don't think we have any trepidation about doing any of this stuff.","Operator","Thank you.

I'll start today with some of the highlights of our second quarter, the general environment and the trends we're seeing, as well as some of the progress we made. And Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.","Our second quarter results were encouraging. They offer strong evidence of Snap-on advancements along our run rates for both growth and for improvement. Our sales were up 8.2% from last year. The operating margin expanded by 130 basis points. And the earnings per share, they reached $1.80, up 20%, compared with the $1.50 reported last year.","The organic sales increase was 6.6%. Incremental sales from our Challenger acquisition in May of last year, and coupled with our acquisition of Pro-Cut this past quarter, added another $10.5 million, which, along with $1.4 million of favorable foreign currency, brought our total sales for the period to $826.5 million. The operating margin for opco reached 16.7%, up from 15.4% in 2013.","Financial Services' operating income increased to $34.8 million from last year's $30.6 million, driving the consolidated operating margin to 19.7%, also up 130 basis points.","Now from a macro perspective, we believe the favorable conditions remain for our businesses serving automotive repair customers; the Tools Group and the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group. Both have continued to experience strong demand, and in the second quarter, both of them reached new sales levels.","Tools Group activity increased 6.6%. The strength of our band channel is clearly evident in those numbers and in the [indiscernible]. RS&I had an overall -- had overall organic gains of 7.7%, led by significant essential tool and facilitation sales in OEM dealerships.","For the C&I group, for C&I, there are also continued signs of improvement along our runways for growth. We saw important and clear progress in our efforts extending to critical industries, and in building the physicals in the emerging markets of Asia-Pacific. U.S. Military activity. It's been a significant C&I headwind. Well, the military experience is somewhat of a resurgence, up double digits from the second quarter of last year, the first year-over-year increase since mid-2012.","The C&I results are positive. We do, however, remain cautious as to the improvement within the U.S. Military business. At this point, the length and the amplitude of any recovery is quite uncertain.","With that said, though, the opportunities for C&I definitely outweigh the challenges, and the results confirm it. More broadly, the operating income gains across the corporation clearly demonstrate the leverage and the power of the Snap-on Value Creation Processes: safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement. They drive our improvement every day, and they helped author our 130-basis-point gain this quarter.","As I speak to the segment results, I'll highlight some of those advancements in both growth and in improvement. Let's start with C&I. I just said -- as I just said, an 8.4% organic sales increase. The group's operating margin was up 70 basis points, even while overcoming an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 80 basis points. Both higher volumes and the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation drove the margin improvement, more than offsetting the currency.","Related to the volume, there were some positive gains in the group's operating unit. SNA Europe had its third straight quarter of year-over-year group -- growth, a promising trend, outperforming the present economic conditions within its own markets. SNA Europe also showed clear margin improvements in the quarter, capitalizing on the volume increases, leveraging the uptick in activity and realizing the benefits of RCI and past restructuring actions. That effect was evident in SNA Europe's growing profitability.","Also in C&I, the Industrial division saw particularly strong volume in the critical aviation sector, and it's a continuation of favorable trends we saw in the first quarter. And besides the encouraging trend -- the encouraging aerospace volume, the quarter also saw a success in extending to other critical industries like natural resources, where sales were up double digits.","Some of those gains -- some of these gains can be attributed to a growing line of innovative products, guided by strong customer connections, specifically designed for critical applications. One such product was just launched aimed at the power generation industry. It was the K3477, our ground-mounted transformer access tool. This new utility tool is perfect for removing or securing the penta-style bolts on underground utility transformers. It's also effective in a variety of other applications in the power generation and delivery industry.","The K3477 features a pentagon socket at one end and a 3\/4 hex socket at the other. The pentagon side gains access and the hex side is used on the terminals inside the transformer. The new unit employs the Snap-on -- importantly, the new unit employs the Snap-on award-winning Dual 80 ratchet technology for smooth performance, enabling the smallest of ratchet swings, very helpful in tight quarters within a transformer box. The K3477, another tool born from Snap-on customer connection, making work easier for professionals and workplaces of consequence.","Reaching to new markets, the Industrial division organized hands-on product training just for its Latin American region. The meeting was attended by about 125 customers and a number of our sales reps. It included a series of in-depth technical training sessions, familiarizing customers with our latest product offering, emphasizing opportunities across the continents in multiple segments, areas like mining, oil and gas, aerospace. Industrial -- our Industrial division, rolling out of the garage, reaching new segments and new geographies like Latin America.","Industrial is also working to create more customers for life in technical education. We continue to add to our list of Snap-on certified schools. Already this year, 35 new institutions have embraced our certification protocols, helping us lead in providing top-notch curriculums to the technicians of the future.","We continue to build in emerging economies, areas of strong potential, and we saw sales progress in bellwether markets like China and India, activity up nicely compared to last year. C&I did have a positive quarter. It did have a positive quarter. And we know there's even more opportunity, and we're continuing in the pursuit.","Let's move to the Tools Group. Sales increased 6.6% organically. Operating margin of 16.4% was also up, versus the 15.7% recorded last year, overcoming within the quarter 60 basis points of unfavorable currency impacts largely related to our operations in Australia and Canada.","The 70 basis point brings our Tools Group OI margins to new levels, and that performance clearly speaks to our improving position. And when combined with the growth this quarter, it clearly demonstrates the vast -- the success we're having on this decisive runway, enhancing the franchisee channel.","You can see it in the sales, and you can see it in the overall franchisee health metrics, trending positively again this quarter. Snap-on franchisees are a committed and capable force, and we're working hard every day to support their effort through creative marketing, in-house customer financing with Snap-on Credit and a growing array of innovative new products. New products like our Push-Pull Spring Tool range, designed to remove and install springs on automobiles, heavy-duty trucks and agricultural equipment with precision and speed.","You see, today's techs commonly use picks and screwdrivers for these applications. These standards -- but these standard tools sometimes slip, causing the spring to go flying or to drop into the mechanism. It's a productivity killer. Snap-on's Push-Pull Spring units are uniquely designed with a robust shank and a deep V- and C-shaped grooves to securely hold and maneuver small- and medium-sized springs. It's a winning tool line shaped by direct observation, customer trial and feedback.","Products like our power tools, our 14 -- our new power tools. So 14 -- let's take one. A 14.4-volt, 3\/8-inch cordless impact wrench, high torque, small size, power in your product -- in your pocket. This impact gun and its twin, the 14.4-volt cordless screwdriver, combine to display Snap-on innovation and to help drive the Tools Group volume.","On another front, the growing strength of our Tools Group marketing is also evident with the increases in big-ticket sales. And a lot of that credit goes to Snap-on hands-on demonstration vehicles, the Rock 'N Roll Cab Express and the TechKnow Express vans, both driving excitement and sales. The Rock 'N Roll Express showcases a broad range of Snap-on tool storage -- of the Snap-on tool storage line, colors, shapes, options. You've been listening to these calls for any time, you've heard that the product variety made available for hands-on selection on the Rock 'N Roll van is a significant contributor to the Tools Group growth.","For handheld diagnostics, the TechKnow Express vans. The TechKnow Express vans follow the path blazed by the Rock 'N Roll Express, offering customers the ability to touch and to feel and to navigate. In essence, try out our assortment of diagnostic solutions, easing the way to make that big-ticket buying decision, all under one roof. And we keep adding to our TechKnow fleet. We now have 24 with more on the way.","Another advantage for the Tools Group is our Financial Services arm, Snap-on Credit, strategic programs aimed at smoothing the way for those big-ticket categories of tool storage and diagnostics. Again this quarter, our credit company played an essential role in enhancing our van channel and helping us drive the sales growth. Well, that's the Tools Group. Attractive new products guided by customer connection, innovative marketing and a unique credit capability, all helping the vans reach new levels.","Now let's move to RS&I. Organic sales growth of 7.7%, while the second quarter operating margin of 23.2%, 23.2%, compared to last year's 23%. The overall sales gain was $32.3 million, or 13.1%. $19.1 million of organic sales, $2.7 million of favorable currency, and $10.5 million of sales from our acquisition Challenger Lifts and our recent add, Pro-Cut International. We're excited to add Pro-Cut to the portfolio, a well-established brand that complements the RS&I lineup. Challenger Lifts and the newly acquired Pro-Cut advance brake servicing product line, both giving us more to sell to vehicle repair shop owners and managers, to customers and independent shops and national service chains and in OEM dealerships. They're both positive steps along our runway for coherent growth in the repair garage.","Beyond acquisitions, RS&I registered organic sales gains across the group, from repair information to diagnostic products within independent repair shops, to program activity in support of OEM dealerships. The robust organic sales were driven, in part, by innovation in new product lines. In April, a new product launch -- in April, the diagnostic division was, again, voted the Top 10 tool Award winner by the readers of Undercar Digest magazine. These awards are determined by technicians and shop owners, the people who use diagnostics every day to make their living. And they voted 2 Snap-on handheld units, the VERUS PRO and the ETHOS Plus, as being among their most important tools.","This, again, -- This, again, extends our string of Undercar Digest Top 10 Awards for Snap-on diagnostics. Our past winners include, listen to this list, VERUS, VERDICT, SOLUS PRO, SOLUS Ultra, and now the VERUS PRO and ETHOS Plus, a parade of innovation.","New products also helped bolster our sales in our OEM solution business, up double digits in the quarter. One assist in that growth was our expansion in the agricultural sector. In the period, we launched distribution of the essential diagnostic system for a major manufacturer of agricultural equipment, with repair outlets over 5 continents. The system will be used in 6 facilities and in mobile shops to deliver diagnostic repair services across the globe. We like this program. It has strategic -- it has significant strategic importance in extending our diagnostic reach to new customers in another critical arena: agricultural equipment.","Another product, another new product, the Snap-on PRO-LINK Ultra heavy-truck diagnostic tool, was also launched in the quarter. It's a next-generation device that'll make work easier in more than 60,000 heavy-duty shops throughout North America. This new unit helps diagnose and repair a variety of problems, including engine transmission and brake issues on commercial vehicles ranging from light diesels to Class 8 heavy-duty trucks.","The PRO-LINK Ultra has a faster processor, includes more memory, is Wi-Fi enabled and incorporates updated OEM software and arrives preconfigured for a repair connect upgrade. That's Snap-on's proprietary system that allows users to link trouble codes with the most likely fixes based on our extensive library of real vehicle repair data.","To wrap up RS&I, we've seen new diagnostics, unique repair information for cars and for trucks, and a growing undercar equipment offering that now adds both Challenger and Pro-Cut products to our established lines. Real strengths that are driving positive trends and have improved our positions with repair shop owners and managers, and you can see it in the results.","Well, that's the highlights of the quarter: growth and improvement; sales up 6.6% organically, overcoming headwinds; OI margin of 16.7%, up 130 basis points; C&I strength with critical industries and with SNA Europe's ongoing improvement, the third straight quarter of year-over-year growth; the Tools Group getting stronger, robust sales and operating margin, continuing to enhance our franchise network with success; RS&I, advancing its position with gains in both independent shops and OEMs; and Financial Services, raising its contribution both financially and strategically. It was another encouraging quarter.","Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo, who will take you through the financials in detail.","Aldo J. Pagliari","Thanks, Nick. Our second quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $826.5 million in the quarter increased $62.4 million, or 8.2%, from 2013 levels, reflecting broad-based gains across all segments, and include higher sales to auto repair mechanics, customers in critical industries and OEM dealerships.","Organically, sales increased 6.6%, excluding $10.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $1.4 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Consolidated gross profit of $400.4 million increased $27.2 million from 2013 levels.","Gross margin of 48.4% in the quarter decreased 40 basis points, primarily due to 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by savings from ongoing RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $262.3 million increased $6.9 million. The operating expenses margin of 31.7% improved 170 basis points from 33.4% a year ago, primarily due to sales volume leverage.","Restructuring costs of $1.4 million in the quarter compares to $1.8 million of such costs last year. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $138.1 million in the quarter increased $20.3 million, or 17.2%, and, as a percentage of sales, improved 130 basis points to 16.7%.","Operating earnings from Financial Services of $34.8 million increased 13.7% over prior year levels. Consolidated operating earnings totaled $172.2 million, and the operating margin of 19.7% improved 130 basis points from 18.4% a year ago. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 32.9% compared with 32.5% last year.","Finally, net earnings in the quarter of $106.1 million, or $1.80 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $88.4 million, or $1.50 per share last year, representing a 20% increase in earnings per share.","Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, on Slide 7. Sales of $287.2 million in the quarter were up 8.4% organically, primarily reflecting a double-digit sales gain to customers in critical industries and a mid-single-digit sales increase in our European-based hand tool business.","Gross profit in the C&I group totaled $111.8 million in the quarter. Gross margin of 38.9% decreased 70 basis points from last year, as benefits from increased sales and savings from ongoing RCI initiatives were more than offset by higher costs, including $2.7 million, or 80 basis points, of unfavorable foreign currency effects.","Operating expenses of $73.6 million in the quarter increased $1.8 million over 2013 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related expenses. The operating expense margin of 25.6% improved 140 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage.","As a result of these factors, second quarter operating earnings for the C&I segment of $38.2 million increased $4.6 million, or 13.7%, from 2013 levels; and the operating margin of 13.3% improved 70 basis points from 12.6% last year, despite 80 basis points of unfavorable currency effects.","Turning now to Slide 8. Second quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $369.1 million increased 6.6% organically, reflecting a mid-single-digit sales increase in our U.S. franchise operations and a high single-digit sales increase in our international franchise operations.","Gross profit of $161.1 million increased $8.2 million from 2013 levels, while the gross margin of 43.6% decreased 60 basis points, due to $2.1 million, or 60 basis points, of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $100.6 million in the quarter increased $2.2 million from 2013 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related expenses.","The operating expense margin of 27.2% improved 130 basis points from 28.5% last year, primarily due to sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, operating earnings of $60.5 million for the Snap-on Tools Group increased $6 million, or 11%; and the operating margin of 16.4% improved 70 basis points from 15.7%.","Turning now to the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group, shown on Slide 9. Sales of $278.5 million increased $32.3 million, or 13.1%, from 2013 levels. Excluding $10.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $2.7 million of favorable foreign currency translation, organic sales were up 7.7%, primarily due to a double-digit gain in sales to OEM dealership service and repair shops and a mid-single-digit increase in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers.","Gross profit of $127.5 million in the quarter increased $12.6 million over 2013 levels. Gross margin of 45.8% decreased 90 basis points, primarily due to a shift in sales that included higher volumes of lower gross margin products, including increased essential tool and facilitation sales to OEM dealerships, as well as sales of Challenger products. Continued savings from ongoing RCI initiatives more than offset $0.6 million, or a higher restructuring cost.","Operating expenses totaled $62.9 million in the quarter, and the operating expense margin of 22.6% improved 110 basis points from 23.7% last year largely due to sales volume leverage, including benefits from the sales shift discussed earlier. Second quarter operating earnings of $64.6 million for the RS&I group increased $7.9 million from prior year levels, and the operating margin of 23.2% in the quarter improved 20 basis points.","Now turning to Slide 10. In the second quarter, earnings from Financial Services of $34.8 million and revenues of $51.7 million compares with operating earnings of $30.6 million on revenue of $44.5 million last year.","The average yield on finance receivables of 17.5% compared with 17.4% last year. The average yield on contract receivables of 9.5% compared with 9.6% last year. Originations of $232.7 million in the quarter increased 14.6% from 2013 levels.","Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.3 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.1 billion from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. During the second quarter, our worldwide Financial Services portfolio grew approximately $65 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.","Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $124.4 million in the quarter increased $14.3 million from comparable 2013 levels, primarily as a result of higher 2014 net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $119.7 million included $58 million to fund the net increase in finance receivables, and also included $41.6 million for the previously communicated acquisition of Pro-Cut. Capital expenditures of $22.7 million in the quarter compared with $16.7 million last year.","Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade and other receivables of 64 days compared with 62 days at 2013 year end and 65 days at the end of the first quarter.","Inventories increased $33.1 million from 2013 year end, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions, and from the addition of inventories related to Pro-Cut.","On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.7x compared with turns of 3.8 at 2013 year end. The quarter-end cash position of $115.8 million decreased $101.8 million from 2013 year-end levels. That's primarily due to $100 million March 2014 debt repayment.","The net decrease in cash also reflects the impacts of funding $370.6 million of new finance receivables; share repurchases of $62.5 million, or 550,000 shares; dividend payments of $51.2 million; the acquisition of Pro-Cut for $41.6 million; and $41 million of capital expenditures. These uses of cash were partially offset by $282.3 million of cash from collections of finance receivables and $212.7 million of cash from operations.","At the end of the second quarter, our net debt-to-cap ratio was 26%. In addition to our $116 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access commercial paper markets. At quarter end, we had $29.5 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.","I'll conclude by mentioning a few outlook items. We continue to expect that our full year 2014 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our 2013 rate of 32.3%, and we now anticipate capital expenditures for the year will be in the range of $75 million to $80 million.","With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Thanks, Aldo. Well, as I said at the start, we are encouraged by the quarter. We believe the results are more confirmation of our progress, but they're also clear evidence of the opportunities that remain. We've been saying for some time that as we look forward, Snap-on has abundant runways -- abundant and wide runways for both improvement and for growth, and we believe that the quarter's performance adds to a long trend that reinforces that outlook.","We are demonstrating clear gains moving down our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise network. Tools Group sales growing, operating earnings at new heights, innovative new products, strong franchisee metrics and a credit company amplifying that strength with greater effects, expanding with our repair shop owners and managers, RS&I growing, diagnostics and information products stronger with independent shops. A successful Challenger acquisition and a new Pro-Cut addition widening the product offering, extending to critical industries. C&I growing organically at 8.4% with a 70 basis point increase in OI margins, overcoming 80 basis points of unfavorable currency. Rolling the Snap-On brand out of the garage to sectors like aviation and natural resources. SNA Europe clawing back. Building in emerging markets, the physicals getting stronger each quarter and seeing it in our market position. We're also progressing down our runways for improvement. Snap-on Value Creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation of rapid continuous improvement, driving margin gains across the entire corporation.","So we are encouraged by the continuing trends. Sales up 6.6% organically, opco OI margin reaching 16.7%, rising 130 basis points. But we believe there is much more, and we are confident that we're positioned with the capability and the intent to take full advantage and to continue our trajectory of positive performance for the foreseeable future.","Before I turn the call over to the operator, it's appropriate to speak to our franchisees and associates. I know that, once again, many of you are listening. Our progress in the second quarter and the positive trends are a direct result of your extraordinary capability and your continuing commitment. The role you play in our ongoing achievement, you have my congratulations. And for your unfailing dedication to our team, you have my thanks.","Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Liam Burke from Janney Capital Markets.","Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","In terms of Snap-on Tools, you have tools that are guaranteed for life. Now you're seeing a pretty nice growth out of that base market. Is it bigger-ticket items, is it new product introductions or is it market share that are contributing to this better-than-average, better-than-expected growth?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","That's a great question. One of the great questions I think is -- one of our big product lines are hand tools, we guarantee them for life. So how is it we have a business at all? And the answer is, is what happens in the marketplace, particularly in the auto repair marketplace, there's a tremendous motion of technology that creates the requirements, things like the spring tool, like the Push-Pull Spring Tool I talked about, and a number of other products. And so when you look at this business, you see -- first and foremost, you see innovative new products rolling out, because our Snap-on Value Creation around customer connection and innovation is working better before -- better than ever before, and we're having more hit products than we've ever had, 5 or 6 times what we had just in 2006. So you see a lot of those and that creates excitement. So we're doing that better. Underlying that is the change in the vehicles, that's one. Two is, we're reaching more customers because we're enabling our van drivers to be more effective. Part of that is really innovative marketing. Things like the Rock 'N Roll Cab Express and the TechKnow Express, and other things we're doing on the van to make our drivers better. And this general productivity rolling through the van is pretty good. And then, thirdly, the credit company. Since we brought the credit company home, we've learned more things about credit than we ever thought we could, especially applied strategically in the marketplace. And all this is coming together with a team that's starting to learn this. And the Tools Group is singing. I mean, you see the sales of 6.6% this quarter, and I think that last second quarter it was 7%, and the second quarter before that it was 10%, and the second quarter before that it was 10%, and the second quarter before that it was 7.6%. Now, I'm not -- as I say, we think -- we say we're going to grow organically at 4% to 6%, and the Tools Group, by all rights, should be at the lower end of that, and that's what we keep saying. But our team in the Tools Group is doing a great job, and they are expanding their position. I'm not going to say we have a bigger market share, but I kind of like the numbers.","Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And real quickly on C&I, you see -- continuing to see some momentum build in Europe. Are there any verticals or critical industries that are doing particularly well?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Look, I think Europe, the play is more by country, perhaps you might say that. I mean, I think no particular industry. I don't think you're seeing the construction industry come back too quickly. And we felt -- in some of that, the agricultural industries are good, big industry is good, aviation is okay. But I want to emphasize what I said in my call, we're growing mid-single digits in Europe in places like Germany and France and even Spain, the U.K., and this is defying the GDP. The GDP in Germany, for example, is forecasted in the second quarter at 1.8%, France is 0.4%, Spain is 1%, U.K. is 3.1%. So our guys are outgrowing the GDP. I just think it's the fact that we have had faith in that market. We're seeing our customers didn't go away, continuing to pound Snap-on Value Creation, making them more efficient and, in one of the more efficient places, is developing better products, more innovative products. And that's playing out now that they're seeing even a little sliver of daylight. That's what's working for us there. There's nothing particularly special, I think it's just being in a proper position when a little bit of opportunity presents itself.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from David Leiker from Robert W. Baird.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I just want to follow up on the organic growth. It seems like -- well, it doesn't seem like, we've had an acceleration in the growth rates, the 6.6% across the company. My numbers show that's the best since the first quarter of 2002. Do you think there's something in particular going on this quarter that's behind that? Or do you think this is an inflection higher and a new trend of a higher pace of sales than we've seen the last 2 years?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Look, it's better than a stick in the eye to see the 6.6%, of course. And I'm still sticking to my 4% to 6%. I think we're quite pleased with what we saw in the second quarter. We always know that -- and we're seeing positive trends, what are we, like, 5% in the first quarter and so on. So we're seeing our businesses start to become more effective, and I think there are elements inside these businesses that are working that way. I think as we look forward, I think we expect this kind of trend to continue, but I think 4% to 6% is the right -- are the right numbers. But when you look at these numbers, you feel certainly more encouraged about that 4% to 6%. As I've said on every quarter 2 call I've been on -- and I'm not pre-staging anything up or down -- the third quarter is always squirrely because we've got vacations and so on, where the technicians take vacation. They go to the FSC. They park their van and Europe is off in July and August, depending on where you are. And you'll never know when the distributors are going to come back, and so it's more difficult to predict that. But if I think if you look out over the trend, the quarters, we're going to see -- and I'm not predicting anything bad or -- in that, I'm just saying, there always is more turbulence, more windage in that quarter. Over time, I think this is got to be encouraging to us.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then if we look at the gross profit and the currency headwinds, Aldo, I think, or Nick, I don't remember which one, called out Australia and Canada in particular. Is that shifting from the U.S. into those markets?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","That's what it is.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","The transactional effect, where is that coming from?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Tools Group. And it hits us in 2 places. Those particular currencies, of course, you have translation because we have operations there, and they do okay. And so to the extent the Canadian dollar is smaller and the Australian dollar is weaker, there's an impact on translation both at the sales line and the operating income line. But the big effect was transaction, as you're referencing here, where we sell -- what we're talking about here mostly here in Canada is taking the Tools Group and selling out of the United States factories into those jurisdictions. And so what happens is, you've got a selling price that now is less in U.S. dollars, and so you try to punch it up, but it takes a while to move the selling price up to match that. And so you -- inevitably, when currencies go down, you have transaction effects, and that's what's happening there. The currencies -- where the currencies are now -- there's variations as we go through the year. But where the currencies are now, they -- I think they're about where they were at the end of last year, I think roughly, if you look at all the currencies together. So I don't see any trends for the end of the year, I don't see any changes in that currency position.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","It sounds like you -- a lot of the transactional aspect of those maybe diminishing some, it sounds like you...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes, maybe. I think, look, I think the advantage -- you might be entitled to the following. The -- when you look at the currencies and you start playing out month by month, there's a lot of variations. All I'm saying is when you get to the end of the year, there's a lot less variations from where we are now. So there's -- it goes in and goes out as you go through the year. But from an operating guy point of view, you might be entitled to the idea that if the currency drops, like in Australia and Canada, we'd be trying to push up the pricing to recapture some of that. That's where I -- yes, you would be.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And, I guess, the question is, as we look at it sequentially here, how long does it take for that pricing to start to flow through the numbers?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I don't know. It's a long -- I can't give you any number. It's like -- you know how this works. Okay, you try to move the pricing up and maybe it doesn't hold so well and so on. So it's not an exact science. You just charge your operating guys with saying, \"Look, let's try to get some of this back.\" It doesn't always work. Sometimes it does work. For example, this time last year, we had a big ding in India, for example, and it took us a long time to get us back up and we're still not back up, but we got some of it back.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then the last item for me is you've done a great job across your businesses. Arguably in those businesses, you're outgrowing your competitors. What are you seeing across, I don't know, a couple of the businesses? Maybe you can do this. What are you seeing the competitive reaction, from your competitors as you guys continue to put up this strong performance?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I can only tell you what I hear from the people on the ground. And so I was just out at Joliet, where the drag race, we had the Nationals. The NHRA drag race out there, the Nationals, and we hosted 1,200 customers. I talked to a number of them, almost all of them probably. And they didn't mention the competition whatsoever. So I didn't hear anybody say -- hey, I'm not saying people aren't doing stuff. I'm not saying they aren't smart people. I'm not saying they're not aggressive in trying to do things. But what I'm getting feedback from in the operations and at the grassroots are mostly focused on how we can get better, how we can strengthen our position with the customer. It's all about our relationship with the customer. It's almost never \"Oh, I got this competition that's going to bother me.\" It's almost all focused on our relationship. And I think this is the kind of feedback you get from a market leader, of which we are clearly the leader in almost all these segments.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from David MacGregor from Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","I wanted to ask you -- clearly, you're benefiting from a lot of the innovation that you're taking to market. And I know, historically, there's been sort of a fairly set level of spending on innovation with respect to revenues. So I guess the question is just, what's gating you or limiting you from just accelerating your innovation investment? And where do you think the sort of the point of diminishing marginal returns are on that investment program?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I don't know. Look, I think what gates it is our own capability. At some level, we're not smart enough to do any more. And so part of it though is, I think -- that's one, and what I mean by that is this: our drive for innovation has to do with our observations in the field. It's not gated by the innovation back here. So in terms of that -- what I mean back here, I mean, at the center, the R&D labs and so on. So what I mean by that is we're gated by how many people for how many hours we have in the workplace. Our R&D spending is up, and it'll fluctuate from time to time, and we spend more in different places. And I guess you would say that over time, we're growing our capability, hiring more engineers. But in my view, the big pacing item is around the unique strategic value that Snap-on has. That is the understanding of the marketplace and the feedback of that understanding into the innovation system that creates these new products. As I talked about today, that tool for the transmission door -- for the power generation door, the transformer door -- that came out of observing how people service transformers. Somebody was there watching and said, \"Boy, we can save a lot of time.\" Or the thing with the springs. Somebody's in the garage watching the springs being unloaded or taken out of the vehicle and watching them fly all over the place, and watching mechanics chase them around. That fed back into, \"Boy, we can make this more productive.\" That's the key, and that's what feeds us. But it\u2019s a unique value and strategic advantage we have, and that's what we're wielding to greater effect now.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","How do you know you're pricing the innovation properly with so much innovation coming down the pipe? How do you explore kind of the upside or the elasticity?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Geez, I don't know. I think we're priced pretty high now. I mean, we think we're up there in terms of pricing. I don't think anybody's ever asked us, \"Are you too shy in your pricing?\" I don't think anybody's thought that. Now you could ask, \"Okay, where do you price it?\" And I think we get that from the field. We have our franchisees, our franchise performance teams that are out there and right -- if you want to take the Tools Group. And with technicians who are out there all the time in the marketplace, and they have a feel for what a tool will sell for. And I think then we kind of price off our own -- our former tool and say, \"How much innovation is this? How much would it be worth for the customer? How flashy will this be?\" And we make a judgment. It's probably not as analytic as you would hope in some orbs, but our position in the marketplace is more an art informed by tremendous understanding of the customer.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Second question, just -- obviously, you've had a lot of success with the Rock \u2018N Roll Cab Express, the TechKnow Van. It's been driving big-ticket sales. It's been driving growth in the Tools segment. But if you exclude those big-ticket storage and diagnostics business, can you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of possible acceleration and growth for sockets and wrenches and just the core tool [indiscernible]?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Actually, the sockets and the wrenches are up somewhat higher than the average this quarter. So that's going okay. I think -- yes, the sockets might be up higher, so that's -- so we don't see any diminutization of that, I don't think. I think -- look, I think you could argue that to the extent that we have more innovation and we punch into new areas and come up with more ideas that aren't exactly wrenches and sockets, they become a smaller percentage, of course, but they're no less important. In fact, I was on a van in Encino, California last week. One of our van drivers, Matt Scott, he took me around to a Mercedes dealer and a Tesla dealer where I saw a huge number of Snap-on tools and Snap-on boxes. And a couple of young technicians got on the van. Mark Scott [ph], he had been technician for like 5 years, and Juan Gutierrez [ph] gets on, and he's only 3 years. And they all have like -- they'll say, \"I have 5 or 6 ratchets already, but I need this special low-profile ratchet to get inside this particular product.\" So I think there is no shortage of need for innovative new hand tools, ratchets and sockets and wrenches, even with young technicians, even today, even at a place like Tesla.","Operator","And we will now take our next question from Gary Prestopino from Barrington Research.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. But, Nick, in terms of what you're doing in the van channel with the Rock 'N Roll vans and the TechKnow vans, have you expanded that outside of the U.S. to other countries where you...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes, we've got about 5 outside the U.S. I don't know -- sometimes when people say \"outside the U.S.,\" we're talking -- I think for purposes of the way you asked the question, yes, 53 of the 58 Rock 'N Roll cabs are inside the United States. We don't have one in Hawaii, I guess. We've got one in Puerto Rico. And we've got 4 or 5 in Canada, we've got 4 in Canada. So, yes, but there haven't been as pushed as far outside the U.S. Canada is -- the routes are broader, so there's a different approach there, I think. You could argue, \"Should they be in the U.K. and Australia?\" And we're looking at that now. Well, maybe there's an opportunity there, I'm not -- we're not sure yet.","Operator","And we will now take our next question from Richard Hilgert from Morningstar.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First one, looking at the Financial Services balance sheet. We've been expecting the growth rates on the receivables to progressively come down a little bit, because you've grown the base over the last 5 years, and as the company continues to grow, you're adding to that base, but the base is a much larger base. But we've seen here the first couple of quarters of this year that it seems like the growth in financial receivables has accelerated a little bit, and I was curious if there's anything going on there.","Aldo J. Pagliari","This is Aldo, Richard. First off, sure, the first half of the year has been a strong beginning for Financial Services, and it reflects -- if you go back over time, the trailing 12-month performance of our big-ticket items is really where the sweet spot for Financial Services does well, and it continues to do so. So we're pleased with that, and we work in concert with the Tools Group to organize programs that call attention both to the tools that we like to feature in the Tools Group and the innovative products that Nick described earlier, as well as programs that we have to make them attractive to the customers of the franchisees -- that is, the mechanics. So our participation rates have been a little bit better. And again, first half of the year has been pretty good for Snap-on Credit. Long way, we continue with the view that, over time, 90-plus percent of what the Financial Services unit does is in support of the Tools Group. And over time, it will reflect the long-term growth rates of that division. So that's still the advice that we give when we model it ourselves internally, and I guess when we talk to people like yourself.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Looking at the quarterly CapEx. That's, at an absolute level, one of the highest I've seen on a quarterly basis going back over the last 5 years. Are we going to see an acceleration in CapEx going forward beyond the $75 million, $80 million that we're looking at this year?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","No. Look, I don't think so. I think just -- I think we said we were at $70 million to $80 million last quarter, now we said $75 million to $80 million. But this is just -- a few more projects came up that we thought we could invest in. They were talking about the tools factories in the United States, there's some investment in Asia, doing some in Europe and some in R&D or in our places here. I think you're seeing kind of noise in the quarter, and with a maybe slight bias for upward movement. But if I was -- shall I say, if I was a cash flow modeler, for example, I wouldn't be thinking that CapEx is going to explode or get much higher. It'll move up over time, but I'm not thinking we're going to double it or go up by 50% next year, or anything like that. Of course, I'd probably have a big project next quarter that I'll announce, but I don't think so.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right. And then on the margins for the quarter being what they are, and Europe still being -- what is it, roughly 20% of overall revenue?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","That's about right.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Yes, any thoughts to -- you've had this target out there of mid-cycle -- or pardon me, mid-teens EBITDA margins. But even with Europe and the softness over there, we've seen it come back this quarter, you're still able to generate an EBIT margin above 16.5%, EBITDA margin slightly ahead of 19%, that's excluding or having Financial Services on an equity basis. Any thoughts to maybe that target of yours moving up a little bit, given the progress you've made, but still having a big chunk of revenues still being slow?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Hey, look. Here's what I think I would say on that, and I think we've said this effect in other orbs. I think we're looking at the mid-teens in the rearview mirror, what we thought was the mid-teens, and so we're by that now. And that doesn't mean we won't have a quarter that's below that, don't -- that doesn't -- I don't mean that every quarter, or anything like that, but I'm talking about the trend. I think we've passed our goal that we set back in, what, 2005 or something like that, when we were back at 6.5% OI margin. We said mid-teens. But what we're saying -- I think we're viewing it going forward, it's not necessarily a target, but I'm telling you that absent macroeconomic turbulence of significance, we see -- we don't see ourselves being interrupted in terms of our growth. We do think that if we never got another dollar of incremental sales, we would be able to increase the margins because of Snap-on Value Creation and its effect on the operations, and there's so much more to improve. And secondly, we do believe though that we're not going to be flat. We think we have ample runways for growth in the van channel with the repair shop owners and managers, with the extending critical industries in emerging markets, and that's going to add leverage to that. So we see our margins continuing to go up at some pace, and we don't necessarily see a near-term ceiling to that. That doesn't mean there isn't a ceiling some place. But we're sitting here [indiscernible], we see that. So I'm not saying we're at a ceiling or anything like that.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back over to Ms. Kratcoski.","Leslie H. Kratcoski","Great. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today.

Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings. With that said, I will now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. Well, our fourth quarter represented an encouraging performance to cap off the year. The progress was not only reflected in the financials, but it also can be seen in our strategic advancements. The Snap-on Value Creation Processes, the principles and processes we use everyday to guide our actions, they're driving results. Our focus on safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI, as we often call it, it's paying off. And we believe the advancements made throughout 2011 on our runways for both growth and improvement position us to go forward with strength. Aldo will provide detail on the financials. But first, I'll offer some of my perspectives on the highlights for both the quarter and for the year. Sales in the fourth quarter were up organically by almost 6% from 2010. Operating income rose about 30% with our operating margin of 16.3%, up from 13.5% last year. Now that profit increase, of course, included some substantially higher earnings for Financial Services. As expected, that rise came right along with the continuing buildup of our on-book portfolio. But before Financial Services, the operating margin was 14.1% and that compares to 12.6% last year and represents a new high for Snap-on for any quarter.","With respect to the economic environment, the events in Europe are creating a bit more of a headwind. I don't think that'll come as a surprise to anybody. I would, however, still characterize our overall market on balance as favorable, fairly stable and you see that in our overall sales growth. Just as we've demonstrated since the recovery began, we were once again able to gain position and to find the pockets of strength that allowed us to offset areas of external weakness. ","I told you during the discussion about 3 months ago that our third quarter sales volumes, excluding the effects of currency movements, were above the pre-recession levels of 2007 and 2008. That was the first time we could claim an overall recovery in volumes. While the fourth quarter continued that overall trend, today we're reporting results that exceed fourth quarter 2007 levels, which is the most appropriate pre-recession comparison. And in addition, sales increased sequentially off the third quarter, consistent with our normal seasonality. So while Europe does pose some challenges, we are maintaining our momentum.","Now for some highlights from each of the segments and a discussion of our advancements in 4 strategic areas, extending into critical industries, building in emerging markets, enhancing the franchise network and expanding in the repair garage. We've identified these runways as being decisive for our future, and we made solid progress in each of them during the quarter and, for that matter, throughout 2011. In the Commercial & Industrial segment or C&I, organic sales increased almost 5% in the quarter. That growth was somewhat higher than the past couple of periods. So while C&I was where we see the most impact from the challenges of Europe due to our large hand tool operation in the region, SNA Europe, we actually saw better year-over-year comparisons than we've been posting recently. That progress was due to the gains in our Industrial business and to our continued growth in emerging markets, both in C&I. The C&I segment margin for the quarter of 11.2% was down from last year's 12.6%, largely reflecting the $2.9 million in additional restructuring charges and some challenges to the profits at SNA Europe, as that part of the world is obviously not yet recovering. That margin rate, however, was improved from what we saw in the past couple of quarters, reflecting the relative strength of our Industrial businesses, which posed double-digit growth and reached new performance highs.","Speaking of our Industrial division, we made good progress throughout 2011, we said that on these calls, extending into critical industries. In the earlier periods, however, those gains were somewhat masked by the lower military activity. In fact, it was actually real positive that the reduced military volume was effectively offset by our growth in serving the other critical industries. But now, our gains in critical sectors such as aerospace and natural resources are showing through. They're visible. That activity in those areas is supported not only by the innovative Automated Tool Control or ATC system, which is somewhat of a halo product,  and has garnered a lot of important attention. But it also reflects -- that attention also reflects a wide array of hand and torque and power tools, all designed specifically to make the work easier for customers in critical industries. It's that expanded offering and the increased focus that's driving the rise in orders to support flight lines, assembly facilities, maintenance, repair and overhaul operations, oil rigs, mines and power plants, and giving us an ever-growing presence.","C&I is also where we see much of the benefit from our emerging market strategy. Now when you say emerging markets, everybody naturally thinks of China, but our emerging growth is rooted more broadly. In the quarter, C&I saw double-digit gains across Eastern Europe, including in important markets like Russia and in Turkey. So 2011 was a strong year for our emerging markets where we saw large gains, not only in the countries I just mentioned, but across Asia as well in places like Indonesia and Thailand and of course, in India and China. And we're supporting that growth with investments. During the year, we expanded our band saw capacity in China and in Minsk, and it's paid off with substantial new customers and volumes across the globe. In China alone, we now have more than triple band saw capacity since our start up. This past year, we also launched a handheld diagnostics unit specifically for the China market, and our Asianized undercar equipment line is making solid inroads with local automotive repair customers.","When we spoke of emerging markets, I've said in the past that succeeding there is often about presence and physicals, and we're showing our commitment to that belief by building. For example, in China, just this past quarter we opened another facility, our new state-of-the-art Engineering Center at our complex in Kunshan. And in 2012, we'll be expanding again with a new undercar equipment factory aimed at making sure that we can continue to serve that growing local market.","Now let's move on to the Tools Group. Sales in the fourth quarter rose over 9% organically. Operating margin at 13.5% was up from 9.6% in the fourth quarter of 2010. Now I'll remind you that in 2010, the 2010 number included a $4.6 million restructuring charge related to consolidating the North American tool storage production into one facility. But while the year-over-year gain is somewhat amplified, the fourth quarter rise to 13.5% still represents a 230 basis point increase even after adjusting for the favorable restructuring compares.","The quarter's result, taken together with the full year operating margin at 13.7% for the Tools Group indicate clearly that, that operation is showing significant positive momentum. Given that one of our key priorities we set for ourselves years back was in fact, strengthening the van channel, I'm encouraged that it appears to be quite robust as we enter 2012. Throughout last year, I was able to point out significant progress in that area. Snap-on being ranked #6 of all franchise opportunities by Franchise Direct and the Frost & Sullivan survey, more recognition of Snap-on by professional technicians as their preferred brand by larger margins, wider than ever before, and awards from MOTOR Magazine and Professional Tools & Equipment News for innovative products that make the technician's job easier. But more importantly, more important than outside recognition, the best testimony to a strong system comes directly from our franchisees. They've told us in confidential surveys and in public discussions that overwhelmingly, if given the chance to do it all over, they would again commit to a Snap-on franchise and they would also recommend the opportunity to a friend or family member. That may be the best endorsement we can ever get. Just this past week, and I spent a weekend -- just this past month, I spent a weekend with a number of our franchisees during the annual kickoff meetings and their enthusiasm, I'm telling you, confirms the progress we've made. They tell me that one of their big advantages while out calling on technicians is our captive finance companies, Snap-on Credit. Our successful transition from a joint venture to a wholly-owned Snap-on entity without our customers' experience, and any disruption was certainly a key factor in maintaining the health of our network and in supporting the global growth we've been posting. The credit companies' portfolio continues to ramp up onto our book. It's performing well and it's adding to our bottom line. But more important than the financial returns, in today's world of tight credit, our franchisees and our technician customers are benefiting significantly from access to consistent and available financing. And we see it in the numbers. The growth in the operation -- so that's some color on the state of the tools. The growth in that operation has been substantial. And I can say that all of those things I've just mentioned are driving the growth, and we are very encouraged by the results of the Tools Group in this period, it's showings strength. Now for Repair Systems and Information or the RS&I. Fourth quarter organic sales were up 2.4%. The operating margin was 20.8%, and that compares to the 19.7% achieved in 2010. The growth in the operation was somewhat muted by our undercar equipment business, which is the other area where we have exposure to Europe reflecting our significant market position in that region. Remember that the RS&I businesses are focused on serving repair shop owners and managers, and they're working to expand our strong brands of products throughout the repair garages of the world. I mentioned our equipment product position in Europe. Well, in the fourth quarter, we reinforced that strength when we launched our updated V3D aligner in Paris. That new product offers some attractive productivity enhancing features such as a VIN reader that automatically loads the vehicle's specification, and an improved user-friendly technician interface. Both innovations that simplified vehicle alignment. And as you might imagine, the new unit was quite enthusiastically received. ","We also continued to get great reviews for our new diagnostic wheel balancer, which was recognized by MOTOR Magazine as one of the top 10 products. I mentioned it last quarter, our unique imaging technology providing a digital map of actual and predicted tire wear and heading off problems with a quick balance and just a few spins of the wheel. That product is now being placed in training facilities where technicians learn and\/or enhance their craft. Both the new aligner and the new balancer represent just the type of innovation that we continue to roll out. And we believe that, that's the key to gaining position and to overcoming economic challenges -- offer products that pay back through productivity, gain committed users who are trained using those very products.","As the economics for the automotive OEM seem to be improving, we've seen those manufacturers commit to new essential tool requirements, customized diagnostics for both their U.S. and European dealer bases, and we're getting our share of that business. We're also expanding into near adjacent segments. I've spoken in the past about growth in the medium and heavy-duty commercial vehicle sector with repair informations and diagnostics products that capitalize on our unique knowledge, bringing it into that sector. In that same manner, we're also able to take that information technology and that diagnostic know-how and apply it to areas such as agricultural and construction equipment. We're starting to get traction there and both those areas represent attractive opportunities. And when you reach further into that same segment, we also see that our Electronic Parts Catalog or EPCs, products that work so well in aiding vehicle technicians to prescribe, locate and order just the right part, also had important applications for those working on agricultural and construction equipment. Our EPCs are also becoming a valuable opportunity in this space. As I mentioned in the past, our overall EPC business was challenged by the decline in the U.S. automotive OEM dealership group tax. So we've been extending to other opportunities. Our expertise in serving independent repairs, repair garages with shock management repair information and handheld diagnostics gives us, we believe, a unique customer connection and an insight into those customers' needs. We've taken that advantage and successfully deployed an all made EPC called more [ph] for the independent markets. The product offers the independent shop an access to the parts operations of OEM dealerships, providing availability and pricing and parts ordering information. And this is a business in which both dealerships and independents want to participate. Now integrated with our Mitchell 1 shop management software, the combination offers even more efficient workflow and productivity in the independent shops throughout the United States. You can see by this discussion I think that we're working across the corporation to provide a full array of products to repair shops and our managers, from diagnostics, to repair information, to shop management software, to undercar equipment and including customized tool storage units. It's paying off with independents and with OEM dealerships. In fact, many of the larger dealerships are outfitting their shops with a consistent professional look that is more and more demanded by OEMs, all while providing great productivity solutions, and we're helping them do it.","Well, those are the highlights. Organic growth in the quarter of almost 6%, encouraging from an overall post-recovery perspective. Operating income increases at both OpCo and SinCo [ph], reaching new highs, our areas of strength combining to more than offset any headwinds. An abundant evidence, clear evidence that we're continuing to take strides, clearly moving forward along strategic runways for coherent growth. It was an encouraging quarter.","Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for a detailed discussion of the financial results. Aldo?","Aldo J. Pagliari","Thanks, Nick, and good morning to everyone. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. ","Net sales in the fourth quarter of $736.6 million increased $39.7 million or 5.7% year-over-year. Excluding foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 5.9%, reflecting sales growth across the majority of our businesses. Higher sales in the Snap-on Tools Group combined with increased sales to a wide range of customers in critical industries and emerging markets, higher essential tool and facilitation program sales and higher sales of diagnostics and Mitchell 1 software products more than offset weakness in Europe, particularly in the southern regions. Consolidated gross profit of $335.8 million in the quarter increased to $17.3 million from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 45.6% in the quarter was comparable with last year. Operating expenses in the quarter of $232 million were on par with 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 31.5% in the quarter improved 160 basis points from 33.1% last year, largely due to benefits from sales volume leverage, savings from RCI and restructuring initiatives, lower bad debt expense and lower stock-based mark-to-market compensation expense. These improvements were partially offset by higher performance -based incentive compensation expense and $2.6 million of higher pension expense. Restructuring cost the $4.4 million in the quarter compared to $5.8 million last year.","Operating earnings before Financial Services of $103.8 million in the quarter increased $16.3 million or 18.6% from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings before financial services improved 150 basis points from 12.6% last year to 14.1% this year. Operating earnings from Financial services of $22.1 million in the quarter improved $12.7 million from 2010 levels, reflecting the continued growth of our on-book finance portfolio. Consolidated operating earnings of $125.9 million in the quarter increased $29 million or 29.9% from 2010 levels. As a percentage of revenues, operating earnings of 16.3% improved 280 basis points from 13.5% a year ago.","Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 33% compared with the 30.1% rate of last year. The lower 2010 rate benefited from nonrecurring tax items, including the December 2010 extension of certain federal tax incentives. ","Finally, net earnings of $74.3 million or $1.27 per diluted share in the quarter were an all-time  fourth quarter record, up $16.4 million or 28.3% from last year's levels. Now let's turn to our segment results.","Starting with the Commercial & Industrial or C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $295.4 million for the fourth quarter increased 4.9% from 2010 levels. Higher year-over-year sales to a wide range of customers in emerging markets and in critical industries, particularly aerospace and natural resources, were partially offset by the weakness in Europe. Gross profit of $106.4 million in the quarter declined $1.6 million from 2010 levels, largely due to $2.9 million of higher restructuring cost, incurred to further improve the segments cost structure in Europe. In addition, benefits from higher sales and RCI incentive were partially offset by margin pressure in Europe. Gross margin of 36% in the quarter compared with 38.4% last year. Operating expenses of $73.4 million in the quarter were up slightly from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 24.8% in the quarter improved 100 basis points from 25.8% last year, primarily due to benefits from RCI initiatives and sales volume leverage. Fourth quarter operating earnings of $33 million for the C&I segment declined $2.4 million or 6.8% from 2010 levels, largely due to $2.7 million of higher year-over-year restructuring costs. As a percentage of sales, operating margin of 11.2% in the C&I segment compared with 12.6% last year.","Turning now to Slide 8. ","Fourth quarter sale from the Snap-on Tools Group of $292.8 million improved $24.6 million or 9.2% from 2010 levels, largely due to continued higher sales in the United States. Gross profit in the Snap-on Tools Group of $123.9 million in the quarter increased $16.7 million from 2010. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 42.3% in the quarter improved 230 basis points from 40% last year, primarily due to $4.3 million of lower restructuring cost, benefits from favorable foreign currency effects and continued savings from RCI initiatives. Last year, the Snap-on Tools Group incurred $4.6 million of initial restructuring cost in the fourth quarter for the 2011 closure of the Newmarket, Canada tool storage manufacturing facility. ","Operating expenses of $84.3 million in the quarter increased $2.9 million from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 28.8% in the quarter improved 160 basis points from 30.4% last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage. Fourth quarter operating earnings of $39.6 for the Snap-on Tools Group increased $13.8 million or 53.5% year-over-year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 13.5% increased 390 basis points from 9.6% a year ago. Excluding the effect of restructuring expense, operating income margin improved 230 basis points year-over-year.","Turning to the Repair Systems and Information or RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Fourth quarter sales of $236.5 million increased $4.7 million or 2% from last year's levels. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 2.4%, mainly due to higher sales in our Equipment Solutions business, which facilitates essential tool programs for OEMs, along with higher sales of diagnostics and Mitchell 1 software products to repair shop owners and managers. These increases more than offset the weaker sales to European equipment distributors that Nick already mentioned. Gross profit of $105.5 million in the quarter increased $2.2 million from prior year levels. As a percentage of sales, gross margin was 44.6% in both the fourth quarters of 2011 and 2010. Gross margin improvements in 2011 from ongoing RCI initiatives were primarily offset by higher restructuring costs. Operating expenses of $56.3 million in the quarter decreased $1.3 million from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 23.8% in 2011 improved 110 basis points from 24.9% last year, principally due to the benefits from sales volume leverage, savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring costs.","Operating earnings of $49.2 million for the RS&I group increased $3.5 million or 7.7% from 2010. As a percentage of sales, operating margin of 20.8% in the quarter increased 110 basis points from 19.7% last year.","Now turning to Slide 10. Fourth quarter operating earnings from Financial Services was $22.1 million on revenue of $35.5 million. This compares with operating earnings of $9.4 million on $21.5 million of revenue last year. The $12.7 million year-over-year increase in operating earnings primarily reflects the growth of our on-book finance portfolio. Originations of $155 million in the quarter rose 9.1% compared to last year's levels, reflecting both higher sales in our Snap-on Tools segment and increased participation in our credit programs.","Moving to Slide 11. As of the fourth quarter end, our balance sheet includes $935 million of gross financing receivables, including $786 million from our U.S. Snap-on credit operation and $149 million from our international finance subsidiaries. ","In the U.S., $636 million or 81% of the financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. During 2011, our on-book financing portfolio has grown just over $200 million. The pace of the portfolio's on balance sheet development has continued as expected and will naturally decelerate as the transition of the CIT owned portfolio to Snap-on Credit nears completion. As such, for the full year 2012, we anticipate that the gross on-book portfolio will increase by approximately $125 million over 2011 year-end levels, which is slightly ahead of our previously communicated future state level for the portfolio of approximately $1 billion. As our transition moves towards completion, we expect further expansion of the Snap-on Credit portfolio to largely reflect activity in the Snap-on Tools Group. Regarding finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.","Now turning to Slide 12. Consolidated operating cash flow of $72.3 million for the quarter and $128.5 million for the year includes the effect of a $48 million discretionary cash contribution to our U.S. pension plans. For the full year 2011, we contributed in total approximately $61 million to our various global pension plans. As expected, free cash flow from Financial Services in the quarter was a negative $36 million, reflecting the continued funding of new loan originations at Snap-on Credit. The operating company generated positive free cash flow of $58.3 million in the quarter, representing a $33 million increase over the prior year. Capital expenditures of $14.6 million in the quarter and $61 million for the full year, included continued spending to support our strategic growth initiatives, including the expansion and enhancement of manufacturing capabilities in both the U.S. and abroad. As seen on Slide 13, day sales outstanding for trade receivables of 58 days at 2011 year end, improved from 61 days at 2010 year end. Inventories increased approximately $60 million from 2010 year-end levels, largely to support higher demand, mitigate potential supply chain disruption and improve customer service levels. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 4.2x compared to 4.7x at 2010 year end, reflective of the higher inventory. Sequentially, inventory [indiscernible] 4.1x in Q3. Our year-end cash position of $186 million decreased $387 million from 2010 year-end levels, principally due to the $200 million August debt repayment. Funding for new loans originated by Snap-on Credit. The previously disclosed $89.8 million second quarter repayment of amounts withheld from CIT and a $48 million discretionary pension contribution. Our net debt to capital ratio of 34.3% compares to 30.1% at 2010 year end, reflecting the uses of cash in 2011 that I just reviewed. In addition to our $186 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, including our $500 million revolving credit facility and $200 million loan and servicing agreement. In addition, our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper market should we choose to do so. As of 2011 year end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities. This concludes my remarks on the fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few [Audio Gap] 2012 as outlined in this morning's release.","We anticipate that capital expenditures in 2012 will be in a range of $60 million to $70 million. Our restructuring expenses for the year are expected to include an estimated $6 million to $8 million charge in the second quarter associated with the settlement of a pension plan related to the 2011 closure of the Newmarket, Canada facility. Exclusive of this charge, pension expense in 2012 is expected to be comparable with 2011 levels. During 2012, we intend to make required contributions of $12.6 million to our foreign pension plans and $18.3 million to our domestic pension plans. Depending on market and other conditions, we may elect to make discretionary contributions to our domestic plans. Finally, we anticipate a full year effective income tax rate of approximately 33.5%. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Thanks, Aldo. Well, to wrap up, we're quite encouraged by our results for the full year in general and for the fourth quarter in particular. Our attention to the Snap-on Value Creation Processes are driving real improvement. OpCo operating margins for the year and the quarter were up from last year, 140 basis points and 150 basis points, respectively, both significant increases. And we continue to bring the credit company on-book with reliability, without disruption and with profitability, just as we said we would. We believe we're making clear advancements on our strategic runways for coherent growth, the van network is more robust, profits are up, turnover is down. RS&I is expanding our offering to shop owners and managers in new places. Our growth in critical industries within double digits, and we've built more physical capability in emerging markets with the opening of our new engineering center in Kunshan. As usual, we do have continuing challenges in Europe and other places, but the strength of our strategic initiatives brought us to an almost 6% organic sales gain in this quarter, well into our target post-recovery range, despite the headwinds. And our operating company in common, OI margin for both the quarter and the year, represent record levels for our company despite the headwinds. Summing it all up, we're encouraged by the results, by the progress they evidence, by the strength they confirm and most of all, by the prospects they imply. ","I'll end, as we always do, by recognizing that the performance over the quarter and the year reflects the special dedication of our Snap-on associates and franchisees around the world. ","I know that many of you are listening. You are the ones who have created this performance and have made this trend possible. For your extraordinary contribution to Snap-on and for your unwavering commitment to our team, you have my congratulations and you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to David Leiker with Robert W. Baird.","Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","This is Joe on the line for David. I'm sorry I hopped on the call a little late, so I apologize if you gave this number. But the past few quarters, you've given us C&I organic growth number x Europe, would you happen to know them?","Aldo J. Pagliari","C&I number x Europe, I don't know if we've given that in the past.  I think we gave it Southern Europe in the past, I'm not sure we have that or interested in giving that or will give that at this time. If you want to call back later maybe we...","Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, I was just -- rather to have, I guess, excluding the headwinds, so Southern Europe but I...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","The thing to do, if you --  what I will tell you is this, Europe breaks down pretty much like this. If you look at our businesses in Europe, we have Southern Europe and Southern Europe is down further than it has been in the past, 15% to 20% now. And so that is particularly right down the center of C&I. This time, we have an impact on the Equipment -- we have the Equipment business, which is down in Europe Now I'm not sure if that's economy related or just 1\/4 motion, because the Equipment business can be a little lumpy. And last year, there was a couple of shows in Europe that made it difficult, and that made the comparisons difficult. But the rest of Europe for us is up 2% to 3%. Now that's softened from where we were. If you pull out -- I suspect if you pull out everything out of all the European businesses out of C&I, you're talking about a 5% to 6% to 7% growth in C&I, so you're still seeing a pretty robust business if you take Europe out of it. Now I will call your attention to, if you weren't on the call, the big pieces that's very strong in C&I is the Industrial business, and we've been mentioning that our runway for growth and in critical industries has been open for us. And in the past quarters, it's been masked by the military activity going down. But this quarter, with the military activity comparisons being a little softer on a year-over-year basis, that business grew by double digits. So in balance, you have C&I down, you have C&I impacted by Europe but still growing in our 4% to 6% range, so let's say at around this 5% to 6% range without Europe.","Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","All right, great. And I actually wanted to touch on the other growth aspect of C&I, the emerging market piece. Do you happen to know what Thailand as a percent of that segment represents, because I'd imagine with all the flooding, they're going to need a lot of car repair in the near term?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Would you think less of me if I admitted to not knowing the Thailand number at this time. But if you want to call in, we may have it. I think our business is reasonable in Thailand but a kind of secondary market. The big markets in Asia are India, China, Japan, Indonesia, Philippines. Thailand would be in the second level around Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. I think you're right. I think there is opportunity for it to grow there. We have a good share. We have a reasonable position, at least in the, I guess, top end of the market.","Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","All right. And then one last one for me, the Tools business obviously had a great quarter and organic growth accelerated sequentially, growing 9% wherein Q3 it looks like it was up 6% organic. You've always talked about that business being maybe at the lower end of the 4% to 6% sustainable range. I'm just wondering, going from 9%, what's going on in that business that's enabling such strong growth and where do you see it going forward to the next...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, I think one quarter does not a whole trend make. So I wouldn't get -- I don't think we get excited about any of our businesses, particularly about one quarter or another. I think you can't draw any conclusions, big conclusions from one quarter. But I'll say this, the Tools Group, we have said for a long time that they have to deal with a certain fixed space, the technicians in the United States. But then we have also said very quickly that our vans call on only a subset -- fully enabled, our vans only call on a subset of that space because they've just -- it's a productivity issue. They only have so many hours in the week, because they have to call on these people every week. And if we can enable them with RCI, then volume will accrue. And that's what's been happening. You're seeing RCI flow through the vans. Now is it going to happen at 9% every quarter? I don't know. I can't comment on that. But I think what you're seeing in the robust quarter is a combination of things, but one of the major factors is the effect of that van network being more robust, being more productive and therefore, capturing more sales of those technicians and calling on more of them.","Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","If you had to give a baseball analogy, how much more room you have to go in the productivity initiatives with the van network, where would you think you're at?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I don't have to give a small analogy though, but I don't know. I think there's quite a bit of runway there, but we have said, I think, our targets, our range is 4% to 6%. We've said that the Tools Group, because of the fixed nature of its business, will be at the lower end of that with RS&I in the middle and C&I at the top end. And we don't -- nothing in this quarter tells us that, that's wrong. Okay?","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jim Lucas with Janney Capital Market.","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","This is Mike Wherley standing in. You guys mentioned restructuring in Europe in the C&I business and I was just wondering, have you resized the SNA Europe to reset up a lower demand level or do you still have belief that those markets are coming back?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","We believe the markets are coming back. What you see in the restructuring is simply the effect of RCI rolling through that business so we can do our target with less.","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. So no change to sort of the size of...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","No, we might. Jim, we might have closed -- we didn't close any big operations or anything like that or rationalize the distribution. We're just -- I think this is what I would call aggressively RCI-ing the business.","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then when we look at RS&I, the revenue growth, it's still there but it decelerated from like 5% and 10% the last 2 quarters. And I'm just wondering, relative to like that 10% 2 quarters ago, how much of that is due to Europe versus just some tougher comps as you came out in the downturn.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Both, Jim. I think that if you're looking at the 10%, that's the easier comps. When you go back and you look at the trend of RS&I, I mean the growths were 11%, 7%, 9%, 6%, 4%, 8%. so you saw it coming off the easier comps. And in fact, some of those businesses were slower to come back than others. So you saw that rolling through the business. Rolling through that sector. What you saw in the fourth quarter was fundamentally the equipment business being a little bit off the boil. And I don't -- and a lot of it's in Europe and we're not sure how to interpret that. I'm not willing to say it's economic-related, I just think we do see from time to time lumpiness in the Equipment business. So the 2.4% in organic and RS&I in the quarter, yes, it's below what we would normally expect, but not I would call what I'd say concerning to us or alarming.","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","But would you say it's more from the weakness in Europe than tougher comps?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes, I'd say so. I'd say so. Yes, I'd say that. I'd say that.","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And then just the last question I had on the Financial Services portfolio...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","So let me clarify that for a minute, if I could. The one thing, the one clarification that as I said, I think, in the last point is that Europe Equipment business had in itself a noneconomic tougher comp because it has every other year's show cycles and so therefore, there's some of that flowing through this business. So all things being equal, we would have not expected as robust the fourth quarter out of RS&I because of this. Now I'm not saying that accounts for all of this, but that's a factor.","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. The last question I had was on Financial Services and you talk about that portfolio being over $1 billion, a little bigger than you had thought before -- by the end of next year or -- and I'm just wondering is that more because the Tools Group is doing well or is it because of other credit offerings outside the Tools Group?","Aldo J. Pagliari","Mike, this is Aldo. It really reflects a higher pace of growth in the Snap-on Tools Group. We do like to work closely with the Tools Group, it's one of the advantages of having a captive finance company. So the Snap-on Credit Corporation works intimately with them to design programs that encourage greater levels of participation. So what I think you see is that we've had a more rapid of ramp-up of originations in the Snap-on Credit Company, reflecting really increased financial health and commercial health of the franchisee network, and that spills over into their customer base. And I think that's why you see some increased performance in the Tools Group itself, and Snap-on Credit also participates in like fashion.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Richard Hilgert with MorningStar.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","On the RCI Slide -- I'm sorry the C&I Slide...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Do you mean RS&I?","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","No, C&I.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","C&I, okay.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","The gross profit line, if I add back the $2.9 million in restructuring costs, I'm still coming up with a 37% of sales gross profit margin. So that leaves us with 140 basis points decline in margin from year-over-year. So I'm wondering, you had mentioned the RCI going through Europe and you've got some restructuring that you're going to do because of it, and you're going to be able to do more with less over there. Does that get us the 140 basis points of margin that we used to have? Or is there pricing pressure over there too?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, let me just speak to that a moment. First, I think it's just -- I think the most -- I guess, the most informative way to look at C&I is not necessarily gross margin, because what you have flowing through that is you have business mix, for example, as some of that. I'm not saying it's the whole effect but I'm saying some of it, it gets distorted by the fact that when Asia-Pacific grows, Asia-Pacific is, by definition, a low gross margin business and a low OE business, still as profitable from an OI business. So that tends to reek a little bit of distortion, Richard, on that gross margin line. So if you roll over to OI which is still down, 140 basis points or something and you say, \"Okay, 90 basis points of that is restructuring,\" you're still down 50 basis points -- what's wrong, what's the problem. And the problem is Europe, you put your finger on it. And in Europe, there are 3 things going on. One is Southern Europe is down again and you may not have heard this, but I've said this on the calls before, for us, Southern Europe was our highest profitability and margin business. So there is a mix question as Southern Europe shrinks further for us on a year-over-year comparison basis. That creates some impact. Then there is the question of -- they have a cocktail of currencies, they source from a number different places on renminbi and the Argentine peso and a number of different places. And those things turn somewhat favorably, so that's some impact. And then, which I think is the more interesting view is, we have in Europe what we're calling a stimulus program where we focus on places where we think we could gain with customers by having programs that attached a little bit more effort, a little bit more support, a little bit more price support. And those kinds of things impact as well. It worked for us in the recession in the United States. We had a stimulus program that targeted places where we thought we could advance our position, and that's what we're playing out in Europe. So those are the 3 factors that have tended to pretty much move that OI margin down. Now are we going to get back? I think that's the intent over time, but I'm not saying that -- I don't think you can say, \"Look, we made these restructuring actions in Europe, and that's going to fix the problem,\" because the problem in Southern Europe is frankly too deep to be fixed by RCI actions. Our whole structure in Europe is -- our whole view, approach to Europe is saying, \"Look, we're watching our customers, we're watching our distribution, we're seeing our share and we believe this market's coming back. We think we'll be stronger than before and therefore, we're just preparing for that day because we think we can capitalize on that.\"","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","The car market over in Europe is quite a bit different. The repair business, the artisan keeping his tools to do his trade is the same. But over in Europe, you've got about 1\/2 of the cars that belong to fleets. How does that dynamic factor in when we've got a slowing economic environment? I would think that these corporations would be holding onto these vehicles longer and trying to get more use out of them, therefore, there might be more repair opportunities. Is that how to look at it?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes, I think that might be true. I think you'll be entitled to that assumption. It certainly happened in the United States as people -- as new car volumes go down. People hold on their cars longer and that drives more repair, so that would be one tailwind we would see. Now remember when we're talking about Europe, we're less auto-centric than we are in the United States, but that's what still give us a boost, because we have our automotive business in Europe. And the way we structured that wouldn't all come out of C&I. We've seen some of it in Tools, we've seen some of -- that phenomena you're talking about, we've seen some of it in Tools, we've seen some of it in RS&I and so on, but it would be a clear tailwind for us.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, good. Last area I wanted to touch on was again this objective of achieving $1 billion plus on the balance sheet for Financial Services. As time goes by and we see economic improvement over here in the U.S. and new car sales start to improve, on the one hand, we might have a decline in the aftermarket in the sense that people aren't keeping the used car as much. They're getting more new. But on the other hand, as that economic conditions improve, there might be more creation of additional repair shops, which would need tooling to get up and running. Is that part of where the increase in the funding or the receivables comes from is an assumption that we'll see an increase in franchisees, and because there's an increase in the number of shops coming as the economy improves?","Aldo J. Pagliari","Again, Richard, Aldo. I'll answer that as best I can. I think the growth in the portfolio, as envisioned, is mostly on the extended credit portfolio side, which is the bread and butter of what we do. It makes up 81% of what we do today. And I think the lion share of the growth beyond where we're at right now, the additional $125 million, I think we see on the slide that $95 million or so come -- or 77% of those, still come from extended credit. So again, that's catering to the mechanic as an end customer via the franchise network. What you hinted at, there will be some of it that's called -- what we call the leasing, when shop owners -- it's a small piece of what we do, it makes them about 4% to 5% of the Snap-on Credit portfolio today as leasing activity. When the shop owners sometimes needs financing, they will sometimes consider Snap-on credit as a source. But that's a little bit of a different credit profile, different bit of a mix and therefore, they have other alternatives available for them, they have -- can have local banks that might be available for them as a source of funds, as well as Snap-on Credit as well as other leasing companies. So to answer your question if shops expand, that does create an opportunity for Snap-on credit to grow, but the lion share of the growth that we're talking about is just the increased participation of our activity with mechanics as end customers.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","But I think you're -- I just want to add to that. I think you're right about an underlying sort of macro in there. And that generally, in markets we have seen, one of the great things about being in critical industries in automotive repair is critical tasks. And automotive repair is one of those, is they tend to move upwards as the world facilitized. For example, you mentioned new cars and so on, but new cars, the new car market in the United States, has been up or down. It's $9 million, $10 million, I think $17 million. And despite that, cars have gotten older every year since 1980. So the idea of the repair and demand keeps going upward, and I think that is just an underlying trend that says, \"Okay, there are going to be more shops.\" There's going to be more demand for repair, and in fact, when you look at the statistics about the average household spend on automotive repair, it's going up. It went up again last quarter and it's been going up pretty much regularly every quarter for a long time. So you're correct at putting your finger on one of the great driving points behind these macro driving points behind this businesses.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just as a follow-on to that, what's the anticipated growth rate in the number of franchisees for the coming couple of years?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I think -- I don't think we're going to see it move up that much. We have 3,400 -- depends on the geography in the United States, we have 3,467 now that moved a couple in the past few years. You might see some increase, but our play -- I think the play about numbers of franchisees is not there. What will happen, we believe, is efficiency. One, franchisees, the individuals will reach more customers, they call on 800,000 now, there are 1.3 million in the United States. They can call on more. It's a productivity issue. It's what I said before. Two, we have turnover, and it's an all-time low, but it's still about 8% a year. So you do the math and you figure out how many turnover, a couple -- 300 a year. And our ability to fill them quickly has to do with our ability to serve the market. So we get better every quarter at filling those things, and that adds capacity, even within the same number of shares. So the effect for the Tools Group is more around productivity for the vans themselves, that's the growth place. And our productivity internally, where we could be more efficient and popping somebody in when they're ready to retire.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions here. Hey Aldo, in terms of the overhead expenses related to Snap-on Credit, is that still running at about $25 million to $30 million?","Aldo J. Pagliari","I think as a ratio, Gary, the best I can determine, let's say you're in the 6% range, if you look at what percent of revenues that they tend to generate, you'll see good drop through. The biggest expense that flexes as you grow the portfolio is really the provision for bad debt. As you grow the portfolio, you have to have -- anticipate bad debt expense that goes along with that. To me that's the biggest variable expense. Of course, there's underlying structural additions you look at. And we always look ahead to will it be increased costs of compliance. So there's some variables out there on the horizon, and we don't really give guidance around it. But it's a pretty scalable organization, but you don't have to have lots of incremental [ph] costs to grow.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Is that 6% of Financial Services revenue, 6% of the total loans out there?","Aldo J. Pagliari","I'm looking at 6%, if you look at the top line more or less, if you look at where you're at. The financial expenses run in the order of about $50 million, $51 million, I believe, they were on a full year basis this year. So that's about -- that'll grow a little bit going forward. The biggest variable expense is really a provision for bad debt expense.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's fine. And then, Nick, you kind of mentioned in your talk that throughout the quarter you started Q4, obviously, Europe continues to weaken and we know the problems in the South and -- but can you maybe comment on what you're seeing so far in the quarter? Is there any changes there? I mean has it gotten worse in terms of both the North and South?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I hate to comment on the South of Europe because I seem to be -- I remember I was on one of these calls one time and I think I said I thought it bottomed out, and that turned out to be misinformed. So that was a long time ago. But we're not -- we don't give guidance, but I can say I don't think we're seeing any sea change, what -- we're seeing kind of the same stuff that we saw. And the interesting thing about Europe is if you look at it, it's kind of the same characteristics that we saw before, it's just that it generally weakened. The South is worse and then for us, the North was better and the Middle was kind of middling and that kind of thing, but we're not seeing any, I would say, any implosion or something like that.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. It's just I asked those questions because it's in the headlines constantly, and you'd think it's falling off a cliff. Okay. And then one thing you did mention in terms of especially in the RS&I, or Repair and Infosystems, you talked about the products you sell generally offer productivity improvements. Have you ever mentioned like what kind of return, what productivity return a shop gets from some of these products that you're putting through there?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","We haven't mentioned it. We haven't mentioned it. It becomes so specific as, I think, being difficult. You kind of have to look at a particular shop and a particular product. I mean, some of them are things like let's take in an aligner, for example. It's hard to measure the idea that -- what the productivity return will be if I can have the aligner run by anybody in the shop as opposed to a specific aligner tech. And that's the kind of thing that happens. And also though, it happens faster and so on. So we have a number of those things, but they're very specific to the shop condition because as an example I just pointed out, if you have an aligner tech, a specific aligner tech and some shop have had them and you bring in the aligner, was one of our new aligners and anybody can do it while you can in fact, redeploy that aligner tech and you get great productivity. But if you're a shop that didn't use aligner techs and kind of muddle along without them, then it isn't quite as much a productivity improvement or as dramatic a productivity improvement. So it really depends on the particular situation. Now if you wanted to go to a garage and look at them, we could probably take you through the elements of that in the specific situation. I think that would be more effective.","Operator","We'll take a follow-up question from David Leiker's line.","Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co.

MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Operator","Good day, and welcome to the Snap-on Incorporated 2013 Third Quarter Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski. Please go ahead.","Leslie H. Kratcoski","Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's third quarter 2013 results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.","As usual, we have provided slides to supplement our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on our website next to the audio icon for this call. These slides will be archived on our website, along with a transcript of today's call.","Any statements made during the call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs, or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections, are forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filing.","With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start by covering some of the highlights of our third quarter, and I'll provide an update on the general environment and on the trends of our business. Aldo will then give a detailed review of the financials.","Our third quarter, it was encouraging. We again showed progress along our runways, both for growth and for improvement. Our sales were up 5.8% from last year, reflecting a 4.7% organic rise, as well as a $15.6 million increase related to Challenger Lifts, which you'll recall, earlier this year, was acquired for our undercar equipment portfolio. Our operating margin before financial services was 14.8%, up 130 basis points from the last year's 13.5%. When you add the $31.6 million in operating earnings from financial services, which was up from $27.9 million in 2012, the consolidated operating margin was 17.9%. And EPS was $1.43, also up from the $1.26 achieved last year.","From a broad perspective, our automotive repair related businesses continue to be well positioned. You can see that with another quarter of mid to high single digit gains in both the Tools Group and in the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group. For Commercial & Industrial or the C&I Group, where our major headwinds have been the most pronounced, the third quarter, it did offer some evidence of an improving environment.","Now military activity, which is being held back by troop withdrawals and budgetary constraints, did remain a substantial headwind. Outside of that isolated sector, we saw a generally better year-over-year comparisons throughout the remainder of C&I. Importantly, that's also true for our European hand tools business, SNA Europe. You remember that this is an area that's been a substantial headwind for quite some time. Well, in the third quarter, SNA Europe was down only slightly, a significant upgrade from the deeper downturns in past periods and encouraging evidence of possible stabilization in that region.","So I'd summarize the overall environment like this, the challenges of the military cutbacks continue, and of course, the situation in Washington creates a further overhang for the military. That's difficult to predict. But our areas of strength are holding firm, and the European contraction, one of our primary headwinds, appears to be abating. But economic environment notwithstanding, we believe that by focusing on 4 defined and decisive areas: enhancing the franchise network, expanding in the garage, building in emerging markets and extending into critical industries, we will continue to move down our runways for growth and maintain our long-term encouraging trend.","Paired with those growth drivers, we also have our Snap-on Value Creation processes: safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI. These are the tools we use each and every day to drive improvement and growth. I believe that this quarter's results demonstrate clearly the progress we're making in each of those dimensions.","Consider customer connection and innovation, Snap-on has again, in 2013, won 3 MOTOR Magazine Top 20 Tool Awards. This year's winners were our AC400 touchless wheel clamp that greatly limits rim damage; the VERUS PRO diagnostic unit, our top of the line handheld; and the new flip socket that incorporates an 8-millimeter and 10-millimeter socket all into one tool.","I've spoken about each of these products in the past, but I mentioned the award because this is just the latest accolade for the long list of what we call hip new products, those that sell more than $1 million in the first year. They drive excitement with our customers, and they author our growth. You see, Snap-on has unique customer connection advantage, over 4,800 vans calling on well over 1 million technicians worldwide and many more direct salespeople calling on thousands of critical workplace. And we translate that unique insight into winning innovation. And all of that, all of that worked for us in the third quarter.","With that backdrop, let's turn to the discussion of the segments. C&I's organic sales were down 0.9% from last year. Actually, that comparison is quite a bit better than the 5% to 6% declines we had in each period starting in the fourth quarter last year. What did remain consistent is the double digit decline in military activity. As I said, however -- said before, however, in the third quarter, SNA Europe's comparison got better and the other operations provided more offset. But again, this quarter, in spite of the declines -- overall decline in sales, operating income was up by $2.6 million or 120 basis points to $36 million, up 120 basis points despite the sales decline to 13.1% of sales. I believe the profit increase in the face of the overall sales drop is clear evidence that RCI is working well at C&I, in Commercial & Industrial.","Aside from the European and military activity that I've already mentioned, C&I also includes those businesses that are responsible for the lion's share of the growth initiatives, extending to critical industries and building in emerging markets of Asia Pacific, and we did see important progress. Related to Asia, we saw some nice increases. Our businesses in China and Korea and Thailand posted notable upward movement in the quarter. Both hand tools and undercar equipment made clear progress across the region, with the equipment activity confirming the capabilities of our recently opened undercar plant in Kunshan. Some of you have visited there.","In our industrial division, the extension into our critical natural resources sector provides -- has been providing favorable offset to the military declines, with much of that activity also spurring international growth. Our expanding offering of tools, brought together into specialized kits and paired with unique tool control solution, is building our presence in oil and gas operations on land and on sea in Mexico, in South America, in the Middle East and in the U.S., in multiple geographies.","Also related to critical industries, Snap-on's got a -- has a large and growing presence in technical schools all across America. You see, we believe that having future professionals trained with Snap-on products provides another important customer connection advantage. With continuing graduations and with new classes entering, the third quarter always provides important insight into our progress in the education sector, and we did see gains in this period. With our broadening certification programs, we partner with schools to develop curricula. The schools use our tools and equipment in their labs. We gain additional insight that helps guide our product innovation, and along the way we make the students customers for life, building a reservoir for sales as we go forward. That's C&I. That provides a bit of color on C&I.","Now on to the Tools Group. Organic sales were up 9.5% from last year, with the gains coming from all geographies. Operating income in the quarter was 41.9% compared to $40.2 million in the -- $41.9 million compared to $40.2 million in 2012. The operating margin was 12.6% compared with 13% last year, reflecting increased investment in focused activities that are enhancing our van network and driving that substantial growth. I'll remind you that even through the downturn of 2009, we made it a priority to strengthen the franchise channel, and we believe there's substantial evidence that we did just that.","The health metrics we monitor each period, whether it's franchisee profitability, turnover or delinquencies, are all broadly favorable. And certainly, the growth rates for this business over an extended period speak to abundant strength and to widening advantage. But beyond the numbers, beyond those numbers, there's observable qualitative evidence of forward momentum. Take this year's franchisee conference held in Nashville during August, it was even more successful. Now that's a barometer that indicates our franchisees are more positive than ever.","These conferences are part selling show, part training seminar and part pep rally, and the recent edition and -- at Nashville was the biggest and most enthusiastic yet. I'll also point out that the franchisees pay their own way to come, taking time away from their home and from their businesses. So in that context, the more than 10% rise in attendance speaks to the state of the business and the height of the network's confidence. I'll also tell you that our orders were up even more than the attendance. It's not only an indication of franchisee optimism, but it's also an endorsement of our innovative product offerings.","I often speak of the new products that enable sales, and that's certainly the case with our array of productivity-enhancing handheld diagnostic units. And that lineup we've had quite a string of hits, the SOLUS Ultra in 2011; the VERUS PRO in 2012; and this year, the ETHOS Plus; the MICROSCAN 3 and our new MODIS Ultra, all making the repair job easier and faster and driving van sales gains.","There's also a number of highly successful and creative marketing and customer connection initiatives driving our sales gain, most notably, related to the tools -- most notably, related to the tool storage units the -- our Rock 'N Roll Cab Express, traveling showrooms that have been a big part of higher sales, and we keep expanding our fleet of those game-changing selling aids. And I believe I mentioned last quarter, we've launched another marketing support vehicle, our techno van, bringing sophisticated diagnostic expertise and demonstrations right to the point of sale. We kicked that program off in the second quarter, and it kept right on expanding. Rock N' Roll cabs, techno vans, we're finding effective ways, very effective ways to enhance the power of the van network and the sales. They -- it's working.","Finally, related to the van channel, I'd be missing a huge competitor and a major strategic advantage if I didn't mention Snap-on Credit. Many of those innovative products, the largest ticket items, are financed. In that way, Snap-on Credit is a big growth enabler. And as you would expect, the credit operation had a strong presence at the franchisee conference in Nashville, providing effective training, teaching franchisees to wield credit more strongly, and making our finance activity an even greater strategic contributor. So that's tools.","Now to the RS&I Group. Total sales were up 13.7%, including a 6.7% organic increase and a $15.6 million increase from the Challenger Lift acquisition. The operating margin at 22.9% rose from 22.3% last year, another testimony to the power of RCI. If you want to talk about Snap-on value creation, rapid continuous improvement to customer connection to innovation, RS&I is a great example. RS&I is charged with expanding our presence with repair shop owners and managers, and there was broad expansion. We again had strong growth in our businesses providing repair and -- repair information and diagnostics to independents, and we appear to be gaining traction across many dimensions in automotive, medium and heavy duty -- in automotive, medium and in heavy duty garages, serving both those independent repair shops as well as OEM dealerships, all fueled by our expanding product line.","First I'll note that 2 of the MOTOR Top 20 winners were developed within RCI -- 4 of those shop customers. But when you're speaking of RS&I new products, there's much, much more. Let me give you a few highlights. Our new MODIS Ultra handheld, well targeted by customer connection, combining the fast operation and functionality of our highly successful SOLUS Ultra, but with added capabilities, such as a graphing meter and scope at an attractive price. It includes a larger touchscreen, a faster processor, expert information, an array of guided component tests and the battery charges while it's hooked up to the vehicle, a very, very popular feature. Early reception has been strong, and it looks like it's going to be a big hit.","New products are also fueling global expansion in RS&I. We're just launching our first handheld diagnostic unit for Brazil, the PDL 4000. We've done it by leveraging information from across RS&I. We've been able to localize -- by doing that, we've been able to localize vehicle information and cover the majority of the Brazilian car part. The result has been an effective unit available at an attractive price, and we expect it's going to help us build a bigger position in an emerging market. It's already doing some of that.","For the U.S. automotive shops, Mitchell 1 launched an update to our ProDemand repair information suite. It features a revised user dashboard that allows technicians and their customers easy access and better visibility to maintenance service schedules. It's an upgrade that will support improved shop productivity and profitability, and it will be popular.","A word about heavy-duty truck shops, where we continue to make good gains with our repair information. That's where we recently launched a new Pocket iQ light diagnostic software product. It's the must-have tool for the aftermarket, developed and ideally suited for truck shops performing preventive maintenance. It monitors essential engine signals, and it even has the capability to adjust some basic vehicle settings.","We've also seen some nice movement serving the automotive OEMs in their dealerships. Just in the past quarter, we expanded our electronic parts catalog capabilities and began wider relationships with large OEMs reaching beyond North America and Europe into several of today's emerging markets, a big breakthrough.","Finally, we just launched a new V3400 wheel aligner, developed using our customer connection and innovation processes, specifically designed for high-end independent and OEM garages. It includes wireless communication that provides flexibility and simplifies installation, has smaller and lighter targets, resulting in space and ease-of-use advantages. And it incorporates our award-winning touchless wheel clamp that eliminates wheel damage. We believe it represents another winning product for RS&I and equipment expansion. So there are a lot of activities, big and small. But all important to our gains in serving garage owners and managers, and you can see it in this quarter's results.","Well, that's the highlights of our third quarter. Organic sales up 4.7% despite the headwinds; the Challenger acquisition contributing well; progress along each of our runways for growth; and the Snap-on value creation driving us down our runway for improvement; OI margin up 130 basis points. It was an encouraging quarter.","Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?","Aldo J. Pagliari","Thanks, Nick, and good morning to all those on the call.","Our third quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $753.2 million in the quarter increased $41.6 million or 5.8% from 2012 levels. On an organic basis, sales increased 4.7%, excluding $15.6 million of sales from Challenger Lifts and an unfavorable $7.3 million impact from foreign currency translation. The year-over-year organic sales increase primarily reflects continued higher sales in the Snap-on Tools Group, along with increased sales of diagnostics and repair information products, as well as higher sales to OEM dealerships. These sales increases more than offset lower sales to the military and slightly lower sales in our European-based hand tool business.","Consolidated gross profit of $364.3 million increased $23.9 million from 2012 levels. Gross margin of 48.4% improved 60 basis points, largely due to savings from ongoing rapid continuous improvement, or RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $253 million increased $8.8 million, and the operating expense margin of 33.6% improved 70 basis points from 34.3% last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage, savings from ongoing RCI initiatives and lower restructuring costs. Total restructuring costs in the quarter of $1.7 million compared with $2.3 million last year.","As a result of these factors, operating earnings before financial services of $111.3 million in the quarter increased 15.7% and as a percentage of sales, improved 130 basis points to 14.8%. Operating earnings from financial services of $31.6 million increased 13.3% over prior year levels. Consolidated operating earnings of $142.9 million increased 15.1% over 2012 levels, and the operating margin of 17.9% improved 140 basis points from 16.5% a year ago.","Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 32.6% compares with 32.3% last year. We continue to expect that our full year 2013 effective tax rate will be comparable to our 2012 full year rate of 32.8%. Finally, net earnings in the quarter of $84.6 million or $1.43 per diluted share compared to net earnings of $74.1 million or $1.26 per share last year, representing a 13.5% year-over-year increase in diluted earnings per share.","Now let's turn to our segment results, starting with the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, on Slide 7. Sales of $275.2 million were down 0.9% organically from 2012 levels, primarily due to a double digit decline in sales to the military, coupled with a slight decline in sales in the segment's European-based hand tools business. As Nick mentioned, our C&I business in Europe is showing some signs of stabilization, which is encouraging.","Gross profit in the C&I Group totaled $104.8 million in the quarter. Gross margin of 38.1% improved 110 basis points from 37% last year, primarily due to savings from ongoing RCI initiatives, particularly in Europe. Operating expenses of $68.8 million in the quarter declined $1.5 million from prior year levels, primarily due to lower restructuring costs, and the operating expense margin of 25% improved slightly from 25.1% last year. As a result of these factors, third quarter operating earnings of $36 million for the C&I segment increased $2.6 million from 2012 levels, and the operating margin of 13.1% improved 120 basis points from 11.9% last year.","Turning now to Slide 8. Third quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $333.8 million increased 9.5% organically, reflecting increases across both our U.S. and international franchise operations. Gross profit of $142.8 million increased $11.5 million from 2012 levels, and the gross margin of 42.8% improved 30 basis points from 42.5% last year.","Operating expenses of $100.9 million in the quarter increased $9.8 million from 2012 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related and other expenses including focused investment in growth initiatives aimed at enhancing the franchise network. The operating expense margin of 30.2% increased 70 basis points from 29.5% last year. Accordingly, operating earnings of $41.9 million for the Snap-on Tools Group increased $1.7 million over prior year levels. The third quarter operating margin of 12.6% compared with 13% last year.","Turning to the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group, shown on Slide 9. Sales of $252.7 million increased 13.8% from 2012 levels, including $15.6 million of sales from the Challenger acquisition. Excluding the Challenger sales and $0.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation, organic sales in the quarter increased $14.9 million or 6.7%, primarily due to a double digit gain in sales of diagnostics and repair information products and a high single digit gain in sales to OEM dealerships.","Gross profit of $116.7 million in the quarter increased $11.3 million over prior year levels. Gross margin of 46.2% reflects a 130 basis point decrease from 2012 levels, primarily due to the impact of lower gross margin Challenger products, partially offset by continued savings from ongoing RCI initiatives.","Operating expenses totaled $58.8 million in the quarter, and the operating expense margin of 23.3% improved 190 basis points from 2012 levels, primarily due to contributions from sales volume leverage, including the impact of the sale of Challenger products that have a lower operating expense ratio and savings from ongoing RCI initiatives. Third quarter operating earnings of $57.9 million for the RS&I Group increased $8.4 million from prior year levels, and the operating margin of 22.9% increased 60 basis points from 22.3% last year.","Now turning to Slide 10. In the third quarter, earnings from financial services increased 13.3%, and originations of $205 million rose 14.2% year-over-year. Revenues in the quarter increased 11.4%, primarily due to continued growth of the financial services portfolio and higher average yields. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.4% in the quarter increased 30 basis points from 17.1% last year, and the average yield on contract receivables of 9.6% in the quarter increased 10 basis points from 2012 levels.","Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $1.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1 billion from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation and $182 million from our international finance subsidiaries. In the U.S., $813 million or approximately 80% of the financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Year-to-date, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew approximately $121 million. For the 2013 full year, we anticipate that the portfolio will increase by approximately $135 million over 2012 year-end levels. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.","Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $84.3 million in the quarter increased $14.6 million from $69.7 million last year. There were no discretionary contributions to our U.S. pension plan in the quarter as compared to last year, when we made a $16 million discretionary U.S. pension contribution. Investing activities in the quarter included cash used of $34.3 million support a net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $19.3 million in the quarter compared with capital expenditures of $19.7 million last year. We expect that full year capital expenditures will approximate $75 million.","Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 62 days compares to 61 days at 2012 year end. Excluding currency impacts, inventories increased $41.9 million from 2012 levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand with improved service levels, new product introductions and inventories related to the Challenger acquisition. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.7x compared with 3.9x at year end.","Our quarter end cash position of $182.5 million reflects the year-to-date net funding of $108.7 million of finance receivables, share repurchases of $67.5 million, dividend payments of $66.5 million, the acquisition of Challenger for $38.2 million and capital expenditures of $50.7 million. These uses of cash were largely offset by $270.1 million of cash generated from operations, including higher levels of net income. Our net debt to capital ratio of 28.6% compares to 29.7% at 2012 year-end.","In addition to our $182 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, including our recently concluded 5-year revolving credit facility. Our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper market should we choose to do so. At quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities.","This concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Thanks, Aldo. I would say the third quarter is more confirmation on the strength of our business model and on the opportunities available along our runways. Of course, there are headwinds. The military is turbulent, and Europe, though stabilizing, is not yet cured. But despite those challenges, our sales in the period were up 5.8%. We are moving down our runways for growth. Rock 'N Roll cabs and techno vans enhancing the van network, the Challenger acquisition and new diagnostic product reaching more shops, our success in oil and gas and in creating customers for life, our growing presence in places like China and Brazil, all of that is compelling testimony to our ongoing growth potential and to our progress in taking advantage of those abundant opportunities.","And we're also moving down our runway for improvement. C&I and SNA Europe, higher profitability despite lower sales. And the overall corporation and op co OI margin of 14.8%, up 130 basis points, clear evidence of Snap-on value creation and its ongoing benefits. We are encouraged by the third quarter results, achieved against challenge, but we believe that substantial opportunity remains and that our favorable trends and long-term progress will continue as we move forward.","Before I turn the call to questions, it's appropriate that I recognize those who made these results possible, our franchisees and associates. Once again -- I know many of you always listen to this call. I know you're listening today. For your extraordinary skill in driving our progress, you have my admiration. And for your extraordinary commitment and dedication to our team, you have my thanks.","Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from David Leiker with Baird.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","A couple of questions. I want to start with on the Snap-on Tools business, and it's nice to see the strong organic growth across all the businesses here in the quarter. I wanted to zero in on the SG&A number here. I mean I think, if I look at the numbers correctly, the SG&A as a percent of that segment sales have been falling or declining, and this is a change from that pattern. So are these the incremental initiatives of what you've been doing, just more of them or broadening them geographically? Can you help some color -- give us some color there?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Sure. Look, I think the thing is the principal activity here is the investments in the -- what we would broadly say, our actions which are breaking through the structural disadvantages of the van. One easy one to remember -- you'll all remember is the Rock 'N Roll cab. The van is constrained by size. You can only put a couple of tool storage boxes on them, therefore, the Rock 'N Roll cabs allow -- add more marketing space at the point of sale from time to time. It breaks through it. It drives more sales. We've gone up. I think the number that we have almost 50, over -- we were in the 40s last time and -- about 40 of them last quarter. So we've gone up quite a bit. In fact, we're in the 30s last time. So you see that. And then this time, we're launching the techno vans. Last time, I think we had 3 or 4 at the end of the quarter, now we have 10. And the techno vans are diagnostics, and there is quite a bit of training around this. Not only are the vans heavily facilitized because you have all of the equipment on the vans, which help you demonstrate the diagnostics to their fullest, but there's a lot of training associated with the van drivers themselves because you have to have guys on those vans that have to make the diagnostics sit up and do dog tricks. And then there are a number of other things in there this quarter, smaller items, which have helped us in that regard. And then I would offer the idea that the SFC was bigger and better than ever before, and we had 10% more, 10% more attendance. That 10% drives more expense. And in fact, we planned it to be bigger with more training and more selling and so on, and more sales space. And all of that rolls up to an investment. Actually, from our perspective, I'm very encouraged by this because what I view it as -- I would classify it in the old football saw as run to daylight. We've asked the Tools Group to -- when they see opportunity, to run to it, to the spend to take advantage of it, and that's what they've been doing. And it's been resulting pretty well. If you look at the Tools Group's numbers, David, over the last several quarters, the third quarters are like this. In 2010, they were up 10.5%. '11, they were up 6%, 11.1% last year, so this wasn't an easy comparison. They were up 9.5% again. So we're not so worried about the SG&A. We like the idea of spending to get those sales.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. That's useful. And then your tool business is up close to 10%, Stanley yesterday said that Mac Tools was up close to 10%. It's hard for you 2 players to be growing that -- take that much market share. So are these finding ways to get to more customers out there who haven't been accessed before? And I'm talking about the 2 of you combined here because the market just isn't growing that fast, is it?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I don't think so. I can't speak to their number. I think they said they were up high single digits. I don't know what the exact number was, so I am...","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","High single digits.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes, right. So I'm not sure exactly what the number is. There are a number of things that can flow through in terms of the different products that can be selling and the sources of those products that will result in driving Stanley sales, depending on how they come out on the Mac vans. The market is nice, but we're pretty sure that we are reaching more customers and selling more to the same customers. I can tell you that our van drivers are more excited about our proposition. I was just in Saratoga, New York, riding around on a van with Greg Dolan [ph] up there, and he was very enthusiastic about our products and its prospects. And his customers were positive about what he does for them. So we feel very good about both those engines driving the tools sales, reaching more people and also selling more to the same customers. That's what's happening in both of these places. And part of it is productivity giving the van driver more time to sell, reaching more customers; and two, breaking through some of the structural disadvantages like space and technical expertise that can only -- that one man can only have so much technical expertise on the van, and that's been driving this increase.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then one last item on the C&I segment, on the military. Q4 -- I know your business had been declining already last year going into Q4, but the fourth quarter was the first big decline. So anniversary-ing around that, is there a way you can characterize your Q3 military volumes versus what they were in Q4 of last year? Is that flattening out? Are we still seeing declines? And I know overall, it's a small piece.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I hate to comment on any kind of trajectory around the military given the turbulence in Washington these days. Who knows where it's going. I mean, look, we had a -- the fourth quarter has always been our biggest quarter. We took a big shot in that, the fourth quarter last year. I had said that we're going to see -- I know I said on these calls that we're going to have probably lighter comparisons going forward. Yes, but the atmosphere gets -- got worse and worse, and so we've been seeing some big headwinds -- maybe not as big as the fourth quarter, but some big headwinds in the third quarter as well, third quarter of this year, not as big as the fourth quarter last year, but still pretty significant that's moving the needle.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","I've got a question on the Tools Group with the solid growth there. Could you maybe categorize or break that out between U.S. -- and I guess, it's -- U.K. is where you have the franchise business. Was a lot of this the U.K. snapping back more strongly than...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","No. Yes, go ahead. Finish your question.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","No, go ahead. That's fine.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Look, if you look at it broadly, if you look at it broadly, international, U.S., kind of the same, Gary, kind of the same. If you landscape the international business -- as you know, for the Tools Group like Canada, U.K., Australia and so on, we had some goes-ins and goes-outs. The U.K. was up nicely as well. In fact, our overall business, if you roll it all together, one of the things we're kind of happy about in terms of our -- one of the things that's positive -- we're happy about is the U.K. actually did snap back, but it's not driving -- our overall business in the U.K., including SNA Europe and the Tools Group and other businesses that sell in the U.K., are up double digits. But for the Tools Group, it's not driving that -- not influencing that 9.5%, not influencing it. It's in that ballpark.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","In terms of -- could you maybe talk about or give us some metrics surrounding growth in the emerging markets, and what percentage of your sales that is now?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Look, it's north of 10% now, I'd say in low double digits, you'd say, now. And every quarter, you get kind of -- because you're spread over lots of emerging markets, you get kind of goes-in and goes-outs. We had -- as I said, I think, in the script, we had a good quarter in China, good quarter in China, nice quarter in Thailand, good one in Korea. We had a fine quarter in Brazil. Some of the others were weaker. For example, the Philippines was weak for us this year. But in general, we're at 11% -- not 11%, but it's the low single digits and we're growing.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then could you just remind me, Aldo, the finance receivables versus contract receivables, what's the difference there?","Aldo J. Pagliari","A finance receivable, Gary, is when Snap-on Credit finances an end customer who is a customer of the franchisees, so in other words, a technician, a mechanic out on the shop floor. A contract receivable is when Snap-on directly finances a garage shop owner or a franchisee themselves. So the receivable is directly between Snap-on and the party versus a third party.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Richard Hilgert with Morningstar.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Congratulations on the award during the quarter to MOTOR Magazine. That was good accomplishment, but something that -- obviously with the technology is something that isn't out of the realm of possibilities. I wanted to ask about the restructuring costs. Was any of that in the Tools segment? Or was all of it in the C&I segment?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Very little actually in this quarter.","Aldo J. Pagliari","I'd say it's -- Roger (sic) [Richard], Aldo here. It was a little bit in the RS&I segment actually and then the Commercial & Industrial Group. There was a smidgen, so to speak, in the Tools Group.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","So this wasn't really a big restructuring quarter for us.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Right. It was $1.7 million, you said?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Right.","Aldo J. Pagliari","That's correct. Overall, it was $1.7 million as compared to $2.3 million for the corporation last year.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","All right, okay. With the shutdown that we just experienced in the government, will there be any impact from that in any kind of government contracts that you might have in the fourth quarter?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, I don't know. I mean the thing is, is that I think you can speculate yourself. First of all, we usually -- we don't give guidance or anything like that, but look, we have a military business. I would say anybody who's got direct business with the government would be wondering whether it would be effect going forward. But they did solve the problem now, so whether that plays out quickly enough to eliminate any overhang, I'm not so sure. What I would say though is that through the quarters we've had, we've seen an overhang from sequestration in the military business and the government business, and it's hard to predict whether that will get positive -- whether that will get more negative as we go forward. I would suppose, if this is not solved and they don't snap back quickly, it could get more negative. But I think that's very shaky, shaky to predict. We've been dealing with a kind of difficulty in that area for some time.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. One last question. The inner segment eliminations for revenues went up quite a bit this quarter. Just curious what was the activity there that drove that?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, it tends to revolve around the SFC, the Snap-on Franchisee Conference, where you bring all these guys together, the franchise -- remember, I said it's part selling show. They order, some of those sales get in the quarter. And what that means is some of the other segments, for example, the diagnostics groups or the C&I Group will provide products, they provide products to the Tools Group, and that tends to ramp up during this period. And that's what you're seeing in here.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Liam Burke with Janney Capital Markets.","Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Nick, you talked about emerging markets in the C&I business picking up some of the slack, where you had other areas of weakness. Is it the same end markets? Is it oil and gas in emerging markets? Or is it some other critical industry?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","No, no. It's broad, broad. And when we say emerging markets, we really mean the whole Shamil [ph], like automotive, automotive repair. We would call automotive repair, by the way, a critical industry. It's just that it's not handled within our standard definition. There is criticality around automotive repair. But it's automotive repair, oil and gas, aviation, in some cases, the military -- foreign military and power generation. So it's broadly based.","Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And you had a lot of new product releases around the diagnostics. Those products are typically smaller. Are you generating similar margins to the -- to what your traditional diagnostic product line?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes, yes. I don't think -- look, I think the products we mentioned, which are handheld diagnostics and for heavy truck and for automotive, there isn't much margin difference between those 2 segments, I would say. So if you're talking about like products reaching into different segments like diagnostics or software, they're pretty much the same types of margins. The margin variation in the RS&I Group comes from the sort of essential tool businesses that we sell to OEM dealerships, that can be a little smaller, and the undercar equipment businesses, which can -- are hardware-based and tend to attract lower margins than, say, the software businesses. But in general, there's no implied motion period-to-period, quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year by those. That we have talked about today.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Nick, you were asked earlier about the sequestration on military and the government shutdown on military. I guess, I wanted to approach that question a little bit differently and just see if you saw any slowdown in channel velocity through your franchisees in the second half of September.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, we usually don't comment on month by month, but I will offer this. When I go out -- and like I said, I was just on a van up in upstate New York, I was just with the national franchise conference -- our franchise advisory council last weekend. And as -- they represent -- there's franchisees, there's 12 of them, they represent every region of our country. I saw nothing but optimism. So my suggestion about the effects of this uncertainty broadly described around the shutdown and the debt ceiling and the sequestration, I believe is not weighing as heavily on smaller businesses that we're seeing, that are -- remember, we're operating in criticality. So the small businesses operating in criticality, whether you're talking about technicians or franchisees or repair shop owners, they seem to be anesthetized to the bad news. As I move up in size the businesses, they seem to be more burdened by the uncertainty. The bigger businesses, the more uncertain they are. And then, of course, anybody who's dealing directly with the business, like our military business, of course, that business gets shut down a little bit. So that's what we're seeing. If you talk about the effects of sequestration and the shutdown of the government and the debt ceiling and the whole idea that this is going to come up again in February and all this news, sure, this is something we watch, but we are not wringing our hands over it.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. You were asked earlier as well about the emerging markets. I just want to go back and pick up on that. If you could just talk about the profitability of the emerging markets business and how's that changing.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","The emerging -- look, if you look at -- it's a -- the emerging market business is about as profitable as the rest of the businesses. Let's say, in C&I, emerging market is a big piece of our business -- a big piece of our emerging market business in C&I. It's about as profitable as that business. It's about as profitable as the businesses reflected in the segment for those product lines. The geography of the profitability is different, lower gross margin, lower SG&A or lower operating expense usually. And then we can parse that there's a pre-investment on top of it that tends to put a little bit of drag on it, and that investment keeps going as we keep expanding. But if you look at the business as it occurs transaction by transaction, you say, this is just as profitable as all the rest of our businesses. So we're very encouraged by that.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. On Europe, can you -- on Europe, you've -- I think you've talked in the past, it's roughly about 1\/3 of that C&I segment, right?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Say that again, I didn't quite catch it.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","I'm sorry. The European business, we think of that as being...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","About 1\/3, yes.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","About 1\/3 of the C&I business. So I guess, the question is, it sounds like it's stabilizing, that's encouraging. When that business comes back and you get a little further down the road, you're running at close to full capacity, what can the European business generate in terms of margins? What would you think of as peak margin capability for that business?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, actually, I don't think we've ever spoken to the margins of the European business in isolation. But certainly, you will be entitled to the fact that we know these -- we've said these things. The European business was down drastically. It was wounded. We have pushed on it and pulled on it and worked RCI on it over the years. Remember, it really never -- it came out of the recession briefly in 2010, then sort of dipped back in, at the end of 2011, went back to double digit reductions and kept going. But through that period, we were working RCI, but we were very careful to, say, one, we didn't see our customers disappear; two, we didn't actually take out capacity. We kept capacity there because we're confident the business comes back, and what that means is we have lowered breakeven. And I would suggest to you that the idea that it is more profitable on even lower sales is good arithmetic and quantitative testimony to the fact that works pretty well. When volume comes back and they start to see some good numbers, it will accrue relatively well to the bottom line like any of our businesses, I believe. And what's happening in Europe actually is kind of interesting. Northern Europe has come back. We're -- particularly England, double digit growth for our businesses overall in England. Very good in the north, Sweden, Norway up very well. The middle countries like Germany and France, France still down, but narrowed a little bit. And then the periphery contributing, like the Maghreb countries and Turkey and so on contributing well. So you still see that Europe is not yet cured, but it's stabilizing in the middle, and the north actually seems to -- at least in this quarter, seems to have turned a little bit of a corner. That accrues well for us based on where our cost structure is.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","So what you're saying is, essentially because of the lower breakeven, you think, as volume comes back, your margins will recover faster there than they would elsewhere in the business?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I think you'd be in -- I think you'd be entitled to that assertion, yes -- to that thought, yes.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. That's good. Last question. Just you talked about the OEM dealerships being a bigger part of your business, can you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of business trends there? Are the OEM dealerships likely to be a stronger part of your business going forward? And what are the implications for your RS&I mix?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","No, actually, I -- correct me -- let me come back. The OEM dealerships, our business with the OEM dealerships, electronic parts catalogs and this essential tools business were up -- I think I said were up strongly in the quarter. But our sales to independents -- Mitchell 1, the software business, the diagnostics business, these are software-based businesses that take advantage of our reservoir of data about the independent -- the car part that independents need so badly, those were up strong double digits. And so actually, I wouldn't say our business is changing. It was growing in the OEMs, but it also grew in the independents. So I wouldn't say the mix changed this quarter, just both moved for us.","Operator","And at this time, there are no other questions in queue.

Kratcoski","Thanks, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's first quarter 2012 results which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. ","We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick-off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions. ","As usual, we have provided slides to supplement our discussions.

Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements.

","With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. I'll start off as usual with the highlights of the quarter and with my perspective on the results and on the overall business. Then I'll turn the call over to Aldo for a detailed review of the financials. ","Our first quarter was another period of encouraging progress. Once again, it showed that the Snap-on Value Creation Processes are enabling improvements just as they been doing for some time in a variety of macroeconomic environments. I think you could say that these past few years sure have been marked by a very dynamic environment. And yet, our discipline around safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI has driven momentum in good times and in bad. ","Speaking of momentum, our first quarter reflects continuing gains in the majority of our markets, and it represents another period of favorable operating margin comparisons. Organic sales increased 7% from last year. The OpCo operating margin of 13.3% was up 70 basis points, while FinCo contributed $23.9 million of operating income, a substantial increase from $12.5 million a year ago. The end result is an EPS of $1.21, a rise of 26% from the first quarter of 2011. ","Now the primary feature in the past quarter was the volume. Widespread, strong gains across the majority of our business and the Tools Group serving automotive technicians and the Commercial & Industrial group or C&I serving emerging markets of Asia, as well as professionals in critical industries through our industrial division. And in diagnostics and software sales through our Repair Systems & Information group or RS&I, which focuses on serving repair shop owners and managers. All of those areas had solid gains. ","If you recall that we identified 4 key strategic runways for our growth, areas that we believe will be decisive for our future, building in emerging markets, extending into critical industries, enhancing our franchise network and expanding in the garage. We believe this quarter's performance represent ample evidence of significant progress in each of these areas.","Importantly, I think, our overall 7% volume gain and improved profitability was achieved even in the face of a turbulent Europe, a headwind that strengthened since the last quarter. ","Just like in the past quarters, our overall environment is favorable, but Europe is a clear challenge. Our volumes in Western Europe and Western European markets were down mid-single digits. You can see that impact most notably in the results of C&I, but it's also evident in the volumes of RS&I where we have a sizable European presence in our undercar equipment business. ","The real story in the quarter though is that we were, once again, able to overcome the challenges and still grow robustly. So overall, we continued our progress, gaining in those areas we've identified as being decisive for our growth. ","Now on to the highlights of some of the segments. C&I group organic sales were up 6.4%. So in spite of Europe, our overall C&I sales gain was actually more than we posted in the previous 3 quarters. ","I mentioned the strong gains in both Asia and our industrial business, 2 of those strategic runways for growth, while both of those businesses were up double digits. ","Related to Europe, I'll remind you that we have particularly large and higher-margin position in the South, especially in Spain. And that regions been even harder hit than the rest of the continent, so that certainly amplifies the European impact for the group. Operating margins in C&I was 10.2% compared to 11.6% last year. Now in those numbers, we did incur $3.5 million and restructuring charges related to Europe. Given the situation, we're making adjustments to the cost structure to better match the environment. These actions brought C&I margin down by 120 basis points. ","In our industrial business, where we serve serious professionals in critical industries, we're pursuing a number of initiatives to drive continued growth. For example, we're expanding our presence in technical schools, a growing number of which offer Snap-on's certification programs for industries such as aviation, vehicle repair and wind industry. And covering a range of specialties like torque and diesel and diagnostics and tool control. Those programs are -- we found are a great way to get the Snap-on brand introduced to the new professionals who will inhabit the critical industries of are our future. The schools are equipped with our products. We train the teachers, and the students learn their profession with Snap-on products front and center. We believe that's a great way to build what we call customers for life and it's working. ","Our efforts in extending in the critical industries can be seen in our annual industrial sales kick off, hundreds of direct sales associates join that event and instead of focusing on products, we focused on serving specific customers: Aerospace, natural resources, the military. The main theme was customer connection, how to make work easier for particular professionals and specific industries and the participants left better equipped to drive our sales growth down that critical run -- down those crucial runways and that's been working. ","Now I'll mention emerging markets. The bulk of that activity for Snap-on also shows in the C&I group. Sales in Asia were encouraging with double-digit growth coming across many of our major markets. Now China, of course, is our biggest opportunity, and we grew well ahead of GDP. But we saw an even greater increase in places like Indonesia and India. And that growth is being aided by our expanding product lines and hand tools from our Zhoushan factory and undercar equipment, hand held diagnostics and band saws, all from our Kunshan complex, where we've been expanding our capacity and launching new products, aimed specifically at Asian customers and that's working. ","Outside of Asia, we're also making progress in other emerging markets. Our expansion in Belarus has been a key to gaining presence in Eastern Europe. That operation has been critical to growing our position in both in Eastern Europe, where SNA Europe actually saw solid gains in places like Russia and Turkey, as well as in the U.S. In fact, our Bahco band saw line continues to be robust, selling well in most regions of the world. ","One final comment I'll make on C&I is related to innovation. SNA Europe and specifically the Bahco brand has long been known for its innovation and quality in serving professionals. In fact, Bahco recently celebrated 125 years of prominence in the professional segment. That reputation was, once again, reinforced this past quarter when Bahco earned 2 prestigious 2012 Red Dot Design awards. The winning new products were entries in our ergo line, a line that differentiates itself by clear advancement in professional grade ergonomics. Those awards generate product excitement and exposure, and our strong endorsement of our brand and of our continuing innovation and of the progress we're making in spite of the challenges that are present all around Europe. ","Moving to the Tools Group, another strong performance. A sales increase of over 12%. It represents another highlight of the quarter. The operating margin of 14.6% was up from 13.2% a year ago. Now, last year's comparison did include nearly $3 million in restructuring charges, but even excluding that effect, there was a 50 basis point increase and this quarter's absolute margin of 14.6% certainly exceeds most of the historical comparisons. ","You might remember, we made it a priority to enhance and strengthen our franchise channel, even while we're in the midst of a recession. And more recently, we were aiming Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI efforts toward increased efficiency, creating more selling time for our franchisees. ","Now the results of all those efforts appear clear. Organic sales in the first quarter were more than 15% above our prerecession levels. Speaking of the franchisees, overall, the network is strong. And it's evident in the trends we track. Franchisee sales and profits continue to rise, credit delinquencies remain at historically low rates and our turnovers are down. To look beyond the franchisees, we see solid indicators on the health of our end customers, the repair technicians, activity with big-ticket items like hand held diagnostics and tool storage remain at the solid levels, as you would expect given the growth rates we've been recording for several quarters now. ","And the strength, the core of our franchise network, the Snap-on brand is now being recognized even more broadly. The results from this year's franchise business review satisfaction survey were announced in February. Snap-on moved up 8 spots from last year to #23 among all large franchise systems. The importance of this ranking is that it's based on the opinions of our franchisees themselves on issues like training and support and operation and financial opportunity. And in February, Snap-on was also cited by Forbes magazine in its ranking of best franchisees to start for the buck, and that article, Snap-on was rated #1 of all franchisees. More confirmation of the growing strength of our system. ","The results are also reinforced what we hear regularly when we speak to our franchisees face-to-face. I characterized their outlook as almost uniformly quite positive, both for the company in general and for their individual businesses in particular. ","Now we're for Snap-on credit. I said it in the past, it's -- but I think it's worth repeating. Our wholly-owned finance company has been a real advantage. Just this week, there's been news relating to the difficulties of securing financing for small businesses in general and for franchises specifically. While our franchisees clearly benefit from their ability to access valuable financing for themselves and for their customers, the credit company is a strategic advantage for Snap-on, and as you can see, evidenced in the first quarter results, it's financially attractive. ","Now let's move to the RS&I group, where we serve repair shop owners and managers with diagnostics repair and shock management information and undercar equipment. The overall organic growth gained for the group -- the overall organic sales gain for the group was a modest 1%. Similar to the C&I group though, some fairly strong sales performances were muted by the impact of European weakness. Our large undercar equipment business on that continent was down in the quarter. ","Outside of the Europe impact, the gains across the operations in the group were up mid-single digits. The operating margin for RS&I was 21.5%, up from 18.9% last year and the highest we seen in the group. It reflects progress in our RCI initiatives, as well as favorable effects of solid growth in higher-margin categories of diagnostics and information products. ","We are worried about those high-margin products. Our hand held diagnostics software sales reached an all-time quarterly high, driven by our new release. This update includes expanded vehicle coverage, along with the new functional tests and reprogramming features and the numbers show it was well-received. ","Our diagnostics business also received recognition for innovation when the readers of Undercar Digest voted 2 of our hand held diagnostic units: The SOLUS Ultra and the VERDICT, as 2012 top 10 tools. This marked the second year in a row that Snap-on has had the only diagnostic units included in that publications award roster. That recognition not only is a testimony to our position as leader in the space, but inclusion of diagnostic units in the top 10 also provides significant evidence of the increasing importance of a handheld unit in undercar work and repairing breaks, wheels and chassis. With our strong position in that segment, this is a favorable trend for Snap-on. ","We also saw strong sales gains driven by product innovation in our repair and shop management information business, Mitchell 1. Mitchell 1 is our repair shop management information business in the RS&I group. We're seeing the benefits in that area from the investments we made over the past several years. We strengthened our offering for repair shop owners and managers with automotive-related products, with new heavy-duty truck applications and with new features like our customer retention programs that assist shop owners to better market to old and new customers. The high single-digit growth that Mitchell 1 during the quarter is evidence of that expanded credit. ","Our repair information position will take another step forward this month when Mitchell 1 launches our new pro demand software. It enhances technician productivity by improving the speed and accuracy of search capabilities, as well as the navigation to other online information like wiring diagrams, technical service bulletins and schedule maintenance data. ","With ProDemand, we're basically expanding the vocabulary of the system, harmonizing terminology across OEM badges, making it better able -- making the system better able to decipher what the technician needs and taking him to the solution faster. We've been trying the product with a broad base of technicians, and the initial reaction has been very positive.","One more highlight related to RS&I. I already mentioned that our equipment business in Europe is fairly large, and the impact is evident in the overall growth rate for RS&I. We are, however, making great progress in emerging markets like Brazil and the Middle East, with the equipment business, where saw solid double-digit gains of undercar equipment. We launched a number of new products for those markets over the past several years, and we're seeing them pay off. ","While that's the highlights. OpCo, operating margin expansion and FinCo continuing on-track with increased profits, a 7% organic growth, significant progress along our strategic runways even in the face of a difficult environment in Europe. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for a financial review. Aldo?","Aldo J. Pagliari","Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales in the first quarter of $735.2 million increased $41.5 million or 6% year-over-year. Excluding foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 7%, led by double-digit growth in Snap-on tools and across the majority of our businesses serving customers in emerging markets in critical industries. ","Consolidated gross profit of $347.7 million in the quarter increased $17.1 million from 2011 levels. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 47.3% was down slightly from 47.7% last year, primarily due to continued margin pressure in our European-based hand tools business, partially offset by contributions from RCI initiatives and $2.1 million at lower restructuring costs. ","Operating expenses in the quarter of $250.2 million were up $6.9 million from 2011 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 34% in the quarter improved 110 basis points from 35.1% last year, largely due to benefits from sales volume leverage in savings from RCI and restructuring initiatives. These improvements were partially offset by a higher stock-based mark-to-market and performance-based incentive compensation expense and $3.1 million of higher restructuring cost. ","Operating earnings before Financial Services of $97.5 million in the quarter increased $10.2 million or 11.7% from 2011 levels. And as a percentage of sales, improved 70 basis points to 13.3%. Operating earnings from Financial Services of $23.9 million in the quarter increased $11.4 million from 2011 levels, reflecting the continued growth of our on-book finance portfolio. Consolidated operating earnings of $121.4 million in the quarter increased 21.6%, and as a percentage of revenues, improve 180 basis points to 15.7% from 13.9% a year ago. Finally, net earnings of $71 million or $1.21 per diluted share in the quarter increased $14.8 million or 26.3% from last year's levels. ","Now, let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & Industrial or C&I group on Slide 7, sales of $286.5 million for the first quarter were up 6.4% organically from 2011 levels, primarily as a result of double digit sales increases across the majority of our businesses serving customers in emerging markets and critical industries. These increases were partially offset by a mid-single digit sales decline in our European-based hand tools business, particularly as a result of further weakness in Southern Europe. ","Gross profit of $102 million in the quarter decreased $1.6 million from 2011 levels, primarily due to continued margin pressure in our European-based hand tools business, partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. As a result, gross margin of 35.6% in the quarter compared with 38% last year. ","Operating expenses of $72.8 million in the quarter were up slightly from 2011 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 25.4% improved 100 basis points from 2011, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage, partially offset by $3.4 million of higher restructuring cost, primarily to improve the segment's cost structure in Europe. As a result of these factors, first quarter operating earnings of $29.2 million for the C&I segment declined $2.4 million or 7.6% from 2011 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margin of 10.2% compared with 11.6% last year. ","Turning now to Slide 8. First quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools group of $316.6 million, improved $34.6 million or 12.3%, largely due to continued higher sales in the United States. Gross profit of $139 million increased $14.1 million from 2011 levels, and as a percentage of sales, was 43.9% compared to 44.3% last year. ","Gross margin last year benefited from favorable manufacturing utilization associated with the anticipated consolidation of the company's North American tools storage operations. Operating expenses of $92.9 million in the quarter increased $5.1 million from 2011 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 29.3% improved 180 basis points, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage. ","First quarter operating earnings of $46.1 million for the Snap-on Tools Group increased $9 million or 24.3% year-over-year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 14.6% compared with 13.2% a year ago. ","Restructuring costs in the quarter were $2.6 million lower than last year. Excluding the effect of restructuring expense in both periods, operating income margin improved 50 basis points year-over-year. ","Turning now to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I group shown on Slide 9. First quarter sales of $226.1 million increased 1% organically. As of mid-single digit sales gain of diagnostics and Mitchell 1 repair information products, primarily the independent repair shop owners and managers and a low single digit sales gain to OEM dealerships were partially offset by the lower sales of undercar equipment in Europe that Nick discussed in his remarks. ","Gross profit of $106.7 million in the quarter increased $4.6 million from prior year levels. Gross margin of 47.2% in the quarter improved 220 basis points from 45% last year, primarily due to a more favorable sales mix, reflecting higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products, including the SOLUS Ultra mentioned earlier. Gross profit also benefited from savings associated with ongoing RCI initiatives. ","Operating expenses of $58.1 million in the quarter decreased $1.2 million from 2011 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 25.7% improved 40 basis points from 26.1% last year, principally due to savings from RCI initiatives and benefits from sales volume leverage. ","Operating earnings of $48.6 million for the RS&I group increased $5.8 million or 13.6%, and as a percentage of sales, improved 260 basis points to 21.5%. ","Now turning to Slide 10. First quarter earnings from Financial Services of $23.9 million increased $11.4 million from prior year levels, primarily due to a continued growth in our on-book finance portfolio. Originations of $156.3 million in the quarter rose 7.3%, reflecting both higher sales in our Snap-on Tools segment and increased participation in our credit programs. ","Moving to Slide 11. As the first quarter end, our balance sheet includes $968 million of gross financing receivables, including $813 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation and $155 million from our international finance subsidiaries. ","In the United States, $660 million or 81% of the financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Since 2011 year end, our on-book financing portfolio has grown approximately $33 million. The pace of the portfolio's growth has continued as expected and is naturally decelerating as the transition of the CIT owned portfolio nears completion. In 2012, we continue to anticipate that the gross on-book portfolio will increase by approximately $125 million over 2011 year-end levels. Regarding finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. ","Now turning to Slide 12. Consolidated operating cash flow for the quarter was $65 million. This includes the decrease in accruals and other liabilities, comprised primarily of incentive compensation-related payments made during the quarter and the effect of a $25 million cash contribution to our U.S. pension plans, which included an $18.3 million required 2012 contribution and a $6.7 million discretionary contribution. In 2012, we also intend to make required contributions of $12.6 million to our foreign pension plans and, depending on market and other conditions, may make additional discretionary cash contributions to our U.S. plans. As expected, free cash flow from Financial Services was a negative $35.1 million in the quarter, reflecting the continued funding of new loan originations at Snap-on Credit. The operating company generated positive free cash flow of $48.9 million in the quarter, representing a $46 million increase over the prior year. Capital expenditures of $21.8 million in the quarter included continued investments particularly in the United States and new product efficiency, safety and cost-reduction initiatives, as well as investments in new production and machine tooling. Capital expenditures also included continued spending to support our strategic growth initiatives including the expansion of manufacturing capabilities in emerging growth markets. ","As seen on Slide 13, day sales outstanding for trade receivables of 58 days was unchanged from 2011 year-end levels. Inventories increased $9.4 million from 2011 year-end levels, excluding currency translation, inventories increased $4.1 million, primarily to support higher customer demand in the U.S. ","On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory trends of 4x compared to 4.2x at 2011 year end. Our quarter end cash position of $162 million decreased $24 million from 2011 year-end levels, primarily due to the funding of new loan originations by Snap-on Credit, the previously discussed U.S. pension contribution, share repurchases of $29.9 million and dividend payments of $20.1 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash generated from operations. ","Our net debt-to-cap ratio of 33.8% compares to 34.3% at 2011 year end. In addition to our $162 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper market should we choose to do so. ","As of first quarter year end, our first quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities. ","This concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. Now I will briefly comment on a few outlook items. ","We continue to anticipate that capital expenditures in 2012 will be in the range of $60 million to $70 million. Restructuring expenses in the second quarter of 2012 are expected to approximate $8 million, including the settlement of a pension plan related to the 2011 closure of the company's Newmarket, Canada facility. Finally, we also anticipated that our full year 2012 effective income tax rate will approximate 33.5%. ","I'll now turn the call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Thanks, Aldo. Well, that's our quarter. An encouraging period, strong volume growth, continuing credit company ramp up and more progress in driving increased profitability, and all of that was achieved in the face of European headwinds. We believe the quarter's performance represents, clear confirmation that our decisive runways for growth are wide and that we are advancing forward. The van network is being enhanced. Sales were up more than 12%, and franchisee health metrics are the best we've seen. ","We are extending to critical industries. Our industrial division grew by double digits again. We are expanding with repair shops owners and managers. Our Diagnostics and Mitchell businesses grew nicely, and we are building an emerging market strong double digit again in places like China, India, Indonesia and Russia. The progress along each of these runways made our quarter and overcame imperfect economies. ","Going forward, we believe we're well-positioned. We have momentum. And we will take advantage, full advantage, of the abundant opportunities that stretch out before us. ","Before I close again this quarter, I think it's appropriate that I recognize the essential role of our franchisees -- that our franchisees and associates have played in our performance. I know many of you are listening, and I also know that this quarter's result is a direct result, is a direct reflection of your contribution. For your energy, for your support and for your commitment to this team, you have my thanks, and you have my congratulations. ","Now I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from David Leiker with Robert W. Baird.","Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","This is Joe on the line for David. I think the most obvious surprise and it's a great quarter with the Tools Group growing 12%. Several straight quarters now that group has been putting up double-digit results. I'm just wondering if you can point to anything specific that might be driving that, because it's obviously well in advance of what some of your public peers are reporting for growth in their businesses.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, I think there's a couple of factors. One is that, as I've said, we kept investing during the downturn. We said that. We invested in the health of our franchisees, and they didn't take a step back during the downturn. They, in fact, got better and stronger. And I think coming out of that, we came out of the downturn with relative to others a strong, strong network. That's one. Two, we've been investing in innovation. If you've ever been here, you see the innovation works and you see the products were rolling out so they have attractive products. And then finally, as I said in my remarks, we've been spending time working on RCI in terms of Rapid Continuous Improvement and expanding the selling time. Only a -- not all of their day is spent on selling. And so this is a productivity opportunity for us, and we're working on that. I've said many times on the call, I think our call and then analyst meetings one-on-one that fully enabled our advance call on, maybe 800,000 technicians or 850,000 technicians and there are 1.3 million technicians in the United States. This is a product -- and they don't call on them because they're less target rich. This is a productivity opportunity. What you're seeing here is in effect that given our people more time to sell, more productivity advancements and, therefore, able to call on broader range of customers. And so you see those 3 effects: New products, stronger health and better productivity. And that's what's generating these double-digit gains.","Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So with the van count pretty much stable productivity has helped you increase coverage, is there an indication of how much more you can pull that lever to further revenue increases?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","This is -- you're right. This is same-store sales. It's a great -- it's an encouraging look. I don't want to speculate on that. I mean, I said that the numbers -- but the numbers -- when we had a first couple of quarters like this, I said, well, one quarter a trend does not make. But now the Tools Group has been putting together some pretty good quarters. I think their organic growth have been stuff like 9, 10 and 6 and 9 and 12, so they've been doing pretty well. So we think this has got some runway.","Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","The new trend is double-digits?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","But I -- but, no, I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't use -- I wouldn't say --","Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Of course, yes.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","-- it is double-digit, of course. But I think we feel very good about the position the Tools Group is in. So without making any projection, I stick to my projection which says, we are looking to grow as a company at 4% to 6% organically, right, every quarter. And the Tools Group is a component of that.","Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Sure. And then just on the C&I business, I think this is the first quarter that the military side of that business is in a headwind, and I'm just wondering with the organic growth going from 4.5%, 5% and now it's up about 6%, would 6% be a more sustainable pace of growth in that business if [indiscernible]","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Look, sure, we said that our growth range would be 4% to 6% organically, and we said that C&I would be toward the top end of that. And so this kind of lines right up with that, it's a little bit better than that actually. And you're right in saying that this military was not a headwind this time, but this is the critical -- military is part of the critical industry, the critical industry's piece of this business. And so you have -- and that's concentrated in our industrial division. And if you go back to our last call, you'll see this is the second quarter in a row, which the industrial business has been registering double-digit growth, which we view as confirmation of our assertion that we have runway in these critical industries. And so we think that the C&I group will be helped by that.","Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just one last one for me for Aldo. Can you say what the delinquency rates have been running at with portfolio?","Aldo J. Pagliari","Well, the delinquency rates are published on Chart 11. If what you're suggesting is the all-in bad debt rate that we sometimes talked to, again, it remains a favorable trend with these delinquency rates.","Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So like around 3%?","Aldo J. Pagliari","About 3.3%.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jim Lucas from Janney Capital Markets.","James C. Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","A couple of things here. You've given a lot of good color, not just this quarter but over the past several quarters about the runways and how they continue to widen. Wanted to just delve a little bit into the Tools Group. In the past, you've talked a little bit about the makeup of bigger ticket items and demand there. And just curious what you're seeing in terms of the purchasing patterns of your customers if it's more toward the handheld, the software upgrades, the toolboxes or is it just really just the day-to-day?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Actually, it's the mix by product. If you characterize it, let's say, big ticket tool storage, the big boxes and the big size diagnostics and so on all the way down to hand tools and so on, that mix hasn't changed for several quarters. It's been -- we use -- the big ticket have been reasonably strong and robust in those mixes, and they haven't really gone down or up within reasonable, what I would say, quarterly windage. And so I don't think we -- you'd see any trend inside there whatsoever. You could -- you see sometimes in the Tools Group as they reach out to other customers, you get a different mix within those groups, like if you sell more to heavy truck or somebody like that, you'll get different diagnostics and different hand tools and so on, so you get a different mix within the groups. But we haven't seen much change with regard to the dimension between big ticket and small tickets. It's pretty much been the same.","James C. Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then if you -- if we take a step over to the C&I side on critical industries, are there any particular industries were you've been more successful? And conversely, are there others where you find you're not having as much traction? Just curious as to what is standing out there.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","If you look at the quarterly numbers, Jim, you'll get ups and downs every quarter. These businesses can be lumpy, so you get -- but if you step back and then look at it over the March and say 18 months or so on, I would say that we've been pretty strong in aerospace. We've been very good at that. I think we've been good in the military when the military has been positive, hasn't been so lumpy, and we haven't had these sort of political headwinds flowing through the military. So we've been strong in that critical applications. And those are the 2, I think, that we've been better at. Natural resources is very good for us at times and so on. And so I think those have been the improving areas for us.","James C. Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And finally on Europe, I mean, undoubtedly that's going to continue to be a headwind. You've got some further cost actions that you're going to be taking. When you take a step back and you look at your competitive position in Europe, where you are today, what you're doing from a cost structure, is it really more just about playing defense until the headwinds subside? Can you just talk a little bit about how you manage through the current environment in Europe?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes. First thing I'd say is we're not exactly wringing our hands over it. You go back and forth when you make comments on these calls and you want to say -- you want to make people aware of the issues in Europe and so on. But we don't -- we -- this isn't our first recession, our first downturn, of course. And so we're managing through this. And so what we see is our customers are still in place. We see our productivity and our RCI efforts creating opportunities for restructuring. We see our Asian factories ramping up to the point they get capability and so on, so they can support and provide even more capacity. So we're being proactive in the idea. We're bringing together the new capacity expansion we're seeing in Asia, and okay, looking to support Europe more in that. We're taking the RCI activities and tailoring the footprint to the current environment reflecting those RCI activities. So I think those 2 things are happening. And one -- so I wouldn't call it necessarily plan defense. I would say more or less saying we believe the market comes back. We believe our customers in place. We believe that the Bahco brand is still strong. And around that, we are tailoring the footprint to be as flexible as possible. So in future ups and downs, we're more -- we're less vulnerable to, let's say, variations in volumes. And then on top of that we're overlaying the idea that more capacity is coming online in the very flexible and growing capabilities in our Asian markets. And that will also create the kind of restructuring program around Europe. One of the things I do want to emphasize around our brand, one of the things that's encouraging to us there is that when you look at SNA Europe's primary brand Bahco, it's selling pretty well outside any -- when you're not talking about the core Europe, when you're talking about the periphery about Turkey and Russia and Middle East and so on, this brand is selling pretty well. So we're convinced there's nothing wrong with the product lines. It's still very strong and being well received, and we get our pricing there. It's just in those economics that are causing us the current challenges -- those economies that are causing us the current challenges, and remember that Spain is one of our, as you know, is one of our biggest area, was one of our biggest areas and the highest margin areas, and it's down substantially in the quarter.","Operator","And next, we'll go to David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Just on the Snap-on Tools segment. I guess you realized a 12% organic growth, but gross margins were off about 40 basis points. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about sort of what appeared to be disconnect there? And mindful that there was a comp issue here. In the first quarter '11, you had some manufacturing activities, I guess, that were influencing them. Can you quantify that for us?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, I don't think we're going to quantify those, but I'll give it to you directionally. When you look at that, you're getting the -- I think we said in the 10-Q or maybe that there was a manufacturing unfavorable comp in terms of manufacturing because last year we're preparing for the consolidation of our tools storage business in the United States and Canada. So therefore, there were some better absorption positions despite the differences in volume in certain of the factories in the first quarter last year. And then the other piece of this is it depends on where you're talking about. The other piece of it is if you look in quarter-to-quarter, the first quarter is always lower because of -- is always past because of higher spending in the first quarter because of kick-offs and so on. And then the other factor, I think, is fair is that as we reach out to different customers, and remember, I said these are -- these were less target rich customers. You get a different mix of product lines that sell to those, and that can create a product line mix -- within a mix within product lines, that will give you some difficulty. And also, I mean, and my view is when you look back over time, the margins are kind of in line with the range of Tools Group anyway. But I think that's -- those are the sort of couple of effects this year as the thing we called out in terms of the year-over-year absorption that was very favorable last year. And secondly, the reach to different customers, which creates a little bit of different mix in some of our products. That's what happened in the Tools Group. The Tools Group. I know some people are worried about tougher comparisons sometimes as we go forward from time to time. But -- and it is. It will get tougher. It does get tougher. But this quarter in the U.S., the U.S. grew over 15% this quarter. That's a gang busters quarter.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","That's a great quarter.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","This business is doing pretty well, I think, so.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","So I'm just trying to understand in your operating margins, you get 140 bps of improvement there. Does that just imply that you had a lot of RCI gains sort of bridging the relatively flat gross margin down to a reasonably good step up on the operating margin?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","In the Tools Group?","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yes.","Aldo J. Pagliari","Just leverage.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes, you get leverage. You get leverage in the Tools Group.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. What's normally the gross margin leverage that we should see absent all sorts of year-over-year comp issues that we're seeing this year, but what's the normal?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I hate to speculate on -- I hate to say that because it depends on -- I realize you'd like something like that to help modeling, but it really depends on the situational situation. Sometimes you can be selling products which you don't make. We can be using not everything we sell are of the brands we make. And so therefore, it depends on the mix of products. So it's very difficult to give you guidance in that regard.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. If I could just ask one other point. Just on the Financial Services business. What's a good number for originations going forward beyond 2012? Growth [indiscernible].","Aldo J. Pagliari","The growth in the Snap-on FinCo portfolio over time get more closely aligned with that of the Tools Group. So once the runoff of the CIT portfolio and the transition stops to occur, originations are more or less fall in line with the Tools Group growth pattern. You can always have a little bit of timing difference one quarter to the next, and it depends on the mix of what is sold in the way of big ticket items, because that tends to find its way onto credit contracts more readily than just hand tools. But over the long-term, it will reflect the growth of the Tools Group. As Nick characterized, while we're enjoying double-digit growth these days, over the longer run, it'll be probably something a little bit less than that.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Aldo, should that convergence occur early in '13?","Aldo J. Pagliari","I think you'll start to see 2013 become more normalized. At the end of this year, I mean, our estimates -- I think we've commented on this before, it will be probably about another $25 million or so of CIT-owned extended credit receivables will be managing on their behalf. So once we get down to that level, I think the crossover will become less.","Operator","Our next question will come from Alek Gasiel, Barrington Research.","Alek B. Gasiel - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just sitting in for Gary. Most of my questions have been asked. But I guess one thing. I know, Nick, you talked in the past about -- just kind of curious again, what percentage of your territory is under penetrated by the van network? And has that changed recently?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Actually, I don't -- generally, it kind of changed over time. We're not looking to -- I would say the addition of vans is not a major factor in our growth going forward. So we have probably as many vans -- it's not to say we won't add some, but the thing is I don't think that's going to be a major factor in the growth. The big thing about in terms of vans is how quickly we can replace them. Of course, we -- our turnovers are down. I believe at least a relatively -- a relative low and I think it might be an all-time low, but so -- but when somebody turns in his Van or somebody wants to retire and he sites to retire and he happens to do Northeast Peoria, you maybe don't have anybody in Northeast Peoria to go in there. So how quickly do we fill that? So how quickly do we get them in? How quickly to get somebody up? This is a factor, so we track that and we talk about that. That's something that can do -- that can go better, that we could do better. We've improved, so we can do better. And then, secondly, I said, we call on a group of technicians. There are some we don't call on because they are less target rich. They're either off the geographic center of our route or they're in tire shops, something like that, and as we get more productivity with our vans, give them more selling time available, they can choose to use this time to call on those people. That's part of the phenomena we're seeing in this growth. And so I would offer that the 2 of the runways for growth anyway with regard to the physical to the van have to do with getting a new guy in when another guy leaves, retires and then secondly, have the people get more selling time so they can reach out, reach more customers. And I guess if you have more selling time, you can schmooze the existing customers and sell them more. So those are the elements of growth.","Alek B. Gasiel - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","How fast is it to get a new guy running up, I mean, versus in the past?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","It depends if we have a guy for the territory. Being as maybe we have trouble -- we might have 4 guys for, let's say, a garden spot, Kenosha, Wisconsin. We might have a lot of people for Kenosha, but we happen to live in here in Kenosha. Our headquarter is in Kenosha, so I'd say that. But we might have a lot of people for Kenosha, but we might not have many people for Peoria. I'm not sure -- it's come down. I don't actually have the statistics. If you like to get the statistics, we'll get them to you. If you call Leslie, she'll have it for you. Okay?","Alek B. Gasiel - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","All right. And just one quick. I might have missed this. Just with Europe, and I know last quarter, you talked about how the softness and weakness in Southern Europe is now creeping into more mature area, which is evident now. Just kind of what you're seeing right now in the quarter, Q2 at the moment? If you can provide any color.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes. I don't think -- we can't. I can't speculate on that. If you read the same paper as I do, I think this is being driven economically. We're not sure. I think if you look at the GDP growth rates that are projected in Europe, a lot of them are flattish. Some of them are down. Our European businesses are down substantially, deeply in the south, mid-single digits in the sort of center, and in Eastern Europe, we're actually up a little bit. I think the important thing to think about for our businesses, if you look at the European business, and our European businesses in each of our groups, there's 10% in the Tools Group and some other percentage all the way up to about 1\/3 or more of C&I. If you take those businesses and you isolate them, the rest of the business grew at double digits organically. So if you look at the place where we weren't organically -- we weren't economically afflicted, you're growing at, what, double-digits, and Europe represents a kind of challenged 20% to 25%. We used to say 25%. It's down now, because it shrunk a little bit, okay?","Alek B. Gasiel - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right.","Operator","And next we have a question from Michael Prober from Clovis.","Michael Aaron Prober - Clovis Capital Management, LP","Could one of you talk about the acquisition environment and how the deal pipeline is? And then I have a follow-up.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, as I said, I think when I've spoken of this, we found that -- we say that we will look at acquisitions that will be in any of the 4 critical paths, our strategic runways for growth. I think you could argue that the Tools Group doesn't have so many acquisitions available to it. But in terms of emerging markets, in terms of repair systems and information and with repair shop owners and managers and with critical industries, there are businesses which would enhance our business and enhance our position that we could acquire bolt-on and allow us to continue to grow coherently. There are a number of those. And I think I've also said that we're still working -- we think we're still -- we're working through and just getting through the largest acquisition in our history, which was the credit company. So the idea that there is a -- we're working through that large acquisition. We have a pipeline -- I don't know, pipeline implies that you're going to go off and do them all. I don't really mean that, but we have a number -- a universe of possible candidates that we have out there in each of those segments, and so we keep -- we're looking at those and when the time is right, we'll take some actions.","Michael Aaron Prober - Clovis Capital Management, LP","I mean, the company really hasn't -- I know that credit card -- excuse me, credit division was a big acquisition. Credit company is a big acquisition, but that was really more of a financial integration than an operational integration because you were mostly...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, that's worth $800 million.","Michael Aaron Prober - Clovis Capital Management, LP","But it soaked up a lot of capital in the balance sheet and now the company is over capitalized by most measures. And I was just wondering if you're planning on spending capital after you build the balance sheet for the finance company in 2013, '14 on acquisitions? And are there any out there for you because it doesn't really look like there are that many out there?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, I think there are acquisitions. I mean, I -- obviously, I don't want to talk about such things on the call, but I think a casual review of things available would say that there are acquisitions that would be available. We may not have -- in fact, there has been acquisitions available, which we may not have moved at for a variety of reasons. So I think there clearly are acquisitions. If you look at the automotive space around repair shops -- repair shop owners and managers, there've been a couple of properties passed. We viewed it, and we didn't -- we weren't the acquirer. And then there are critical industries. There are a lot of product lines, which we could add to our product lines smear the Snap-on patina above it and make positive things. In emerging markets, there are places to acquire.","Operator","And at this time, we have no further questions in the queue. And I will turn the call back over to Leslie Kratcoski for any additional or closing remarks.","Leslie H. Kratcoski","Thanks, everyone, for joining us today.

Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.","As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion. These slides can be accessed under the Downloads tab in the webcast viewer, as well as on our website, snapon.com, under Investor Information. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript of today's call.","Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs, or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.","Finally this presentation includes non-GAAP measures of financial performance, which are not meant to be considered in isolation or they substitute for their GAAP counterparts. Additional information regarding these measures is included in our Q3 earnings release issued today, which can be found on our website.","With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone.","As usual I'll start with the third quarter highlights providing update on the environment, and speak about some of our trends. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of the financial.","In the third quarter we again showed progress along our runway for growth and for improvement. And we saw those gains across all our operating segment. Total reported sales were $834.1 million up 1.5% and that included $9.7 million of unfavorable currency.","It also included the incremental $1.1 million of sales from last year's acquisition of Ecotechnics. Organic sales were up 2.6% and the OpCo operating margin it was up 140 basis points reaching 18.9%.","When you add in the $50.6 million of operating earnings and financial services and that was up from $43.5 million in 2015 but consolidated operating margin was 23%, an increase of 180 basis points. Our EPS was $2.22, up $0.24 a double digit increase, rising 12.1% from last year.","Let's consider the environment. Automotive repair continues to be favorable and we believe our Tools Group and our Repairs Systems and Information or RS&I Group, they're both well positioned to take full advantage of that opportunity. The Tools Group clearly demonstrated enhancements to the franchise network, gains in both the North America and European markets continuing to make the most of the opportunities so abundant in an aging and changing vehicle fleet.","At RS&I serving repair shop owners and managers, sales progress was mix. The volume of diagnostics and repair information products to independent shop was up mid single-digit. For the OEM side, activity with individual dealers was up, while programs commissioned by the OEM manufacturers, a historically lumpy space was down. Under car equipment was flat with variations from product line to product line.","For Commercial and Industrial or C&I the group was up organically 1.5%. Snap-on Europe, SNA Europe was higher again making progress against the turbulence of Brexit and the other uncertainties across its market. The industrial business was flat reflecting the challenges we\u2019ve seen now for a year.","Significantly however the critical industry activity recorded the second straight quarter of sequential growth following more than year of decrease, reductions driven by the difficult macro environment in areas like oil and gas, military and the Middle East. Now there will always be headwinds across our operations.","They\u2019ve been a factor in other quarters and they were present in the third quarter but we did overcome, we did see it growing because we\u2019re well positioned to confront the challenges and continue to proceed down our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise network, expanding with repairs shop owners and managers, expanding to critical industries and building in emerging markets. These do represent our growth strategy and we continue to make progress along those quarter.","At the same time, those growth drivers are joined and supported by the benefits of Snap-on value creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, rapid continuous improvement or as we call it RCI. Together these are the processes, the tools we use each and every day to drive improvement and improvement is written all over our results especially customer connection, understanding the works of professional technician and innovation matching that insight with technology to make work easier.","Snap-on value creation once again led to more prestigious awards. We were recently honored with two MOTOR magazine top 20 and with five professional tool and equipment news or P10 innovation award. Those winners represent only a fraction of a wide array of new products born out of insight, of the insight of our franchises and our direct sales people, transplanting workplace observations into productivity solution and in the quarter those customer connections were a big factor in our results.","To see some of that let's move to the individual groups. Commercial and Industrial, organic sales is up with an operating margin reaching 15.1%, an increase of 80 basis points from last year\u2019s 14.3%, the benefit of Snap-on value creation evident in the ongoing stream of innovative new products developed for the critical industry.","One of those products launched in the third quarter by our Industrial division is the PWZ five pliers wrench. This wrench is the latest and the largest model in a popular Snap-on PWZ series. It\u2019s a long 41.34 in inches. It can handle jobs that would traditionally require a pipe wrench with much less slippage for better overall performance and for better safety. It features inwardly angled teeth, fine at the back, large at the front for stronger and more secured grip on objects of all sizes and the narrow jaw design gives improved accessibility in tight compartments and in those cramped corners.","It\u2019s perfect for applications on tie rods and other areas that are hard to reach in industries like railroad, oil and gas, for serving fleet, actually any heavy duty application. You heard me speak about in the past about our growing industrial product line. Well this wrench is another great ignition to our handful line up for critical industries.","Now SNA Europe, 12 quarters in a row of year-over-year growth navigating some difficult geographies and some taped economies. SNA sales activity continues to be positive but its profits are even more encouraging now up for 14 straight quarters and we believe there is still more opportunity.","And the Asia Pacific operation mixed environment across the region, we continue to invest in building our physicals and the Asia operation has gains contributing to the progress in the quarter. So that's C&I.","Now on to the tools. Organic sale is up 5.6% significant growth both in the U.S. and international and the internationally. Operating income of $64.6 million compared to $56.3 million in 2015, the operating income margin of 16.3% rose 150 basis points from last year\u2019s 14.8%.","Volume gains as well as operating improvement from RCI translated into a significant margin rise and that 150 basis point gain it over attained 60 basis point of negative currency. When you consider the Tools Groups\u2019 success you can see the power of Snap-on value creation of customer connection and innovation. The MOTOR Top 20 and the P10 award represent just a few examples of the recognition our products continue to receive. Awards from industry publications but also awards from the professionals that use our tools every day. Innovation is consistently innovation, it\u2019s consistently been a key contributor to our Tools Group and in the third quarter more new products.","Like our reversible ratcheting combination wrench, the latest in the line of a Snap-on wrench of adding a reversible feature to our patented ratcheting mechanism utilizing our dual 80 technology combining dual pulls with thin walls, box end designs, smooth operation, more torque transferring tight basis and a port it incorporates the iconic Snap-on plank drive profile biting into fasteners without rounding corners preventing slippage.","The new reversible ratcheting combo wrench it\u2019s more turning power, enhanced durability, compact design and built stronger to last longer. This is the core of Snap-on value creation. Customer connection and innovation solving specific problems in the shop. Take the new 20 millimeter 12-point impact socket born from hours of observations in the workplace, hours of observation at workplace.","This socket is designed to remove head bolts in large industrial engines, long enough to reach the deepest of inaccessible and strong enough to remove the toughest fasteners a unique combination. It\u2019s produced in our Elkmont, Alabama plant and it\u2019s essential for servicing large off road equipment. It may not be needed often but when it is it\u2019s critical and Snap-on has it. It\u2019s just another example of our commitment to make work easier solving our technician\u2019s most challenging problem.","In the third quarter it\u2019s also when hold the annual Snap-on franchisee conference or SFC. This year it was in Orlando with more than 8,700 attendees franchisee and family members from over 3,000 routes, three days of showcasing the opportunities, the opportunities to enhance the franchise channel and I can report to you because I was there that based on the optimism and the confidence of our franchisees it was big success in orders because we orders at these events and orders while they were up once again beating the record levels of 2015.","Now when we speak of the wrench, we also have to consider the strategic combination of Snap-on credit. Our financial services are on help to create opportunities across the organization but especially within the Tools Group it\u2019s been an ongoing partnership for over 50 years and our credit company had a strong presence at this year\u2019s SFC supporting franchisees with unique program. 270,000 of our approximately 875,000 about 30% of our technician customers in the United States have credit company contract enabling those big ticket item. The credit company has been a key part of franchisee success and the third quarter was no exception to that.","Now let\u2019s move to RS&I. Organic sales were up 1.7%. The operating market of 25.1%, it increased 50 basis points from the 24.6% registered last year. As I mentioned RS&S clearly show progress in providing repair information and diagnostics to independent show owners and managers. And certainly a portion of that growth came from innovative new product several launch at the SFC. Product like the MODIS Edge, our latest diagnostic offering an enhanced industrial design, improved ergonomics, reduced weight and Code Scan capability that allows the Tech to scan all of the vehicles computer system with the systems with the push of a single button.","It also contains fast excess oil change and recent information, automatic vehicle identification and are unique SureTrack expert database. All features specifically designed to save the technician significant time.","This new handheld is lighter, faster and smarter and simply based on the excited crowds of franchises at the SFC that carved out precious time to a 10 MODIS Edge handheld training. We expect this to be a very popular item.","Another exciting SFC launch was our Diagnostic Thermal Imager, this completely new Snap-on offering a breakthrough and pinpointing drop with a graphical display illustrating surface data, temperature data and a referenced library of nominal and respect thermal images for a variety of auto parts found in break, emission system and in vehicle electrical equipment.","We believe we have a winner with the Diagnostic Thermal Imager and autos at the SFC prove it, its sold out. And RCI innovation wasn\u2019t just an diagnostic product. Take the brand new polytech air conditioning unit from our recent acquisition eco technique. Develop and manufacture specifically for the North American market meeting a very aggressive launch both our US and our Canadian customers have a firm strength of the units designed performance. Its been our real testament to the capability of the eco techniques team.","And speaking of products, I\u2019m getting more to sell to repair shop owners and managers. This week we entered into a definite agreement to acquire Car-O-Liner based in Gothenburg, Sweden, but reaching around the globe.","Car-O-Liner product offering in its special expertise are important editions to the Snap-on team providing extraordinary capabilities in collision repairs at segment were changed now authoring opportunity. It\u2019s an operation that strengthens our position both in auto and in the heavy duty. Car-O-Liner is another coherent business and we believe that match with Snap-on team, it offers substantial possibilities for both growth and for improvement, all of that. Great opportunity going forward. So that\u2019s the highlights of our quarter.","Organic sales, up 2.6% gains across all group progress along our runways for growth. Snap-on value creation trying our customer connection insights into innovative new products and along with our ongoing RCI initiatives driving margin improvement and it all shows in a result. Optical OI margin arising to 18.9%, up a 140 basis points. EPS of $2.22, up 12.1%. It was an encouraging quarter.","Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo","Aldo Pagliari","Thanks, Nick. Our third quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $834.1 million were up $12.6 million or 1.5%. Due to the strengthening of the US dollar or currency moment adversely impacted our Q3 sales comparisons by 120 basis points excluding $9.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $1.1 million of acquisition related sales.","Organic sales increased 2.6% reflecting pretty good progress and serving the vehicle repair sector as well as well as improvements in sales in our commercial and industrial segment. Consolidated gross margin of 50.2% grew 70 basis points from 2015 leveled, primarily due to benefits from higher sales in savings from RCI initiatives.","Operating expenses of $261.5 million yielded an operating expense margin of 31.3% in the quarter, an improvement of 70 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage and lower pension expense. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before financial services of a $157.6 million including $4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 9.7% and as a percentage of sales improved 140 basis points to 18.9%.","Financial services revenue of $71.6 million in the quarter increased 17.2% from 2015 level. And operating earnings of $50.6 million increased 16.3%. Consolidated operating earnings of $208.2 million including $4.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased 11.3% and the operating margin of 23% improved 180 basis points from 21.2% a year ago. Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 31.2% compared to 31.6% last year. For the full year we now anticipate that our 2016 effective income tax rate will be slightly below our full-year 2015 rate of 31.7%.","Finally, net earnings of $131.7 million or $2.22 per diluted share increased $14.9 million or $0.24 per share for 2015 levels, representing a 12.1% increase in diluted earnings per share.","Now let\u2019s turn to our segment results. Starting with commercial and industrial, our C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $289.3 million in the third quarter increased modestly over 2015 levels excluding $3.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 1.5%, primarily due to a mid-single-digit increase in the segment's European-based hand tools business and a low single-digit increase in both the segment's power tools and Asia Pacific operations.","Organic sales to customers in critical industries were essentially flat and the decline to the aerospace market segment was largely offset by gain in sales to the military and increases in both the technical education and natural resources market segments.","Despite the continued presence of certain headwinds in the industrial space, we were encouraged that sales performance has improved what we had seen earlier in the year. Gross profit of the C&I Group of $112.7 million compared $109.5 million last year.","The gross margin of 39% improved to 110 basis points primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives and 40 basis points of favorable foreign currency effect. Operating expenses of $69 million in the quarter compared to $68.2 million last year.","The operating expense margin of 23.9% increased to 30 basis points, primarily as a result of higher cost including cost associated with continued expansion initiatives in Asia and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.","As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $43.7 million including 0.3 million of favorable foreign currency effects increased $2.4 million of 2015 levels and the operating margin of 15.1% improved 80 basis points from 14.3% last year, representing a recent high for C&I and up a 130 basis points sequentially.","Turning now to Slide 8. Third quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $397.2 million increased 4.4%. Excluding $4.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased $21.2 million or 5.6% reflecting mid-single-digit gains in both the company\u2019s US and international franchise operations.","Gross profit of $173.3 million compared to $166.5 last year. Gross margin of 43.6% declined 20 basis points as benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives were more than offset by 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effect.","Operating expenses of $108.7 million in the quarter compared $110.2 million last year. The operating expense margin of 27.3% improved to 170 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI and other cost reduction initiatives.","As a result of these factor, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $64.6 million including $3.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased $8.3 million and the operating margin of 16.3% improved 150 basis points from 14.8% last year.","Turning to the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group, shown on Slide 9, third quarter sale of $286.1 million increased 1.1% from 2015 level excluding $2.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $1.1 million of acquisition related sales, organic sales increased 1.7%.","The organic sales increase primarily reflects a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. In the quarter, sales of both undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships were essentially flat. As Nick mentioned, sales to OEM dealerships this quarter were practically impacted by the timing of essential tool of facilitation program sale. For example, sales in Q3 of last year benefited from a refrigeration related facility action program which has since lapsed.","Gross profit of $133.1 million compared to $130.9 last year and a gross margin of 46.5% improved 20 basis points, primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives partially offset by 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.","Operating expenses of $61.3 million in the quarter compared to $61.2 million last year. The operating expense margin of 21.4% grew 30 basis point principally due to savings from RCI initiatives.","Third quarter operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $71.8 million including $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased $2.1 million from prior level and the operating margin of 25.1% improved 50 basis points from 24.6% last.","As we announced earlier this week and as Nick mentioned in his remarks, we have entered into an definitive agreement to purchase Car-O-Liner. Car-O-Liner annual sales are approximately $95 million and we expect them to generate operating income margin somewhat similar to those of RS&I undercar equipment business which are typically in the low teens.","We expect to complete the acquisition of Car-O-Liner within the next month. Our plan is to fund the transaction with a combination of cash on hand and approximately $125 million in issuances of commercial paper.","Now, turning to Slide 10. Operating earnings from financial services of $50.6 million on revenue of $71.6 million compared to operating earnings of $43.5 million on revenue of $61.1 million last. Financial services expenses in the quarter included some additional headcount related expenses to help better serve our growing portfolio. But, as a percentage of the average portfolio financial services expenses were 1.2% in both periods.","The average yield on financial receivables of 18% in the quarter compared to 17.9% last year and the average yield on contract receivables of 9.4% compared to 9.5% last year. Originations of $269.8 million in the quarter increased 4.7% prior year level.","Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $1.8 billion of gross financing receivables including $1.6 million from our US operation. Approximately 81% of our US financing portfolio relates to expanded credit loans to technicians.","The first nine months of 2016, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew $190.3 million. As per finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectation.","Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $111.9 million in the quarter decreased $1.8 million from comparable 2015 level. Its higher net earnings were more than offset by $11.4 million of higher cash tax maintenance and $5.4 million of higher US pension contributions. Net cash used by investing activities of $69.2 million included $56 million fund, a net increase in finance receivables and $16.5 million of capital expenditures.","Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $26.6 million in 2015 year-end levels reflecting both higher sales in an increase in days sales outstanding from 60 days year-end to 63 days at third quarter end.","Inventories increased $25.8 million in 2015 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions. On a trailing 12 months basis, inventory turns of 3.3 compared with 3.5 turns at 2015 year-end.","Our quarter end cash position of $117.5 million increased $24.7 million from 2015 year-end levels. The net increase includes $501.7 million of cash collections of finance receivables and $415.6 million of cash from operations. These cash increases were largely offset by the funding of $691.4 million of finance receivables, dividend payment of $106.3 million, the repurchase of 492,000 shares for $76.4 million and $56.6 million for capital expenditures.","Our net debt to capital ratio 22.6% compared with 24.6% at 2015 year-end. In addition to our $117 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. As of third quarter end, we had $8 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.","That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. And I'll now turn the call back over to Nick. ","Nicholas Pinchuk","Thanks Aldo.","Stepping back and looking at the Snap-on third quarter; we believe a number of things are apparent. Our part of the auto repair market is solid. As we've seen in the past that followed the different trajectory that new car sale. It was reliable even in the withering discussion of 2009 and strong today. And we believe our ability to take advantage of that opportunity grows every quarter and you can see it in a result. ","Tools Group, sales up 5.6% organically. The franchises were prosperous and stronger. The group's OI margin up 150 basis points against 60 basis points of unfavorable currency. The credit company continue to serve as the Tools Group's strategic partner and enabling franchises and technicians as it has done for five decades to recession after recession without disruption. ","RS&I selling to repair shop owners and managers mixed growth in uncovering the usual ups and downs of OEM sponsored programs, but showing real progress with individual shot, both independent and dealers. And C&I a mixed turbulence but now growing again, showing year over year and sequential gains despite the difficult macros and despite the difficult macros registering operating margin of 15.1% up 80 basis points.","Showing what we believe is confirmation of the great value it offers as run rate of coherent growth. And finally in the result you can see the effects of Snap-on value creation more new product driving gains and the engine of rapid continues improvement offering efficiency, it all came together for organic sales growth of 2.6% and an optical operating margin of 18.9%, up 140 basis point and an EPS of $2.22 and increase of 12.1% a double digit gain again.","And the Car-O-Liner acquisition giving us more to sale, more opportunities for coherent growth and providing more possibilities for the Snap-on value creation to drive progress. The great opportunity. It was an encouraging quarter and we believe it clearly confirms the future of continuous Snap-on growth and improvement as we move through the end of this year and into 2017 and beyond. ","Before I turn the call over to the operator for questions, I'll keep directly to our franchises and associates. I know that many of you are listening or will listen to this call. Once again you should know that the encouraging performance of our corporation is only possible because of your capability, your energy and your dedication. For your extraordinary contribution to our progress you have my congratulations and for your unfailing commitment to our team, you have my thanks.","Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from David Leiker with Baird.","Joe Vruwink","Hi, good morning. This is Joe Vruwink for David. I wanted to discuss the deceleration in origination growth this quarter. So maybe for context, can you revisit the driver of the double-digit origination growth, that has been seen in recent quarters? And then maybe comment on whether demand conditions or other items change for those same drivers, or those same products in the current quarter?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Sure. Look, a couple of things, first of all big ticket the idea of Snap-on tool storage and diagnostic were strong in a quarter, in fact stronger than - so much stronger than the overall Snap-on tools growth and incidentally this is side hand tools were also pretty strong in the quarter. So it was still a good quarter for big ticket items, which are the principle driver for these things.","Secondly and the reason that is the case. Reason why big ticket has been the case it's because we've been investing in product, great new tool storage products and number of used features and number of great attractive product that get customers excited. The fact that diagnostics are more important in the repair shop than ever before and technicians are trying to - I guess caliber off to have better and bigger diagnostic take care of those products.","It's natural that big ticket items would be stronger, so you would see that. So I think that looking at the Tools Group and seeing that lead the way is just a consequence of our investment in the marketplace and as the kinds of product we've had and the demand to the market associated - the shift in the market associated with more diagnostic.","And also our investment in enabling event that breakthrough the original structural barriers of the bands that is the space and time the Rock n Roll CADs which we talked about quite a bit which helped tool storage and the Techno band we have 67 of them now. In a Techno band we have 49 of them and that drive fairly robust bigger ticket items sale.","In terms of higher-double digit before - double digit origination before and somewhat less originations now, you can't trade quarter-to-quarter, because there isn\u2019t a perfect one-to-one correlation. Remember that when you are looking at originations you are looking at franchisee sales. When you are looking at the Tools Group you are looking at our sales. We sell for the franchisees but the timing is different then you have on top of that the franchise margin and then we have on top of that the idea that a tool storage sale or diagnostic sale may ignite the couple of trading type sales which would also be somewhat supported by the credit card.","So, you put those all together and that shows the landscape, but when we step back and we look at the say, 2015 numbers, when we look at the 2015 numbers about origination and the Tools Group big ticket sale, they seem pretty much the same. And this year we start to see year to date the same kind of thing.","Joe Vruwink","So I'm sure you know, in the market, there seems to be this idea that tools group growth is only strong because origination growth is strong. This quarter, you actually maintained a strong rate of growth, organic growth, stable quarter over quarter, originations came down. That either to me seems like the hand tool category may be strengthened quarter over quarter, or this whole relationship of painting tools group as a byproduct of the credit business maybe isn't the most accurate relationship.","Nicholas Pinchuk","This is the most accurate. The tools group is a strategic partner- I mean the credit company is the strategic partner of the Tools Group. But if you think about it, yes, okay, but only 270,000 of our 875,000 customers, they have a credit company contract that's only about 30%.","So if you think as a Tools Group growth been driven exclusively by the credit company mojo, think again. It just isn\u2019t that wide, of course, it is grown because the market has - the customers have turned that way and we have invested into support that with new product and also part of the way we figured out how to enable the band has been associated with that segment.","But it's a natural thing, I've been talking about the Rock n Roll CADs for multiple quarters and that would naturally of course drive a little bit more credit company activity. Okay?","Joe Vruwink","And then my last question if I can, the comps are difficult, so to do the growth you did this quarter was positive. I'm just thinking, you took 3,000 routes down intra-quarter for the franchisee conference. Is there any indication based on vans coming back online, and your order activity, that\u2019s the pace of sales you got strength in year-over-year in the Q4?","Nicholas Pinchuk","I am not in the business of projecting out. I'll only say this is what I said on the call, look. The Franchisee Conference was baffled. It was really good and the enthusiasm was good, so I can tell it anecdotally or anybody was there was talking anecdotally I'm just with the national franchises, the National Franchise Advisory report and they are all positive. And quantitative piece is the orders were up, it was up over the record that we set last year at the SFC.","Now they don\u2019t translate one to one in sale, they were up significantly. It doesn\u2019t translate one to one, but what it says is our guys saw the new product they were confident in the future they invested and they ordered so they think good things are coming.","Joe Vruwink","Great, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Liam Burke with Wunderlich.","Liam Burke","Thank you. Good morning Nick, good morning Aldo. Aldo, in your prepared statement, maybe you can answer, you talked about the physicals, the investment in emerging markets of C&I. Are you seeing any kind of significant revenue growth there to begin absorbing that upfront investment?","Aldo Pagliari","The emerging markets tend to have their own volatility and lumpiness so to speak for lack of a better word but we believe that the secret to penetrating the emerging markets is to establish physical presence, people, place, products that suite those market and those environments. So through thick and thin we\u2019re continuously looking for opportunities to expand our footprint because we know that what we\u2019ve today could still be improved upon. So that\u2019s basically our philosophy when it comes to that Liam.","Nicholas Pinchuk","We\u2019re investing in things like more Blue-Point stores, more products. You are trying to expand your product line and more sales outlets. For example we just opened another sales outlet in Vietnam this quarter. So that\u2019s the kind of investment we\u2019re doing because in the 11 years I lived in Asia I know I am confident that the building of the physical allows you to take advantage of the market as it matures.","Liam Burke","And, same with C&I, on the new product introductions, you talked about that being a big driver of incremental growth. Are there any particular verticals that you, this quarter, saw opportunity to put new product into the market?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Well, we had - we talked about couple of those. I mean I think in this particular market the natural resources we\u2019ve been - I can only say that actually we\u2019re trying to play the long game in C&I. We believe we\u2019re trying to build our activity in each of these markets.","So for example, not in this particular quarter because we wouldn\u2019t make product adjustment for a quarter. We see opportunities, we build out \u2013 our goal was to build up in each of the markets. For example last year we brought out 929 new products just for aviation, 313 for oil and gas even though it was, we\u2019re having probably one of the most difficult times, 313 for military even though it was a difficult time.","So we just keep addition not so much targeting. Now we still have some great opportunities they are still on heavy duty, the substitute for the pipe wrench, that\u2019s been a great new product. And so we see things like that all the time. We see enhancements to our visual control system, our tool control system which we\u2019ve seen now. Amazingly we\u2019ve seen the tool control system more and go bleed into oil and gas.","We have a major sale in Canada associated with oil and gas as opposed when we had been using it just for aviation. We can see it rolling into railroad with small enhancements. That\u2019s the kind of thing we\u2019re doing.","Liam Burke","Great. Thanks Nick, thanks Aldo.","Operator","Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","Good morning everyone. Congratulations Nick, on a good quarter. The question is on the tools group and your margin is up 150 basis points, including 60 BPs of negative FX. You have come through a period where you have a period of hypergrowth, as that term might be applied to this particular category. That growth seems to be slowing now.","Obviously, there is a lot of cost opportunity that is out of reach when you're getting that kind of growth, but now the growth is easing a little bit. Maybe that cost opportunity becomes more accessible. The question is how sustainable are these year-over-year margin progression numbers, given that you now have a cost of opportunity you might not have had for the last couple of years?","Aldo Pagliari","I think there is some truth in what you say there, I don\u2019t think you can predict quarter by quarter in this kind of situation. Of course one is with your eyeballs are looking for trying to double-digit growth that kind of things you maybe perhaps have some efficiency opportunities but we like to believe we take full advantage of those kind of things.","I think though if you look at our overall number, if you look at the OI margin growth for the corporation and you take a look at the year-over-year OpCo margin and you go back and see it, you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s been triple-digits on awful lot of times awfully far back in peak sales growth and small sales growth.","So I think we\u2019ve been able to grow that margin in a lot of different situations on an overall basis. Now in the situation at Tools Groups it does give you a little more advantage, little opportunity to look at that but I wouldn\u2019t allow the characterization that 5.6% is low. I think that\u2019s pretty good growth. I mean we\u2019re taking about 5.6% organically in GDP that are throwing between 1 and 2 all over the world. So I think it\u2019s pretty good.","David MacGregor","If I could just follow-up with a couple of other quick ones.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Yes.","David MacGregor","The slower growth in the origination, how much of that was just the flat under car?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Say that again please.","David MacGregor","The slower growth in originations I am just wondering how much of that might have been due to lack of growth in under car.","Nicholas Pinchuk","No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that much. I mean the thing is that of course there some under car equipment that gets sold in to the Tools Group space but just primarily when you\u2019re talking about the origination, the primary driver is tool storage and the second driver is the big ticket diagnostics. So it\u2019s not real. There is some of it in there floating around but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s much of a factor.","David MacGregor","Okay, last question, I know you are going to market through your franchisees but you have a pretty substantial distribution arrangement as well. Was de-stocking within your distribution partners \u2013 how much of a growth inhibitor was that in the quarter?","Nicholas Pinchuk","I am sure there was some of it but I\u2019d have to say it might have been, it would have shown up in the industrial business that was flat like I said it was up sequentially which gave us some positives. I don\u2019t think it was huge factor this quarter, it might been some evolving.","David MacGregor","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Hayes with Northcoast Research.","Tom Hayes","Good morning gentlemen. On the RS&I group, Nick, your organic growth rates have been bouncing around the last couple of quarters. I wanted a little bit of clarity digging into that a bit. Maybe the route trajectory of the diagnostic equipment, versus the undercar that is in there as well.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Yes, look, like we said in the I think the statements, the formal statements is that diagnostic information and products and diagnostics so that will be like Mitchell and diagnostics the software and the handheld hardware to independent repair shop owners and managers were up mid single-digit and it\u2019s been up. That kind of number gee I think every quarter for a long time. I can attest to it exactly but I think that in most quarters it\u2019s has been bouncing around mid to high single-digit.","Tom Hayes","Okay.","Nicholas Pinchuk","So I think that\u2019s doing pretty well. The big thing about diagnostics at this time I mean, not diagnostics but RS&I this time as I tried to make clear in the quarter we have this business in RS&I which produces, which takes contracts, OEM commission contract to distribute where you could talk potential tools or facilitate a project. So for example you might have somebody\u2019s Aldo referred to this to do some air-conditioning, provide an air-conditioning reclaim system for all its dealers.","One of the manufacturers is like, I want you to provide this air-conditioning system, I want you to get it my dealers, I want it to be two per dealer and I want it to be rolled out in the next four quarters or three quarters. We rolled it out. That\u2019s a pretty big piece of sales. You might have another one that does an essential tool for a particular new product or a new technology that rolls out on an new truck that rolls to in a quarter but what happens is these are driven by the view of the OEM and the technology and the differences that are rolling through their new models.","So they tend to be quite lumpy and what happened in this quarter for that particular type of business this was kind of a strong quarter in that business and that created the overhang, one of the overhangs in RS&I.","Tom Hayes","Okay, and then on the\u2026","Nicholas Pinchuk","But the stuff we sell to individual dealers was pretty good.","Tom Hayes","On the Car-O-Liner acquisition, that was roughly $95 million in revenue. Is that a little bit of geographic clarity, is that all Europe, or is that spread across?","Nicholas Pinchuk","No, no. It\u2019s like about, it\u2019s like this. It\u2019s about 45% U.S. about 30% in Europe and the rest in the rest of the world but there is a big piece of that like 20 points or 25 points in Asia. That\u2019s the way it works. And the 275 people, 100 in the factories, 150 selling, 50 engineers and the rest to do in other thing.","Tom Hayes","Okay. Lastly if I could for Aldo. Fourth quarter last year on the operating expenses it took a pretty big step down versus 3Q of \u201915. Is there anything in there that maybe you guys held back last year that we need to think about this year?","Aldo Pagliari","No I mean the top of mind you can think about the creates little bit of volatility if there is a changes in mark to market, it's depending on stock price one way or the other.","Tom Hayes","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.","David Kelley","Good morning. This is David Kelley in for Bret. Just a quick follow-up on RS&I, and specifically the undercar business being flat. We have heard similar commentary from other aftermarket retailers and installers, and they mostly have been referencing the residual impact from last year's mild winter weather. Just thinking about some of the industry fundamentals and miles driven being up, it feels like it's a bit surprising that segment is still lagging. The question is, do you think there is some pent-up demand there, or some real opportunity for you as we lap last winter, and slowly inch to 2017?","Nicholas Pinchuk","I don\u2019t know. For us the winter thing is a double-edge sword. I heard people say winter is tough and therefore we don\u2019t sale balances or we don\u2019t sale -- we don\u2019t do tire service, we'll service when winter is mild. So we don\u2019t do as much tire service. On the other hand I heard people say, yes, people are crashing into each other left and side there is lot of repair, we need more or less, we need more alignment going on. People are running into bumpers or bouncing into potholes.","So it's a double-edge sword. I am not so sure, but I do think there is opportunity in our business. What we saw there was variation from product to product. We saw kind of stronger quarter and alignment and couple of the other product lines that are little bit weaker. We didn\u2019t really think it was very significant or indicative of anything actually for us. We do think there is opportunity for the equipment business going forward though because we like our product. ","David Kelley","Okay, great. So you don\u2019t see any real structural issue that for whatever reason undercars?.","Nicholas Pinchuk","I don\u2019t think so. We don\u2019t see it anyway and we are in garage with every -- we have people in garage for hours every week.","David Kelley","Sure, sure. And a follow-up on the strong tools organic growth, I was just wondering if you could talk about some of the drivers there, the specific product segments that are just really outperforming as of late? Or even regional trends, are you seeing some specific region or part of the U.S.?","Nicholas Pinchuk","There can be regional trends, but they tend to very quarter to quarter, they tell you the truth. The thing is I can tell you I was just with a bunch of franchises, and from all over the country this is the National Franchise Advisory conference, they all seemed positive. And they are representing the region.","So I didn\u2019t run into a single person who was saying, this is tough. And we are saying that they were positive. At the SFC I can't emphasize enough, how important is it when people order more year-over-year. What is means is they are putting their money on the line, they are committing to taking products that they think things are going to positive, so they got a positive outlook.","So we feel good about that. What's driving our business I think maybe three factors. One is our new products pretty robust. You heard me talk about couple of them for handtools. Handtools were up in the quarter, tool storage were up in the quarter, diagnostic were up in the quarter. We talk about that product line because I think about customer innovation is better than ever before. We have more products than we ever had. Secondly, our franchises are stronger. They are stronger and the despite the fact they are stronger they seem to be hungrier for more products.","And thirdly, we've invested in things in the vans like Rock N' Roll Cabs. The Techno-Vans and our franchises are so confident that taking on system, so the model itself is getting better that another way it's a great market. Auto repair is a great market and like I said every quarter we know how to take better advantage to the opportunity. You can see it. ","David Kelley","Okay, great, thanks. One more for me, and thanks again for taking my questions, I will pass it along. You referenced the jump into the US collision market with the deal. How do we think about US collision here? My understanding is you didn't have a ton of exposure to that market, and I know the US collision sector from talking to the LKQs and Coparts of the world, has certainly been strong, and feels like it is going to be strong for the next few years. What do you think you opportunity is in U.S. collision?","Nicholas Pinchuk","We like it for a few reason, one is we believe car liner is a great brand, but we smear the Snap-on over it even stronger. Secondly, this is a space which is changing, different materials are requiring different modes of collision repair. And car liner's the out front on that regards with their product line and our research and engineering can augment those 50 or 45 engineers at car liners to make them better. Thirdly, we think that repair start to become more important in collision shops because there is intelligent distributor around the car.","You get a dent you got repair things and so we can bring the repair aspect the collision shops something no one else can do in this space. Our products in terms of our physical products and data base associated with repair. So we think it\u2019s a great coherent acquisition.","David Kelley","All right great. I appreciate the color. Thanks again.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Stember from C.L. King.","Scott Stember","Good morning. Can you maybe talk about Brexit, your initial observations, whether you have seen any impact on the UK market? And either from a sales or a currency perspective? And then, maybe just to talk about your expectations for currency. It looks like we still have some headwinds. I know initially before Brexit there was a thought that later in this year, that the comparisons would start to flatten out. Can you maybe talk about those two things?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Yes, look Brexit of course as I referred is a challenge for as part of the turbulence in Europe. But in fact if you look at the three pieces of our businesses in Europe, if you look at the Tools Group up strong in the U.K., you look at RS&I up nicely but you look at SNA Europe and SNA Europe was up in the quarter again I think it was the 12 straight quarter of growth. That was down slightly.","So Brexit might have hurt them a little bit, it really would but generally overall volume it was great market for Snap-on. U.K. was one of our better market. The problem is in the currency so it becomes a big liner in terms of - it becomes a big effect in terms of sales, translation effect on our sales because we have pretty good sales in pounds and secondly remember we\u2019re selling into the British market, selling in pound but we\u2019re making in dollars, we\u2019re making in United States. So we have a transitional impact.","So if you step back and you look at our currency overall for the corporation that $2.22 it has $0.05 of currency impact and a lot of that was the U.K., a lot of that was the UK. Of course there were some other factors in there. And then looking forward when you start at look at the UK kind of went down in the quarter so we think kind of like from a sales perspective looking forward we probably don\u2019t see as much pressure from translation but the profitability will be about the same maybe a little bit more impacted going forward because of the pound.","Now going out beyond where are now. That\u2019s based on where we sit today in terms of the pound. If the pound gets weaker it will impact us more. But that\u2019s the major factor. We think our product and our improved capabilities overwhelm the sales factor, the selling factor just the currency sensitive factor.","Scott Stember","Got it. And the last question on weather again, taking a different slant, the record warmth that we have had this summer, maybe for air-conditioning related products, have you seen any jump in demand for any tools that are related to any AC repair?","Nicholas Pinchuk","I am sure that happened but I can\u2019t you quote you any figures on that, I haven\u2019t sliced the tools by virtually AC repair. That is one of the thing that does happen. Every year there is a new story about that, it\u2019s a hard winter or short winter and people have different tools. The cool thing about Snap-on is, we have the widest product line, so whatever the conditions we have something to sell into those conditions.","Scott Stember","Got it. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks so much for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.","Gary Prestopino","Hi, good morning. A couple of questions. Did you call out what the European hand tools business was up on a percentage basis this quarter, Aldo?","Aldo Pagliari","I did not but it\u2019s up mid single - I think maybe mid single-digit.","Gary Prestopino","Okay.","Aldo Pagliari","Sorry go ahead.","Gary Prestopino","No, I was just going to say, that\u2019s about where it\u2019s been all year right.","Aldo Pagliari","Yes, it\u2019s been around that level, yes, it\u2019s been growing. I mean, it\u2019s still, I hate to say this but it\u2019s still got headroom. I mean it\u2019s still below where it was at its peak, maybe 15% or so below where it was but we think it\u2019s got headroom and the profitability 14 up straight quarters. We know that has a runway.","Gary Prestopino","Okay.","Aldo Pagliari","That\u2019s a good thing for us.","Gary Prestopino","Right, okay, so good things for it. And then, could you give us some idea of what Car-O-Liner's growth has been historically, and where you think you can take that? Top line growth?","Nicholas Pinchuk","I don\u2019t think we\u2019re looking backwards in terms of growth. We like to look forward and we see this as a kind of in the 5 plus vicinity, RS&I type. When you think of the RS&I type business growth that\u2019s where we see it, the 5 plus type business. I think it\u2019s a kind of a food errand to be true definitive looking forward but I can tell you that we think looking at it that\u2019s a solid projection.","Gary Prestopino","Okay. That is good. And then in terms of, it looks like year-to-date the corporate expenses are down about $13 million. Your SG&A is down as well. Is that all dealing with the pension expense on the market to market on the stocks?","Aldo Pagliari","It is Gary, the pension this year the way the accounting rules work we have a savings per quarter of about $1.9 million so you can multiply that by 3 and you get a year-to-date amount. And then the noise is created by how the stock price moves not just this year but remember you have to look at the movement relative to last year. For this particular quarter there is really no change of mark-to-market it\u2019s very benign. So most of the changes in corporate expenses this quarter is related solely to pension expense.","Nicholas Pinchuk","How we look at it the quarter is down I think year-over-year like 1.2 million something like that, 22.5 versus 22.7 but the penalty for currency was well more than offsetting that. That's good news out of pension. So we think we ended up on the short end of that combination.","Gary Prestopino ","Okay, that\u2019s all I have. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our last question from Richard Hilgert with Morningstar.","Richard Hilgert","Thanks for taking my question. Good morning everybody. All of my questions have already been asked, congratulations on a great quarter, good to see the continued improvement and the profitability across the group still, and still seeing that nice growth in the financial services area. And, appreciated that little bit of color earlier on the differentiation between what is going on in hand tools, and the growth in financial services.","Just a final question remaining for me was, I noticed that on a percentage basis, if you take a look at your intersegment number, on the breakdown for revenue with the segments, it has gotten a little bit larger, compared to history. It is running now above 14% number as a percentage of the total, of the segment revenues. And on an absolute basis, now up to $139 million. Just curious what is driving that and should we be expecting that percentage to be a higher amount of the total going forward?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Yes, no kidding, it will grow because of the Tools Group has been growing. If you think about it the Tools Group it\u2019s got its own factory but it\u2019s got that great distribution. So inside C&I there are factories like the power tools factory and so on like other places that sell, they sell externally but they also sell to the Tools Group SNA Europe does that, RS&I has some divisions that do that. We\u2019ve torque wrenches in C&I that do that do that out in California so sell in both places. So as the Tools Group grow, you will see inter-company sales grow, it\u2019s a natural outcome of that.","Richard Hilgert","Okay, great. Thanks you very much and again congrats on the quarter.","Operator","That concludes today's question and answer session. At this time I would like to turn the conference back to Leslie Kratcoski for any additional or closing remarks.","Leslie Kratcoski","Thanks everyone for joining us today.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski. Please go ahead.","Leslie Kratcoski","Thanks, Jennifer, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-On's second quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning.","We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-On's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-On's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.","As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussions.

Nick?","Nick Pinchuk","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning everybody. As usual, I'll start with some of the highlights of our quarter. I will speak about the general environment, the trends we see, some of the headwinds we have encountered and the progress we\u2019ve made. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.","We believe that our second quarter further demonstrated Snap-On's ability to continue its trajectory of positive results over coming headwinds and period and period variations. We\u2019re encouraged by these results. Like every quarter, we had disparity from group to group and within each group.","The van business remains below trend, and some segments and some geographies still a down period, but once again our strength overcame diagnostic progress in the van network, broad gains in the critical industries and rise in our software products across our business. Those gains overcame the variations and moved us forward again.","Our reported sales of the quarter were up 33.2 million or 3.6% to 954.6 million including positive foreign currency translation of 13 million. They also reflected an incremental 8.1 million from acquisitions, including last year\u2019s Norbar operations and this year's FASTORQ business.","Now, organic sales for the rose 1.3% with strong activity in critical industries and in diagnostic and repair information product, some of our higher margin areas. The OpCo margin was 20.2% reaching 20% for the first time, representing a 30 basis points increase over 2017 including an unfavorable 10 basis points drag from lower margin acquisitions and 20 basis points of favorable currency, profitability that demonstrates the ability of Snap-On value creation that consistently drive earnings growth.","For financial services, operating income grew to 57.8 million from last year's of 54.6 million that result combined with OpCo to raise our consolidated operating margin to 24.2%, up similar 30 basis points. Earnings per share, they reached $3.12 including a $0.01 benefit related to the implementation of the U.S. tax legislation. That EPS was up from the $2.60 recorded last year, a rise of 20%. So those are the numbers.","From an overall macro perspective, we do believe the automotive repair arena remains favorable. The Tools Group didn\u2019t return to growth, but we did see sequential improvement and we do see further opportunities for advancement. The other side of order repair activity, repair system information of the RS&I Group encountered a period of unevenness across the business. Higher sales of diagnostic and repair information to independent repair supplements and manager verses a decline in the equipment area, despite that we like RS&I's progress and capitalizing on the rising requirement for database solutions and vehicle repair.","Snap-On has a growing array of leading products to take advantage of that trend, new repair tools, hardware and software like the innovative midrange Apollo handheld diagnostics, incorporating intelligence diagnostics in its two year data package. And in products like our continuing improving Mitchell 1 ProDemand repair information software, strong offerings like those in software and data arena and data areas served RS&I and Snap-On very well in the quarter.","For the commercial and industrial or the C&I Group, organic sales were up mid single digits, solid organic growth across sectors and geographies, and the critical industries double digit improvement around the world strengthened places like aviation, natural resources, military and general industry, progress in almost every sector also encouraging for C&I.","SNA Europe, our European hand tools business delivering another quarter of sales growth, and our Asia Pacific division registering solid increase in key countries like India, Indonesia and Japan. So, overall, the results remain favorable. The Tool Group, sequential improvement, but not back to growth. RS&I uneven results but propelled by advancement in diagnostics and information products, offset by challenges in undercar equipment and strong gains in the critical industries of C&I. The opportunities out way the challenges and the results show it.","In the operating income margin clearly demonstrated once again the leverage and the power of Snap-On value creation, safety, quality custom connection, innovation and rapid continues improvement. Those are the principles guiding our organization in the ongoing development of our product and solutions, borne out of the insights and observations gathered at our customers' workplace which together with RCI helps drive the product and margin progress again. Well, that's the macro overview.","Now, let's move to the segment. In the C&I Group, organic sales were up 4.4% including 8.1 million from Norbar and FASTORQ and 5.8 million of favorable foreign currency as reported volumes rose by 9%. The operating income of C&I improves to 14.5%, a 60 basis point rise from 2017. Volume in RCI will offset 30 basis points from unfavorable currency and a 10 basis points impact from those recent acquisitions.","For the industrial division, the progress across the critical industries was broad based at double digits with most sectors and most geographies advancing in the quarter. We believe the reasonably positive macroeconomic conditions coupled with an array of new products that saw a critical path to driving those gains and they are continuing.","Speaking of critical industries and product, one of the great demonstrations of customer attraction and innovation has been our automated tool control system ATC the smart took box that keeps track of repair tool, avoiding foreign object damage that's important in so many places, made in our Algona, Iowa and Conway Arkansas plant. It's been a forefront of our extension of critical industries and it keeps evolving.","Just recently adding a fingerprint feature to the basic card ID access protocol and we have also launched a new facial recognition access system that expands ATC's adaptability and application helping support ongoing international placement. ATC, a spearhead, a Snap-On -- a spearhead for Snap-On in critical industry, it's already recognized at the top of the line and tool control and we're making it stronger.","Precision is becoming increasingly important in critical situations, and torque products are significant enabler in that trend. We've been building our torque capabilities to match that direction. In this quarter, our City of Industry, California torque operation, combined with our Sturtevant Richmont acquisition in Illinois to extend the Sturtevant Richmont digital torque control series, the DTC.","The first facility of Sturtevant Richmont interchangeable heads in the compact package of a City of Industry, micro torque electronics they've been combined at another dimension to our DTC line. It gives us more to sell in critical heavy assembly operations where the space is often tightened and ability to adapt wrench head size is quite valuable as the technician moves from application-to-application. We believe we have a winner in the new digital torque control series and early customer feedback confirms it.","In the late last quarter, we introduced a new half inch pneumatic impact wrench, the PT650 power tool, manufactured at our Murphy North Carolina facility right here in the U.S. You might remember that top of the line PT850 introduced to accolades last year, 810 foot pounds in power while still waiting a relatively light 4.3 pound, the go-to-tool for the top professionals, top tech love it.","Well, late in June, we introduced its little sibling, the PT650 power tool, also from the Murphy plant, little less power, little 50 and of course more economical. It's an attractive package aimed at the entry level technician and we hear good things about its reception. To C&I a promising quarter, moving down its runways for growth, extending to critical industries and driving strong profitability.","Now onto the Tools Group. Organic sales down 1.5%, reflecting primarily a low single digit decline in the U.S. and essentially flat international results. Operating earnings 79 million, down 2.1% and OI down to 0.1% and OI margin of 19.2% lower by 30 basis points, but still among the groups strongest. We do believe our actions to reinvigorate the van channel, our bearing fruit. This quarter they didn't increase -- create an overall increase, but they did positively affect the U.S franchise operations. Tool storage showed some recovery.","Lead by the new high margin mid range KCP1422 and by handheld diagnostics also made progress, authoring another increase in software sales. As we rollout more Apollo and ZEUS unit with the revolutionary intelligence diagnostic feature, the data package sales that accompanies most of those units builds our software penetration, and software sales did grow again this quarter. You can see it in the Tools Group's gross margin. It rose to 45.9% up a 150 basis point.","Now do impart the favorable currency, but that also reflected a big boost from the power of our new products, beyond the financial numbers. We do see continuing strength in other areas, advancements in our network are also evident franchisee health metrics, indicators we monitor and evaluate regularly, and again this quarter they remain favorable and that positivity was not just from our own measures we again acknowledge by outside publication, listing Snap-On as a franchise of choice both interest the U.S and abroad.","We finished number 11, up two spots in entrepreneur magazine list of top global franchises published in June. Entrepreneur ranks, the top 200 global franchisees by using 150 data points formula factors like cost and fees, franchise support, branch strength, financial strength, stability and international size and growth. Now, this type of recognition reflects the fundamental and contemporary strength of our franchises in our overall van business. We wouldn't have been achieved without innovative new products.","I just spoke about the introduction of our Snap-On KCP1425. We spoke about it last quarter as well, a full featured mid-tier tool storage unit with greater capacity in a compact footprint, made in Algona, Iowa released at the end of March. It was a clear success and it did help our tool storage line move forward. And we believe that our new socket line, the Flank Drive Extra, we call it FDX, will have a significant long-term positive impact out of our Milwaukee plant, the FDX is the simply the most important innovation in socket design since the original Snap-On Flank Drive System was introduced decades ago.","The new FDX delivers improved turning power, better stationer engagement in greater strength. The patent innovation is that a grips the fasteners further off the corner with a more angled socket wall for greater turning power as much as 50% more on damaged round and fasteners, very important in a garage. It has an optimally chamfered lift on the hex end, additional leverage on shallow headed fasteners and fasteners with limited top clearance. The contour of outer wall enables easier socket removal and the large clearly identifiable markings on the socket size, make picking the correct size fast and easy even in dimly lit spaces. It was launched in June, the initial response has been quite enthusiastic and we believe it should be. Well, that's a Tools Group.","Now onto RS&I, as reported sales of 343.1 million, up 1.5% including positive currency translation of 4.9 million -- including positive currency translation of 4.9 million. Organic sales were flat reflecting mid single digit sales gains of diagnostics and repair information products to the independent repair shop owners and managers, flat OEM dealership activity and mid single-digit decline in undercar equipment. Now RS&I operating earnings in the quarter increased 6.5 million or 7.9% to 88.7 million. The operating margin was strong 25.9%, up 160 basis points overcoming 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency translation, a margin gain that was again driven by innovative product.","Repair shop products like our NEXIQ pocket HD handheld diagnostic for the heavy duty truck market specifically designed using customer connection for OEM and aftermarket repair centers or for fleet maintenance facilities. The pocket HD provides immediate access to critical diagnostic information for heavy duty repair. It's both versatile and reliable with the larger display and user friendly features, whether you're responsible for maintaining a large fleet or just responsible for a truck or two. The intuitive software of the pocket HD makes diagnostic easy. It comes preloaded with the standard heavy duty and light medium truck data and it also offers software for particular filter like regeneration and anti-lock system software, which covers both Bendix and Meritor WABCO systems. The new pocket HD is a powerful addition to any truck shop and we believe it's a winning product.","Late last year, we launched the ZEUS, our top of the line handheld diagnostic. In April of this year, we introduced Apollo, our midrange handheld. With those new products, we further differentiate our offerings from competitors by giving professionals access to our intelligent diagnostics features and our proprietary databases in a handheld. Early sales have been strong for both models, and as I've said previously, the data packaging feature has been a big plus. And when you put those advancements together with a continuous gains being registered by Mitchell 1 one with its repair information software and with its shop management system, software sales at RS&I are also on the clear rise, matching the trend in vehicle repair and driving profitability.","So to wrap up RS&I, you can say improving positions with repair shop owners and managers growth in diagnostics and information offsetting the other areas, organic sales are flat but profits and margins up nicely. Those were highlight of our quarter. Tools Group, still off, but improved. C&I reporting an overall strong performance especially in critical industry and RS&I expanding strength in diagnostic and repair information, progress along our runways for coherent growth and clear advancements down our runways for improvement, overall sales increasing organically by 1.3%. OpCo operating income margin of 20.2%, up 30 basis, EPS $3.12 in the quarter 20% higher than last year. It was an encouraging quarter.","Now, I will turn the call over to Aldo, Aldo.","Aldo Pagliari","Thanks Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $954.6 million in the quarter increased 3.6%, reflecting 1.3% organic sales gain, $8.1 million of acquisition-related sales and $13 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales gain this quarter particularly reflects strong sales in critical industries and in diagnostics and repair information products.","Consolidated gross margin of 51%, increased 70 basis points primarily due to benefit from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives and 10 basis points of favorable foreign currency, partially offset by higher material and other costs. The operating expense margin of 30.8% compared to 30.4% last year, primarily due to higher cost and 10 basis points of operating expenses from acquisitions, partially offset by 10 basis points of favorable foreign currency.","As a result, our operating margin before financial services of 20.2%, improved 30 basis points from 19.9% last year. Financial services revenue of $82 million and operating earnings of $57.8 million increased 5.5% and 5.9% respectively from 2017. Consolidated operating margin of 24.2% of revenues improved 30 basis points from a year ago. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 23.8% was a decreased by 20 basis points as a result of a $500,000 tax benefit related to newly issued guidance associated with last year's U.S. tax legislation.","Excluding this benefit, the effective tax rate for the quarter as adjusted was 24.0% and compared to 30.6% a year ago. Finally, net earnings of $178.7 million to $3.12 per diluted share compared to $153.2 million at $2.60 per diluted share a year ago. Excluding the aforementioned tax benefit, net earnings as adjusted was $178.2 million at $3.11 per diluted share, up 19.6% compared to last year.","Now let\u2019s turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I Group on Slide 7, sale of $337.8 million in the quarter increased 9%, reflecting a 4.4% organic sales gain, $8.1 million of acquisition-related sales and $5.8 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase primarily includes double-digit gains in sales to customers in critical industries and a slight increase in our European-based and tools business, partially offset by a low single-digit decrease in sales of power tools.","Sales growth within the critical industries of business was broad-based across the end markets we serve, including both U.S and international aviation, natural resources, the military and technical education. Gross margin of 39.4% increased 40 basis points, primarily due to higher sales volume in RCI, partially offset by 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. The operating expense margin of 24.9% improved 20 basis points compared to last. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $49 million increased to 14% and the operating margin of 14.5% improve 60 basis points from 2017.","Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-On Tools Group of $411.9 million decreased 0.5%, reflecting a 1.5% organic sales decline, partially offset by $4.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales decrease includes a low single-digit decline in the United States, while sales internationally were essentially flat. Although, sales were again lower year-over-year in the United States, the percentage decline was less than that experienced in Q1, reflecting some sales recovery in the United States due in part to a modest year-over-year increase in sales of tool storage.","Gross margin of 45.9% improved to 150 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to 70 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects, higher sales of higher margin products and benefits for the Company's RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 26.7% increased 180 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the higher cost and the effect of the lower sales. Operating earnings for the Snap-On Tools Group of $79.0 million decreased 2.1% and the operating margin of 19.2% compared to 19.5% in 2017.","Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9, sales of $343.1 million increased to 1.5%, reflecting essentially flat organic sales and $4.9 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales level includes a mid single digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products, largely offset by a mid single-digit sales decrease of undercar equipment. Sales to OEM dealerships were essentially flat.","Gross margin of 48.1% improved to 120 basis points primarily as a result of a shift in sales that included higher volumes of higher gross margin products and benefits from RCI, partially offset by 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. The operating expense margin of 22.2% improved 40 basis points over the last year. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $88.7 million increased 7.9% from prior year levels. The operating margin of 25.9% improved to 160 basis points from last year despite the 20 basis points of negative currency effects.","Now turning to Slide 10. Operating earnings from financial services of $57.8 million and revenue of $82 million increased to 5.9% and 5.5% respectively from year ago. Financial services expenses up 24.2 million increased 1.1 million, primarily due to an approximately 800,000 increase and provisions for losses on finance receivables, which totaled 13.6 million in the quarter.","On a sequential basis, finance receivable provision expense was down $2.2 million from $15.8 million in the first quarter, reflecting some further stabilization in the portfolio credit metrics. As a percentage of the average portfolio, Financial Services expenses were 1.2% in both the second quarters of 2018 and 2017.","The average yield on finance receivable in the second quarter was 17.7% compared to 17.9% in 2017 driven principally by product mix. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 9.1% for both 2017 and 2018. Total loan originations of 276.1 million increase 5.5 million or 2% as a result of higher originations of contract receivables. Originations of finance receivables were down only slightly.","Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2 billion of gross financing receivables including 1.77 billion from our U.S operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio grew $20.4 million in the second quarter, as for the 60-day plus delinquency trends, they are stable year-over-year and in the United States have come down sequentially from the first quarter, which we view as an indicator of further stability in the portfolio.","As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, the largest portion of the portfolio trailing 12 month bet losses of $51.5 million represented 3.17% of outstanding at quarter end, a 56 basis points year-over-year, but only 9 basis points sequentially, which is less than the sequential increases experienced over the last several quarters.","Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $186.9 million in the quarter, increased $59.8 million from comparable 2017 levels, primarily reflecting higher net earnings and an increase from net changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used by investing activities of $63.7 million included net additions to finance receivables of 40.3 million and capital expenditures of $20.6 million.","Net cash used by financing activities of $105.3 million included cash dividends of $46.3 million and the repurchase of 371,000 shares of common stock for $55.2 million under our existing share repurchase program. Year-to-date share repurchases totaled 646,000 shares for $98.7 million. As of the end of June, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $345.1 million of common stock under existing authorizations.","Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivables decreased $8.5 million from 2017 year-end levels due to $12.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency, day sales outstanding of 64 days improved by 2 days in 2017 year end. Inventories increased $29.5 million from 2017 year-end as a reminder, the year-to-date increase in inventory included $20.9 million related to the recognition of an inventory asset associated with the adoption of ASU Topic 606 on revenue recognition.","On the trailing 12 month basis, inventory turns of 3.0 compared to 3.2 at year end 2017. By quarter end cash position of $112.3 million increased $20.3 million from 2017 year-end levels. Our net debt to capital ratio decreased to 23.7% from 27% at year-end 2017. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter end, we had $115.5 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.","That concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?","Nick Pinchuk","Thanks, Aldo. The Snap-On's second quarter, Tools Group, still off but improving. OI margin at 19 .2%, one of its highest. C&I, the extension to critical industries continuing a positive trend. OI margin at 14.5%, up 60 basis points against unfavorable currency and unfavorable acquisition. RS&I sales flat but the gains in diagnostics and information driving OI margins to a very strong 25.9% up 150 basis points from last year. It all came together for an organic sales rise of 1.3%, overall OI margins of 20.2% and an EPS of 3.12 up 20%.","And we believe, the trajectories demonstrated in the quarter, the progress of diagnostics, the gains in critical industries and rise of software are significant trends that bodes well for continuing progress along our runways for growth. We also believe that the results for quarter are strong testimony to the power of Snap-On value creation, especially customer connection innovation in RCI to drive significant profit and margin achievement even in challenged situations. This was an encouraging quarter, positive for the present and promising for the future. And we're confident that we have the products, the business models and the team to continue our positive trend throughout 2018 and beyond.","Now, before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I know many who are listening, the progress of the second quarter would not have been possible without your contribution for your achievements in delivering this performance, you have my congratulations and for your support of our efforts and your commitments to our team, you have my thanks.","Now, let's turn the call over the operator. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Liam Burke with B. Riley FBR.","Liam Burke","Nick, you mentioned in the core Snap-On Tool Group, you saw a modest step up in storage sales from call stabilization. You were down organically. Can you give some color on how the hand tool business did? And how new product introductions went this quarter into the channel?","Nick Pinchuk","Well, hand tools were off a little bit, not much, but slightly. You could call it in the low single-digit. So it's really kind of you would call it flattish sort of, but down a little bit for the arithmetic purposes. The introduction of the new 1422 that mid-tier tool storage unit, was its fairly buckle and it helped to ignite better tool storage. Tool storage was up slightly in the quarter. So we saw some come back off course just barely, but it was up in the quarter which has been our first up in awhile, so we feel pretty positive about that.","And the new product introductions associated with diagnostic tended to drive some positivity. The hand tools business you know I referred to FDX, the new wrenching system, I mean the new socket system that we have, and we're very bullish on that, but it was introduce late in the quarter so it didn\u2019t make that much of a difference in this quarter. Diagnostics show some increases and software off course was up which helped drive profitability. The Tools Group margins, the 45.9 I think is maybe a all-time high. So those products were very good for us.","Liam Burke","And you've mentioned in the C&I business you've had new introductions on the power tools side. The power tools were down in the quarter since just the timing of introduction and new products or is there anything in power tools that are proving to be challenging?","Nick Pinchuk","No, the power tools on a C&I side rises or falls with the introduction in new product, and I talked about the PT650 which is the little sibling of something we produced last year. So one, in the quarters, we had somewhat earlier release last year of the big brother, the PT850, so you\u2019re up against that one, and this one came out I said I think in the late June. So you really didn\u2019t see an effect in that and you have that kind of disconnect.","And of course, there is the question of power tools in C&I sales primarily itself externally but also sales big to the Tools Group. So there is a little bit of lag in terms of and disconnect between those two, going to inventory and selling that will sometimes drive differentiation in the quarter, but we think power tools has good things ahead of us because we like the power tools product that are coming out. We like the 650 and we like other things that will come out later in the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Leiker with Baird.","Joe Vruwink","Hi this is Joe Vruwink for David. Maybe just wrapping up product discussion for the Tools Group, so diagnostic in the quarter, it sounds like the overall category between tools and RS&I was up by some amount where the diagnostics sales into that tool channel up as well.","Nick Pinchuk","Yes, diagnostic, the handheld diagnostics were up low single digit to couple percent, the big thing is you know you got those big ticket but higher margins diagnostic units of Apollo and ZEUS. Now, we often say that they have to share the margins with RS&I, but Apollo versus its predecessor is higher margin, so that\u2019s why you're seeing the impact on margins.","Joe Vruwink","And then, there has been quite of lot of work done in tool storage not just a new product, new feature at the mid-level as you've been renovating the Rock 'n' Roll cabs. Was that an ongoing effort through Q2, so that Q2 would necessarily reflect a full three months benefit from all of these items and really I know Q3 is tough because the other conference, but Q3 would really be the first quarter everything is consistently selling for three months?","Nick Pinchuk","Yes, that\u2019s right, I mean, it wasn't ongoing and we\u2019re putting on the 3D modeler on the vans on the Rock 'n' Roll cabs. The Rock 'n' Roll cabs are I think our franchises continue to tell us they are very effective, so you'd be entitled to that. Now remember, I say and I say this every third quarter that our third quarter can be a little squirrelly because we have the conference and it depends how many days or guys in the field all those things. But you will see the full force of that product going on and that feature going on in the second half. So, we\u2019re pretty positive about that.","Joe Vruwink","And when you set back and just think about because for the big ticket categories, diagnostic and tool storage, that\u2019s a pretty sharp rebound, higher compared to what the trend has been recently. When you think about just the new products that helped drive that, is it more than just a one quarter phenomenon? Are we looking at getting these products in front of the entire network and so we have three more quarters of benefit? Just how are you thinking about that?","Nick Pinchuk","All I\u2019m thinking that we\u2019re going to have late because I mean we think, if you\u2019re talking about big ticket items, we think the diagnostics unit keep driving. And of course, if you think about this the driving of new software, you can look at the numbers about one third, let say software starts to increase dramatically because only single digits of the people were buying subscriptions. Now one, third of installed base was taking updates in a year. But when you do as ZEUS, more than 90% have taken a data package and Apollo closed to 90% have taken the data package.","And those are subscriptions, and so those represent a significant portion of the installed base. So that's what driving -- that annuity out, there is what's driving the software growth in the Tools Group. And we see that going forward more than anything and as well as the further sales of those. And then we have new products ready to rollout as well. Now, one of the things I will tell you that I think has good legs as to socket wrenching system, so I think that will keep going.","Joe Vruwink","And then last question from me so, obviously, these big ticket products are supported by Snap-On credit, and the portfolio has really done a nice job and kind of normalizing, so the improve -- the increase I should say in delinquencies, you are seeing that slow to pretty I would say normal levels. When you think of about supporting growth in these products on a go forward basis, will it be your expectation that the risk of the customer buying these products is pretty comparable to the current portfolio, so not so much and an increase in provision or delinquency is associated with this growth?","Nick Pinchuk","Yes, I'd say that. I think that's right. I mean I think the business is pretty well balanced now. I think like I said, like we said many times in many calls, the credit system is a kind of self-correcting system and it continually corrects both by us and by the franchisees. We think they are in a good spot now. Actually, we think the system is pretty balanced. You see originations kind of matching what big ticket is. You see sales by us matching or actually sales off the van are better than sales, our sales to the vans themselves. So, this makes for pretty good balance at least in a short-term. We feel pretty positive about where the Tools Group is. Now, I'd like to see growing off course, but it's certainly better than last quarter.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.","Bret Jordan","Question on the 1422. I guess the new tool storage lines, are the margins comparable in that mix versus the old tools storage categories?","Nick Pinchuk","Better.","Bret Jordan","Okay, and I guess because it seems like it's more content that you've been adding to, is this just you are passing that through [indiscernible]?","Nick Pinchuk","Look at the gross margin, 3 basis points. The thing is -- I think that's the most the telling thing. We're selling these products for that given away I mean fundamentally that's what RCI is about, customer connection innovation, rolling our products more content, getting your price and also being able to control your cost in the phase of even material changes.","Bret Jordan","Okay.","Nick Pinchuk","45.9, I believe, now we are not for sure, I think it's an all time high but it feels good.","Bret Jordan","Okay, so that was not just software driving margins higher?","Nick Pinchuk","The software was a factor, but it wasn\u2019t just software. The icons -- the 1422 is higher margin.","Bret Jordan","That's perfect.","Aldo Pagliari","And then, the franchisee of that or anything particularly new is going to be rolled around that sort of the catalyst.","Nick Pinchuk","But I'm not announcing it on this call. So, yes, we will roll out some things I think, and it looks like it's been better attended than at least for registrations right now better attended than ever before.","Bret Jordan","And then just as housekeeping and within C&I, what percentage is now critical industries, and I guess what of that critical industries is U.S versus international?","Nick Pinchuk","Let's see, well, look critical industry and C&I is about 40%, I would say, for government work 40% and it's about 25% maybe 30% international, yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn","Just wanted a step back on some of the big ticket launches with Icon and Apollo and ask about the process of getting that into the channel. I think initially you might recognize revenue ahead of end purchase. I imagine the sell-through lacks, the initial channel fill little bit. But can you explain how that works? And where the second quarter lies on that process?","Nick Pinchuk","I don\u2019t know, I mean, this is like every other product, we sell it to the franchisee, they take it and we book the sale expect for -- that\u2019s for all the product and then we -- in the case of diagnostics products, we track what we call activations. So, we know right away when they sold into the industry. And so when I\u2019m saying these products are, we not only sold more to franchisees, but we know that they are selling better off the van than anyone than their predecessors. Because we see the activations because they have to come back to us to activate the software, so we have that.","And then you know there is the whole data package question that appended to ZEUS and Apollo with the franchise sells that, but we don\u2019t book it, we amortize it over 36 months or 24 months depending on the period. And remember that, remember here that just to be clear, one of the things we monitor very clear is sales -- overall sales to end customers, for the quarter and for the year-to-date, the sales to end customers off the vans are higher than the sales and our sales to our franchisees.","Christopher Glynn","That was for the overall Tools Group, right.","Nick Pinchuk","Everything. Yes, everything, right, everything. Now, if you look at any particular product, particularly rolled out a new product of course it\u2019s a lack. There is the guys got to get trained, they got to socialize and we roll them out, regionally, so there is a lot of variation from product to product. But for sure, there is a significant -- we've been clear that deliver sales will be called, sales up vans have been for a long-term and clearly in the quarter, better off the vans and we sold to them and therefore the inventories are shrinking.","Christopher Glynn","Okay and then on the stories, congrats on getting that up in the quarter. As I understand that the second quarter comp might have been especially easy in the second half what in 17 wasn't down quite as much. So, what would be some wisdom you might impart as we think about that?","Nick Pinchuk","See, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think I worry so much about those comps. I think this quarter was -- if I look at the absolute amount size, I was encouraged by the absolute amount of these quarters. So I'm not so concerned about rolling into whether the third quarter or the fourth quarter was down or up. I'm looking for a positive so sequential and year-over-year improvement.","However, I will again say that our third quarter was always squarely because you don\u2019t know how many weeks or how many days the franchise is going to sell, and it's always been so and I've said so on every call that I've faced the third quarter. But we're optimistic going forward, we see like I said, we saw some improvement and we do see opportunities going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.","Gary Prestopino","Nick, I think this is important question here and I don\u2019t know how you can maybe break it out for us. But it seems that with a lot of these new products that putting out and with data and more software being sold subscriptions. Can you give us an idea of just what percentage of the sales that you are doing right now, encompass data and software versus where they were last year at this time and where you think they may be able to go?","Nick Pinchuk","I can tell you this that the software sales in the Tools Group are up strong double digits. And the software sales in the sales group or maybe what would I say at quarter or quarter of diagnostic sales or maybe a third of diagnostic sales, so you can kind of triangulate around that time of thing. There are dribs and drabs in software at a lot of different places, but you can look at that. It's about a third of the diagnostic sales and we're up strong double digits in that particular.","And so that is very profitable, if you pivot to the RS&I Group, software comprises about a third of that business, and we're up mid-single digits there, but it's a much boarder thing in a much different industry. There is a little bit of double pounding because they're selling into Tools Group.","But it's still positive software, one of the cool things is our database is our common home, and they have given us better sales and that what's driving this kind of profitability. If you looked at our gross margins quarter, it's pretty strong. I usually don\u2019t talk about gross margin, but if you look at the overall businesses gross margin, I think it's an all-time high as well and it's being driven\u2026","Aldo Pagliari","I guess what I'm getting at is that, it seems that would more use to software, more use to data that there has been you are driving a little bit more a shift change in your product mix and that these gross margins at least not on a absolute number basis, but gross margin expansion should be sustainable as long as you keep selling these products and introducing new products. Is that kind of correct?","Nick Pinchuk","Sure, I mean the thing is, just think of it this way. The balance in the Apollo and the ZEUS was that we package the software. The data package was appended to the hard body, and therefore a figure out-of-the-box place, so we list that higher prices for our customers, but we sold them in pretty bigger number than a predecessor and that created a bigger software streams which will keep recognizing. So, we don\u2019t recognize a portion of that higher price because we wait, we recognize it month-by-month. So what you are seeing is a growing amortization of that in some cases, in many cases. So you will see that sort of annuity coming home.","Gary Prestopino","And then, is that fact that what you\u2019re doing with the software and data and all that, is that just because we're continuing to see more complexity in vehicles? I mean, is a lot of this being driven by the fact that you know maybe cars from 2010 on have more technology, more software and these mechanics need to have this?","Nick Pinchuk","Exactly, they need that and like you say, 40% of the repairs in car, overall car park required diagnostic unit, 80% of the repairs in the new car required diagnostic units and only getting worse, it's getting more complex. And we have the best one, the 1 billion record data base for smart repairs and almost a 100 billion data base for decoding, some of the codes when you don\u2019t have an easy solution, people are liking that why they are buying these products at strong prices.","Gary Prestopino","And then lastly.","Nick Pinchuk","And responding to that trend, and we\u2019re the only ones who have the data.","Gary Prestopino","That\u2019s important. And then lastly just on the, I know you doing a big refresh on the tool storage and with the vans and all that. Somebody may have asked this question, but I didn't quite get the answer. Where are you in that? Have you basically completed that or we still going to introducing more tool store unit and you have more tinkering with the van channel to go?","Aldo Pagliari","Well, I'll let you know when we're growing at much bigger. We keep making tinker. We tinker all the time. We make changes all the time. So, we will keep changing the tool storage, but this is a big. Now, when we come up to an SFC, we do have changes associated with tools storage line. We roll it out 3,495 franchises get to see it and so, we kind be ready for that. So, you\u2019re seeing some of that changes going on. And if that doesn\u2019t work, we will keep tinkering.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","I\u2019m just trying to understand question on originations, Nick. Your finance receivables are down. Your diagnostics were up. Your storage is up. You've got software increase obviously. How you reconcile that with finance receivables being down?","Nick Pinchuk","Well, I will let Aldo answer that. But I'll tell you -- part of it is -- that is fairly a direct correlation because there is a timing difference in lot of that. But Aldo, you want to\u2026","Aldo Pagliari","Yes, finance receivables are down 0.3%, so if you correlate that with the low single-digit, the increase in handheld diagnostics and full storage, and you\u2019re down a little bit in other products generally speaking. I think it triangles quite well, but there is that timing difference I think I mentioned. Right, but originations reflect sales of the franchisees off the van versus ourselves, but I think they triangulate very closely.","David MacGregor","Maybe I could follow up with you offline on that, to try and better understand some of the puts and takes. On the originations, you were up 2%, driven by growth in contract receivables. Can you talk about what\u2019s driving that growth? And how much of that is for franchises purchasing larger trucks and just more inventory versus maybe other factors that are play there?","Aldo Pagliari","That's a good portion of it is in fact van related when you have contract franchisees coming on board, when they start up or missing routes. Often times, they are financing to the end involve, but also there is some financing of working capital it's kind of normal, but that's been positive.","David MacGregor","And then how the franchises inventory levels stand at present, specifically on big ticket stores and diagnostics?","Nick Pinchuk","I think it's hard to specify individual pieces, but all I can tell you is, the sales off the vans are better than our sales to them. And so, that's being going on throughout the whole year. Now, franchise to franchisees, they may have more inventory or less inventory. I talked to franchisees who said both. I think you would say that, if it's a new product, they probably have more inventories than the less because they are rolling it out and they like to put it in front of customers. And when they see customers, they want to strike while the iron is hot. I think for stuff that's been around for a while, they have less inventory.","David MacGregor","And then, you've noted your reported delinquencies were stable year-over-year. I guess that marks the first year-over-year stability in about 10 quarters at this point. Does Snap-On become more accommodated on credit at the end of the quarter so as this marked a more permanent change for credit policy?","Aldo Pagliari","No, I don\u2019t think so. I think the policy -- we've again making some changes more at the beginning of the year and in middle of the year, but no change in that regard. I think what you are seeing is just an improvement in the base of activity and stabilization as I mentioned. Normally, you get sequential changes 0 to 10 basis points. This time, you saw a 20 basis points the improvement, if you look from Q1 moving into Q2. So I think this is overall stabilization.","David MacGregor","On the SFC, I guess last two years ago you had a greater SFC. Last year, it was a little disappointing. What are you going to do differently this year to support the stronger sort of order growth performance? Are you revisiting the whole bundling strategy or maybe if you can talk a little bit about that?","Nick Pinchuk","Sure, we learn something -- we do learn some things about the size that a hand tool bundles last year. We learned some things about the length of the [Indiscernible] speed, time period under which we were booking SFC orders. In other words, when you go to SFC, you could book orders out for delivery out through February. So this year, we're tightening that a little bit to be to make it more direct and understandable. I think our franchises like that and off course we are working harder on products.","Now, we think I'd say what based on registrations, it seems like this is going to be a pretty good one. So, the first step is getting people there, it looks like that's going to happen. Now, we think we have to learn the lesson. We've learned some lessons of last year. We expect that to work, but that's the art of -- sort of the art of the presentation.","David MacGregor","And then, you talked -- just to go back to tools for a second just quickly, your operating expenses in the tool segment were up 180 basis points. Can you just help us understand the main factors behind that increase?","Nick Pinchuk","Yes, we're trying to sell more and we -- so investing in support in terms of people in the field, in terms training, when we roll out something like the Apollo or the ZEUS, hey, complicated now. So, you got to put more time in training and supporting our sales. Our guys just don\u2019t -- they have a lot of other products to worry about, so you have to supplement that and that drives a lot of that.","So, it's not a surprise to me. If I close my eyes and I say and you told me that we rolled our products with intelligent diagnostics, and we have two of them in a field and then we rolled out a new different silhouette tools support box, which is again you want to sell the features and so. And we are talking about an FDX towards the end of the quarter which is new wrench, a new socket system. I would say we spent a lot of money trying to support that.","David MacGregor","Will that continue with that level over the next couple of quarters?","Nick Pinchuk","No, I think it depends on our feeling about how well our franchise and how well the training takes the first time. Usually, we're making assessment of that afterwards and we say, gee, do we need to roll some new market because our guys don\u2019t understand it at all. With products like this you want to make sure that both the seller and the customer appreciates the technology because as some people have said other people are offering cheaper stuffs.","David MacGregor","Last question from me, you've talked about the higher materials and other cost as a negative to consolidate gross margins. I guess, how do you expect second half to defer from the second quarter experience in terms of different\u2026","Nick Pinchuk","No, I\u2019m not really sure. I\u2019m not sure. For example, steel prices, we buy steel in the U.S. Our steel, the Milwaukee sockets are made with U.S steel. All our hand tools are U.S. steel and they rose 30% in last 18 months. So, I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going to happen in the future. It's hard to say where there will be more or less. Certainly, we think we can manage it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Stember with C.L. King & Associates.","Scott Stember","Can we just talk about RS&I, maybe just flush out, it looks like a diagnostic and software did well and the flatness really came from the undercar care or the under care equipment and flat OEM? Can you maybe just talk about I know there is lumpiness in the business, but maybe just talk about what\u2019s drove down in particular the undercar equipment side?","Nick Pinchuk","That\u2019s a good question. I mean that is the question there. I mean the thing is the flatness to the OEM is generally driven by the chronic lumpiness of that business, and we\u2019ve seen it go up and down pass, the equipment business was all up. I think its mid single digits or low single in the quarter and that is the little worse than it's been. And you got a couple of effects one is that, we had a couple of in some of the peripheral pieces that business like break ways and so on, we had some pretty big distributions last year in terms of some major OEM that did create a headwind.","And we had some difficulties around things like we change the deliveries associated with some of our in our collusion business and we had a little destocking with distributors. And around some of our lift factories had the same kind of things in terms of delivery. So, we had something that you could explain some of it. I think the rest of it is just, boy, it was a tepid quarter. So, we saw a tepid quarter and we had a couple of three things in there that you could make some explanation, but I don\u2019t think they added up to the whole downturn.","Scott Stember","So, it sounds like probably two thirds of it was more transitory or at least some of it goes away?","Nick Pinchuk","Yes, I mean I think it is our job is to try to six that. I mean we don\u2019t like it down there in that situation. So, we have to try to figure out how to deal with those -- the way we\u2019re dealing with the transitory stuff is couple of new products are rolling out. So some people might have been anticipating that and backing up. We've got some new products rolling out in a fall, so we will do that. We\u2019re going to take a look at that sourcing associated with the relationship with the distributors, and see if we can make sure that, it doesn\u2019t just throw us that air ball again. And so, that\u2019s all we do in that situation.","Scott Stember","All right and on power tools, did you just talk about how that did within the tool segment? And how that affected the intercompany sales on C&I?","Nick Pinchuk","Yes, look, the power tools business is up slightly in the Tools Group. Cordless tools sold pretty well in the quarter. You know that pneumatic that I talked about coming out of the C&I business was launched late, so wouldn\u2019t have any effect some on into the Tools Group. Generally, you saw the small tools that come from our Kunshan factory in China. The little 14.4 volts sell pretty well in the Tools Group, which created that positivity.","And then, they were really selling down some of the inventory they had from prior distribution from the C&I business. And we expect that a little bit to change as new products rollout from C&I, but that sort of it. Tools Group had a reasonably positive hold in the right -- but positive, holding their own in cordless though, weaker in pneumatic in the marketplace. And but some of that was driven by our smaller like cordless power tools that come out of Kunshan therefore in this quarter, the C&I power tools factory in Murphy didn\u2019t benefit from it.","Scott Stember","And just last question, you've talked about I guess the first salvo of tariffs that went out on steel and aluminum. Can you maybe just touch base on the last couple the $50 billion that were announced in 200 billion, how you guys can offset that going forward?","Nick Pinchuk","I think, if you talked about products, generally, we are sourcing the markets from where we -- we're sourcing the markets where we sell, so we generally have a fairly positive profile versus those kinds of interruptions. And if we don\u2019t, we have the ability to move things around the resource. So when we look at the list of tariffs, we think we're pretty well positioned for those things, and those things that we are not, that's our job to make the difference.","So at least that we look at it right now, we were not ringing our hands and worrying about them effectively. So, I think now things could change and things would be changing minute by minute with tariffs. So, I'm always saying to what I see right today and what's in place today we are okay.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski for closing remarks.","Leslie Kratcoski","Great. Thanks, everyone for joining us this morning.

Good day. And welcome to the Snap-on Incorporated 2015 First Quarter Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Leslie Kratcoski","Thanks, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's first quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer.","Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.","As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on our website next to the Audio icon for this call. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript.","Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs, or otherwise state -- management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.","With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?","Nick Pinchuk","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll start with the highlights of our first quarter and along the way I will give you perspective on our results, our markets and on the progress we've made. Then, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.","I believe that our first quarter once again provide a strong evidence of Snap-on advancing along our runways for both growth and for improvement. Our EPS in the quarter was a $1.87, up from a $1.62 last year, that rise reflects an opco operating margin of 16.7%, an increase of 120 basis points.","Combining those opco gains with earnings of $40.3 million from Financial Services brought Snap-on consolidated operating margins to 20.1%, compared to the 18.6% registered last year.","Our operating improvement in the quarter came on organic sales growth of 9.9%. Overall, sales in the quarter were $827.8 million, a rise of 5.1% from the prior year and those gains include a significant unfavorable foreign currency translation of $38.5 million or 540 basis points.","Now currencies headwind, it was last year, it\u2019s likely to continue throughout the year and if the present rates hold, it will rise somewhat going forward. But we are very encouraged by organic growth in both volume and profitability, and we believe both represent a continuation of our strengthening position and capability and of the generally favorable business environment for each of our operating groups.","For us the quarters result a testimony to the abundant opportunity along our runways for growth and of our ability to take advantage as conditions unfold. Like in past quarters, the environment surrounding our Automotive Repair related businesses, the Tools Group and RS&I, Group was generally positive. The changing technologies across the fleet continue to drive the need for new problem-solving products, making those markets robust.","In that regard the Tools Group has enhanced our franchise network with van productivity and with innovative marketing taking clear advantage of the favorability to sell more to existing customers and to reach new customers, all on its way to strong growth. At the same time, RS&I is also growing, capitalizing on those positives and utilizing its broader product line to expand repair shop owners and managers.","Now C&I, serving customers in critical industries and the most international of our groups does face more variations in the market. Its European operations are confronted with large differences across the business from the relatively calm U.K. to the turbulence in the Middle East to the challenges of Russia to the political uncertainties of newly elected governments in places like India and Indonesia.","But it\u2019s in past quarters, the opportunities outweigh those headwinds and when combined with our growing range of customer driven products and with our expanding capabilities aimed specifically at the needs of industries and customers, C&I again showed gains, extending in critical industries and building emerging markets.","Besides advancements on our runways for growth, we also made progress on our runways for improvement with Snap-on value creation and safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, our RCI as we call it.","RCI has become a part of the fabric, a daily activity at Snap-on. You can see it in the results. OI margin is up and you can see it advance like our annual RCI conference held recently just down the road in Illinois, nearly 400 people, almost 40 best practice teams came together to share ides, buy for awards and celebrate their progress, bringing the learning and enthusiasm back home to the local teams.","You can\u2019t help but walk away from these events encouraged and convinced that there's great potential for further improvement. Well, that\u2019s the environment. Of course, as it will always. There are headwinds.","Market-to-market variations in difficult macros, but despite the challenges our operations moved significantly along each of our runways for both growth and improvement and you could see it throughout the numbers.","Now let's move to the segments, in the C&I Group, organic sales were up 9.8% with contributions coming from our European, U.S. and Asian operations. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of $44 million, increased $4.9 million or 12.5% and that represents our margin rate for C&I of 14.8%, an expansion of 130 basis points.","SNA Europe again recorded volume growth. This time similar to that achieved by RCI -- by C&I overall, brought gains in many of our markets, led by selling strength and by products that generate real enthusiasm. But SNA Europe improvement in the quarter goes beyond sales growth and far those gains made from past restructuring.","Our initiative to improve productivity with focus on both costs and product development are clearly evident in the operations achievements and you can see it again this quarter. Organic sales were up, but profits, profits were up more. Illustrating the power of RCI even in the European environment that remains challenged.","Industrial division was also part of the C&I rise. It grew in a number of critical industries, areas like power generation, mining, railroads and the military, as everybody knows, the military sector remains uncertain. But having said that, we have made the most of the opportunities available, this time the opening arose with the changing roles of various units as the troops are redeployed back to the allied states. Actually, that\u2019s a major theme for our first quarter, making the most of the opportunities as they arise mid to turbulence.","Another big factor and again in critical industry were expanded product offerings targeted at practical workplace needs. One new example in the recent quarter was the with the PDX series of air drills, ideal for the aviation industry, made in our Murphy, North Carolina plant, these pneumatic drills are using application ranging from light assembly to metalwork, perfect for drilling ferrous and nonferrous metal, plastics and composite materials, the kind of versatility that\u2019s so helpful in aviation application. And the feeterrable trigger provides outstanding control and unparallel run out performance offering great accuracy.","Beside utility of the tool, the low sound, low vibration, soft grip and aluminum housing offers maximum comfort with reduced operator fatigue. Another attractive feature in the workplace to ease the professional\u2019s task and enable more consistency throughout the day. These drills are especially usual.","One performing important repair work on damaged aircraft still, an application that must be critical in nature. We believe we have another industry winner, the PDX drill, a Superior Aviation tool consistent with Snap-on name.","Our industrial division also has driven growth by leveraging the Snap-on RCI experience. Participating in several customer-sponsored lean events right on customer\u2019s side, side-by-side with the customer\u2019s local team. Snap-on people sharing their experiences and insight of rapid continuous, improving, helping customers solve their problems but all the -- problem -- but all the while, gaining deeper practical understanding of the crucial task in critical industries, creating opportunities to tailor our products to the work and to drive more sales.","We say we help professionals in solving the critical, RCI is becoming a tool to do just that. Our Asia-Pacific division also posted higher activity, registering progress, building the physicals and limiting the impact of the economic difficulties in Japan. I was just there, attending our annual reseller\u2019s conference this year within C&I in China, bringing together enthusiastic Snap-on associates and resellers from all across the region. New Asian-ized products were introduced. Training seminars were conducted and the group's enthusiasm confirmed our extended opportunities in Asia-Pacific. That\u2019s C&I.","Now on with the Tools Group. Organic sales up 12.9%, solid grow in all geographies. The groups operating earnings of $59.8 million represented a margin rate of 15.8%, up 150 basis points for the Tools Group. The results continue to speak for themselves. They clearly demonstrate ongoing progress along one of our runways for coherent growth, enhancing the franchise channel and there is abundant evidence of the strength of positive trajectory of that channel.","It is stated clearly in our franchisee metrics, financial and physical and poor indicators of network health likes sales per band and franchisee turnover. We monitor them closely and they are favorable across the board.","In our direct interactions with the franchisees, the meetings like 2015 kickoffs held all over the network earlier in the year. They were marked by -- I can tell you they were marked by enthusiasm and optimism by commitment and energy, gatherings of entrepreneurs and professionals confident in reaching higher. Our Snap-on value creation process, the process is also critical components of the Tools Group progress.","Innovative new products, many of these launched from the customer connections we observed on a daily basis. Those solutions, those products are significant players in driving the group\u2019s upward trajectory. An example is the KRL1163 Tool Storage Cab with the power tool organizer system based on customer connections made on our Rock N Roll Express bands. This model transforms the bottom drawer of the box into a customized secure, easy to access storage system for frequently used power tools.","It\u2019s a feature that can make technicians work easier. Visitors to our Rock N Roll Cab highlighted the need, our design teams made it a reality, customer connection to innovation to winning product.","Speaking of tool storage, this summer marks our 95th year in business. We\u2019ve just launched a special set of tool storage box, highlighting our long tradition of excellence with unique anniversary panel and custom red trim etched with the years, 1920 and 2015.","The new units also offer the Snap-on echo remote locking system, another customer connection driven option that we\u2019re confident will be quite popular. These special anniversary boxes are already gathering -- generating considerable excitement on the advance and in the shops. Lots of excitement around these blocks.","And we believe there will be strong sellers, clear testimony on the strength of the Snap-on brand and on the bond between Snap-on and professionals. More innovation can be seen on product like the new Snap-on half inch drive 3 six-inch breaker bar, the SHN-36 originally developed from customer connections of the heavy duty mechanics desiring more -- a longer handle for increased leverage. The addition of a soft grip provides added control on comfort and that\u2019s a premium when you're removing tires or adjusting tracks on construction and agricultural equipment, a loosening head bolts on large engine, a much improved product that will make work easier, innovation even on the most established product line.","Finally, I want to mention the Tools Group efforts with RCI. Progress, I think, it\u2019s clearly evident in the financials but to double down on a testimony, I spoke before of our annual RCI conference. While a team from Tools was awarded the grand champion at this year's event. The Tools Group rework center for their work on substantially reducing turnaround time, highlighting that at Snap-on. The shop floor has no monopoly on RCI. And illustrating that even an experienced organization like the Tools Group potential RCI opportunities abound up and down throughout and across the business.","And we can\u2019t talk about the Tools Group without speaking of its strategic partner about our financial services organization. With each quarters Snap-on Credit becomes more attuned just what programs can best aid our franchisees. And the first quarter demonstrated that progress clearly portfolio growth, profits up over 70% and all the while holding delinquencies to a relatively low level. Snap-on Credit, a greatest historic tools business, and you can see that relationship play out in the positive trend.","Now let\u2019s move to RS&I. The first quarter organic sales for RS&I rose 6.3%, broad gains with both OEM dealerships and with independent shops. Operating earnings of $63.9 million were up $5.8 million. The operating margin of 23.5% rose 140 basis points. I\u2019ve spoken often in the past about our line of successful handheld diagnostic units and they continue to drive growth and excitement in the independent repair space. And the first quarter was no exception with our VERUS PRO and MODI\u2019s ultra unit being recognized by undercar digest in this year\u2019s list of top 10 tools, continuing our strength of award-winning products with that publication.","Undercar digest bases its selection on the votes of actual users. The award confirms that our handheld diagnostics resonate strongly with professionals. And it demonstrates the power of customer connection and innovation in generating unique productivity solutions. That\u2019s what these stools are about.","The VERUS PRO and MODI\u2019s Ultra, they are also key components of our next generation advanced diagnostic work stations, launched in February. These new work stations include handheld diagnostic unit in docking station, a flat screen monitor and accustomed Snap-on tool box. They provide comprehensive diagnostic support to fix cars accurately and quickly and they go a long way in reinforcing the shops images having strong professional capability in the electronics arena, a feature we believe is of significant value to many independent garages as they strive to build customer confidence in this environment of rising vehicle technology.","With more than 800 workstation sold since the launch, this is another one of our hit products with over $1 million in first year sales. And it\u2019s another add to our growing track record of innovation success and it\u2019s driving sales progress.","Our equipment division also registered gains in the quarter with several national account in part exceeding by highlighting our expanding product bundle, including challenger lifts, Pro-Cut on-car brake lathes as well as the new undercar equipment and broad diagnostic offerings. Snap-on equipment increased productivity for the automotive repair shop networks and advantage rooted in our expanded and enhanced line of products.","Finally, we continue to see further progress with our Nexiq heavy-duty and fleet information systems, as well as progress with the improved functionality and comprehensive content contained in Mitchell1\u2019s ProDemand and SureTrack products. All are differentiating offerings that lead to more business.","Armed with those products, we achieved a number of multi-location customer wins in the quarter, displacing competitors and gaining traction across the marketplace. Snap-on innovates in the information products, unique database solution, effective navigation systems with speed to repair, all emphasizing our growing strength in vehicle information and they helped drive RS&I sales again this quarter. So that\u2019s the highlights.","Significant progress was made in the quarter. Organic sales rise 9.9%, along all our runways for coherent growth. EPS of a $1.87, up 15.4%. Gains achieved through our Snap-on value creation processes, RCI and customer connections especially shinning through, strengthening our business and driving to a 16.7% opco operating margin, up 120 basis points. It was an encouraging quarter.","Now, I will turn the call over to Aldo.","Aldo Pagliari","Thanks Nick. Our first quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on slide 6. Net sales of $827.8 million in the quarter were up 9.9% organically, reflecting broad-based growth across all of our operating segments. On a reported basis, net sales including $38.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation increased $40.3 million or 5.1% from 2014 levels.","As you know, Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations. Largely due to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our year-over-year sales comparisons by approximately 540 basis points.","Consolidated gross profit of $410.1 million increased $31.4 million from 2014 levels. The gross margin of 49.5% in the quarter improved 140 basis points, primarily due to benefits from higher sales, lower restructuring costs and savings from RCI initiatives.","Operating expenses of $272.2 million increased $15.2 million, largely due to higher volume related and other expenses, partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 32.8% increased 20 basis points from 2014 levels. No restructuring costs were incurred in the first three months of 2015.","Last year, we incurred $2 million dollars of restructuring costs. Pension expense in the quarter was approximately $2 million higher as compared to the prior year, reflecting updated pension plan assumptions for 2015, which include the effects of lower discount rates as well as increased life expectancies.","As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $137.9 million in the quarter, including $6.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased $16.2 million from prior year levels and as a percentage of sales improved 120 basis points to 16.7%.","Financial Services revenue of $57.4 million in the quarter increased 14.3% from 2014 levels, while operating earnings of $40.3 million increased 17.2%. The increases in both revenue and operating earnings primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio.","Consolidated operating earnings of $178.2 million in the quarter, including $6.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased $22.1 million or 14.2%. And the operating margin of 20.1% improved 150 basis points from 18.6% the year ago. Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 32%, compared with 31.6% last year.","Finally, net earnings of $110.5 million or a $1.87 per diluted share increased $14.6 million or $0.25 per share, representing a 15.4% increase in diluted earnings per share.","Now, let\u2019s turn to our segment results, starting with the Commercial & Industrial or C&I Group on slide seven. Sales of $297.5 million in the quarter were up 9.8% organically, primarily reflecting similar sales strength both in critical industries and in our European-based hand tools business.","Gross profit in the C&I group totaled $116.5 million in the quarter and a gross margin of 39.2% improved 40 basis points from 2014 levels, largely due to savings from RCI initiatives primarily in Europe.","Operating expenses of $72.5 million in the quarter decreased $1.1 million and the operating expense margin of 24.4% improved 90 basis points, largely due to sales volume leverage.","As a result of these factors, operating earnings for C&I segment of $44 million including $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $4.9 million from 2014 levels and the operating margin of 14.8% improved 130 basis points.","Turning now to slide eight. First quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $378.2 million increased 12.9% organically, reflecting comparable sales gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations.","Gross profit of a $166.3 million increased $18.3 million from 2014 levels and the gross margin of 44% improved 90 basis points, primarily due to benefits from higher sales. Operating expenses of $106.5 million increased $7.7 million from 2014 levels, mostly due to higher volume related expenses.","The operating expense margin of 28.2% improved 60 basis points, principally due to sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $59.8 million, including $3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased $10.6 million and the operating margin of 15.8% improved 150 basis points.","Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group showed on slide nine. Sales of $272.3 million in the quarter increased 6.3% organically from 2014 levels. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a high single-digit gain and sales of undercar equipment, as well as mid-single-digit gains in both sales to OEM dealerships and the sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers.","Gross profit of $127.3 million increased $9.3 million over 2014 levels and gross margin of 46.8% improved 190 basis points, principally due to savings from RCI and other cost reduction initiatives and $2 million of lower restructuring costs.","Operating expenses totaled $63.4 million in the quarter and operating expense margin of 23.3% increased 50 basis points, largely due to operating expenses of Pro-Cut, which was acquired in May of last year.","First quarter operating earnings for the RS&I group of $63.9 million, including $2.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased $5.8 million or 10% from prior year levels. And the operating margin of 23.5% improved 140 basis points.","Now turning to slide 10. In the first quarter, operating earnings from Financial Services of $40.3 million on revenue of $57.4 million, compared with operating earnings of $34.4 million on revenue of $50.2 million last year.","The average yield on finance receivables of 17.7% in the quarter, compared with 17.5% last year. And the average yield on contract receivables was 9.5% in both periods. Originations of $230.7 million increased 14.2% from 2014 levels.","Moving to slide 11. As of quarter-end, our balance sheet includes approximately $1.4 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.2 billion from our U.S. Snap-on credit operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. During the quarter, our worldwide finance portfolio grew approximately $23 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continued to be in line with our expectations.","Now turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $78.1 million in the quarter decreased $10.2 million from comparable 2014 levels as higher net earnings in 2015 were more than offset by net increases in operating assets and liabilities, largely as a result of $15 million discretionary domestic pension plan contribution as well as higher tax related payments in the current year. Net cash used by investing activities of $59.5 million included $38.6 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $18.1 million in the quarter were comparable to the prior year.","Turning to slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 60 days compared with 61 days at 2014 year-end. Inventories increased $6.8 million from 2014 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.6 compared with 3.7 turns at 2014 year-end. Our quarter-end cash position of $114.4 million decreased $18.5 million from 2014 year-end levels. The net decrease includes the impact of funding $198.8 million of new finance receivables, the repurchase of 340,000 shares for $49.7 million, dividend payments of $30.9 million, and capital expenditures of $18.1 million. These cash decreases were partially offset by $160.2 million of cash from collections of finance receivables, $78.1 million of cash generated from operations, and $22.8 million of cash from a net increase in short-term borrowings. Our net debt-to-cap ratio of 27.6% compared with 26.3% at 2014 year-end.","In addition to our $114 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities. And our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access commercial paper markets. At first quarter-end, we had $52.5 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.","This concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. Now, I will turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?","Nick Pinchuk","Thanks, Aldo. As our first quarter similar to our other quarters, growth and improvement, EPS of $1.87, up 15.4%. Once again, there were headwinds, varying economies, fluctuating currencies, and political unrest, but we overcame by finding and making the most of the opportunities. We made significant progress along our runways for growth, driven by new products and new customers, enhance the band channel. Tools Group organic sales up 12.9%. And we believe the network has never been stronger, expand with repair shop owners and managers, RS&I organic sales up 6.3%.","OEM, dealerships, and independent shops capturing new customers with the growing product bundle, extend the critical industries and build in emerging markets. C&I organics sales up 9.8%, SNA Europe progressing against the economic tied, our critical industry team building our understanding of those critical workplaces, launching new products aimed at those tasks and gaining position.","Once again, again this quarter we clearly saw the effects of Snap-on value creation, advancing down our runway for improvement. OI margin improvements are more than a 100 basis point in every group and an overall opco margin of 16.7%, an increase of 120 basis points. It was an encouraging quarter.","We believe it serves as more testimony, great testimony that our business models have the strength, our runways offer the opportunity, and our teams have the capability to continue to trend positive progress as we move forward even amid headwind.","Before I turn the call over to the operator, it\u2019s appropriate that I mention our franchisees and associates. I know many of you are listening today. The encouraging performance of the first quarter and the positive trends are continuing due to your contribution and commitment. For the result you\u2019ve authored, you have my congratulations and for your dedication and support to our team, have my thanks.","Now, I will turn the call over to the operator. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Tom Hayes with Northcoast Research.","Tom Hayes","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my questions.","Nick Pinchuk","Good morning, Tom.","Tom Hayes","Just wondering specifically on the C&I Group great organic growth. I was just wondering if there are any industries that maybe outperformed your expectations. And then correlated to that, just wondering about your exposure maybe to oil and gas market as they kind of have some challenges right now?","Nick Pinchuk","Yes. Look, I expect good news in every market, every quarter I think because we are not -- thing is we are in early days in penetrating critical industry. It\u2019s an aspect of coherent growth that what we\u2019re doing there is duplicating what we have done for automotive repair technicians all these years. We are doing it for other people and other industries you know observing work and making it easier with just the right tools, whether it\u2019s software or hardware.","And so an element of that is learning about the industry. So it\u2019s early days. Now we have very industries in there, aviation, the military, oil and gas, power generation, mining. One of the advantages of this is we don\u2019t really have much [indiscernible] in the way of share in these businesses. So therefore each quarter rise and falls not so much on the effect of the industry, just on our own performance.","So we have lumpiness from section to section or from industry to industry. In this particular quarter, we actually saw fine performance in places like I said in my power generation, mining, railroad, the military. The military was up this time because we were able to see opportunities. Aviation is a big business in that area. And oil and gas actually was up, even slightly in this quarter.","So we saw the usual lumpiness from operation to operation, but the critical industry business really is the driver behind C&I and you see the C&I growth across those segments. So I didn\u2019t see any particular surprises. I guess if you are looking at our business, you might say, ghee, they grew in oil and gas, even though the market was weak. My view was we don\u2019t have that biggest share in oil and gas. Therefore, we can grow against weak markets.","Tom Hayes","Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. Just one kind of follow-up question. I was just wondering on the -- how much share repurchase authorization you still have?","Aldo Pagliari","We\u2019re having about $215 million.","Tom Hayes","Okay. Thank you for the questions.","Nick Pinchuk","Sure.","Operator","We will take our next question from Liam Burke with Wunderlich.","Liam Burke","Thank you. Good morning, Nick.","Nick Pinchuk","Good morning, Liam. How are you doing?","Liam Burke","I am fine. Thanks. The organic growth of the Snap-on Tool segment is pretty strong, closer to the high-single digits. A lot higher than more of a mid-single digit expectation, what's driving that incremental growth?","Nick Pinchuk","Well, I think what\u2019s driving it is, is that the Tools Group team is understanding how to enable the franchisees that we have in various places. We have 4,800 worldwide. We have 3,478, I think in the United States are van. And they are learning quarter-by-quarter how to do it better. And that\u2019s allowing to sell more to same customers and reach other customers, which they had on their routes but they hadn\u2019t been calling on.","So the effects of these, I think maybe threefold. One effect is I think we\u2019ve talked about it many times. I think they\u2019re very cleverly breaking through the natural boundaries of that model by adding space with a Rock N' Roll Cabs and you can see it in the progression of the tool storage and breaking through the time by adding a help with things like the TechKnow vans.","Now I think, we have 66, 67 of Rock N' Roll -- 66 Rock N' Roll vans throughout the world now and we have now up to 35 TechKnow vans, that\u2019s about four since last quarter. And so you can see breaking that natural boundary is helping. Secondly, Boy, we\u2019re using as much as possible.","We using as much as possible our customer connection. We spent a lot of time in the shops and we\u2019re organizing that process and getting that information back into the innovation process and rolling out new products, like that 36-Inch Breaker Bar. People might look at that and say, what\u2019s that? It\u2019s just a long bar.","But the idea was -- it wasn\u2019t really available in the marketplace and the ones that were available aren\u2019t as comfortable. Innovation doesn\u2019t have to be earth shattering. It just has to make work easier in this space and the Tools Group is understanding how to do that. ","And then thirdly, they\u2019re looking at the franchisee and saying, we know your time is valuable. We\u2019re going to make it better. We\u2019re going to drive RCI into the vans and that\u2019s all resulting in this kind of thing. Their numbers were up 12.8% in the quarter, 12.9% in the quarter, 11.8% the quarter before that, 6% the quarter before that, 6.6% the quarter before that and 6% before that.","In fact, 19 of the last 20 quarters, they\u2019ve been 6% or above. And that\u2019s -- what\u2019s driving it all is tuning that business. It\u2019s kind of a -- if you step back and you look at the auto repair you would say, it\u2019s going to go better than GDP. 4% to 6% is what we say. But if you have capability that resonates with those franchisees like they figured out, you would see these kinds of numbers.","Liam Burke","And you touched on RCI across all businesses. They were providing incremental profitability along with volume increases. Can you push RCI in a similar fashion to the van channel?","Nick Pinchuk","Sure. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re putting RCI into the vans drivers. Now, things like -- I think I\u2019ve mentioned this before on the corporate things like when you repair a ratchet, repairing a ratchet was taking 15 minutes every ratchet. Sometimes, I was on vans where people brought on four ratchets to be repaired at one stop that would have killed the route that day.","But we have tools, kind of just like a factory. We are laying it out like a factory, like our van drivers can repair within three or four minutes now and number of things like that, so taking RCI, looking at the van, doing value stream mapping on the van and reducing the time. Adding to their selling time is part of the process, which is allowing them to reach out to more customers. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve been doing. Thanks for that question.","Liam Burke","Thanks Nick.","Nick Pinchuk","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Leiker with Baird.","Joe Vruwink","Hi. Good morning. This is Joe Vruwink for David.","Nick Pinchuk","Hi Joe.","Aldo Pagliari","Hey, Joe.","Joe Vruwink","Maybe staying with the Tools Group for a second, any products in the catalogue that\u2019s become kind of logical extensions of this recent company-owned van strategy? I should say\u2026.","Nick Pinchuk","I don\u2019t feel so. I think -- not any particular product. I don't think -- I'm sure I could go through launching of new products and find those that came from a company-owned store driver but only around customer connection. We have the van driver itself is the guy or an employee goes out there and he reports back as part and he gives us leads for new tool as part of the company-owned store and that flows back. But we don't really differentiate between a lead from a company-owned store and a franchisees.","But in my remarks, you might have heard the whole idea of the power tool draw organizer at the bottom -- at the tool storage box. That came from the Rock 'N Roll Cab and their company stores. They are not selling but their company stores are rolling there. People got on those Rock 'N Roll Cabs and they start talking about boy, wouldn\u2019t it be good if we had a power tool organizer at the bottom in one of these drawers.","We got that idea. We gave it to the engineers, they put it in place and we\u2019re rolling out this new product and it\u2019s looking to be a good seller. So that\u2019s an example. I guess the only thing is if you have the company owned stores, they just add the flow of ideas back from the field, the customer connection that comes back from the field.","Joe Vruwink","Yeah. So I guess, my question was more oriented towards the Rock 'N Roll Cab and the TechKnow van put really a spotlight on particular things. Is there some extension of that strategy that you can keep rolling out across the Tools Group?","Nick Pinchuk","Well, we only have 35 TechKnow vans now. We actually added a couple Rock 'N Roll Cabs in the last quarter, so that\u2019s growing much more slowly. But we added four TechKnow vans, so they may continue to grow some. Whether we add another extension, we may have some ideas but I don't think I'm going to pre-announce them on the call here. I think that\u2019s the magic and the magicians are trying to find out more techniques and activities or programs that would expand the power of the franchisee.","See, I think, one of the things, Joe, I just want to point out. Part of the -- really what the Tools Group has done is they figured out that these vans, these franchisee are a great resource, they are better then anybody else. And they figured out how to help them, be more powerful and amplify that power of that rolling retail space and that really capable and committed entrepreneur that's driving it. And we\u2019re going to do more of that, but I\u2019m not about to announce any more of that.","Joe Vruwink","Okay. Fair enough. And then switching gears over to the profitability and RS&I this quarter. You call out a few product areas that I would normally think are a bit lower margin within that segment, yet the margins improved year-over-year. Has RCI kind of neutralized thinking about that business in terms of software being sold or equipment being sold from an EBIT margin standpoint?","Nick Pinchuk","As I said many times in these calls, our RS&I is the hardest to characterize from a margin perspective. Yes, we had good growth in things like equipments, which tends to be lower margin. But you know, we had a good quarter in software that offset it.","Our software is rolling. When I go out and talk to people, they love our diagnostics. In many cases, they\u2019re solving problems three or four times faster than anybody else -- three to four times faster than anybody else and the software is up. So that\u2019s good stuff.","Our Mitchell1 Information business and our Diagnostics and Independent Garages are pretty robust. And okay, equipments growing, but those two things are relatively imbalanced. So I don't think we saw a lot of mix in those numbers except for maybe the acquisition might have been there a little.","Now the story of 140 basis points in, I think its 140 basis points in RS&I is we had about 50 and 60 of RCI, and we had \u2013 I think we had 70 or 80 of restructuring because last year we had a big restructuring dial up in there. So that\u2019s how you can kind of way you look at that. But still a pretty big dial up of RCI, plus you don\u2019t want to no mistake about this even though the equipment the lower margin business are growing so as the software.","Joe Vruwink","Okay. Great. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.","Nick Pinchuk","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.","Gary Prestopino","Good morning, everybody.","Nick Pinchuk","Hi, Garry.","Aldo Pagliari","Hi, Garry.","Gary Prestopino","Good. All right. Nick, it\u2019s the inevitable question on margins and just looking at the gross margin, I think that gross margin you reported in Q1 was probably the highest that it\u2019s been for quite some time? And I was just wondering if there were something in there that got it about 49% or is -- one time deal or are we at a new kind of sustainable level here, so if you could directly you could talk about that?","Nick Pinchuk","Yeah. Look, I don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t spend a lot of time agonizing over the difference between gross margin and OE, I kind of test the operations to drive their operating income and I tend to focus on that much more.","And what we said is, is that, we believe that we have both run ways for growth and improvement that accrues operating income and from quarter-to-quarter they accrue, those two things accrue in different proportion between gross margin and operating expense.","So I wouldn\u2019t call the gross margin necessarily breakthrough, but there\u2019s nothing special in there this quarter. So there is nothing really -- there\u2019s no real -- I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real onetime event or anything like that.","Really I mean you saw you saw our currency numbers in the quarter I think you, our sales were -- what was it 38.5% in currency and about 6.9% in OI and we are -- we have currency headwinds one of the current rate stays the same those will rise.","But on the other hand we believe that that's sort of arithmetic, well, we are so enthusiastic about our operating opportunities and you can see it in this quarter the operating opportunities worked out. Currencies are going to go up and down, but the operating gains are going to stay with us forever and we view the 16.7% as being part of that.","Gary Prestopino","Okay. That's fair. And then Europe I\u2019ve been reading that new car registrations are up? It seems that Europe starting to get some traction? And I think you said your European hand tools business topline was up commensurate with C&I? So -- the cadence has been that you\u2019ve moved on a quarterly basis over the last couple of quarters from low single-digit to mid single-digit to high single-digit growth in the\u2026","Nick Pinchuk","It hasn\u2019t been that -- I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been that thinking about it back here, I have to go back and look it. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been that sort of straight lines, but if you looked that it over say like eight quarters or something like that you probably see some kind of movement.","I think what happens this order is basically some of our activities are paying off associated with new product development. We do have some new products that are exciting the customers you can create enthusiasm even in what I consider to be a relatively dead market in Europe.","New car sales usually doesn\u2019t help us that much, except for the fact that, except for the broader fact that new car sales probably accompanying a more positive economy. It is true though that we made -- I think encouraging gains in selling in Europe.","We -- France and Germany which had been a drag in the last couple of quarters. In fact they were down in the last couple of quarters, they were up this quarter and we continued with the Nordic countries and we had some business in Turkey, of course, Eastern Europe was week, so and Spain was up off of a relatively low base.","So we kind of saw -- we kind of saw the same progress in Europe that we\u2019ve seen in other quarters, except we started making progress in France and Germany. Eastern Europe is kind of dead right now and Russia is difficult so on. So that\u2019s kind of -- so I guess you could be entitled for the idea, Europe got a somewhat better. But profits were even better, very strong performance because of the effects of RCI.","Gary Prestopino","That's great news. And then lastly, as I just look at this, the reported revenues and the unfavourable currency translation, if I add back the impact of currency translation and then say you had about 25% of your sales are based internationally. Is that correct?","Nick Pinchuk","A little more than that. I think it\u2019s -- let me see I think it\u2019s about, what is it like 35%, yes 35% is international.","Gary Prestopino","Okay. Because I was getting -- I was getting a currency hit of somewhere between 17% drag on the numbers from a 25% contributions, so it\u2019s 35%, it\u2019s still going to be about 10% to 12% hit. And I am just wondering were the -- was the euro down that much that it caused that kind of drag on the numbers, or is my math wrong?","Nick Pinchuk","The euro was down. We have several currencies that impact us on a translation basis. You\u2019ve got -- first of all, you got the euro and then you got the pound and then you\u2019ve got the Canadian dollar. If you look at that and actually when I said 35%, it\u2019s -- I was embracing our northern neighbours here and I was using Canada. If you just look at the United States, talk about, maybe think of Canada, it\u2019s international which is somehow I don\u2019t really always, it\u2019s 40% outside the United States, so Canada is in there. So you see those kinds of variations.","Gary Prestopino","Okay.","Nick Pinchuk","I mean, basically, one of those companies that is in current -- we are affected by currency, but we have some good -- some reasonable natural hedges from transaction because we tend to make in the markets where we sell.","Gary Prestopino","Right. That's the next question I was going to get to. You have those natural hedges, so...","Nick Pinchuk","No, not in everything, but we are not immune. Certain like this we are currency resistant from a transaction point of view, but we are not immune. So we don\u2019t bring our hands over it. We see it coming like I said clearly we had currency -- we had currency last year actually. We\u2019ve got it this year. If the rates stay where they or rise some, but it doesn\u2019t affect our operating activity because we know that that 16.7% is going to stay with us, that 12.9% is going to stay with us, that 9.8% is going to stay with us.","Gary Prestopino","Okay. Thank you very much.","Nick Pinchuk","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Hilgert with Morningstar.","Richard Hilgert","Thanks for taking my questions. Good morning, everybody.","Nick Pinchuk","Sure.","Aldo Pagliari","Good morning, Richard.","Richard Hilgert","I was looking at the currency impact a little bit differently. I added back the currency impacts to each one of the revenues for each of the groups, and then also added back the negative impact for currency for each one of their operating results.","Nick Pinchuk","Yes.","Richard Hilgert","The year-over-year increase or expansion in margin, excluding currency, was 140 basis points. When I did all those add backs, I came up with an expansion that was just about 10 basis points less than that at about 130, which is still a fantastic performance. But I'm curious, is that because -- correct me if I am wrong, but isn\u2019t C&I a little bit more of the mix when you add back the currencies and that's why the expansion wasn't quite as much when you take into consideration the currency?","Nick Pinchuk","I\u2019ll tell you this. I\u2019ll tell you this is that in our numbers 120 basis points for our calculation, no effective currency in that 120. In other words, it all balances out at the corporate level. At the corporate level, it all balances out. So we don't really -- at a margin level, at a margin rate level. So the 16.7% from our perspective is basically all RCI, it\u2019s pretty much \u2013 it\u2019s got bad news from pension, it\u2019s got bad news from pension and so on, and it\u2019s primarily RCI and volume productivity.","Richard Hilgert","Yes. No matter how you slice it, it\u2019s still a great performance.","Nick Pinchuk","It\u2019s got a little bit of restructuring good news, offsetting pension and the rest is productivity, currency doesn\u2019t come in there. But if you go by the various groups, C&I it\u2019s helped a little bit on the margin rate basis, not on an absolute basis by currency. Tools Group being, Tools Group would -- if they didn\u2019t have currency, Tools Group would be much more -- it would have been more than 150 basis points. And our C&I a little bit of currency. But that\u2019s way it kind of works out.","Richard Hilgert","Okay. And then on the hand tools side, since we\u2019ve had improving economic conditions for the last three, four years now, have you see an increase in the number of garages opening up in the United States. Is that all sold out?","Nick Pinchuk","No. Technician population is probably growing at about 1.3% for government work that would be the number. But the garages, in fact, if anything, if anything actually, depending how far back you go, the dealerships have shrunk. I think the dealerships were about 21,000 before recession, now that it\u2019s 17 or 18. So they have shrunk. The independents have stayed about the same. The independent have taken more share since that\u2019s started before the recession.","That seems to may be, now this state always trail. So that\u2019s kind of levelled off a lot of people think now. But I think there hasn\u2019t been a big change in the characteristics, except the independents are becoming more sophisticated, because they have the deal with the changing technologies. 20 years ago there were 50 engines codes on a car, now there is 5,000 engine codes. It\u2019s hard to fix the car without the diagnostic unit now, and we have the best one. And so we are selling them to technicians now, not just the garages and so that\u2019s helping drive our business.","So that technology change in the independent space, that\u2019s why we talked about the diagnostic workstation because the independent garages know that people know their cars are more like spaceships these days. And they want to bring them to people who could fix and therefore this diagnostic unit makes it look like wow, this is big computer unit that can fix the car, helps fix the car and it grows confidence. And actually, it helps in terms of accuracy. So, if anything, we\u2019re seeing a greater demand of our product in the independent shops and other shops because of the change in technology, that\u2019s\u2019 the big change.","Richard Hilgert","Okay. Great. And then with respect to your comments about Europe and new car sales in what that means, in terms of hand tool sales over there. Just noticing Western Europe trailing 12 months, new car sales are up about 6%, Eastern Europe however, those, is up about 10%. They were up as much as 15% back about, around the third quarter of last year.","But that growth rate is kind of steadily got down a bit. They are still tracking year-over-year increases. So I\u2019m kind of curious, it makes sense that France and Germany, you\u2019re doing better. The industry is doing better in general in those two countries. But I'm surprised that the Eastern Europe hasn\u2019t really kept up with the expansion of the new-car demand, any comments about that?","Nick Pinchuk","The new car demand is down in Eastern Europe, right.","Richard Hilgert","No. I mean, it\u2019s still up.","Nick Pinchuk","It\u2019s still up. But for us new cars don\u2019t matter. I mean, I think, I\u2019ve said that, because the new car sales are almost always -- except in emerging markets place like China and India so on. There is almost always small compared to the installed base to the car part. Consider the U.S. $16 million cars, North America, 17 million 18 million cars sold. There is a 300 million on the road. It\u2019s like a fly spec almost, the new cars, compared to those on the roads So doesn\u2019t really move our business that much up and down and sort of a shortly basis.","In terms of Eastern Europe, I think, I would just suggest you that I'm not really sure what\u2019s going on in the Eastern Europe, it\u2019s a cocktail of different countries. So it\u2019s really hard to say, I mean, you see Russia being so weak. On the other hand, our business is up in Poland, for example, if you include that in Eastern Europe.","Richard Hilgert","Yeah. I do.","Nick Pinchuk","So it\u2019s hard to make much prediction about that. I think this is just one of those turbulent things that where traditional economics don't always work in every period.","Richard Hilgert","Okay. And just for clarification on new car sales, it would impact you from the perspective of the new diagnostics in the new tools that have to come out of the service new vehicle, right?","Nick Pinchuk","Sure.","Richard Hilgert","Okay.","Nick Pinchuk","But that\u2019s a longer wave event. In other words, you\u2019re right, Richard, but the next year isn\u2019t that much different. It changes some, and so people need to adjust for that. But these things work through over time. I was reacting to the idea that people say while new car sales were up in the first quarter therefore your business is going to be better. I don\u2019t think so. It doesn\u2019t affect us that much.","Richard Hilgert","Okay.","Nick Pinchuk","It\u2019s much longer.","Richard Hilgert","And the last question for Aldo. The financial services business, the receivables debt year-over-year keeps growing at the low double-digit numbers, despite the lower revenue on the single-digit numbers. Any comments on how come we\u2019re still seeing so much more growth, I thought that the financial services business was pretty much penetrated for being a captive now?","Aldo Pagliari","Richard, just to remind you, most of the activity in financial services actually about 94% to 95% of, it really reflects activity in the Snap-on Tools Group. So if you look at on Snap-on Tools Group performance, again it was, I think, organically 12 plus percent, 12.9%. And I think, what you\u2019re seeing when you look at the originations of 14.2 on the topline for full year growth, you seeing it really reflective of the Tools Group and the Financial Services penetration of their sale of not just big-ticket items, but a variety of the product that they sell. So overtime it will mirror that and I think if you look back, it\u2019s rather consistent with Tools Groups performance over the last several quarters.","Richard Hilgert","Okay. Are they doing more in RS&I at this point?","Aldo Pagliari","Above the same level. I mean, we are growing with RS&I at about the same level. The biggest different has been the reflection of the Tools Group.","Richard Hilgert","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.","Nick Pinchuk","Thank you.","Aldo Pagliari","Take care.","Operator","And there are no more questions over the phone.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski with Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Leslie H. Kratcoski - Snap-On, Inc.","Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's fourth quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning.","We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.","As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussions. These slides can be accessed under the Downloads tab in the webcast viewer as well as on our website, snapon.com, under the Investor Information. These slides will be archived on our website, along with the transcript of today's call. Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements.","Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings. Finally, this presentation includes non-GAAP measures of financial performance, which are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for their GAAP counterparts. Additional information regarding these measures, including a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and conference call slide deck, which can be found on our website.","With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. I'll start with the highlights of our fourth quarter and our year and I'll give you my perspective on the results, on the market environment and on progress we've made. After that Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.","This is not a typical quarter. There are a number of special non-recurring events that impacted result, the legal charge, and the transition associated with the new tax law. But when you look through all that, Snap-on again showed overall and significant progress along our runways, achieving both growth and profitability.","As with most quarters, we had headwinds and we had opportunities. We took advantage of the opportunities and we overcame the headwinds. Overall sales in the quarter were $974.6 million, 9.5% higher than last year, strong. That total included $29.7 million of acquisition-related volume from last year's Car-O-Liner and Sturtevant Richmont operations and this year's BTC and Norbar businesses, and $16.2 million of favorable foreign currency. Our organic growth was 4.3% relatively encouraging with varied results across the groups.","Let's start by looking at the non-recurring events. First, the one-time legal charge. A judgment in a pat-related litigation matter that is being appealed. It impacted operating income by $30.9 million and the earnings per share by $0.33. Second, a $7 million or $0.12 EPS charge associated with the implementation in the new U.S. tax legislation.","Excluding the legal charge, OpCo operating margin was 19.4% of sales, down 40 basis points, reflecting primarily a 30 basis point dilution from lower margin acquisitions and the impact of favorable foreign currency.","For Financial Services, operating income of $54.4 million compared to last year's $51.6 million. As-reported, the EPS was $2.29, but excluding the legal charge and the impact of the tax legislation, earnings per share as-adjusted grew to $2.69, that's an increase of 8.9%. That's our result.","And our market, what we believe the automotive repair segments continue to remain favorable, although, we again saw mixed results in that arena, new technologies, aging vehicles, requiring innovative tools and specialized equipment and updated diagnostics and more repairs continue to make that a favorable place to be. As I said though, we had mixed outcomes.","Our Tools Group was below trend and in the U.S., looking similar to what we saw in the third quarter, unsatisfying. However, the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group continued its considerable advancement serving repair shop owners and managers.","From an overview level, we believe the ongoing progress of RS&I, taken together with what we know would be the strong fundamentals clearly indicate that there's ongoing and abundant opportunity available in the segment.","Now if you look to Commercial & Industrial \u2013 now our Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, it had one of its strongest quarters. Organic sales were up nicely across almost all industries and geographies, including Europe and Asia. Performances in the period from our critical industries focused business with the Industrial Division and SNA Europe, both experiencing strong double-digit growth, were especially encouraging.","Within Industrial, an area that's on an upward trend, nearly all segments generated double-digit growth with natural resources, military and general industry leading the way. And SNA Europe's volume in the period was similarly positive again, reflecting gains across almost all geographies.","So across the corporation, I'd characterize our markets as mixed, but on the whole, clearly positive. With overall strength in automotive repair, notwithstanding the outcome of our Tools Group and continuing strength in the critical industries and gains across geographies, despite the challenges of the quarter and headwinds will always exist.","We remain confident that our businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on the possibilities, on the opportunities that do exist along our runways for growth. And looking ahead, we also see clear runways for improvement. We said this many times. Snap-on Value Creation Processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI driving, ongoing and significant advancements as they have for some time.","Now for the full-year, sales of $3.69 billion represented an as-reported increase of 7.5%. The organic volume gain was 3.4%, with the RS&I Group up 7.6%, the C&I Group rising 4.5%, and the Tools Group roughly flat.","As-reported EPS for the year was $9.52, but excluding the legal matters and the impact of the tax legislation, earnings per share as-adjusted reached $10.12, that's an increase of 10%.","OpCo OI percent as-adjusted was 19.3%, up 20 basis points, overcoming 50 basis points dilutive impact from acquisition and a decrease of 20 basis points associated with unfavorable currency.","And when we include the income from Financial Services of $217.5 million, which rose $18.8 million, the consolidated operating margin for the corporation as-adjusted was 23.2%, up a similar 20 basis points, the quarter and the year, sales gains and profit increases, taking advantage of opportunities on our runways for growth and driving down our runways for improvement.","Now, let's move to the individual operating groups and their fourth quarter results. The Tools Group. Organic sales down 3% and operating earnings of $67.3 million, representing a margin rate of 16.4%, down 120 basis points. We do believe our actions to reinvigorate the van channel sales will be effective, but they didn't create improvement in the fourth quarter.","In the quarter and throughout the year, however, the Tools Group did confirm the strength and the market-leading position of its van network. It wasn't evident in the recent financials, but it was clear in the franchisee health metrics we monitor each period. The franchisees are strong and the turnover is low and that positivity was once again acknowledged by multiple publications, listing Snap-on as a franchise of choice.","And just this past quarter, Snap-on was ranked among the top franchise organizations, both in the U.S. and abroad. We were again recognized by Franchise Business Review, which collects franchisee's satisfaction data. And in its latest ranking, lists as Snap-on as a Top 50 franchise, marking the 11th consecutive year we received that award based on satisfaction.","We were also once again recognized by the Military Times, which includes Snap-on on its Best for Vets annual ranking, coming in at number five for the second year in a row and the only mobile tool franchise on the entire list.","And abroad, Snap-on was ranked number two in the Elite Franchise magazine's Top UK franchises for 2018, finishing above many UK-only franchises and ahead of some very popular global brands.","Now this type of recognition reflects the fundamental strength of the franchisees in our van business and it would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of innovative new products. And in 2017, once again, the Tools Group increased its number of hit products, those $1 million sellers developed from direct observations gained in the field that I think you've become familiar with.","Tool Storage sales were still a shortfall in the quarter, but we're taking action. You heard me speak of migrating some premium options like the PowerDrawer, the speed organizer into our lower ranges, we're doing that. We're introducing new features and new themes. We're retooling the Rock N' Roll vans and we'll be expanding our line with a model that offers attractive capacity in a compact footprint, some high-end features at a price that's affordable to young technicians. A unit aimed at making them Snap-on customers for life and contributing to a restart for the Tools Group.","And just in December, probably too late to affect the fourth quarter, we introduced our new series of 12-point high-performance ratcheting box wrenches, whole form gears, proprietary steel for durability, extended handle for leverage, 8-tooth pole to minimize the swing arc, another unique tool reducing technician job time, particularly in difficult and critical situations. The Tools Group may be below trends, but we keep building its strength with new product and network vitality, well that's the Tools Group.","Now let's move to RS&I. Volume in the fourth quarter was $356.8 million, with an organic rise of 6.2%. Double-digit sales gains in the OEM dealerships and low single-digit increases in diagnostics and repair information products. Operating earnings of $89.8 million, increased $7.3 million for an OI margin of 25.2%, down 60 basis points from last year, but with a 50 basis point decline from lower margin acquisitions and negative currency effects.","Once again, we saw some compelling products, giving us more to sell to those repair shop owners and managers, offerings like the NEXIQ Blue-Link Mini, our electronic logging device. It won a Professional Tool and Equipment Innovation of the Year Award at the SEMA show in Las Vegas. The Blue-Link Mini logs driver hours, vehicle movement, engine hours, vehicle performance data like, and vehicle performance data like speed and miles per gallon. All of that allows heavy-duty customers to meet the electronic data logging regulation that took effect in December. And it appears to be a winning product with great customer reception. We saw that.","Our diagnostics and repair information businesses were also led by new products. We mentioned last quarter, the launch of our game-changing handheld intelligent diagnostics, the ZEUS. Well, it's selling well.","Hardware and software subscriptions, yes, subscriptions, a new focus for one of our introductions. A great unit raising the bar in advanced repair, and helping to offset the difficult comparison of last year's fourth quarter, both in the launch of the MODIS Edge handheld and our very popular Thermal Imager in that category.","RS&I also advanced in its position in the repair information space, the Mitchell 1 business, enhancing our ProDemand software by adding a new user interface. It takes repair information to a whole new level of intelligence with advanced search technology that scans the vast Mitchell 1 database and returns exactly the specific information the technician needs for that particular job.","OEM data and Snap-on's proprietary SureTrack real-world data, real-world information is now more tightly integrated and the new interface amplifies the power of that combination. It makes the technician's diagnosis job easier, quicker and more accurate.","Finally in the period, RS&I's equipment division introduced the new V2100 imaging wheel aligner. It's targeted squarely at meeting the needs of independent shops that work on a multiple brands of vehicles and perform a variety of repair services. Those shops typically can't have a dedicated alignment guy. They just don't do that many alignments. What they do need is an ease-of-use mid-tier unit. Different vehicle brands have varying alignment procedures. It's a major challenge for a general tech. Well, the V2100 is the right unit within an intuitive interface that will guide through the multiple approaches to align with clarity.","For a general tech, it reduces alignment time by 30%, a great saving and a nice boost to our equipment lineup. We keep driving to expand RS&I's position with the repair shop owners and managers, offering new products to sell, developed by our customer connection and innovation processes or added by our strategic and coherent acquisitions. And you can see it in the numbers.","Now, on to C&I. Sales increased in the period 19.4% from 2016, helped by \u2013 I want to say that again \u2013 sales increased in the period 19.4% from 2016, helped by $19.1 million in acquisition-related volume and $6.8 million of favorable currency.","Organic sales were up 10.1%, among the highest we've ever seen at C&I. That year record increase reflects improvements from almost every operating division, including gains by Industrial, SNA Europe, Power Tools and the Asia-Pacific division. The group's operating income was $50.9 million. That's up from the $43.9 million reported last year. Operating income margin was 14.9%, down 40 basis points, but reflecting a 50 basis point impact from the acquisitions, dilutive acquisitions, and another 50 basis point decline from unfavorable currency. In fact, those impacts notwithstanding, 14.9% is among the highest margins we've seen for the group in the last several years, last four years or so. In effect, C&I had one of its strongest quarters.","Reassuringly, SNA Europe again posted increased organic sales, up double-digits, continuing its progress, now 17 quarters in a row of year-over-year growth and profit climbed right along, up 19 straight quarters. 19 quarters in a row of profitability improvement, reflecting Snap-on Value Creation at work with innovative new products and improved new processes, driving positive trends and some pretty challenging geographies.","Also in C&I, our Industrial division made encouraging strides. As I mentioned before, strong double-digit growth, driven in part by our strong double-digit growth for our Industrial division, driven in part by a widening array of new products. Having been up and down in recent periods, aerospace showed good progress in the quarter, rising worldwide.","First time in a while, we vision both in domestic and international on a boost from customer connection, authoring products like our new cordless grease gun kit. Many planes have service requirements, which prohibit them from using this industry standard units with customer connection Snap-on developed a new gun, which limits the grease delivery pressure, matching a special aircraft requirements.","And based on further customer connection, we also added improvements like an extended length pressure hose, giving technicians that added reach to reach and service landing gear and a clear grease cartridge tube, allowing users to quickly identify the type of material in the gun. Now these are, seem like simple improvements and they are, but they're quite effective in making critical work easier in special aerospace situations.","Just like in the Industrial division, SNA Europe has also been using customer connection and innovation to drive its continuing expansion. For example, in the critical power generation industry in Europe, with a significant amount of oil in Northern Europe being pumped from offshore, there was opportunity for a special tool kit for servicing the individual ocean rigs.","Customer connection, observing the environment and tasks led to the development of what we're calling the pump-man tool kit, combining bottles tools at height with safe when you use them at height with the safety suspenders and with our large array of \u2013 combining those tools at height with a large array of our non-sparking tools, eliminating fire hazards and addressing the service and safety needs for the critical oil rig environment. The specialized kits \u2013 these specialized pump-man kits were released just this year, but based on early receptions, we believe will be a big driver for our expansion in the oil and gas industry and a great help in continuing SNA Europe's upward trajectory.","Power Tools division returned to growth in the quarter and new product paved the way. One winner was our new CDRR761, a 14.4 volt, 3\/8 inches, MicroLithium right-angle drill, lightweight, provides up to 150-inch pounds of torque, offers two-speed ranges at a variable speed switch. It's great for driving screws with control.","It was launched to help technicians get into small tight spaces under \u2013 like under the dash and on the firewall and it has an integrated LED light to illuminate that dark work. It was introduced in the fourth quarter and it's already $1 million seller, one of our hit products that drive growth.","Well, that's our fourth quarter. OpCo organic sales rising 4.3%. Progress along our runways for coherent growth and advancements down our runways for improvement, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement.","Tools Group, working on regaining growth. RS&I continuing its considerable strength and C&I starting to show its potential with much more to go. All of it driving a 19.4% adjusted operating margin, despite the dilutive acquisition and an as-adjusted EPS of $2.69, up 8.9%. That's our fourth quarter.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?","Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.","Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide 6. Net sales of $974.6 million in the quarter increased 9.5%, reflecting a 4.3% organic sales gains, $29.7 million of acquisition-related sales and $16.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation.","The year-over-year organic sales growth, which was the highest level achieved of any quarter in 2017, reflects ongoing progress in serving repair shop owners and managers in the vehicle repair sector as well as broad-based growth in the businesses that comprise the Commercial & Industrial segment.","Consolidated gross margin of 47.7% declined 220 basis points, primarily due to higher sales of lower gross margin products, 60 basis points of lower gross margins on an acquisition-related sales and 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency.","The operating expense margin of 31.5% increased 140 basis points as 320 basis points related to the legal charge that, as Nick has mentioned, is being appealed. These were partially offset by benefits from sales volume leverage and a 40 basis point benefit from operating expenses for acquisitions.","Operating earnings before Financial Services of $157.7 million or 16.2% of sales, includes the legal charge and compares to $176.1 million or 19.8% of sales in the prior year. Excluding the legal charge, operating earnings before Financial Services, as-adjusted was $188.6 million or 19.4% of sales. Financial Services revenue of $79.9 million and operating earnings of $54.4 million increased $5.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively from 2016.","Consolidated operating earnings of $212.1 million or 20.1% of revenues compared to $227.7 million or 23.6% of revenues a year ago. Excluding the legal charge, consolidated operating earnings as-adjusted was $243.0 million or 23.0% of revenues.","Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 33.0% was reduced by 120 basis points as a result of the legal charge, but increased by 360 basis points as a result of a $7 million charge related to the implementation of the new tax legislation in the United States.","This tax charge includes an estimated transition tax, an unremitted foreign earnings of $13.7 million, partially offset by an estimated tax benefit related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities of $6.7 million. Excluding both the legal and tax charges, the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 as-adjusted was 30.6% as compared to 30.8% in Q4 of 2016.","Finally, net earnings of $129.5 million or $2.24 per diluted share compared to $146.3 million or $2.47 per share a year ago. Excluding the legal charge and tax charge, net earnings as-adjusted was $155.6 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.69, represented an increase of 8.9%.","Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I Group on slide 7. Sales of $341.7 million in the quarter increased 19.4%, reflecting a 10.1% organic sales gain, $19.1 million of acquisition-related sales and $6.8 million of favorable foreign currency translation.","The organic sales increase includes double-digit gains in sales to customers in critical industries and in European-based hand tools business as well as low single-digit gains in both the segments Power Tools and Asia-Pacific operations. The gains in critical industries were positive across the board, including strong growth in international aviation and the military, two areas, which were weaker earlier in the year.","Gross margin of 39.2% declined 110 basis points from 40.3% a year ago due to higher sales of lower gross margin products and 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. The operating expense margin of 24.3% improved 70 basis points, primarily due to the benefits of sales volume leverage, partially offset by 50 basis points of operating expenses related to our acquisitions.","Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $50.9 million increased 15.9% and the operating margin of 14.9% compared to 15.3% a year ago, including the 100 basis point impact from currency and acquisitions mentioned above.","Turning now to slide 8. Sales in the Tools Group of $409.2 million decreased 2%, reflecting a 3% organic sales decline, partially offset by $4.3 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales decrease includes a mid-single digit decline in the U.S., which was only partially offset by a mid-single digit sales gain internationally.","Gross margin of 41.4% decreased 60 basis points year-over-year due to the lower volume in related cost. The operating expense margin of 25% increased 60 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the effect of the lower sales. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $67.3 million, decreased 8.4% and the operating margin of 16.4% compared to 17.6% in 2016.","Turning to the RS&I Group shown on slide 9. Sales of $356.8 million increased 11.6%, reflecting a 6.2% organic sales gain, $10.6 million of acquisition-related sales and $6.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflected a double-digit gain in sales to OEM dealerships and a low single-digit increase in sales of diagnostic and repair information products.","Gross margin of 45.4% declined 240 basis points as a 110 basis point impact from acquisitions, higher sales of lower gross margin products and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency were partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 20.2% improved 180 basis points due to the higher sales volume and 80 basis points of benefits from acquisitions, partially offset by 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency.","Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $89.8 million increased 8.8% from prior year levels. The operating margin of 25.2% compared to 25.8% last year, including a 30 basis point impact from acquisitions.","Now turning to slide 10. Operating earnings from Financial Services of $54.4 million on revenue of $79.9 million compared to operating earnings of $51.6 million on revenue of $74.2 million a year ago.","Financial Services expenses of $25.5 million increased $2.9 million, primarily due to a $2.4 million year-over-year increase in provisions for losses on finance receivables, which totaled $16.0 million in the quarter. This is up $3.2 million sequentially from $12.8 million in the third quarter of 2017 and compares to third to fourth quarter sequential increase in the prior year of $2.8 million.","As a percentage of the average portfolio, Financial Services expenses were 1.3% in both the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016. In the fourth quarter, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.8% in 2017, compared to 18.2% in 2016 due in part to the portfolio mix as well as higher percentage of originations utilizing marketing rebates in 2017. Respective average yield on contract receivables was 9.2% and 9.3%.","Total loan originations of $265 million in the fourth quarter increased $4.7 million or 1.8% year-over-year. As higher originations of contract receivables principally franchise finance were partially offset by a decline in finance receivable originations due to the lower year-over-year sales of big-ticket items in the U.S. by the Snap-on Tools Group.","Moving to slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.74 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross Financial Services portfolio grew $28.1 million or 1.4% in the fourth quarter.","As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, they are, as expected, tracking higher year-over-year, similar to what we've seen over the last several quarters and also reflecting typical seasonal increases. We believe these, trends however, continue to support our view over an appropriate risk reward balance in this segment of our business.","As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, the largest portion of the portfolio, trailing 12- month losses of $46.7 million, represented 2.92% of outstandings at quarter-end, up 61 basis points year-over-year and 15 basis points sequentially.","The 60-plus day delinquency rate of 1.9% for U.S. extended credit increased 20 basis points sequentially typical of the seasonal increase from the third quarter to fourth quarter. Overall, operating earnings in the Financial Services segment rose 5.4% year-over-year. Their allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the above-mentioned trends in the portfolio's performance.","Now turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $193.5 million in the quarter increased $41.8 million from comparable 2016 levels, due primarily to lower discretionary pension contributions and cash paid for income taxes in 2017. Net cash used by investing activities of $59.0 million included net additions to finance receivables of $38.2 million, down from $53.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Capital expenditures of $24.7 million in the quarter compared with $17.7 million last year. Net cash used by financing activities of $136.6 million included dividend payments to shareholders of $46.4 million and the repurchase of 472,000 shares of common stock for $75.3 million under our existing share repurchase programs. Full-year 2017 share repurchases totaled 1.82 million shares for $287.9 million.","Turning to slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $76.8 million from 2016 year-end levels, primarily due to higher sales, $21.7 million of foreign currency translation and $9.5 million from acquisitions. Days sales outstanding of 66 days was up from 63 days a year ago, but down from 67 days at the end of the third quarter.","Inventories increased $108.3 million from 2016 year-end, primarily to support increased customer demand in certain segments and new product introductions. Foreign currency translation and acquisitions contributed $23.9 million and $5.7 million of the increase, respectively. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.2 compared to 3.3 at year-end 2016. Inventories decreased approximately $11 million from the end of the third quarter.","Our year-end cash position of $92 million increased $14.4 million from 2016 year-end levels. Our net debt to capital ratio increased to 27.0% from 26.3% year-over-year. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter-end, we had $151 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.","That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2018. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. As a result of the recently enacted tax legislation in the United States, we currently anticipate that our full-year 2018 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 24% to 25%. This compares to a full-year 2017 effective tax rate on a reported and on an adjusted basis of 31.1% and 30.6%, respectively.","I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Thanks, Aldo. Well, I started by saying that we were encouraged but unsatisfied in the quarter and we were. The Tools Group remain below trend, not yet recovering, but we continue to have confidence in the market and in our inherent strengths. We do have a strong franchise network. The turnover and our franchisee health metrics say so.","And we are investing in new products and support to restart the growth engine. You can see it in the ZEUS, revolutionizing vehicle diagnostics and moving us further into subscription-based software. But despite the Tools Group challenges, we overcame again. Organic sales growth was 4.3% and the as-reported number was 9.5%.","The RS&I Group and the C&I Group both had strong quarters. RS&I as-reported growth, 11.6% organic and inorganic gain of 6.2% and OI margin 25.2%, a significant contribution to our performance.","C&I had a near-record quarter, rolling the Snap-on brand out of the garage with success. As-reported sales of 19.4% and an organic increase at 10.1%, OI margin of 14.9% among the group's highest.","The results in the quarter I think clearly demonstrate that our coherent runways for growth, expanding with repair shop owners and managers and extending to critical industries are wide with abundant opportunities, and we're confident we have the strength and the position all along our runways for further growth \u2013 all along our runways. We have the strength and position for further growth and more improvement amplified by the new tax rates to maintain our positive performance trajectory as we move through 2018 and beyond.","Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. The performance of our fourth quarter and of the year and our clear opportunities going forward would not be possible without your extraordinary contributions. For your ongoing achievements, you have my congratulations, and for your continuing dedication and commitment to our team, you have my thanks.","Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll go first to Liam Burke with B. Riley FBR.","Liam Burke - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Yes, thank you. Good morning, Nick. Good morning, Aldo.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Hey, Liam.","Liam Burke - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Nick, in the core Snap-on Tools Group, you highlighted the fact that storage sales were down again. But how did the core hand tool business fare this quarter on the year-over-year basis?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Well, the hand tool business was I think improved from the fourth quarter, but it's still down some. And we're still suffering I think the results of maybe the less than overwhelming offerings, coming out of the SFC. So, we're seeing an improvement, but not where we want it to be. The big factor, the good news in the quarter I think is associated with the ZEUS, the effect of the ZEUS and its sale off the vans, which is very encouraging for us. That's the silver lining in the quarter, I think. But in general, we still got to keep working on the Tools Group, new product, new support.","Liam Burke - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Okay. And on a free cash flow basis, Aldo, you're up about 35%. Does that change your capital allocation outlook? You went through a good part of your buyback authorization. Does that become an increasing part of your capital allocation strategy?","Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.","Certainly. The share repurchase is part of our allocation strategy, but I think our priorities remain the same, Liam. We have good access to capital markets, the new tax action provide more cash generation opportunities, but serving organic sales and then M&A opportunities still becomes the two most important items on the list, but certainly share repurchase, dividend strategy, pension contributions factor into that decision as well.","Liam Burke - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Thank you, Nick. Thank you, Aldo.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Thanks, Liam.","Operator","Next is David MacGregor at Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yes. Good morning. Do you hear me okay?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Yeah.","Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.","Yeah.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Great. A couple of questions. First of all, just on the C&I, pretty remarkable organic growth. It's nice to see you follow \u2013 sort of firing on all the cylinders. I guess the question is just how sustainable is it? And just talk about \u2013 I know you don't provide quantitative outlook and guidance on your head, but if you could just talk about how sustainable that organic growth might be, given the strength you're seeing in critical industries and European hand tools?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Look, I think you can look at it this way. I believe that SNA Europe was up double-digits and you might not say double-digit every quarter, but I think we said in our thing, it's been up 17 quarters in a row in terms of sales; and 19 quarters in a row in terms of profit. And we think it's still got considerable headroom. It's still not back to where it was prerecession. So it took a big dip in a recession and we keep making it stronger, so we're positive about SNA Europe and I think we have abundant demonstration of that.","The Industrial business is now through the downturn in the industrial sector in oil and gas and others. We kept investing in new product and our understanding of marketplace and I think you're seeing that come to fruition.","Now I'm not going to say until you see those two big cylinders, I think working, based on improved capabilities that you can see coming through in the results to us. Now whether that's going to offer double-digit growth or not, is another question. I think we prefer to say that we look at our growth on an organic basis at 4% to 6% and we see C&I at the top end of that, but it appears as though in this environment with the strength we have, we got two big pistons there.","And the other place, Asia-Pacific, had pretty good growth particularly in China and in India, in turbulent markets, I would say. And Power Tools came back, so I think you'd say C&I has positioned pretty well and the numbers showing that. If you take a look at those numbers, this is what we meant by rolling the Snap-on brand out of the garage.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Well, congratulations on all the progress there. I guess my second question was on the Tools segment and just if you could talk about franchisee order patterns through the quarter and what was changing there. I know your contract receivables are up, and you talked about that being driven by franchisee sales. Is your sense that inventories are maybe up a little, accumulating within the franchise network?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Actually no. I don't think the inventories are accumulated.","Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.","The contract receivables, David, are up principally because of the launch of new vans and the franchised channel, so a lot of franchisees have upped the size of their advance they're putting on the street, and that's one of the key drivers in franchise finance.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","We would say the opposite actually that, if anything that we don't have perfect visibility on this. If anything, the franchisees inventories are coming down a little bit.","I think the principal component of the franchisee story is the ZEUS. The ZEUS is selling well off the van and I don't know if the import of my remarks hits, but the franchisees are selling this big revolutionary new ZEUS at higher levels than we've seen for a large unit and they are selling what we call a data package, which is three years of subscriptions. We never really sold subscriptions with a launch before, and that's happening at record level.","So I think if you look at the franchise interface level, one of the real great stories is around that revolutionary diagnostic, which is changing the industry, recognizes the market leader and is pulling us more into subscriptions-based software.","Now when you do this kind of thing, it doesn't always register for the Tools Group right away, because the franchisees sell for three year subscription boom and it gets financed or sold in other way. And we, in the Tools Group, recognize on an amortized basis over the month. So they see that kind of thing, but if you look at that level, the franchisees are pretty happy about this.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","And last question for me is just on the Tools business. You talked about the gross margin pressure there and I appreciate you breaking it out for us. To what extent, this promotional pressure or promotional programs sort of a headwind on gross margins, and if you could tie that in with just some commentary around the general competitive environment tools that would be helpful?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","I'll say it this way. Look, I'll say it this way. Look, the Tools Group volume is down. They're vertically integrated, so you know that's going to play out in some kind of loss margin plus absorption and that kind of situation; but also, they want volume. If you're in the position of the Tools Group, if you want volume and so they're working pretty hard to take advantage of every possible piece of daylight they can. That's not the most efficient way to sell.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","All right. Thank you.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","We'll go next to Gary Prestopino with Barrington.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Good morning Gary.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Nick, on the Tool Storage area, I mean, how far are you on the product refresh that I think you \u2013 we had talked about couple of quarter \u2013 over the last couple of quarters, then you mentioned it a little in your earlier comments. I mean are you basically done with that product refresh?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","I ain't done at all. I'm not done, but we were \u2013 we brought out some stuff. I think I said in the \u2013 some different themes and some different features and we migrated some features down into smaller \u2013 into the \u2013 some of the middle \u2013 mid-tier line, and we're continuing to do that. And I think we continue to make changes associated with the Tool Storage, because we think it didn't move \u2013 what happens to it, Gary, it didn't move this quarter. Some of that stuff worked, but not enough to move the overall needle, so you keep bringing out new stuff to try to make sure you can make the change.","I think one of the things we're kind of encouraged about is this entry-level thing for the technicians, which we're kind of focused on in this situation. We're kind of \u2013 we're seeing some reasonable effects at the top end of the line and then \u2013 so we'd like to get these guys to \u2013 at the lower end with a little more activity. So you're seeing some of that.","Then you go back to the Rock N' Roll Cabs. The Rock N' Roll Cabs, we're refurbishing them and we finished the first half of that refurbishment program right at the end of the year, so they really weren't \u2013 if you look at it, they really weren't on the road. And we expect to get the other half finished in another quarter, let's say, for government work. So you'll see those rolling out.","So I don't \u2013 if you're looking for me to tell you when the thing is going to turn around, I guess I can't, but I have every confidence we can do this. And the reason I do this is because, when you look at our van network, you talk to our franchisees, you see our product line, pretty strong.","Now we have gaps and it's caused us some difficulty, but the Tools Group, each one of our groups go up and down like this and we bring them back. I think the thing about the quarter is, is for the second quarter in a row, the Tools Group had difficulty and we achieved anyway because we had great quarters with RS&I and C&I.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","No, no. I understand and get it. No, I'm just trying to try and get an idea of when we could see an inflection point in the Tools Group?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Yeah. Look, I think, I said, the meaning of my word unsatisfied is this, Gary. We expect to grow every quarter.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Right.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","And so, we don't grow in one of these divisions, while there is the possibility of having a difficult quarter, we're not satisfied. So our expectation would be to grow, but I can't \u2013 in terms of forecasting for a financial situation, I can't be saying that we're doing that, but I can tell you internally, we're looking for it.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","And then what \u2013 in terms of refurbishing the van, the Rock N' Roll, vans, cabs.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Yeah.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","What are you doing there?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","First of all, you start from the outside in. You make the outside look differently, you do different wraps. You go inside, you reorganize the structure of the vans themselves, you put new stuff on, you organize a more robust refreshment of the Tool Storage boxes on the van, you try to make sure you have different examples, and we install a new computer system, which will \u2013 a new 3D modeling system, which if you doesn't see it on the van, or you see it on the van and you like a different color, you get a great picture of it.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Okay.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","So, we do those kinds of things. It's really to try to make it seem different, so when the technician gets on the van, he says, oh, this is different I want to take a look at this stuff.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then getting back to the ZEUS, which is interesting.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Yeah.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Is this a federal \u2013 what is it, a federal regulation now that you have to monitor your mileage or something?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","No, no, no. Sorry, I probably confused you on this. The ZEUS, I was talking about the NEXIQ Blue-Link Mini. It's an electronic data logging. That's in the heavy-duty business that you put on trucks that monitor the daily log. There was legislation that took place that took effect in December, which drove that sales. ZEUS is for, your average vehicles in your \u2013 in Bimmer's auto repair, down in Illinois or something like that, or a muffler shop.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Sure.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","All right. Thanks.","Operator","The next to David Leiker with Baird.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. This is Joe Vruwink for David.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Hello.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","I was hoping to peel back the onion a bit more on the Tools Group. So if I look at finance receivable originations, and that's my proxy for big-ticket product sales, that was down 1% to get to Tools Group of down 3%, it means the core hand tool, power tool business, let's call it, was down 4% and that down 4% is a weaker number than it's been tracking all year long.","So I'm just wondering within Q4, what trends did you see that might explain maybe a weakening or I'm wondering since we're talking about the ZEUS, are your franchisees spending more time selling ZEUS and maybe less time selling Tools and that might be getting caught up in this number?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Let's just talk about this for a minute. As you know, I know you know this well. There isn't a perfect linkage between the Tools Group sales and originations. One thing, there is a time lag, probably the stuff that's originated in the fourth quarter, some significant portion of that got sold by us in the third quarter, that's one thing, I think. Clear, you know this. The work that gets into the van, they got to sell it and so on. That's one thing.","And ZEUS introduced a new wrinkle for this. ZEUS is two pieces. It is the hardware itself, revolutionizing, intelligent diagnostics, faster stream, better color resolution, all that stuff and then it's a software package, a data software package underneath the intelligent diagnostic.","Well, the data software package sells for thousands of dollars because it's three years and that gets financed, but it doesn't get recognized at the Tools Group, except on a monthly basis, amortized like a subscription. So not only is there \u2013 is this new wrinkle introduced by ZEUS, and that you have franchisees financing something, which doesn't really get recognized as immediately by a sale, by the Tools Group because it's the subscription-based software. We think it's a great situation because we're going to subscription base, that creates some of that disconnect. And so, I think you could talk to us a little more extensively and we can talk about this a little bit more and go through it, that's number one.","Number two is your point is well taken though, I think. The ZEUS is a very expensive unit and we do have to take a lot of effort in training the franchisees and having our diagnostics, our 130 diagnostic systems developers and the Techno van supporting them and it takes a lot of effort to sell it. So a successful ZEUS sale can be drawing attention from other things, that's true. It's hard to quantify that though, Joe, you know. But that does happen.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. The point on software sales, that makes a lot of sense. Maybe if I spin the question around a little bit. So, U.S. down mid single-digits. That was a consistent number as in Q3. Obviously, tool storage has been weak. We've talked about that, but in thinking about the core mechanic customer, what is your sense on just the backdrop there whether the BLS has data, it shows hours worked up, hiring up, earnings way up. It would seems like that customer is able to buy more tools. What is your sense on Snap-on's ability to tap into what is ultimately a pretty strong, I'll call it, wallet growth?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","I agree. That's why I'm saying the automotive repair market is a robust market with abundant opportunity that we can drive down. We think we have the capability to do it. I mean, I think the fact that we're selling the ZEUSs in pretty good numbers, basically last year, we had a boffo quarter with the thermal imager. You know what, we sold a lot of them in the fourth quarter and at the franchisee level, they're overcoming that with ZEUS. And so what you got is people are playing the ZEUS list price, some people have looked at it, all-in is like $17,000. Now that's like a car price. There's a lot of versions of that, that gets sold, but it's thousands of dollars, and we're selling it successfully. So we're able to tap into it I think if we have the right product.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","And you think recent, you've talked about coming out of the franchise conference, that product introduction, but have there been other items launched in the back half of the year? We're entering Q1 or we're over a month into Q1, what have been more recent trends than just that undertaking around new products?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","That's why I put the power tool in the script. The power tool that we talked about, that 3\/8 inch mini power tool right angle drill sold out right away and it became a $1 million seller, a hit product. So we are launching products. Our problem is, we're not selling enough tool storage, and there are other issues, but the thing is that, we need to turn around tool storage. That's what I think. Now there are other things we'd like to see go better. So we are seeing encouraging. When we have the product, we believe we sell it.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","And then my last question, A lot of our focus over the past year has been on finance receivables, but let's maybe talk about contract receivables. How much of the asset book is that category? And then can you just segment of contract receivables, how much is maybe more of a commercial loan with the shop? How much is going to be van leases? And are the growth in van leases going on right now? Is that historically a leading indicator of future activity or anything you can kind of foot to for why franchisees are reinvesting right now?","Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.","Joe, actually, there's not a lot to be gleaned. The mix within the portfolio has been rather constant. If you look at the end of Q4, 81% of the portfolio is extended credit, 15% is franchise finance and 3% is to leases of equipment to shop owners. That vacillates between 3% and 4% over the years. The franchise finance goes from 13.5% to 15.5%, so it's kind of all within range. I think it's a sign of prosperity and confidence when you see the franchisees up into a new van, particularly a larger van. I think they wouldn't make an investment like that if they didn't show their commitment to the future and want to keep growing their business.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I think last year, maybe a couple of phases you tightened credit a little bit. Just wondering what the results, learnings were around that, what the latest toggles are if that subsequently yielded to some opportunity to lose some credit backup perhaps?","Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.","I think we look at credit each and every quarter, a little bit harder at certain times of the year than others, Chris. It evolves, but not big movements in terms of decision making, we're always trying to tweak the portfolio in a positive way, try to put our franchisees and ourselves in a better place. Try to make sure we match our customers' needs up with what we were offering. So loosening credit, I wouldn't say that per se. I think we're judicious in terms of how we counsel the franchisees and approaching the situation. Having said that, one of the callers earlier made the comment that I think mechanics' wallets are getting bigger. I think that means that there probably is more capacity over time. We were trying to identify where that credit capacity is and loan to those mechanics.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then on the core vans channel, wondering if you're seeing any apparent rebalancing in the vans channel marketplace around historical price spreads around the few key competitors and maybe any changes on the relative under-penetration of some of your stronger peers?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Look, certainly if you looked at our numbers and you looked at some of the other numbers, you would conclude there's some change. We don't hear it from our franchisees. We don't hear them saying, oh, by the way, I have trouble competing with this guy or that guy over a particular product. So to the extent other people are growing, I guess you could argue that they're making inroads, where we could have had those inroads, but, or had that business. But you don't hear at the level. Nobody comes up and says, boy, you got to match this or we got to do this, or this is giving me problems. You don't hear it.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then just final, bookkeeping, if you told us I missed it, but what's the finance receivables allowance balance down the year?","Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.","The balance is about 3% of the portfolio, if you look at the coverage ratio.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.","A little bit more.","Leslie H. Kratcoski - Snap-On, Inc.","If we move to the next question please.","Operator","Pardon me. Thank you. We'll go next to Scott Stember with C.L. King.","Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Good morning.","Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Most of my questions have been answered, but I have one question. Nick, you had referred to the SFC, and I guess you're referring to the big pack of tools and maybe some bundling or unbundling that didn't go well, I guess from a pricing and just the actual packaging. Could you talk about what you've done to remedy that? And how long would we take to see that with an improved numbers within the Tools Group? Thank you very much.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Look, I think, yeah, the thing is that generally hand tools are something which are a little different than tool storage or diagnostics or anything else. The hand tools inventory is fairly ubiquitous on the van itself. They have a lot of handles, but generally, they have to be \u2013 you have to attract them to a bundle. It didn't work so well, some people took it in the SFC. We've tried to counter that by bringing out some tools, that's why I talked some individual tools that would be attractive.","So, when I talked about the ratcheting wrenches and the specific high-durability ratcheting wrench that gets into certain small spaces, that's the kind of thing we're doing. And remember, I could have talked for the whole call about those kinds of things and so that's what we're trying to do to try to restart that. I think if you're dangerous, if you're looking at any one quarter at any particular group, because you do even in the good \u2013 when they were growing like a 7%, you saw ups and downs in those things so you can't necessarily conclude that hand tools because it's up and down, would be in trouble in terms of a tool category or be wanting in any way, we just didn't quite have the right package and we're trying to restart that with new product.","Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Got it. That's all I have. Thank you.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next to Bret Jordan with Jefferies.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Good morning.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Are you seeing any kind of a market share struggle, I guess. I mean, the question was kind of asked earlier. I have heard from mechanics and some of your other franchise peers are being aggressive on pricing at the shop level. And is that something that you're hearing at all from your franchisees?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","You know from the \u2013 Bret, from the 80,000 foot level, you would say, we must be seeing something like that, if other people are growing faster than you are. I don't know if the mechanisms for that competition are price or what, but when I ride and I was just on a van the other day and guy never mentioned Mac or Matco, or any other competition.","Now of course, he is talking to me and you can argue this, but I do meet with these guys a lot and often, they're just talking about ourselves, we could have \u2013 we could use different tool storage. We could use a new model in tool storage to address this kind of thing. We like the ZEUS. It takes \u2013 we're enthusiastic about the ZEUS. The feedback I get is all associated with ourselves. So I don't think we're feeling something that other people are doing other than maybe we're not doing as well as we could do versus what we expect of ourselves, that's the difference, I think. Really.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","I think the Snap-on franchise \u2013 you ask people about the preferred form of hand tool, that seems rock solid.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then a housekeeping. On rates, would you expect and I guess the rates were down and maybe I think Aldo mentioned some promotional issues on the quarter on the funding rate, but would you expect rate to be up going forward just given the increasing rate environment? Or do you think we're still sort of \u2013 we're going to be kind of flat?","Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.","I think they stay, Bret. It wasn't by a couple promotions. The products that fascinated the customer is what we call featured products. Featured products usually have rebates associated with them. That marketing expense comes off of the interest income that we calculate and the uptake on those was just better than what it had been in Q4 of last year. So you get a little bit of a depressant effect.","And then the mix in the portfolio tend to be a little bit better quality credit and a lot of the shop owners with the ZEUS that Nick mentioned, the principal buyers of that are pretty good credit quality customers that drives the rate in the portfolio down a bit. So it depends on the mix of those. To answer your question, I think it stays in the 17% to 18% range on a holistic basis for finance receivables.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great.

Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's second quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning.","We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer, and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer.

I'll speak about the general environment and the trends we see, and I'll take you through some of the progress we've made. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.","Our second quarter was encouraging, and we believe it once again offered evidence of clear advancements that along our runways for both growth and for improvement. Reported sales were up 2.4% or to $872.3 million and that included unfavorable foreign currency translation this quarter, an impact of $10.2 million. It also reflected an incremental $5.9 million from last year's Ecotechnics acquisition.","Now, organic sales for the quarter rose 2.9%. OpCo operating margin expanded by 140 basis points and earnings per share, they reached $2.36, up 16.3% compared with the $2.03 the last year. The OpCo operating margin reached 19.1%, up from 17.7% in 2015. And that 140-basis point increase reflects a higher sales, but it also represents the power of Snap-on value creation. For Financial Services, operating income grew to $49.5 million from last year's $41.4 million, combining with OpCo to drive our consolidated operating margin to 22.9%, up 180 basis points.","From an overall macro perspective, the automotive repair arena remained strong and that can be seen clearly in the businesses serving that sector, the Tools Group and the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group. They continue to make progress in the quarter both in and outside the United States.","The Tools Group organic activity increased 5.8%, once again demonstrating its ability to expand on our already-strong position, leveraging a stream of new products and innovative solutions, capturing more business by helping technicians keep pace with changing vehicle technologies and with the aging fleets.","In RS&I, organic gains of 5.2%, higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, increased volumes with OEM dealerships, expanded activity in undercar equipment, and broad progress in most regions.","For the Commercial & Industrial Group \u2013 well, for Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, organic sales were down 2%. Results were mixed across our industrial sectors and geographies. And in critical industries, headwinds surrounding our military business remained, spending stagnation from Washington continued in the quarter. We also witnessed ongoing inactivity within the Middle East. Aviation customers delaying project work due in part to the turbulence throughout that area, that region.","That said, there were positive industrial sectors, in places like U.S. aviation and power generation, where we made progress based on our understanding of the tests, our increasing understanding of the tests and our extending product lines that enable that work.","Also a positive for C&I, SNA Europe advanced. SNA Europe, our European hand tools business delivering positive results, broad strength across the core of Europe, in places like the U.K., Germany and Spain, in a period when the word Brexit entered our vocabulary accompanied by uncertainty.","So the overall results remain positive, strength in vehicle repair, mixed performances from critical industries and advancements against the wind in Europe. Opportunities outweighing the challenges and the sales growth confirms it, and the operating income clearly demonstrated the leverage and the power of Snap-on Value Creation, our Snap-On Value Creation Processes in safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement. In this quarter, special note should be made at customer connection and innovation, keeping pace with the aging car part and the changing technologies across the workplaces of the world.","And another broad trend, as we move toward automatic control and more drive-by-wire, is the growing need for more precision in mechanical adjustments and more insight into data trends. Snap-On innovation is responding to that opportunity and the products that support the need for precision and insight help drive our sales and our margins in the quarter.","Customer connection and innovation and in fact all of the Snap-on Value Creation Processes helped us advance down our runways for improvement everyday driving our 140-basis point OI gain and overcoming the challenges. So that's the overview. That's the macro overview.","Now, let's turn to the groups, let's move to the groups. We'll start with C&I. As I just said, a 2% organic sales decrease with lower critical industry activity and higher volume at SNA Europe and our Asia\/Pacific and power tools operations. The operating income margin was 13.8%, a 50-basis point decrease impacted principally by the reduced sales in the higher-margin critical industry business.","For the Industrial division, we had headwinds, but as we said, we also had sectors of growth. U.S. aviation sales were higher bolstered by innovative new products like our latest in Tool Control solutions, the Automated Tool Control locker. You may remember, our ATC smart toolboxes, visually keeping track of workplace hand tools. Well, the new ATC locker brings that asset control to a regularly shaped items, like extension cords, toolkits, and plastic or fabric carrying cases, personal protective equipment, all common in aviation shops.","The new ATC locker makes tracking those non-standard tools easy and reliable, and like the smart box, the ATC locker is fully networkable. It enables tracking from a central site, displaying the tool control status for easy surveillance and avoidance of foreign object damage. Avoiding foreign object damage are really important feature in those critical aviation applications; we can all relate to that. And based on the early reception, we believe we have a winning extension to our flagship tool control line with this locker, doing well.","Now, we often speak about customer connection, direct observation of the work and guiding new product innovation based on that observation. While the Industrial division is constantly introducing new products, born out of that value creating process. One example is our SGDE series of electrostatic dissipative screwdrivers, great for places like avionics maintenance shops or any critical application where static discharge can damage sensitive equipment, special conductivity to dissipate static and in a rotating handle mechanism that's ideal for precise, detailed electronics work. Safety and precision, two special needs made clear by direct observations at aviation MRO back shops across the world, customer connection and action making work easier in the aviation sector, that's what these screwdrivers are.","Another customer connection, this time the offset crowfoot adaptor for the specially configured fasteners at power generation sites. It replaces homemade welding tools that frequently break and damage those high-voltage insulators \u2013 we've all see them on the top of transformers \u2013 damage that equals critical failure. Visiting those substations, observing the work, we also saw Frankenstein-like modified tools, welded out of multiple tools, trying to do the transformer task and we knew we could do better. So we designed a Snap-on professional tool, that's more durable, safer and easier to use. It's a great attraction in power generation and it's products like that, that are behind this quarter's positive results in that sector.","Now, let's speak about SNA Europe. During the double-dip in Europe, we said we would use RCI energetically and we did. But we also said we wouldn't reduce capacity. Well, that faith is paying-off. SNA Europe registered its 11th straight quarter of year-over-year sales growth, a positive trend in a very uncertain economic environment of Europe. And profit, Q2 marked the 13th straight quarter of margin improvement. SNA Europe up again in sales and in profit.","Our Asia\/Pacific operations also contributed positively and we kept investing in that region, more products, more distribution, more capabilities, positioning to take advantage of that building potential. Well, that's the C&I story, turbulence in certain critical industries partially offset by progress in other divisions.","Now, let's move to the Tools Group. Organic sales were up 5.8%, reflecting mid-single digit gains in the U.S. and internationally. Operating margin of 18.3%, up 120 basis points, overcoming 80 basis points of unfavorable currency. That 18.3% and 120-basis point rise, it's a clear demonstration of our improving position and progress along one of our most important runways for growth, enhancing the van channel. The advancements are evident in the sales and in the margins, and perhaps most importantly in the overall franchisee health metrics, which are all trending positively again this quarter. We believe our franchisees are growing stronger armed with an array of innovative products. Products like the new 1\/4-inch Drive Extra Long Flex Head Ratchet. At 10.5 inches, it allows technicians to work in difficult-to-reach spots under the dash, in tight engine compartments or anywhere that access is limited, and it combines our patented dual pawl system with a finely machined 72-tooth gear, more power in less lateral space at a distance.","It's manufactured in Elizabethton, Tennessee, in our Elizabethton, Tennessee tool plant, and it's the next in the series of extra-long handle tools, designed specifically to make the technicians toughest jobs much easier and we believe it does just that. And early sales have been robust.","Now, we've been making torque products for some time. In the second quarter \u2013 but in the second quarter, we launched the heavy-duty 0.5 inch drive mechanical torque wrench. We call it the Brutus, the Brutus 300, targeted at technicians servicing larger vehicles. It solves a critical need, making it possible to torque a wide range of fasteners using a single tool in places where a number of special tools would normally be required.","Today, the trend I described, many larger vehicles, large SUVs and pickup trucks, responding to the need for more precise specifications require a wider range of torque, some in tight places, some on buried components, some above 250-foot pounds, big components like brake calipers, pitman arms, and wheel hubs. Previously, a technician would go through a time consuming multi-tool procedure or sometimes just torque by judgment. The Brutus uses Snap-on's unique metallurgical capability to reach in the farthest places, fit in the smallest spaces, but have the strength necessary for larger torque values, all in a relatively light package for less fatigue. It's manufactured at our plant in City of Industry, California. It's long, small, light and strong responding to a growing need for precise torquing in larger vehicles.","Along with the innovative product, the Tools Group has another special advantage, our Financial Services arm, Snap-on Credit, strategic program aimed at supporting those essential big ticket purchases. The credit company is focused on enhancing our van network and again this quarter it did just that. So that's the Tools Group. New products guided by customer connection driving sales growth and strong margins.","Now onto RSI, solid across the group, organic sales growth of $14.2 million or 5.2%, operating margin 25.2%, rising 80 basis points, broad-based progress, operation-by-operation, the diagnostics and information businesses selling to independent repair shops driven by our award-winning handheld diagnostics products and by our extensive database of repair solutions.","Whether it's the top of the line, VERUS Edge with its comprehensive diagnostics, technical service bulletins, and the power of SureTrack big repair data for advanced professionals and working on those really difficult repair, whether it's that big VERUS Edge for advanced professionals or for the entry-level technician, the ETHOS Tech with its considerable functionality and attractive price point, the Snap-On line-up of handhelds makes work easier across the garage.","Some of today's vehicles now have over 100 electronic control units, all requiring service, so the demand for diagnostic tools and data insight is rising. And to support those growing complexities, our Mitchell 1 team continues to refine its ProDemand product, expanding make and model coverage, adding the most recent vehicle platforms, broadening search results, improving navigation, providing even more shortcuts to a quick fix with its SureTrack big database, all of it saving the technician's time. The Mitchell 1 solution gets better every quarter, and we see it in the results. In sales undercar equipment, also up mid-single digits with growth registered in the U.S. and our international markets.","The U.S. gains included a particular strength by a pair of our recent acquisitions, the Challenger Lifts, and Pro-Cut break lathes, both expanding the Snap-on presence in the garage, and both progressing well in the quarter with products like Challenger's versatile CL12 lift, 3-stage Low Profile arms from more flexibility, and Pro-Cut's new X9 on-car brake lathe, more positioned in rotor matching, more repeatability of \u2013 stay calibrated over thousands of cuts. The trend in vehicle repair, more precision, that means more wheel alignment and more rotor matching and Snap-on has the products that make it easier.","Speaking about hit products and alignments, last quarter, I mentioned the launch of the V3300 wheel aligner. I said it was a game-changer, and so it was. Based on it \u2013 so it was, based on the enthusiastic reception from many prominent dealer networks, now with the full quarter in the book, the results are in and the sales have been strong, and it's no wonder. We spoken about the trend to more precision and that means more frequent alignments, enabling some of the new features like lane departure systems or adaptive cruise control and the V3300 fits that trend. More alignments are in the future and the speed and the accuracy of the V3300 is a great asset.","So to wrap-up RS&I, we see it as a confirmation together with the Tools Group of the strength of the auto repair market. RS&I great diagnostics, new repair information and expanded offerings of undercar equipment, all driving positive trends and improving our position with repair shop owners and managers.","Well, that's the highlights of the quarter. Growth and improvement. Progress, along our runways for coherent growth and clear advancements down our runways for improvement. When you step back and you look at these numbers, sales increasing organically by 2.9%; OpCo operating income margin of 19.1%, up a 140 basis points; EPS $2.36 in the quarter, 16.3% higher than last year, it was another encouraging quarter.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?","Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.","Thanks, Nick. Our second quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $872.3 million were up 2.4% including $10.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $5.9 million of acquisition-related sales. Excluding foreign currency translation and acquisition-related sales, organic sales increased 2.9%, primarily reflecting higher sales in our businesses serving automotive repair, partially offset by lower sales to critical industries in our C&I segment. Due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q2 sales comparisons by 120 basis points.","Consolidated gross margin of 49.4% improved 20 basis points from 2015 levels as benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives were partially offset by 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.","Operating expenses of $264.9 million yielded an operating expense margin of 30.3% in the quarter, an improvement of 120 basis points from 31.5% last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives, as well as lower stock-based mark-to-market compensation and other expenses, and a lower pension expense. As a result of these factors, operating earnings from Financial Services of $166.4 million, including $6.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 10.3% as compared to prior year, and as a percentage of sales, increased 140 basis points to 19.1%.","Financial Services revenues of $69.3 million in the quarter increased 18.1% from 2015 levels and operating earnings of $49.5 million increased 19.6%. These increases primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio.","Consolidated operating earnings of $215.9 million, including $6.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 12.3%; and the operating margin of 22.9%, increased 180 basis points from 21.1% a year ago.","Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 31% compared to 32% last year. For the full year, we continue to anticipate that our 2016 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our full-year 2015 rate of 31.7%. Finally, net earnings of $140.1 million or $2.36 per share, increased $20.1 million or $0.33 per share from 2015 levels, representing a 16.3% increase in diluted earnings per share.","Now, let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, on slide seven, sales of $285.7 million in the second quarter decreased 3.4%, excluding $4.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales declined 2%, primarily due to a double-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries, largely in the military and international aerospace market segments. This decline was partially offset, by mid-single digit increases in the segment's Asia\/Pacific and power tools operations and a low-single digit gain in the segment's European-based hand tools business.","Gross profit in the C&I Group of $111.4 million compared to $112.9 million last year. The gross margin of 39% increased 80 basis points, mostly due to savings from RCI and other cost reduction initiatives.","Operating expenses of $72.1 million in the quarter compared to $70.7 million last year. The operating expense margin of 25.2% increased 130 basis points from 23.9% last year, primarily as a result of unfavorable sales volume leverage and 70 basis points of higher cost including cost associated with continued expansion initiatives in Asia.","As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $39.3 million, including $1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, decreased $2.9 million from 2015 levels and the operating margin of 13.8% compared to 14.3% last year.","Turning now to slide eight. Second quarter sales on the Snap-on Tools Group of $416.7 million increased 4.5%. Excluding $4.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased $22.7 million or 5.8%, reflecting similar gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations. Gross profit of $182.1 million compared to $176.5 million last year. The gross margin of 43.7% decreased 60 basis points, largely due to 80 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.","Operating expenses of $105.8 million in the quarter compared to $108.5 million last year. The operating expense margin of $25.4% improved 180 basis points primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives and 20 basis points of lower stock-based cost associated with the company's franchisee stock purchase program.","As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $76.3 million, including $4.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $8.3 million and the operating margin of 18.3% improved 120 basis points from 17.1% last year.","Turning to the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group, shown on slide nine. Second quarter sales of $295.2 million increased 6.4% from 2015 levels, excluding $5.9 million of acquisition-related sales and $2.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 5.2%. The organic sales increase reflects a mid-single digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, as well as mid-single digit gains in both sales of undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships.","Gross profit of $137.8 million compared to $129.6 million last year. Gross margin was 46.7% in both periods.","Operating expenses of $63.3 million in the quarter compared to $61.9 million last year. The operating expense margin of 21.5% improved 80 basis points, principally due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives. Second quarter operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $74.5 million, including $1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $6.8 million from prior-year levels and the operating margin of 25.2% improved 80 basis points from 24.4% last year.","Now, turning to slide 10, operating earnings from Financial Services of $49.5 million on revenue of $69.3 million compared to operating earnings of $41.4 million on revenue of $58.7 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.9% in the quarter compared to 17.8% last year. And the average yield on contract receivables of 9.3% in the quarter compared to 9.4% last year. Originations of $281 million increased 10.9% from 2015.","Moving to slide 11, our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.7 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.5 billion from our U.S. operation. Approximately 82% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. In the first half of 2016, our worldwide Financial Services portfolio grew $121.3 million. As for finance portfolio loans and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.","Now, turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $162.1 million in the quarter, increased $1.8 million from comparable 2015 levels. This higher net earnings and improvement in working investment were largely offset by the timing of cash tax payments. Net cash used by investing activities of $95.3 million included $76.9 million to fund the net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $20.6 million in the quarter compared with $27.7 million last year.","Turning to slide 13, days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 60 days was unchanged from 2015 year-end levels. Inventories increased $9.3 million from 2015 year-end levels, mainly to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.4 turns compared with 3.5 turns at 2015 year-end.","Our quarter-end tax position of $119.9 million increased $27.1 million from 2015 year-end levels. The net increase includes $341.4 million of cash from collections of finance receivables and $303.7 million of cash from operations. These cash increases were largely offset by the funding of $475.1 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $70.9 million, the repurchase of 377,000 shares for $58.5 million and $40.1 million for capital expenditures. Our net debt to capital ratio of 23% compared with 24.6% at 2015 year-end.","In addition to our $119.9 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. As of second quarter-end, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.","This concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Thanks, Aldo. Well, that's the Snap-on second quarter; continuing the trend of positive performance with ongoing year-over-year gains, runways for growth, enhancing the van channel, and expanding with repair shop owners and managers. Vehicle repair, a space with strong tailwinds, aging car parts, changing technologies and a need for more precision, abundant opportunity, and you can see it in the results.","The Tools Group growing 5.8% organically and an OI margin of 18.3%, up 120 basis points. Something we haven't seen. And it was achieved against 80 basis points of unfavorable currency. RS&I in the vehicle repair space, broad gains, growing at 5.2% organically. OI margins of 25.2%, up 80 basis points. Tools and RS&I up again, clear evidence that vehicle repair is strong and it has abundant opportunity and that Snap-on knows how to take full advantage.","C&I, battling the difficulties in the military and international aviation, but proving it can extend and advance in sectors like U.S. aviation, power generation and in geographies like Europe where our efforts with SNA Europe are paying off, and all of it combined to author organic growth at 2.9%.","The second quarter also bears the mark of Snap-on Value Creation, customer connection and innovation, creating a growing list of new products to provide higher value, matching the needs for greater precision and performing the work of today and of tomorrow. And RCI, people all over the corporation getting up every day and making our complex business more efficient. Snap-on Value Creation drove our OpCo operating margin to 19.1%.","Again, stepping back and looking at the performance and at the numbers, growth up 2.9% organically, performance OpCo operating margin of 19.1% up 140 basis points, a significant rise again this quarter. And EPS of $2.36, a 16.3% increase. It was another encouraging quarter. And we believe that we have the abundant opportunity and the demonstrated capability to continue that positive trend on through the remainder of 2016 and well beyond.","Before I turn the call over to the operator for questions, I'll directly speak to our franchisees and associates. I know that many of you are once again listening to this call. The encouraging results of this quarter reflect the special capability, energy and dedication you bring to our effort every day. For your clear achievement in this period, you have my congratulations and for your contributions and your commitment to our team unfailing, you have my thanks.","Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. And we'll go first to Scott Stember with C.L. King.","Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Good morning.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Good morning.","Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Could you maybe just talk about the overall industry backdrop for the automotive aftermarket, doesn't seem to have that much of an impact on your quarter, but just specific to weather and whether you saw any mechanics or end-markets that were backing off on tool purchases somewhat in the quarter?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Not really. I mean, I think, look \u2013 I think, every quarter is different and there are ups and downs in every quarter in terms of the growth and in terms of the types of products that sell and so on, big ticket was very strong. I was just on a van within \u2013 just a little over a week ago and the franchisees and the garages we visited were all very, very optimistic. So I didn't get any feeling from that, from an anecdotal point of view. And then, during the quarter, I met with our \u2013 a group of our franchisees several times from the United States and Canada and so on and they seemed uniformly positive.","And when I look at the numbers, I think this market looks like it has looked to us for multiple quarters now, for a long time. So empirically with the numbers and anecdotally from what I get from talking to franchisees and technicians, I think this is pretty positive.","Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And focusing on the Tools Group, maybe just talk about some of the higher-priced electronics versus traditional tools and power tools, maybe how that trended in the quarter?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Yeah. Well, big ticket items. What we've \u2013 diagnostic sales were strong in the quarter for the Tools Group. We \u2013 you have kind of a secular trend in the market, what I characterize in my remarks is a tailwind, the need for more diagnostics because 40% to 50% of repairs in the parts today need a diagnostic to effect it efficiently and new cars are 80%, so there is a growth toward everybody needing a diagnostic, we see that in our everyday sales and the trends in the market. But in this particular quarter, big ticket items were fairly strong, high value, some of the things I talked about high-value tools that attack precision like the Brutus 300, strong-seller.","So the idea \u2013 hand tools in fact were also up very strong. So we saw I think pretty wide strength, but again in this quarter, big ticket led the way. And that's what we expect, because our marketing age around Rock N' Roll Cabs and we've just done a major refurb on the Techno-Vans have kind of support those purchases.","Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Got it. And just last question on currency. When you would expect to start to see some of the easier comparisons with the...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","For your information, for example, you can look at it this way. In the second quarter, the numbers were in sales, we had about $16 million and $0.09 of currency impact between transaction and translation. In this quarter, we had $10 million and $0.07, $10 million \u2013 just north of $10 million and currency in sales. And I think that's 1.2% or something like that and about $0.07 of currency impact on profitability, 50 basis points in the OI, impacting the OI margin.","If you go forward, if everything stayed where it is, for us the pound is a big \u2013 is kind of a big deal. So I think you would say that in the third quarter, the comparisons are such that there would be a slight easing if everything stayed the way it was and then the fourth quarter would get easier I think for us, so that's the way we'd see the year going on, an easing of the pressure of currency, but I think that happens more in the fourth quarter and the third quarter, primarily because of the pound and the pound does carry uncertainty around the exchange rate today and anyway in that situation. But if it stays the way it is today, that's how it'll be.","Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And just a quick follow-up, sales that are bound by the pound, what percentage of your total sales are coming from that region?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","About 8%...","Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.","8% or 9%.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","About 8% or so. And no one knows what the \u2013 what Brexit is going to do. The roll up to Brexit was I think a time of uncertainty. We didn't really see much change, but we're selling into a very basic critical industry, so our people are going to \u2013 I think our people buy. We've even see it. So on a deep recession, people bought the small \u2013 the low payback \u2013 the short payback items, even in the deepest of recession. So it remains to be seen what effect Brexit will have, but we're optimistic about it. Okay?","Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Got you. Thanks for taking my questions.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Next to Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Good morning, Gary.","Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.","Good morning, Gary.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Nick, what \u2013 you didn't give a percentage on the European hand tools up in the quarter, can you share that with us, or maybe I missed it?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","It was up low-single digits in the quarter.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Okay.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","So we usually don't give percentages, but we have given it in those kinds of terms, mid-single digits, low-single digits, high-single digits.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Right.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","It was up more in profitability. We're pretty encouraged by that though. Like I said, it's the 13th straight quarter growth. And what's really encouraging I think is the growth in core Europe. We haven't seen growth in the core of Europe like this before uniformly. So I am a little encouraged by U.K., Germany and places like that. France, it was encouraging for SNA Europe.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","And then, the previous caller asked a question about currency. Did you say that currency comparisons for the pound should get easier as we go through the back half of the year?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","I said \u2013 what I said, well, hard to predict, you know. I mean, the thing is \u2013 and you got the cocktail of what you sell and all that stuff. But if all things remain equal, what will happen is, is that currency in general will get \u2013 currency in general, the pound becomes more difficult I think as you rollout through the year, but then the other currencies abate. So if you look at the total, it gets \u2013 if everything stays the way it is, and the mix stays the way it is, you end up having a little softening in the third quarter and more softening in the fourth quarter. I think that's the way to think about it.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Okay.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","(40:43) problematic and in fact it might be...","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Right.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","... more problematic (40:46).","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Right. So would be the Canadian dollar and the euro...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Canadian dollar, Aussie dollar, you know, the euro, the SEK...","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Right.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","...those kinds of \u2013 those kinds of currencies, the comparison simply get easier later.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","And then did you see any disintermediation in Europe post-Brexit for the first couple of weeks of this quarter, can you discuss that at all?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","No. We don't comment on the forward quarter, but I don't really think so. I mean, certainly I'll say this, there was a lot of uncertainty in the \u2013 going \u2013 I was in Europe just before the Brexit vote and there was a lot of uncertainty floating around, around that and we didn't see it impact then, I don't know what will happen going forward. But again, I say, we sell items that solve critical tasks, that tends to be less effective by the economics. It can go up and down in a short period, but I think over time, it doesn't get affected. So I don't really think we expect in that situation.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Right.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","If the exchange rate changes dramatically that would have a transactional effect of course. If it affects the interest rates that would have another thing around other than \u2013 in other parts of the corporation, but I don't really \u2013 we didn't see anything so far.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","And then in terms of the Snap-on Credit, it keeps growing in excess of the sales of the Tools Group, are you seeing more of an appetite or are more products being financed by the technician that...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","No, not so much. Not really that. I mean the thing is fundamentally, what's happening in the Tools Group, if you look at it from our perspective and we look at it, you can't look at any one quarter because there is a secondary market and there is a lot of \u2013 that's actually the franchisee sales not our sales, so it doesn't match up. There is a lot of noise from quarter-to-quarter. But if you look at overall the last year, the originations are roughly the same as the sales of the big ticket items. So it's being driven by the sale of those big ticket items. And if you've been a student of Snap-on, you know that we have been energizing big ticket sales through we think better product of course in diagnostics and tools storage, but also in terms of the marketing, in terms of the marketing, the Rock N' Roll Cabs and the Techno-Vans.","So if I didn't know anything, I would say Snap-On puts Rock N' Roll Cabs and Techno-Vans in it and makes clear cold boxes, I'm going to see high originations because it's going to have a higher big ticket sale.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Nick.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","We'll go next to David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yes. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the call. Nice quarter, Nick.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Thank you.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Just talking about the growth though in the Tools segment, you guys peaked out in the first quarter of 2015 at about 13% organic growth. And just because of the comping process, obviously that's not a sustainable level and you're going to be coming down. But that organic growth has been sort of settling back down for six consecutive quarters now; you're back to 5.8% this quarter. You talked many times in the past about the long-term growth in the Tools segment, it's probably closer to about 4%. And I just wonder, are we on our way back to that kind of level here in the second half of the year or is there something -?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","I think, what I said is \u2013 I'll say \u2013 I'll make two comments about that. One is, is that, all through \u2013 there has been periods when we grew it like 6% or 5%. During the string of 23 out of 24, I think a year before in 2013, I think, we grew it like \u2013 we threw a bunch of 6%s during that period. So it goes up and down. This is a risk fluctuation.","I've said this, I think \u2013 look, I think the Tools Group goes in the 4% to 5% range if based on the tailwind. It's got \u2013 that's a great market, automotive repair is the market, one of the market \u2013 in our model is one of the business models that Saturn (44:59) automotive repairs, one of the great, great markets, you've got tech \u2013 you've got aging of the part and you've got changing its technology, you've got more precision and that will drive us in a 4% to 5% range and things like Rock N' Roll Cab and Techno Express in the system program drives us up into higher levels depending on how effective that unleashes these \u2013 how much more effective that makes the van business. So from time-to-time, we get above this. And I think our ability to grow above the 4% to 5% depends on our ability to keep coming up with those things. That doesn't mean we can grow at every quarter so I think that's how I view it.","I think we were at a solid 4% to 5%. But I think if we can keep coming up with ways to amplify our business, the technicians are there. There's 1.3 million technicians, we're calling on 850,000 of them, so a lot of them we'd be hiring every year. So we see a great market there. The other thing I will offer about the quarter, yeah, it was 5.8% but 18.3% OI margins.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","The incremental margins were fantastic and you said...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Try to find one of those in the Tools Group history.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah. But...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Now, it's again 80 basis points.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Right. Could you...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","So I guess the less than 6% sales and 7% sales didn't affect the profit \u2013 so they're still bringing the money...","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Right.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","... to the bottom line.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","And you've said repeatedly that during that period of superb growth that you're not too focused on costs, you're more focused on just bringing in the business. But at some point that growth would ease and that's where we will see the margin improvement, just there was a lot of low-hanging fruit.","I guess, which is part of why I asked the question, and now you're starting to see the margin growth which would confirm as a milestone that maybe we're at that point where the growth starts to ease. But you also said earlier in the call that you're still seeing strong double-digit growth in originations and originations attracts big ticket. So I guess the question I would next ask is what's easing within Tools, what do you see that if big tickets are holding up, what's easing on you?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Well, look, I didn't say in the quarter that was \u2013 I didn't match the double-digit growth of big ticket to the \u2013 or double digits of originations in the quarter, because you can't do that. You got to look at it over a longer period. So what I did say was the double digits in 2000 \u2013 of originations in 2015 maxed, almost pretty close to dead-on the big ticket items in 2015. In any quarter, it's hard to say that. I don't think in the quarter, the more robust businesses were around diagnostics, around hand tools. I think we had a dynamite hand tool quarter, but maybe we had a possibly less of a power tools quarter than we did in the prior quarter, that's the kind of characteristic we had. So we had some goes-ins and goes-outs, if you want to look at it by product.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah. And you're not adding any more tech or Rock N' Roll Cab Express, so I presume that the storage part of this is starting to level out a little as well, is that correct?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","No. Yeah, yeah. But we actually did add one in the quarter. So went from 66 to 67, I mean, okay, it's not much. Look, I don't \u2013 I think it's one quarter. I'm not saying that \u2013 I'm not \u2013 we don't give any guidance, I'm just saying it's one quarter, so I think it's a little wrong to explain to view it totally as what were the mix in one quarter and, will tool storage go down, I don't think so.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Last question was just you talked on the last call about extending a little more credit to your most discerning franchisees, guys with the strongest track record at dispensing credit. And I'm just wondering where did that credit get put to work in the quarter and where does that show up in the segment numbers, if in fact it did get put to work?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","It shows up in the originations and in the Tools Group, those are the big ticket items. Those guys are wielding big ticket items. So that's part of the support system that allows us to sell those big ticket items. I mean big ticket is basically \u2013 and it has been for Tools, this has been 30 years of this or 50 years, I don't know how long, but it's been since the 1980s at least that they have been and I think longer that they've been financing big ticket items in this way. And what we did, as you said, is \u2013 what we did was just bring striking to the franchisees where we listen more to some guys and listen less to other guys depending on the record to call in the air strikes about appropriate credit. And in the quarter, that kind of \u2013 I think in the quarter, that kind of was relatively stable. But over like the last 18 months, we've had \u2013 we strike more guys that have been better at credit, and they've been able to aid the credit process more effectively.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","All right. Thanks very much.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","We'll go next to Bret Jordan at Jefferies.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning, guys.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Yeah, good morning.","Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.","Good morning.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Just to follow-up your comment on the secondary market in the \u2013 on the credit side, I'm just sort of trying to line up the growth in the finance book relative to the growth of sales. Has anything \u2013 and I guess we've decided that there is not an increase in penetration of credit on a transactional base, so you're not lending at a higher rate. It's been more a growth of high-value sales, but then you had a comment about the secondary market sort of creating some volatility there. Is that when your lending on a transaction where a franchisee is selling a used tool they took on trade?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Yeah. Let's take it this way. Yes, that's essentially what it is. But what I meant was, what I offered that comment for is, it's harder to take one quarter's numbers in origination and relate it from originations, the credit action to the actual sale, which is a movement of product from us, from Snap-on Tools to the franchisee. The product moves from Snap-on Tools to the franchisees, it might go into inventory, it might sell directly, and it might ignite say, okay, I've sold you this, Mr. Big Box, it's like 15-feet wide and I took your 7-foot box in trade and I'm selling that, both transactions would be financed.","And so while the net, you get a discount from the original for the amount in trade and then that would be on. So the total amount tends to be sort of the same. The timing of those two things can be very different. So a franchisee might end up in his garage, might have three boxes, used boxes waiting there, and then one quarter might roll them all out, might find a seller for them (51:53), you see what I mean. And so...","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Yes, I do.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","...that tends to distort the timing, not the amount, but the timing.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then back on the Tools, on the contribution from RCI versus leverage, did you discuss sort of what the RCI impact was in the prepared remarks, I didn't hear it?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Sure. I mean, the Tools Group is more or less like this. The OI margin is up 120 basis points and they had 80 basis points of negative currency. The principal offset is RCI.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then one question on C&I. You talked about U.S. aviation and power generation being highlights. Did you say anything \u2013 are you seeing any shifting trends? I mean, energy was a category you used to call out as being challenged? Is there any sign of improvement in some of the other big pieces like energy or mining that have been lagging in C&I?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Well, mining, I don't think so. Energy, generally, oil and gas is still lagging, but not by the mammoth proportions we saw in the in the first quarter and the fourth quarter of last year. So that came back a little bit. That got better. And for C&I in general, as we go into the third quarter and fourth quarter, we start to get into, I'll say less demand in comparisons in military and in international aviation as well. So you see that kind of effect going on.","In terms of the quarter-to-quarter business, we saw \u2013 I think we saw rays of hope in places like U.S. aviation and power generation. And general industry seemed to be fairly nice in the quarter. So we're encouraged by that, but I'm not \u2013 given the fact that we're down 2% in the quarter and down more in the critical industries, I'm reluctant to predict any turnaround until I actually see it.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then one final question on RS&I, just to cover all the bases. In the mix of software versus hardware, are you seeing a shift where you've got this great penetration of diagnostics in your selling software upgrades and that's increasing as a percentage of the mix or is that business kind of stable? It would seem like the software margin should be pretty good.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Software margins are pretty good, but I'd say in the quarter, it was relatively stable. From time to time, we can see a bump from software based on, we'll issue 18.4 (54:38), will come out in a quarter and that will bump the software sales. But generally, I would say our software sales go up with the general push of diagnostics. Remember, we tend \u2013 when we're looking at RS&I, we're looking at the sales we show you have quite a bit of software in it in Mitchell 1. Mitchell 1 is a pure software business. Repair shop information and repair shop management, that's where that SureTrack business is.","Generally though I don't think we've seen a big change in the mix yet. It might be entitled to the idea that going out future as we get more installed base, you may see some improvement in that. I tend to think as we get more installed base, we'll see both because people will buy in first. The entry-level technician will buy in at the bottom level for that ETHOS. And then when he starts to get more experience, who want to trade up and buy both software and hardware as he trades up.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. So the penetration rate of hardware is still growing. It's not just...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","No, we don't.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","You don't have a cycle where you get to sell a lot of \u2013 a very high-margin software to a large installed base of hardware?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","No, we eventually will. I mean, but I think now, we're still seeing a growing of the penetration.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","We'll go next to David Leiker at Baird.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. This is Joe Vruwink for David.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Hi. Joe.","Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.","Hi, Joe.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I just want to circle back on your C&I comments. I think it was last year in Q3, when military took its first step down and then energy followed in Q4. So when you look at spending levels in those two businesses as we head into this year's Q3, do you think you could actually get to the point where the comparisons flip around and C&I reports a positive comp in Q3?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Well, as I said, I think the comps get easier. Clearly, the military comp gets easier, the international aviation comp gets easier, the oil and gas comp kind of is starting to get easier now. So I think those get better. Whether I can predict the turnaround in the military business, the oil and gas business, or the Middle East loosens up, hard to say. They do loosen up and I think you see favorable comps.","I mean, like I said, I am positive about our mechanism there, our proof-of-concept. We keep investing in those businesses. If you look at the C&I SG&A or OI this quarter, you see quite a bit of investment, that's because we invested in Asia, we kept investing in these markets because we believe in them. So we obviously believe a turnaround, whether that's a third quarter or not is another question, but these comparisons do get softer.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. And then shifting back to the Tools Group, not to belabor this question, but growth slowed more than two points sequentially and your comparisons versus a year-ago got easier. So by saying that hand tools were good in the quarter and big ticket items were strong in the quarter, there just seems to be a missing link in the equation that would explain why growth ultimately did decelerate?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Well, as I said, I don't really want to go through all the items, but the power tools is down and so on. I don't necessarily recognize that the comparison was necessarily soft versus last year. I'm not really sure about that. But the thing is, is that, from our view, we're not seeing \u2013 all I can say is, we're not seeing anything in the market that's a difference. And so the 5.8%, yeah, it's down from the 8.1%, but we still see it as a pretty strong quarter and we don't have any other view of the future of the Tools Group or the auto repair market based on that.","In terms of how the numbers, how the numbers work out, like I said, big ticket, still strong, sold better than the average, hand tools are sold better than the average. The other ones were \u2013 obviously if you talk about arithmetic, they were lower than the average.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Fair enough. My last question, with Fortive being its own company, Matco has been a little more visible and it looks that their van count has grown pretty dramatically in recent years, but it doesn't really seem to be diluting Snap-on's growth at all. And so is it the case where the two of you or really the three of you in this market co-exist? Is there any deterioration or things that you're concerned about, just maybe an update on the competitive dynamics?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.","Well, the science of Danaher are strong managers. And so Fortive is a formidable competitor with Matco and so is MAC. But I haven't heard their names mentioned on the last several \u2013 in many, many van rides now. So \u2013 and including the last one, which was just a little while ago. So we don't seem to be seeing them and pinging on them. Whatever they are doing, they are doing it invisible to most of our people. I tend to think people decide to buy Snap-on Tools as they look at others. They make that choice. It's kind of a binary decision. You buy Snap-on because that's the best. If you don't, if you don't, if you don't want that, you look at a bunch of others.","Generally if you think about the numbers of people that we have in the field, the 3,487 vans and versus the \u2013 even the advanced Matco numbers, we're \u2013 our people are much more focused and spend more time with the certain amount of customers and calling those customer bases. The Matco and MAC guys chew a lot more dirt.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Very good. Thank you.","Nicholas T.

Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-On's first quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning.","We have on the call today, Nick Pinchuk, Snap-On's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-On's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick-off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results.

Nick?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Thanks Leslie. Good morning everybody. As usual, I'll start the call by covering the highlights of our quarter and along the way, I'll give you my perspective on our results, on our markets, on the progress we've made, and what we believe it all means. And then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.","We believe that our first quarter again demonstrated Snap-On's ability to continue its trajectory of positive results, overcoming significant headwinds, and period-to-period variations.","We're encouraged by the quarter. Something -- like every quarter, I suppose, but something did not go as we would like. The Tools Group remained below trend and some segments and some geographies saw a down period. But once again, our strength overcame, our core hand tools, and the van network, and in Europe, and in segments like the military and general industry was strong.","And then our very different products, software, also showed significant progress across our businesses, and that general combination overcame the turbulence and moved us forward again.","Our reported sales in the quarter were $935.5 million were up of 5.5%, including $26.9 million of favorable foreign exchange, $14.3 million of acquisition-related sales, and $7.2 million or 8% organic gain.","EPS was $2.82 and that included a $0.07 net gain related to the issuance and early retirement of debt and a $0.04 charge related to the implementation of the U.S. tax legislation.","Without these one-time items, EPS was $2.79, up from last year's level of $2.39. That significant rise includes an OpCo operating margin of 19%, a 20 basis point decrease, but reflecting a 20 basis point impact from unfavorable currency, and a 10 basis points drag from the lower margins on our recent acquisition.","When you combine these OpCo gains with the earnings of $56.9 million from Financial Services, it brings Snap-On's consolidated operating margin to 23%, down 10 basis points from last year, again, impacted by currency and acquisitions.","Let's look at our markets. We believe the auto repair market remains a great place to be despite the variation. The Tools Group, it registered a similar performance to the fourth quarter last year with the U.S. volume down.","We clearly haven't returned to growth, but we do see the positives in our new products and in the underlying opportunities. Repair Systems & Information Group, or the RS&I Group, encountering a period of lumpiness in the essential project segment with vehicle OEMs, but despite that, still expanding -- Snap-On -- still expanding Snap-On's presence in the garage, capitalizing on innovative new tools, hardware and software, like the top-of-the-line ZEUS handheld diagnostic and its three-year data package.","The blue link mini truck diagnostic unit and are continuously strengthening ProDemand vehicle repair software, all leading to growth and independent repair shops and more than offsetting the OEM lumpiness.","C&I, it includes the businesses that serve critical industries and is the most international of our groups. And in the quarter, the results showed progress. Despite some challenges in industrial sectors and troubled geographies, in the critical industries, we saw improvement in the military and heavy-duty and general industry, combining to overcome period-to-period variations, as we call it, in segments like aviation and in places like the Middle East. From SNA Europe, we saw general advances in most of Europe. In our Asia-Pacific division, solid increases in key countries like Japan, China, and India.","So, overall, I'd describe our markets as continuing to offer opportunity. Now, challenges still exist and there are pockets of turbulence, but we're encouraged by the advancements in the quarter, progress down our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding our repair shop owners and managers, extending to critical industries and building in emerging markets, leveraging our broad -- our broadening product line and increasing our understanding of work, giving us the power to grow in critical sectors and important geographies.","Now, let's move to the segments. In the C&I Group, organic sales were up 1.9%, including the $13.6 million for Norbar and for our most recent acquisition, FASTORQ, and a $13.3 million of favorable foreign currency. First quarter as reported volume rose 11% compared to last year.","From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income was $46.5 million, up from the $41.9 million that we recorded last year. The operating margin was 14%, flat with 2017, but with volume and Rapid Continuous Improvement, or RCI, offsetting 70 basis points from unfavorable currency and a 10 basis point impact from our recent acquisitions.","The story for C&I in the quarter was continuing progress in several of the critical industries and advancements by SNA Europe, partially attenuated by a down period in aviation, both for international and for the U.S. and by lower sales of power tools for the Tools Group.","We're confident in and committed to extending in critical industries. We'll keep strengthening our position as we move forward and we have seen continuing gains, held greatly by our lineup of innovative new products, matched to the task, and designed to especially make work easier in the uniquely challenging industrial workplaces.","One example is our recently released line of [Indiscernible] pistol grip pneumatic drills manufactured in our Murphy, North Carolina plant. It's a new product line used for drilling ferrous and non-ferrous metals, plastics and composite, aimed at complex assembly and repair where precision is critical.","This tool offers a dual chamber motor for high drilling torque, a drop-in motor configuration with simple alignment -- with simple alignment for quick service and at three planned gear carrier for precise -- precision and durability, all great design, all top-of-the-line design features. And it's also quite easy to use and it has a lightweight housing for extended use without strain and a contoured inlay grip for maximum comfort and reduced fatigue. The new Murphy pneumatic drill power, durability and comfort is a winning product for task and critical industries.","Now, I already mentioned SNA Europe's organic sales growth. That progress was clearly evident in our results and was broad-based across the European landscaping, including some fairly difficult reasons.","Snap-On SNA Europe -- SNA Europe's positive trends or performance now extends to 18 straight quarters with year-over-year sales growth and profitability. It was up once again contributing to C&I performance, now reaching 20 continuous quarters of improvement.","The SNA Europe positive trajectory is also driven by innovative new products, products like the all in line BAHCO's precision cutting and holding pliers. Each of these is made with the ball bearing grade-- with ball bearing grade steel for resiliency, toughness, and the ability to withstand high impact.","For both the cutting and the holding pliers, the entire frame is heat-treated for superior stiffness and for the cutting -- and the cutting pliers have induction hardened edges, extra strength and sharpness that completes a clean cut for a minimum of 200,000 cycles.","BAHCO's new plier line, a powerful hand tool is designed to excel in critical applications. So, based on early inception, the professionals are now using it. The pliers have launched to a very strong reception. Well, that's C&I.","Now, onto the Tools Group. Organic sales down 2.7%, a mid-single-digit decline in the U.S., partially offset by a mid-single-digit gain internationally. And operating earnings, $68.9 million, down 2%, that represents a margin rate of 17%, lower by 20 basis points. So, the Tools Group, down in volume, minimizing the impact on profitability.","We are seeing turbulence, but our van network remains strong. You can see it in the franchisee metrics. The financial and physical indicators, again this quarter, they remained favorable matching the clear optimism we see when we meet our franchisees.","You see, we continue to be confident in the opportunity for our van network and the tools team is working with focus and energy to restart progress with programs like our refurbished rock 'n roll past and with great new products.","When we speak of products, we turn to Snap-On Value Creation and the processes of safety, quality, customer connection and innovation and Rapid Continuous improvement. In this case, it's customer connection and innovation, creating new products, solving critical tasks, and we're doing just that. For example, we're building a comprehensive line of ratcheting wrenches, wider than any other available, matching the unique requirements for a broad range workplace.","Last quarter, I spoke about the introduction of our longest 12 point, high performance ratcheting box wrenches. They sold extremely well in Q1 in the first quarter and they were joined this quarter by the introduction of our latest and smallest variance of our patented ratcheting wrench family, our compact length Drive Plus reversible ratcheting wrenches available in both SAE and metric and size down to six millimeters. This small, but still professional-grade ratcheting wrenches are equipped with [Indiscernible] gears made in the same special alloy steel found Snap-On's robust socket.","Our high-precision forming and machining and our unique call and high gear count provide access to the tightest spaces, while at the same time offering unparalleled confidence in the strength and durability of the tool.","These wrenches give the tech working on critical tasks the smallest envelope and the shortest swing arc, exactly what's needed to efficiently work with tiny fasteners in confined spaces. Under the crowded dashes of newer model -- newer model vehicles.","Check the 2014 Chevy Silverado some time and you'll see what I mean. This smallest offering in our ratcheting wrench line is one-third the length and one-fifteenth weight of the wrenches we spoke of last quarter. They are compact and they are going to be popular.","We believe we have a great range of hand tools in our new ratcheting wrenches and so do the technicians. Hand tools sales were up nicely this quarter, demonstrating our product strength and contributing to the tools market.","Another new tools product, the KMP 1422, Snap-On icon tool storage unit, designed after extensive customer connection with younger technicians and launched just as the quarter was closing. Made in our Algona, Iowa plant, the mid-tier unit with broad appeal, but with some great top-end features and unique capacity advantages.","It comes standard with integrated -- with an integrated power drawer for recharging cordless power tools and other electronic devices. It has a five outlet, two USB port power strip for charging batteries, cellphones and tablets, all while securely stored in the unit. And it offers a special speed drawer with configurable dividers giving the technician quick access to small tools and parts, a very attractive feature.","But most importantly, the icon has a redesigned profile, taller than our usual mid-tier boxes, providing greater capacity within the standard footprint, great for the compacts spaces, sometimes allocated to new techs. And along with the capacity and size, the new design offers strong durability, heavy-duty drawer slide, reinforcing our panels and vibration-absorbing chassis on a wider wheelbase, also provide a more stable environment for those heavy tool loads. We release the icon at the end of the quarter and we've seen some promising interest since its launch.","Let me make one more point on the Tools Group quarter. We've been increasing our emphasis on software with the shops and tech for some time, selling updates, promoting subscriptions, and with the ZEUS, focusing on a three-year data package. While in the first quarter, our software sales were up significantly, not enough to restart growth, but it does help overall profitability, and it does represent a very promising development.","Now, let's speak of RS&I, first quarter organic sales rose 2.6%, mid-single-digit gains registered by our diagnostic and repair information businesses focused on independent shops, low single-digit growth by our businesses focused on OEM dealers, and flat volume in our undercar equipment operation.","Operating earnings of $85.8 million increased $6.7 million from 2017. Operating margin was 25.5%, up 70 basis points, overcoming a 60 basis point impact from currency and acquisition.","Now, in the -- now, the OEM facing business advanced, but not as strongly in the recent past. You might remember that that operation is rooted in the essential diagnostic and tool commissioned by auto manufacturers for the dealers. Every quarter, some programs end and others begin. It's always been a lumpy arena and in the first quarter, our new projects, once again, outweighed those which are ending, but not by us a bigger margins in the past. So, the business showed lower growth. It's not indicative of a trend or the future. It's just the lumpy nature of that business.","Having said that, we continue to clearly see abundant runways for growth in the RS&I group, expanding Snap-On's presence in the garage. You can see it in the opportunities. You can see the opportunities and continuing progress demonstrated by our sales of diagnostics and information to independent repair shops.","That activity was, once again up, this time, mid-single-digits, showing our strong position, rooted in comprehensive repair information, wide coverage of makes, models, and years and amplified by our proprietary and formidable database of actual repair records, providing unique and time-saving shortcuts for technicians.","We keep expanding in those independent shops, driven by products like Mitchell 1's ProDemand for light vehicles, cars, light trucks and SUVs. Late last year, we enhanced ProDemand software with the addition of one search, providing clearly enhanced navigation and search capabilities. It was a winning move, driving more sales.","This quarter, we upped the ante again, making it possible to identify vehicles configuration simply by entering the license plate number. With that new feature, technician can enter the plate number and ProDemand will automatically identify the VIN and provide a specific equipment and service data for that particular vehicle. What a timesaver and for job service writers and for vehicle technicians for both of those populations. It really helps.","But Snap-On and RS&I isn't only in light vehicles. We're in repair information for commercial trucks. Mitchell 1's truck repair suite for medium and heavy-duty trucks helps professional diagnose and repair all makes of class for to class A trucks, saving mechanics' time throughout the fixed. It's the only comprehensive truck information software of its kind available and we keep building its strength, expanding the capabilities and adding features like our comprehensive repair job estimating package, a very popular feature.","And recently, we expanded again, adding a truck shop management system that helps businesses streamline and repair process, helps the business itself streamline and repair process, improve shop communication, engage with customers and track performance.","Snap-On had decades of expertise in offering high-quality shop management solutions for light vehicle -- for the light vehicle repair market. And now that time-tested software has been adapted for trucks helping that special segment improve efficiency. And the product has been received with enthusiasm. You can see it in the continuing Mitchell1 growth numbers and there's much more opportunity for further expansion.","Now, just finally, if you step back, you see that RS&I in recent quarters has shown some very encouraging growth in its vehicle software products. Those products are getting stronger every quarter. And this past period was no exception. Software was up significantly. It's evident in the RS&I OI margin of 25.5%, up 50 basis points, again, 60 basis points of currency and acquisition impact.","So, those are the highlights of the quarter. Continued progress, overcoming headwinds against variation, sales growth and profitability gain, Tools Group challenged, period-to-period variation in some areas, but strength enhancement in software helping to achieve a 19% optical operating margin down to 20 basis points, but overcoming 30 basis points of impact of currency and acquisitions.","EPS of $2.82 -- $2.79, excluding the $0.07 net gain related to net debt items and the $0.04 charge related to the U.S. tax legislation, up from $2.39 last year. It was an encouraging quarter.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?","Aldo Pagliari","Thanks Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $935.5 million in the quarter increased 5.5%, reflecting a 0.8% organic sales gain, $14.3 million of acquisition-related sales, and $26.9 million of favorable foreign currency translation.","Consolidated gross margin of 50.4% declined 10 basis points, primarily due to 20 basis points of unfavorable currency, 10 basis points from acquisitions, as well as other higher costs, but these were partially offset by savings from RCI.","The operating expense margin of 31.4% compared to 31.3% last year. Operating earnings before Financial Services as a percentage of sales was 19%, including 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency compared to 19.2% last year.","Financial Services revenue of $83 million and operating earnings of $56.9 million increased $6.2 million and $4.4 million respectively from 2017. Consolidated operating earnings of 23% of revenues compared to 23.1% of revenues a year ago.","Other income expense net was income of $2.8 million. This includes a net gain of $5.5 million that was associated with the treasury lock settlement gain of $13.3 million. This is related to the February issuance of $400 million of 4.1% 30-year senior notes. This was partially offset by a $7.8 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to the repayment of $200 million of 6.7% 10-year senior notes that were originally due in 2019.","Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 26.2% was increased by 120 basis points as a result of an additional $2.6 million tax charge. This reflects IRS guidance issued during the first three months of this year related to the implementation of last year's U.S. tax legislation and the computation of the company's 2017 federal income tax liability. Excluding this charge, the effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 as adjusted was 25.0% and compared to 30.7% in the first quarter of 2017.","Finally, net earnings of $163 million or $2.82 per share diluted share compared to $141.6 million or $2.39 per diluted share a year ago. Excluding both the aforementioned net debt items and the tax charge, net earnings as adjusted was $161.5 million or $2.79 per diluted share, up 16.7% compared to prior year Tier 1 earnings per share.","Now, let's talk to our results. Starting with the C&I group on slide seven. Sales of $331.6 million in the quarter increased 11%, reflecting a 1.9% organic sales gain, $13.6 million of acquisition-related sales, and $13.3 million of favorable foreign currency translation.","The organic increase includes low single-digit sales gains in customers in the critical industries and the European-based hand tool business and in the segment Asia-Pacific operations. These gains were partially offset by a mid-single-digit decrease in sales of power tools.","Gross margin of 39% decreased 10 basis points, primarily due to 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by benefits from higher sales volume and RCI.","The operating expense margin of 25% improved 10 basis points as 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects were more than offset by benefits from RCI and other cost-reduction initiatives.","Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $46.5 million increased 11% and the operating margin of 14% was unchanged from 2017 despite 70 basis points of unfavorable currency effects.","Turning now to slide eight. Sales in the Snap-On Tools Group of $404.7 million decreased 1.1%, reflecting a 2.7% organic sales decline, partially offset by $6.7 million of favorable foreign currency translation.","The organic sales decrease includes a mid-single-digit decline in the United States, driven by lower sales of big ticket items, which was only partially offset by a mid-single-digit sales gain internationally.","Gross margin of 44.6% increased 130 basis points year-over-year, principally due to 50 basis points of favorable foreign currency, but also a year-over-year shift in product mix and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives.","The operating expense margin of 27.6% increased 150 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the effect of the lower sales. Operating earnings for the Snap-On Tools Group of $68.9 million decreased 2% and the operating margin of 17% compared to 17.2% in 2017.","Turning to the RS&I shown on slide nine, sales of $337 million increased to 5.7%, reflecting a 2.6% organic sales gain, $0.7 million of acquisition-related sales, and $9.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation.","The organic sales increase includes a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products and a low single-digit sales increase to OEM dealerships. Sales of undercar equipment was essentially flat.","Gross margin of 48.1% decreased 40 basis points, mostly due to 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.","The operating expense margin of 22.6% improved 110 basis points, largely due to benefits from sales volume leverage and RCI initiatives, partially offset by 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $85.5 million increased 8.5% from prior year levels. The operating margin of 25.5% improved 70 basis points from last year.","Now, turning to slide 10, operating earnings from Financial Services of $556.9 million on revenue of $83 million increased 8.4% and 8.1%, respectively, from a year ago. Financial Services expenses of $26.1 million increased $1.8 million due to a $2.8 million year-over-year increase in provisions for losses on finance receivables, which totaled $15.8 million in the quarter.","On a sequential basis, finance receivable provision expense was down slightly from $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a percentage of the average portfolio, Financial Services expenses were 1.3% in both the first quarters of 2018 and 2017.","In the first quarter, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.8% in 2018 compared to 18% in 2017, driven principally by product mix. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 9.2% and 9.3%.","Total loan originations of $247.3 million decreased $17.3 million or 6.5% year-over-year due to a 9.4% decline in finance receivable originations, resulting from lower year-over-year sales of big ticket items in the United States for the Snap-On Tools Group, partially offset by higher originations of contract receivables.","Moving to slide 11, our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.74 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross Financial Services portfolio grew $8.3 million in the first quarter.","As for finance portfolio, losses and delinquency trends, they are tracking higher year-over-year similar to what we've seen over the last several quarters. That said we believe the overall portfolio metrics continue to support an appropriate risk\/reward balance in this segment of our business.","As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, the largest portion of the portfolio, trailing 12-month net losses of $49.4 million represented 3.08% of outstandings at quarter end, up 61 basis points year-over-year and 16 basis points sequentially.","The 60-plus day delinquency rate of 1.6% for U.S. extended credit improved 30 basis points sequentially, a bit better than the typical seasonal improvement of 10 to 20 basis points from the fourth to first quarter.","Overall, operating earnings in the Financial Services segment rose 8.4% year-over-year and our allowance for accounts reflects the above-mentioned trends and portfolio performance.","Now turning to slide 12, cash provided by operating activities of $231.9 million in the quarter increased to $39.5 million from comparable 2017 levels, primarily reflecting higher net earnings and an increase from net changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by cash proceeds from the 2017 treasury lock settlement.","Net cash used by investing activities of $37.1 million, included net additions to finance receivables of $16.5 million, down from $53.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net cash used by investing activities also included capital expenditures of $18 million and $3 million from the acquisition of FASTORQ, which provides hydraulic torque and tensioning products for use in the critical industries.","Net cash used by financing activities of $190.5 million included $450 million in senior note repayments. Dividend payments to shareholders of $46.5 million and the repurchase of 275,000 shares of common stock for $43.5 million under our existing share repurchase programs.","As of March 31st, we have remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $372.8 million of common stock under existing authorizations. These amounts were partially offset for the February sale of the $400 million of 30-year senior notes.","Turning to slide 13, trade and other accounts receivable increased $5.2 million from 2017 year end levels, due principally to $8.1 million of favorable foreign currency. Days sales outstanding of 66 days was consistent with 2017 year end. Inventories increased $40 million from 2017 year end, $20.9 million of which related to the recognition of an inventory asset associated with the adoption of ASU Topic 606 on revenue recognition.","In addition, foreign currency translation contributed $9.5 million of the increase. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.1 compared to 3.2 at year end 2017. Our quarter end cash position of $97.5 million increased $5.5 million from 2017 year end levels. Our net debt to capital ratio increased to 24.4% from 27% at year-end 2017.","In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter end, we had $132 million of commercial pay per borrowings outstanding.","That concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Thanks Aldo. Well, let me sum up. Snap-On's first quarter, progress against headwinds, some areas not where we would like, but also some significant gains. Our traditional strength, hand tools growing contributing significantly with new products leading the way and software, with techs and vehicle repair shops continuing upward trend in the quarter. That combination help to overcome the headwinds and drives general progress.","The Tools Group, down, but we're confident that we have the market, the products, and the team to move forward and upwards. C&I, critical industries, gains, overcoming period-to-period variations and SNA Europe continuing its long upward trend.","RS&I, ongoing gains with independent repair shop owners and managers, overcoming the lumpiness of OEM -- of the OEM central programs with a 25.5% operating margin. It all added up to a quarter of continued growth and profitability, and we believe it points to abundant opportunities and confirms that Snap-On has the position and the capabilities, the product, and that market to continue its positive trend through the rest of 2018 and beyond.","Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly for a moment to our franchisees and associates. Our first quarter results, our positive trend of performance, and our significant opportunities going forward would not be possible without your extraordinary contributions. For your success in driving our progress, you have my congratulations. And for your continuing dedication to our team, you have my thanks.","Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","And you will hear first from David Leiker of Baird.","Joe Vruwink","Hi, this is Joe Vruwink for David.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Hello Joe.","Joe Vruwink","I wanted to start with tools, so with finance receivable originations that 9% tools organic down less than 3%. Obviously, the implications at hand tools saw a really nice acceleration, particularly relative to what Q4 saw. I'm wondering what were the biggest differences between your execution in this Q1 quarter versus Q4.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Look, I think a couple of things. I think a couple of new products rolled out, our ratcheting wrench line expanded, there was a couple that I mentioned and some of the packaging that we had off -- the kick-off started to make sense to people and so you started -- people getting attracted to adding to their positions on hand tools. I think that's it. Generally, the compelling nature of the new hand tools was I think what drove this.","Joe Vruwink","And in the past, you have alluded to monitoring the POS off the van that giving you a sense of confidence that retail activity was pretty good, but your own sales into the channel were perhaps lagging retail activity. Where does that dynamic stand today? And I ask if new products are more compelling, does that potentially drive a restocking effect at some point this year?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Sure. I think that's true. I think, look -- I think what we saw is that big ticket items read -- principally, the big ticket items are tool storage didn't sell as well. We still have some work to do in that regard. You faired that out, you see it in the originations, but there's sort of like smaller ticket items sold pretty well off the van and so that seems a reasonable trend in the current situation.","What we have to do is solve the tool storage problematic and I think that has to do with data compelling nature of the product. I talked about the icon; we think that's one step towards that. The idea of the rock 'n' roll camp is another step in that regard.","Tools Group just keeps trying to look at the situation and the solution is, as I said, programs and products. You've got the icon, you've got the new ratchets, you have the new ZEUS out there with moving and positioning as more towards software, which seems to work reasonably well. And we've got other new products being introduced as we speak right now.","Joe Vruwink","Okay. And if I can switch to RS&I. So, we're coming out of this pretty unique environment, where sales growth had been pretty consistent for five quarters. Obviously, this segment is a lot lumpier historically. Is the OEM facilitation business, would you say that's exclusively responsible for the deceleration in growth in Q1? And given your visibility on new model programs that are going to be launching in 2018, do you have any sense, Q2 is going to be better or expect some feature of the quarter to also exclude exhibit some deceleration?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Look, a couple of things. First of all, it's not exclusively the reason. We had some -- so if you looked that we have some a little bit more tepid sales of undercar equipment and that had something to do with the sell-through in the Tools Group. Some of that -- some of the lower end stuff sell-through in the Tools Group, you have some of that. But principally, I think that big driver was in that OEM business.","Now, when we look forward, we have no reason to believe that the projects are tailing off. It's a matter of the calendarization of them and when they go in and out and which ones we capture. So, you kind of have a complex cocktail.","I, on the other hand, hold to my longtime view of the world that we say we grow to 4% to 6% organically and RS&I is in the middle of that. And if you remember, for I think it's 2015 and 2016, RS&I grew at 4.6% and 4.7% each year. Last year, they happen to grow at 7.4%, but we kept saying, it's in the middle of that 4% to 6% range over the long-term. We still feel that way.","Joe Vruwink","And then last question. There's a lot of focus right now on competitive dynamics and diagnostics and how ZEUS is faring and how Snap-On more broadly is faring. You talked about really strong growth in software, both for the Tools Group and RS&I. Can you bracket that? Is that mid-single, high single, double-digit? Just an update on your diagnostic growth and what you're seeing there?","Nicholas Pinchuk","If you're talking about me bracketing or dimensioning the software growth, I talked about -- I think saying it's up significantly is reasonable. I don't want to get reporting on another segment myself, but I think that's very positive. I think, look -- I think -- I can tell you this; ZEUS sold better than its predecessor significantly. So, I think we're very positive about that and one of the things right now we're introducing what we call the Apollo, which adds smart data to smart scans, smart data to the midrange line. So, that's rolling out as we speak.","See the Tools Group is not taking this -- looking at this situation very without urgency and focus. So, one of the things that we're doing is we're doubling down on that idea and rolling out in the mid-tier. I feel pretty positive about this. And early return say it's going to be a strong product.","Joe Vruwink","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","Yes, good morning everyone.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Good morning.","David MacGregor","Nick, just talk a little more about the tools segments and just, I guess, you talked about normalized growth in 4% to 6%, I think the tool segment is typically thought of kind of a 4% in that range -- at the lower end of that range. And notwithstanding, it sounds like you've got some new wrenches, you've got some new products out there that you're -- it sounds like you're pinning your expectations for a recovery in growth performance around new products, but--","Nicholas Pinchuk","I wouldn't necessarily use the word pinning. That sounds like that's the only thing we're doing.","David MacGregor","I guess I wanted to get at that because--","Nicholas Pinchuk","I didn\u2019t say that. No, I don't mean. Look, we're doing a lot of other things. Rock 'n' roll camp, a new catalog, a number of different programs, better training for our franchisees. So, we're doing other things.","David MacGregor","Right. So, maybe -- you did get on a few of these things, for instance, the franchisee transition to larger vans. How did that contribute to your first quarter segment growth, let's start with that?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Well, I think that's hard to the measure because it's complex cocktail of things. You've got the rollout of the 20-foot vans and then there's a kind of I think burn-in what we're finding about these vans, they come out, they get to 20-foot vans, it gives them more inventory. But the guys figure out -- in other words, more retail space. But the guys had to figure out how to wield it in their particular route.","So, it takes a little while for that to become pretty effective. So, when you overlay that, it's hard to really quantify that. But we feel, we feel -- I think I've said this many times on these calls that our performance is proportional to -- in some ways, proportional to the freeing more time of the franchisee and to -- which is some of the programs were doing, and adding more retail space. So, that's one of the things for the long-term. It's one of things where we feel okay and confident about the position that we're in.","David MacGregor","All right. Storage, how bad was it, can you say?","Nicholas Pinchuk","It was double-digits, upper double-digits. So, it wasn't -- it was a quarter, which is sort of like what we've seen, down. So, we haven't solved the tool storage problem. Now, these things -- when you start to look -- David, when you start to look quarter-to-quarter, you look at every quarter and you start to look at the numbers, you can get balled up in these things. Some of it types of focus. You launch ZEUS, people focus on that. They may not sell other things, but it's clear that tool storage is not where we would like it and it wasn't where we would like it this quarter again.","David MacGregor","As the rock 'n' roll camp refresh influenced organic growth here at all?","Nicholas Pinchuk","It's still too early to tell. It's been rolled out in the fourth quarter and we still -- we're still working on the configurator, which was a big part of the refurbishment, the 3D configurator with a little bit more activity. So, it's hard to say that right now, but we believe, based on the receptions I heard, I talked to more than a dozen franchisees, they're pretty positive about it. So, we'll see. These are one of these things -- it's kind of an art. We think we've got to the right mix, but we'll see.","David MacGregor","And you noted diagnostics were positive contributor to the RS&I growth, but what did they contribute to tools segment growth number? Is it positively or negatively?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Well, the Tools Group, the Tools Group, ZEUS was strong in terms of sales. But overall, the diagnostics business was down because of focus on the Tools Group. So, the other products, the mid-tier and the sort of like MODIS, which is between mid-tier and high tier were down and so that offset had a kind of downward push on the diagnostics number.","If you look at it off the van, they were kind of off the van, the diagnostics sales were sort of flattish year-over-year and that is against the thermal imager of last year. So, I think the franchisees are looking at it as pretty good sales.","Now, of course, the ZEUS is focused on a certain population, the Senior, Senior Tech and the shop owner. So, it's a select group of people you're selling too.","David MacGregor","Okay. Last question for me and that is just you've talked about regaining back to a 4% growth rate, I guess, is a long-term normalized number for tools. Kind of six consecutive quarters now below that. What's the time expectation before we can get back to a 4%?","Nicholas Pinchuk","I don't have time concept on that. All I can tell you is, boy, I'm impressed with the product we're rolling out. You would be too if you set where I am. that's all I can say.","David MacGregor","Thanks. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question comes from Liam Burke of B. Riley FBR.","Liam Burke","Yes, thank you. Good morning Nick, good morning Aldo.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Good morning Liam.","Aldo Pagliari","Good morning.","Liam Burke","Nick, you had a strong finish in 2017 in C&I across the Board, both on critical industries and geography. This quarter, Europe looks strong. How did Asia-Pacific do? And could you give us some sense on longer term, how some of the other underperforming critical industries will go?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Look, I think it's -- I sort of think it's like this. Asia-Pacific -- Southeast Asia is kind of weak, but we're -- we were encouraged, so we had some down drafts in places like Indonesia and Thailand, which created some offset. But India, Japan, China, up nicely. So, Asia-Pacific I think, if you look at the total, you're kind of encouraged by that.","If you look at critical industries and you look at the down -- aviation was off, but we view it as period-to-period. If you step back and you look -- and you look at the six months associated with our critical industries across all the segments, you're approaching double-digits.","So, it's a matter of variation when the projects fall from quarter-to-quarter in various segments. So, that business is a little bit lumpy. Remember that C&I grew -- what are the growth? 10.1% organically in the quarter last quarter. So, we see a little bit of lumpiness flowing through there. We don't see anything -- I don't read anything into the little bit lower growth in the C&I this quarter.","Liam Burke","Okay, great. And you did highlight power tools sales into -- from -- into the Snap-On Tool Group channel. Do you think the new product introductions will help stem that decline or was it factor -- was it at a competitive factor or?","Nicholas Pinchuk","No. Look I think there's always competitive factors in power tools. It's a very competitive sector. I think simply, that is -- Tools Group, they launched a couple of great products last year. Tools Group stacked up with those products. There's a little bit less -- the demand was kind of -- they're adjusting for the demand.","So, basically, they didn't have new product this quarter. Therefore, they ordered less out of the tools -- out of the C&I group. It wasn't really indicative or directly associated with the sales of them to the van or the van to the end-user. So, basically, it was adjustment of new products. As they roll out new products, that's going to change.","Liam Burke","Okay. And Aldo, cash flow was very strong for the quarter. Does this change any of your allocation view? I mean, obviously, acquisitions, as I come along make sense, but how do you look at balancing the rest of the cash allocation?","Aldo Pagliari","Liam, it was a good quarter for cash flow and I think our fundamental mission of supporting organic growth and looking selectively at M&A remains at the top of that choice. But looking at dividends and share repurchase opportunistically remains on the radar screen and the more cash, obviously, the more opportunities to do things like that.","Liam Burke","Great. Thanks Nick, thanks Aldo.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Thanks Liam.","Operator","And we'll hear next from Gary Prestopino of Barrington Research.","Gary Prestopino","Hey good morning everyone.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Gary.","Gary Prestopino","Hey, Nick, a couple of quarters here you've talked about just the software part of your business getting a lot of traction. I guess what I'd like to know is -- has something changed on a secular basis in terms of the needs for the software. Or is this just something that Snap-On is starting to emphasize more and rolling out new products in conjunction with the software, the ability that you have on the software side?","Nicholas Pinchuk","I don't think there's any -- I don't think with regard to the market, there's a singularity. There is a nice tailwind, as I said many times, having technicians -- more and more technicians to require more and more diagnostics to be able to do repair effectively. You've heard me say 40% of them have diagnostics now. They're moving where they're all going to need them. And the cars are getting even more complicated so that those diagnostics have to be even more sophisticated. And I guess if there's anything -- any change here, it's the fact that we discovered the power of big data and we are deploying it.","So, we've had SureTrack, the idea of the $1 billion records of real repair fixes and now we have the $100 billion snapshots of associated with the smart data. And so those things in the ZEUS, first in the ZEUS and now and what we're rolling out today, the Apollo, really worked pretty well, I think, and have made our diagnostics even more ascendant, and that's worked pretty well.","And the other thing is as you look at our focus on the three-year data pack associated with ZEUS, that's an intent to try to have our franchisees spend more time selling software. That's what they're doing.","Gary Prestopino","So, when you sell ZEUS or one of your truck guys sells ZEUS, is that software sale recorded in tools or is that recorded in RS&I?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Look, it's recorded in tools, but remember that the three-year package is sold by the franchisees and then we record it on an amortized basis over the 36 months. So, we don't get it as an immediate pop. It's kind of different for us. So, we [Indiscernible] the revenue back. Right.","Gary Prestopino","Right. Okay. Could you -- I know somebody mentioned -- asked the question about bracketing, but could you maybe just give us an idea of just as a percentage of all your sales, where this -- where your total software sales are now?","Nicholas Pinchuk","You can think of it this way. Software sales are about one-third of the RS&I business. I think that's a good dimension for it. And most of the software flows through RS&I and some of it to other divisions, other segments.","Gary Prestopino","Okay. Thanks. Thank you.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Sure.","Operator","And we'll hear next from Scott Stember of C.L. King.","Scott Stember","Good morning guys.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Good morning.","Scott Stember","Nick, just talking about the Tool Group. I know you don't want to pin a time when you would see things turning around or turning back to positive, but taking a look, I mean obviously the comparisons beginning in the second quarter start to get a lot easier. And with some of the new products out and with the Tools doing better, maybe just talk how you feel about that as you head into the back half of the year when you're going up against easier comparisons?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Well, I never like to talk about comparisons. I always like to look at the quarter itself, that's more or less -- we look at the absolute value and profitability created by the thing, not necessarily compared on a year-over-year basis, that's more for this kind of -- we certainly like to improve. We hold ourselves to a standard to improve, but really, we focus on the creating of value, more value each time.","I don't know, look, obviously, arithmetically, weaker comparisons make it likely that you're going to see growth. I mean that's certainly true. I feel confident that the Tools Group, like I said, has the products and the team and the market to go forward. I don't know about the time constant. That's all. There are a lot of variables in this kind of thing. And so I think, as myself, I think I feel increasingly better about the situation, but I don't know when all these advancements are going to take -- get traction.","Scott Stember","Got it. But from a longer term picture, just to reemphasize that you still believe that this is a 4% to 6% grower this segment over the long haul.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Absolutely.","Scott Stember","Got it. And then just turning back over to the intercompany impact from tools on C&I. Can you maybe frame out how much that took out of the C&I's growth, organic growth maybe just try to give us the true organic number is for the -- just for the true C&I end markets.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Well, you can kind of see that in the intercompany sales I think in C&I. But look, I think I don't want to get down into that kind of detail out in this call. Look, all I can say is the reduction of sales to power tools group had an impact on the overall C&I Group that might've been a couple of basis points or something like that, a couple of hundred basis points, right? Sorry.","Scott Stember","Got it. And just last question on tariffs, obviously, you guys used a lot of steel in the like maybe just talk about where your steel comes from and maybe...","Nicholas Pinchuk","Comes from the U.S.","Scott Stember","From the U.S., okay. And maybe just talk about what -- in the event that there are broad steel increases across the Board, what the game plan would be?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Yes, look I think we source our steel from the U.S. We don't -- we source maybe what, $80 million worth of steel, it's mostly from the U.S. It's all from the U.S. Generally, U.S. prices have risen in the last, what, couple of years, 30% I think end-to-end in anticipation of some kind of action around this.","So, I don't know what the tariffs will have -- what effect that tariffs will have in the long-term, may be no effect on U.S. steel, may be some slight effect. But we generally think we can price for visible inflation and I think we've demonstrated that over time.","The other facts of any kind of over tariffs and so on, generally, we're making the markets, in which we sell in terms of finished goods, sometimes we're importing components, but if those components get tariffs on them, we'll just source someplace else.","Scott Stember","Got it. That's all I have. Thanks for taking my questions.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Sure.","Operator","And our last question comes from Bret Jordan of Jefferies.","Bret Jordan","Hey, good morning guys.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Good morning.","Bret Jordan","Hey, could you talk about the market in general sort of from a competitive landscape? I guess looking at your sales growth versus underlying market may be market share trends, are you seeing either increased competition at the service level for Mack [ph] or Matco? Or the import diagnostic guys like Launch or Autel pushing harder? Or is it just the market itself relatively sluggish?","Nicholas Pinchuk","I have pondered this question for some time. We grew substantially, I guess, 2010 to 2011, same-store sales. The market itself grew pretty well. So, we don't necessarily focus on in market share or anything like that. And -- but recently, you look at some of the other people announcing good results, well, we have had not where we would like.","But when I asked the franchisees, Bret, they say I'm not feeling pressure. So, what's ever happening in our space is not being induced by other people. Their view is, if I'm not selling, it's not because I'm being aced out by somebody else's product.","Now, I suppose there's exceptions to that, of course. Somebody could have a better power tool or a better compressor or something like that or for a particular application, maybe. But in general, we don't hear that and I just talked to -- like I said, within the last week, I've talked to more than a dozen guys and I ask them that question and they all said things like that. Now, the competition are smart guys and I'm sure they are prospering, but our franchisees are not talking about or asking about it.","Bret Jordan","Okay, great. And then a housekeeping, what's the price point on Apollo? And Aldo, if you can break at the inventor again, what was 606, what was acquisitions, and what was core inventory year-over-year?","Aldo Pagliari","Well, sure. With respect to the inventory, you had a $20.9 million adjustment just related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard 606. And if you look at the effects of currency in the quarter that was $9.5 million and a nominal effect that was less than $1 million related to acquisitions. So, that would leave you with an operating variance or growth in inventory of about $9.5 million.","Bret Jordan","Okay. And what's the price point on Apollo?","Nicholas Pinchuk","No, I tell you what, I really meant it when I said we're rolling it out as we speak. So, I don't necessarily -- I'm afraid of giving stealing the thunder of my guys, but I will tell you this is its predecessor was list priced about $4,500. Of course, the street price has some lower number from that and this will be a premium over that.","Bret Jordan","So, this sells against MODIS or--?","Nicholas Pinchuk","No, SOLUS.","Bret Jordan","SOLUS, okay. Thank you.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Sure.","Bret Jordan","Great. Thanks guys.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Thank you.","Operator","And with no other questions, I will now turn the conference back to Leslie Kratcoski for any additional or closing remarks.","Leslie Kratcoski","Thanks, again, everyone for joining us today. A replay will be available shortly on snapon.com. And as always, we thank you for your interest in the company. Good day.","Operator","Again, that does include a call. We would like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"19573":["Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA) Q4 2014 Earnings Call February  5, 2015 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Leslie H.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski. Please go ahead.","Leslie H. Kratcoski","Thanks, Hannah, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's fourth quarter and full year financial results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer.","Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.","As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on our website next to the audio icon for this call. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript.","Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs, or otherwise statements on management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.","With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. I'll start with the highlights of our fourth quarter and our year. I'll give you my perspective on the results, on the markets and on the progress we've made. Then, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.","The results of our fourth quarter were encouraging with sales increases and profit gains across our businesses, continuing our positive trend. We had opportunities, and we had headwinds. We took advantage of those opportunities, and we overcame the headwinds. The result was organic sales growth of 9.8%. If we include a $5.7 million contribution from Pro-Cut and $21.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, overall sales in the quarter were $857.4 million, a rise of 7.5%. Our EPS was $1.97, up 23.1% from the $1.60 in 2013. And that rise reflects an opco operating margin of 16.9%, an increase of 140 basis points.","Financial service earnings of $42.2 million in the quarter were also up significantly. And the consolidated operating margin, including both Financial Services and opco, reached 20.4%, an improvement of 190 basis points compared to the 18.5% of last year.","Looking at our markets. The automotive repair-related segments continue to be favorable, driven of course by expanding and aging car parts and year-after-year technology changes, all driving demand for our product. The Tools Group and the Repair Systems & and Information, or the RS&I, Group took advantage with volume growth by our van network and gains in OEM dealerships in independent repair shops confirming the progress.","But we also had opportunities rooted in our expanding capabilities and product lineup for the critical industries and in growing physical strength in emerging markets, areas within the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, arenas that were challenged by a variety of headwinds, fluctuating currencies and macroeconomic turbulence in places like Eastern Europe, Japan, Indonesia and even the core of Western Europe. Despite those challenges, C&I results were quite positive. Higher volumes and favorable trends continued in our Industrial division, progress across a range of critical industries. And in a range of specific operations, the quarter was a period of clear progress, adding to our growing strength in that region.","Another feature of the quarter is that military activity was stronger. I think if you've been listening to these calls, all of you know that the critical -- that critical segment has been quite turbulent. In fact, the way forward is still unclear. A significant level of budget uncertainty does remain, and it's difficult to predict the military environment for any extended period. However, in the last quarter, we did make the most of the available opportunities and registered considerable military growth. It added to C&I's positive trend.","So to wrap up the broad discussion of the markets, I'd summarize the situation as generally positive across our businesses. And know, we'll always have headwinds. We do believe that no matter what the environment, we have the opportunity and the capability to advance our position. We'll continue to progress against challenges, along our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise channel, expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage, extending to critical industries and building in emerging markets.","That strategic advancement, when coupled with the Snap-on Value Creation Processes of safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, drives a significant and ongoing positive trend or performance. And we believe that the results in the fourth -- first quarter and over the full year show just that.","Speaking of the full year, Snap-on's EPS in 2014 was $7.14, an increase of 20.4% from 2013. Driving those earnings was an opco operating margin of 16.3%, up 120 basis points. When we include the income from Financial Services of $149.1 million, which rose $23.4 million, the consolidated operating margin for the year was -- of 19.6%, was up 150 basis points. That performance came on sales of $3.3 billion, a 7.2% year-over-year increase that reflected primarily in organic growth of 6.9%.","In 2014, full year gains were achieved from every group. In the Tools Group, a strengthened van channel with organic growth of 7.6% for the year. RS&I expanded reach with repair shop owners and managers, up 4.9% organically. And from the C&I Group, growth in critical industries and progress in emerging markets, organic activity rising 9.5%. All clear evidence of forward movement in the markets we serve.","Now let's move to a discussion of the groups and their quarters. In the C&I Group, revenue in the quarter was up 5.3% from 2013 despite unfavorable foreign currency. The organic sales increased 9.9% from broad contributions across the businesses. The Industrial division paced the progress, achieving double-digit gains in multiple critical industries. Encouragingly, SNA Europe posted a solid mid-single-digit rise, offsetting significant European headwinds, while the Asia\/Pacific division recorded higher activity, growing in emerging markets overcoming the present difficulties surrounding Japan.","From an earnings perspective, C&I income of $40.5 million, increased $3.4 million compared to the prior year period and that represents an operating margin of 13.6%, a rise of 50 basis points versus 2013.","C&I performance in the quarter is exemplified by SNA Europe. As I said, sales gains despite difficulties and profits up sharply, again. RCI practiced over all those difficult days, while the sales were falling. That effort's paying off, and we can see it in the SNA Europe numbers.","C&I also advanced in penetrating critical industries. Of particular note, I think, was our gains in power generation, railroads and the oil and gas sectors. And one product line that has gained traction in these areas is our Tools at Height offering, drop prevention systems designed for a variety of industries and used to keep people safe and assets secure. Falling objects is a leading cause of accidents in the workplace. And a 3-pound tool falling from height can make quite an impact. In other words, don't get hit by a falling wrench. It sounds rudimentary, but it's a real workplace issue and a clear opportunity for Snap-on customer connection and innovation to provide unique solutions. By ergonomically tethering our tools, we provide our customers an engineered attachment system, a productive and compliant solution, maintaining the functionalities of tools used at height, but with safety.","Guided by customer connection and solving these critical needs on oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico or in major power plants in the U.S., our Industrial division's Tools at Height drop prevention system are making work safer and more productive for our customers performing critical tasks.","The fourth quarter also grow -- saw a growth in the emerging markets of C&I. China and India led the way for the double-digit growth in our Asia\/Pacific division. And it's clear what's driving the progress. Growing physicals, more distributors, more field training, more Asian-ized products, products like our new GLS2P4 [ph] , the compact lift; or our new flexible -- our flexible new i-Aligner system, both ideal for the smaller footprints in Asian shops. And our expanding lineup of Blue-Point tool sets for the rising Asian vehicle repair market. Each quarter, each quarter, we believe we build more Snap-on Asia\/Pacific strength, are better poised to continue our positive momentum and improve our position for the considerable repair wave, we believe, is coming in that emerging region.","Finally, in C&I. Let me speak a moment about the evolution of our automated tool control system or ATC. You may remember that the ATC, we've spoken on it -- often about it on these calls, is our tool security and inventory management system that uses advanced digital imaging technology and proprietary software to automatically keep track of critical tools.","Well in the fourth quarter, the Industrial division reached a milestone. There are now over 1,000 ATC systems deployed and the number's growing. We started out aiming at aviation -- at the aviation industry. But now through customer connection and innovation, we redesigned the product to accommodate the very tool configurations found in the natural resource and railroad industries. ATC systems are now solving problems for customers in both those segments and the momentum is building. ATC, an effective Snap-on concept, extended to more customers, helping drive C&I growth.","Now on to the Tools Group, where we posted organic sales increase, an organic sales increase of 11.8%. The operating earnings of $63.9 million, representing a margin rate of 16.5%, up 200 basis points from last year. We often mention Snap-on runways for coherent growth, guiding principles or our long-term sales opportunities, and always prominently included is enhancing the franchise channel. Well the results for the Tools Group in the quarter represent clear validation of the progress being made along that runway.","But in addition to the financial performance, there's other evidence that authenticates the achievements. Snap-on continues to be recognized as a franchise of choice. Once again, Snap-on was ranked among the top 25 in Entrepreneur Magazine's list of top-500 franchises. And the Franchise Business Review, which measures franchisee satisfaction, recognized Snap-on as a top-50 franchise in its latest ranking, marking the eighth consecutive year we received that award.","And again, this quarter, like always, I had the opportunity to meet directly with franchisees at the fall meetings of our U.S. and Canadian National Franchise Advisory Council. And again on our recent kick-off meetings across the country, each of the sessions generated valuable insight, great feedback from an enthusiastic group of franchisees.","Based on their optimism, I believe anyone interacting with these professionals would conclude our band network as stronger than ever before.","The Tools Group success can also be traced to customer connection and innovation, essential parts of that Snap-on Value Creation. This is the Tools Group's fifth consecutive year for success -- of growth for successful product ideas derived from collaboration efforts with our franchisees, from discussions with technicians or from the independent observations of our associates.","An example of that customer connection and innovation is our newly introduced steering rack socket. The accepted technique for replacing of power steering o-rings required removal of the entire power steering rack assembly, followed by the use of a screwdriver and a hammer to change the o-ring. The new Snap-on socket allows the tech to replace the o-ring while the power steering assembly remains in place. It can save a full hour of labor. And it's a winning timesaver, and I can tell you on the van, it's an attention grabber. The steering rack socket is a clear example of Snap-on Value Creation, customer connection and innovation, moving us down our runways for improvement, providing the means for an ongoing trajectory of positive performance. And the fourth quarter results for the Tools Group, our testimony that it's working.","Sales in the fourth quarter were -- moving to RS&I. Moving to RS&I. Sales in the fourth quarter were $282.8 million, organic gains of 6.9%, primarily reflecting stronger software sales in independent dealerships and essential tool activity with OEM dealerships. If you add $5.7 million from our profile acquisition and $5.5 million of unfavorable foreign exchange, overall reported sales were also up 6.9% in the quarter. Operating earnings of $65.2 million rose $4.4 million, with OI margin improving 10 basis points to 23.1% as the benefits of RCI offset variation in the group's business mix.","In the fourth quarter, RCI (sic) [RS&I] sales to vehicle OEMs grew strongly, driven by several essential diagnostic programs, tools for vehicle dealerships. So we grew with OEMs and we grew with independent shops. For the independent shops, Mitchell 1 also registered growth in the quarter, assisted by several multi-site placements of its ProDemand automotive and information product.","Mitchell 1 is advancing ProDemand with continuing integration of repair shop information, enhanced navigation and improved mobility. Strengthening the product line and driving volume gains, ProDemand is becoming essential for effective repairs.","In the quarter, RCI also -- RS&I also continued the introduction of its newest handheld diagnostic unit, the SOLUS Edge. With an updated processor and easier viewing features, our new SOLUS Edge offers a 50% increase in speed as well as a 15% larger screen size. And as you might expect, it's shaping up to be one of the most successful diagnostic rollouts. Along with our advancements to our handheld hardware, we also continue to enhance our software offering; fewer navigations steps, better user experience, Snap-on diagnostics, simply helping the technicians to fix cars easier and faster.","For heavy trucks, our PRO-LINK Ultra, the diagnostic tool continues to enable top-notch service from light diesel to Class A heavy duty trucks. The PRO-LINK delivers the broadest coverage ever available in a single handheld diagnostic tool, including data for major systems like engines and transmissions and ABS brakes and instrument clusters and emissions and body control. It's the ideal tool for heavy duty fleets and dealerships, owner-operator repair shops, municipality and mobile truck services. And as you would expect with those features, sales have been exceptional.","Also in the period for RS&I, the equipment division performed quite well. High single-digit organic sales increases bolstered by an improved North American marketplace, gains in Western Europe and innovative new products. Once again, Snap-on Value Creation was on display in the form of the new Snap-on Motorized Wheel Balancer, ideal for shops of all sizes. The new balancer comes equipped with a sonar sensor that eliminates manual measurements of rim width, enabling faster balancing. It also features multiple placement mode, allowing users to flexibly match weight location to a variety of vehicle rims that are so much variety, common today in the car market. And it utilizes Snap-On's Virtual Plane Imaging technology, providing unsurpassed accuracy to ensure an effective balance and a satisfied customer. The new Snap-on authorized balancer: speed, flexibility and accuracy. It's received quite positive reviews, and we anticipate strong sales as the rollout continues. We're very excited about this product.","In fact, we're excited about the entire breadth of the RS&I offering. And in November, RS&I presented its full product portfolio at the annual SEAMS show in Las Vegas. The group's equipment business, including Challenger Lifts and Pro-Cut brake lathes, new acquisitions, were featured along with our diagnostics; Mitchell 1, business solutions and equipment solutions product offering, all on display in one booth under the banner \"Snap-on Total Solution.\" Customer reaction was enthusiastic, and our sales for the event were strong.","We believe the RS&I group, with state-of-the-art undercar equipment, a strong product line of repair information solutions and award-winning diagnostics products, is capturing an increased presence with shop owners and managers, and the results confirm it. Well, that's our fourth quarter. Opco organic sales rising 9.8%, EPS of $1.97 in the quarter, 23.1% higher than last year, progress registered along all our runways for coherent growth and advancements down each of our runways for improvement, but especially in customer connection and innovation and certainly rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, all of that helping to drive a 16.9% operating margin, up 140 basis points. It clearly was an encouraging quarter.","Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo.","Aldo J. Pagliari","Thanks, Nick. Our fourth quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $857.4 million in the quarter increased $59.9 million or 7.5% from 2013 levels, reflecting broad-based gains across all of our operating segments. Organically, sales increased 9.8%, excluding $5.7 million of acquisition-related sales and $21.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Consolidated gross profit of $411.3 million, increased $32.8 million from 2013 levels. The gross profit margin of 48% in the quarter improved 50 basis points, primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives and benefits from higher sales, partially offset by increased restructuring and other costs.","Operating expenses of $266.1 million increased $11.2 million, primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 31.1% improved 90 basis points, mostly due to sales volume leverage. We incurred $1.1 million of restructuring costs in the quarter. There were no restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of last year.","As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $145.2 million in the quarter increased $21.6 million or 17.5% compared to the prior year; and as a percentage of sales, improved 140 basis points to 16.9%. Operating earnings from Financial Services of $42.2 million on revenue of $59.4 million in the quarter compared to operating earnings of $33 million on revenue of $47.4 million last year. The year-over-year increases in both operating earnings and revenue, primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio as well as revenue and earnings from an additional week of operations in 2014.","As you may know, Snap-on operates on a fiscal calendar, which results in an additional week to our fiscal full year and fourth quarter every 6 years. As a result, our 2014 fiscal year contained 53 weeks of operating results, with the extra week relative to the prior year occurring in the fourth quarter. While the impact of this additional week was not material to Snap-on's consolidated fourth quarter net sales or net earnings, our Financial Services segment did earn an additional week of interest income on its financing portfolio. At the consolidated level, the net earnings benefit from the additional week of Financial Services' interest income was largely offset by a corresponding additional week of fixed expenses, primarily personnel-related costs and interest expense.","Consolidated operating earnings of $187.4 million in the quarter increased $30.8 million or 19.7%. And the operating margin of 20.4% improved 190 basis points from 18.5% a year ago. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate was 32.1% in both the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013.","Finally, net earnings in the quarter of $116.2 million or $1.97 per diluted share increased $21.7 million or $0.37 per share from 2013 levels, representing a 23.1% increase in diluted earnings per share. For the full year 2014, net earnings of $421.9 million or $7.14 per diluted share increased $71.6 million or $1.21 per share from 2013 levels, representing a 20.4% increase in diluted earnings per share.","Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the commercial and industrial, or C&I Group, on Slide 7. Sales of $298.2 million in the quarter were up 9.9% organically, primarily reflecting double-digit gains in sales to customers in critical industries and in our Asia\/Pacific operations as well as mid-single-digit sales increase in our European-based hand tools business. Gross profit in the C&I group totaled $113.4 million in the quarter. Gross margin of 38% decreased 90 basis points from 2013 levels, primarily due to a shift in sales activity that included higher volume sales to the military and increased sales in our Asia\/Pacific operations as well as higher restructuring costs, partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives.","Operating expenses of $72.9 million in the quarter, decreased $0.3 million from 2013 levels. The operating expense margin of 24.4% improved 140 basis points, primarily due to the sales volume leverage including benefits from the sales shift just mentioned.","As a result of these factors, fourth quarter operating earnings for the C&I segment of $40.5 million increased $3.4 million or 9.2% from 2013 levels. And the operating margin of 13.6% improved 50 basis points from 13.1% last year.","Turning now to Slide 8. Fourth quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $387.5 million increased 11.8% organically, reflecting a double-digit increase in the United States and a high single-digit gain internationally. Gross profit of $166.4 million increased $20.2 million from 2013 levels. And the gross margin of 42.9% increased 130 basis points, primarily due to the benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $102.5 million in the quarter increased $7.3 million from 2013 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 26.4% improved 70 basis points, principally due to sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, operating earnings of $63.9 million for the Snap-on Tools Group increased $12.9 million or 25.3%. And the operating margin of 16.5% improved 200 basis points from 14.5% last year.","Turning to the Repair Systems and Information, or RS&I Group, shown on Slide 9. Sales of $282.8 million increased 6.9% from 2013 levels. Excluding $5.7 million of acquisition-related sales and $5.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales were also up 6.9%, reflecting high single-digit gains in both sales of undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships as well as a mid-single-digit increase in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. Gross profit of $131.5 million in the quarter increased $9.5 million from 2013 levels. Gross margin of 46.5% increased 40 basis points, as savings from RCI and other cost reduction initiatives were partially offset by a shift in sales that included higher volumes of lower gross margin products including increased essential tool and facilitation sales to OEM dealerships. The RS&I Group also incurred higher restructuring costs in the quarter.","Operating expenses totaled $66.3 million in the quarter. And the operating expense margin of 23.4% increased 30 basis points, primarily reflecting operating expenses for the Pro-Cut acquisition. Fourth quarter operating earnings of $65.2 million for the RS&I Group increased $4.4 million or 7.2% from prior year levels. And the operating margin of 23.1% increased 10 basis points from 23% last year.","Now turning to Slide 10. In the fourth quarter, earnings from Financial Services of $42.2 million and revenues of $59.4 million, including contributions from the additional week of operations in fiscal 2014, compared with operating earnings of $33 million on revenue of $47.4 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.6% compared with 17.4% last year. And the average yield on contract receivables was 6 -- I'm sorry, it's 9.5% in both periods. Originations of $232.2 million in the quarter increased 17.5% from 2013 levels.","Moving to Slide 11. Our year-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.4 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.2 billion from our U.S. Snap-on credit operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. In 2014, our worldwide finance -- Financial Services portfolio grew $152.2 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continued to be in line with our expectations.","Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $97.2 million in the quarter decreased $25.3 million from comparable 2013 levels as higher net earnings in 2014 were more than offset by net increases in operating assets and liabilities, including the timing of estimated tax and other payments, and $10 million of higher discretionary pension plan contributions. Net cash used by investing activities of $46 million included $30.7 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $17.3 million in the quarter compared with $19.9 million last year. Full year capital expenditures totaled $80.6 million.","Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 61 days compared with 62 days at 2013 year-end. Inventories increased $41.1 million from 2013 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions and from the addition of inventories related to Pro-Cut. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.7 compared with 3.8 turns at 2013 year-end. Our year-end cash position of $132.9 million decreased $84.7 million from 2013 year-end levels, largely due to the March 2014 repayment of $100 million of debt at maturity. The net decrease in cash also reflects year-to-date impacts of funding $746.2 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $107.6 million, $80.6 million for capital expenditures, the repurchase of 680,000 shares for $79.3 million and the acquisition of Pro-Cut for $41.3 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by $591.4 million of cash from collections of finance receivables and $397.9 million of cash from operations. Our net debt-to-capital ratio was 26.3% at both 2014 and 2013 year ends.","In addition to our $132.9 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities. And our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. At 2014 year-end, we had $37 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.","This concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2015. We anticipate that capital expenditures in 2015 will be in the range of $80 million to $90 million. We also expect that our full year 2015 effective income tax rate will be at or below our full year 2014 rate of 32.1%.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Thanks, Aldo. We believe our fourth quarter and full year results are clear evidence of the abundant opportunities that lie along our strategic runways for growth and of our continuing progress of taking advantage of those possibilities and in achieving amidst challenge and turbulence. The vehicle repair market is both favorable economically and familiar operationally, and we are advancing in that arena. The van channel is being enhanced. The Tools Group is continuing to rise, sales up 11.8%, operating margin increased by 200 basis points. And we believe the franchise -- that franchisee confidence and capability are stronger than ever.","We're expanding repair shop owners and managers, profitable growth in dealerships and independent shops, Pro-Cut and Challenger integrated smoothly giving us more to sell, an OI margin of 23.1% and volume growth of 6.9%. We're reaching into new areas for new customers, growing coherently. The extension to critical industry is working. Double-digit growth with those customers in the quarter, 4 straight quarters of robust increases. And we're building firm physical capabilities in emerging markets. Activity in China and in India, up nicely in the quarter. Put that progress together with our with commitment to Snap-on Value Creation, and you will see encouraging results. You see organic sales increases of 9.8% and a margin gain of 140 basis points to 16.9%. In fact, you see our fourth quarter. And as we move forward, we know there are headwinds. We know there are more challenges. But we also believe that our team has unique opportunity rooted in growth and improvement, and has the intent and the capability to continue our positive trend of strategic and financial progress, ensuring that we will exit 2015 stronger than when we entered.","Before I turn the call over to the operator, it's appropriate that I recognize our franchisees and associates, an extraordinary group. Once again, I know many of you are listening. Please know that this encouraging quarter is the result of your effort, for your contributions to our performance, for your support of our team and for your commitment to our future. You have my congratulations, and you have my thanks.","Now I'll turn the call over to Hannah for questions. Hannah?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Liam Burke with Wunderlich Securities.","Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Nick, can you give us a little color on how much incremental growth you got from company-supplied vans, like the Rock 'N Roll van, to help supplement the van franchisee effort?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well -- yes, sure. Look, the Rock 'N Roll vans, as you know, are sort of like a time shared event, which add retail space on a time-sharing basis. Each of the -- each technician, they go around and they visit various technicians for 2 to 3 days. We've grown them from, I think, 18 in the first quarter of 2012, up to around 59 in North America last year. They're not growing anymore. But suffice it to say, that big-ticket items, which tool storage is one of them, was up ahead, greater than the overall Tools Group of 11.8% in the quarter. So they pace the -- they were among the pacing elements -- big-ticket items were among the pacing elements for our growth in the Tools Group. And it's clear that the -- that those 59 in North America, and I think it's 64 international -- in total because we have some in the U.K. now and Australia, have helped drive the way. And of course, that's together with our TechKnow vans, which have increased the same way. The TechKnow vans are now up, I think, to 31, which it started at 14. So those are both helping grow this business. And it has moved faster than at 11.8%.","Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And on new product introductions or innovation, did you have a good year in terms of hit products and were they divided equally between industrial and automotive?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I would say we had a good year, yes. I'm pretty positive about the year. We had some really fine new products and the numbers were the like last year. Compared to just, what, 2006, they're several times, as I said many times, that number. And I would say that they are divided, kind of, not quite equally. I'd say the Tools Group gets a little more of those because we have more people really in the workplaces for the automotive repair business, and therefore, those ideas are rolling back with greater frequency. But we are getting a good representation from the industrial business, from the critical industries. And you know, I can offer to you that we've advanced our critical industries, not hit products, but we're expanding that business. For example, we added in the year, 996 new aviation products. We added over 600 oil and gas products, military products over 800, power generation. So we're adding products. They are not all the hit products. I'm not saying that, but we added new products to create excitement in that business. The hit products are those that sell over 1 million and create the excitement. We're getting those in industrial. We're still today getting more out of the vehicle repair side of the business. Still, a very good year for that, I'm very pleased. And in fact, when you look at these numbers, it's hard for you to appreciate it, but I believe very strongly that it's generated by the enthusiasm and the attention-getting that these great new products get when people in the vans or when our salesmen call on customers and say, \"Wow, that's a new product. I'd like to get it,\" and they add other products to it.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Leiker with Baird.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to start on the organic growth in the Snap-on Tools Group. You were running 6% or so, the last -- the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year. You jumped up to approaching 12% here in Q4, almost double the growth rate. Anything in particular that's behind that? And any sense on how sustainable that kind of a growth rate is going forward?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes, I know -- I don't know. I think -- we have been -- you and I have talked about this many times. I mean, the Tools Group numbers, like you say, 11.8%, 6.0%, 6.6%, 6.0%, 10.2%, 9.5%. In fact, the Tools Group now -- the Tools Group has now grown greater -- 5% or greater in, I think, the number 18 of the last 19 quarters. So they've shown some fairly strong performance. And all I can say about it, in general, David -- what I can say first, in general, is that what's happening here is the effect -- the continually increasing effect of understanding how to help the franchisees be more effective, which authored things like the vans, the Rock 'N Roll cab and the TechKnow van. And we're just getting better at bringing out new products and finding those sweet spots in the -- for the customer needs that excite the customers and get that stuff moving off the van. That's what's happening here. Our ability to make the franchisees more productive and effective and the experience that's building in our team to be able to wield this model, which has always been, I've said, the model that fell from Saturn, more effectively. One of the world's great models, those guys in the Tools Group are probably wielding it better than ever before. In this quarter, I think you might say, we had a particularly great customer connection and innovation season, like Liam just add, that's one. And two, we had things like power tools and some great power tool products that came up. I was in a shop the other day, and in fact, Monday -- Tuesday -- sorry, Tuesday, I was in a shop and the technician said, \"Boy, I got this new CT8850, you know, my cordless impact. I used to use these pneumatics. I used to be proud of my pneumatic. Now I've turned my compressor off because this thing is so powerful, I won't let it out of my hand.\" So that was a terrific endorsement of that. He really had gone completely to that new product, and that has driven some of our sales. So you see that. The other thing about the fourth quarter is, we had a particularly great SFC, great SFC. And the tool -- again, this is the experience of the Tools Group guys that are very positive about this. They're very effective in doing this. This is one of the things that I feel about this business, if I can just say this. I think we are on a trend of continual operating improvement. I know there's a lot of discussion about currency. In fact, you can see the numbers there on -- you can see it in our numbers. In the fourth quarter, we got about $20 million worth of translation hit and when you see the K, you'll see a couple of million dollars of profitability hit associated with it. And you never know what the eventual numbers will be because you got a lot of variation in terms of what happens in the marketplace. But we're exposed in places like -- our big exposures are places like the euro, 9% of our sales in the euro and 8% in the pound and then another 5% in the Canada and so on. And we have some drips and drabs around Australia and Japan. But when you -- and the actual number depends on where those -- what activities are each of those markets. So translation and transaction depends on the cocktail of that. But one thing we know is that as we move forward, the rates from the end of the year are moving up more unfavorable. So we'll see headwinds from currency, but we are confident. We know that our operating position will keep improving despite the arithmetic associated with the currency. So things like the Tools Group, the extension of critical industries, 4 straight quarters of high single digits or double digits, those will continue to grow. And we'll exit, as I said in my comments, better in 2015 than when we entered.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then just a follow-up on that. If we look at these activities that you're doing with your dealers to improve their productivity, finding ways to push more through the channel, inherently that's somewhat of a barrier. You are creating more and more of a barrier of entry. How is your competition competing with your franchisees changing their business? Are they trying to figure it out? Are they copying what you're doing? What's happening down in the trenches there?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, we have some great guys in the competition. We have some great companies, Stanley and Danaher behind Matco and so on. But at the garage level in the vans, from each of our positions, we see that our franchisees don't often mention the competitors. They reference themselves versus where we have been or where we are going. I just did a van ride, like I said, on Tuesday. And my van driver never mentioned the competitors. He only mentioned how we could get better or how satisfied he was with certain of our new products. So I see this. And I see it across our product line. Our people are confident of our hand tools. Our people are confident of our tool storage because they are beautiful pieces. Our people are confident about our diagnostics and our software because they provide a better insight to repairing the car than ever before. And you know what's happening in the marketplace now, it used to be garages wanted diagnostics. Well with the extension of all the computers on cars, every technician needs to have a diagnostics to repair these days. And so you can see this kind of confidence in our franchisees. And yes, they say, \"Well, I'd rather have this or I need something else.\" But it's always with reference to themselves, it's not much compared to their -- it's not really compared to their competition as much. I hardly ever hear about that. That's not to say, they're not capable and capable people and aggressive people, but when I go out, I hear mostly about ourselves.","Operator","Our last question is from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","You and your organization have built a tremendous compound earnings growth story here, and it's-- it really shows. So congrats on all the progress. I wanted to ask just a couple of questions that are just kind of following up on the earlier questions. And I start with the Tools Group. And you made the observation that you aren't adding any more vans, I guess, on the Rock \u2018N Roll Cab Express. Just looking at the 17.5% origination growth in the finance portfolio suggests that the storage is still a big part of the Tools growth story and the margin, 200 basis points, probably is driven in part by that as well. How do you keep the growth going if you've stopped opening new stores in this enterprise? And maybe talk to that, for starters.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well let me say a couple of things. First, just thanks for your compliments about compound earnings growth. But actually, I don't think it's that surprising. This is a great business. It's a great business that has a lot of opportunity and runway further. So we are not so surprised by such things because it is a business that has so much untapped opportunity for both growth and improvement. Let me come back to the idea of keeping it growing. Yes, it is a challenge. But you know that we've grown -- the Tools Group has grown 11.8%, 6%, 6.6%, 6.0%, 10.2%, 9.5% in the subsequent quarters, same-store sales. And then the other thing is, we're getting better at bringing out new products. We just launched another tool storage unit at the kickoffs, David. And you know what it is? It's a tool storage. It's these tool storage, big boxes, you can envision them, and they're gleaming in different colors. They've got great features. You can plug in your power tools and all this stuff, and now we equip them with a downtown sound bar. Now I don't know if you've ever been in a garage, but a sound bar in a tool storage box sounds like a cool thing to me. Everybody who sees them and hears them is going crazy. So new product is a great -- are a great advantage, so that helps it, too. And then the other thing is, we just have to keep thinking of new ways. The Rock 'N Roll Cab was an innovation by the -- brilliant innovation by the Tools Group guys to figure out that they could help the van -- virtually expand the space of the van, which is one of the limitations. They just have to keep coming up with ideas. That doesn't mean that the Rock 'N Roll Cabs won't contribute more. I mean, they've been pretty stable for a fairly long time. I want to say that the vans have been, like, year-over-year -- if you wanted to look at last year at this time, North America had 56 vans, now we have 59. So they only moved up 3 and still it grew at 11.8% in total. And tool storage and big ticket was above that. So they figured out some way to do it without too much increase in sales. Having said that, they also -- we'll be tasking them to come up with new ideas to try to help this situation. The final point is that when you look at the originations versus the Tools Group, it's a little more complex. You have the question of originations and it does -- it is driven by big-ticket items, but it's also a little bit driven by the variation between our sales and the franchisees' sales, of course. The originations track a sale to a technician; our sales track a sale from us to the franchisee. So there's a little bit of timing difference, and it can muddy the water a little bit.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","That's good detail. I guess, the second question I had was, again, following up on a previous question on competition, and you talked about with respect to Stanley and Matco and the others. I wonder if you could just talk about how much competition you're feeling and maybe particularly within the diagnostics business. But how much competition you're feeling from the automotive retailers? And I guess the question really is, as the category...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","What do you mean? What do you mean automotive retailers? Can you define it for me?","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, the AutoZone, Pep Boys, O'Reilly, those guys. I guess my question really is, as that diagnostics category evolves and the technologies that represent, kind of, the foundation of that category become less expensive, how do you respond to protect your great business from price competition, increasing availability? I mean, is it innovation? Is it warranties? Is it credit? Is it support and service? How do you go about...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I'll tell you what, I tell you what, all of the above, I think. Remember first -- I think, first, that we start with a great product enabled by an extraordinary base of information with, I think, better insight on repair than anybody else. We have a product that will tell you, okay, if you have a make and model and powertrain of a car, and it's a certain model, what the typical repair is on that model based on big data. It's the only one available. And we have an understanding. A lot of the competition comes at the lower end with code readers and so on, a little bit less sophisticated. Technicians are looking for more levels of sophistication. They want to read what the car says. They want to be able to put the car through functional tests, through its paces. They want to be able to reprogram it. They want to be able to see what the OEM says as a standard fix. And then they want the whisper tips and the tips that come out of the big data. We have all of that. Almost no one else does. So our product keeps evolving and getting stronger in that regard. And if anything, the requirements for this gets bigger because it used to be -- the computer content on cars are getting more and more. This is one of the reasons why nobody can repair cars anymore because they're so complicated. And even in garages, you need -- what used to be a situation where you needed one big unit to handle everybody and you could pass it around, well, you can't be working on a car today, in many cases, without these things. So every technician wants one. And so you have that. And then finally, finally, we have our franchisee armed with the TechKnow vans, up close and personal with the technician to help him through the product, tell him what he needs to know, how to use it, and find out what his particular problems are. We have customer connection and customer delivery like no one else has. And so that's why we don't feel so much heat from those other guys. We think this is a robust market that's going to keep growing. We think it's only going to get more demand in this area. And we think we have significant advantages in data, in hardware and in software. And our software business -- our hardware business was strong. We just had a great launch. And our software business was up more than the hardware business in the quarter.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

As usual, well, I'll start the call by covering the highlights of our quarter, and along the way I'll give you my perspective on our results, on our markets, on the progress we've made, and what we believe it all means. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.","Once again the results for the quarter in the comparative periods include a number of special nonrecurring legal tax and debt events that affected our as-reported levels. So to provide greater clarity, we'll refer to amounts excluding the one-time effects as an as-adjusted number to make everything comparable. And when you look through all of it we believe it's clear that Snap-on did make recognizable progress, demonstrating again our ability to continue a trajectory of positive results, recovering in some important areas, while overcoming some significant challenges. We're encouraged by the quarter.","The Tools Group U.S. van network, which has been the center of some considerable attention continue its improvement growing mid single digits on fairly broad improvement. Our side saw some rise in its business serving the vehicle OEMs that had been down for several quarters. And the corporation's efforts around Snap-on value creations are runways for improvement fought off the challenges of unfavorable currency and uncertain environments in some of our geographies to maintain and expand our profit margins.","Now to the results, first quarter as reported sales were $921.7 million, down 1.5% including a $26.1 million or 290 basis point impact from unfavorable currency. Organic sales were up 1.4%, gains in the U.S. van channel and critical industries tempered by the turbulence. From an earnings perspective our OpCo operating income for the quarter, including the one-time benefit from a recent legal settlement and an offsetting impact of unfavorable currency, was $187.4 million, increasing 5.5% compared to last year. OI margin for the quarter was 20.3%, rising 130 basis points. On an as adjusted basis, excluding the nonrecurring items, the OI margin was 19.1% up 10 basis points.","For Financial Services, operating income of $62.1 million was up compared to last year's $56.9 million. And the as reported OI margin including both financial services of OpCo was 24.8%, up 180 basis points. The as adjusted OI margin was 23.6% compared to the as adjusted 23% last year. And EPS on an as reported basis was $3.16, $0.34 or 12.1% above last year. The as adjusted EPS was $3.01, exceeding the comparable $2.79 from last year by $0.22, an apples-to-apples increase of 7.9%.","Now, let's look at our markets. We believe the auto repair market remains a great place to be despite the variations. The ageing of the car part, the changing repair tasks as new vehicles introduce, the increasing vehicle complexity are solid underlying drivers that we continue to see across the segment. Now, we do see headwinds arise from time to time associated with macro difficulties in certain geographies like the U.K., and in certain sectors like the OEM dealerships when the new car industry sees turbulence. We are however convinced that the outlook is positive, and we keep investing, investing in product, in hardware and software and data and processes, all to further our advantages. You can see some of that confidence coming to fruition with the recovery in the U.S. van channel driven by great new products. And with the turn in the OEM business in RS&I we believe the auto repair industry is a great place to be, and we're confident regarding our current position and our future.","In other opportunities, the market we've termed the critical industries, sectors like natural resources, the military, and aviation. We see our business growing stronger in that arena with new products and new customers. We also see period-to-period challenges, but overall we believe we're becoming more effective in those large vertical markets with stronger products like automatic tool control, sophisticated torque system, and task-targeted hand tools. And we're winning a growing array of committed customers. So, overall, I'd describe our markets as continuing to offer attractive opportunity.","We've also enabled our Snap-on value creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection [ph], innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement, our RCI, processes along which we're committed to drive improvement. They support our advancement in positive times, and they create powerful offsets in turbulent times. We believe you can see that in our results over time, and you can see it in the first quarter. Snap-on value creation overcoming challenges, and continuing our performance progress. ","Now, let's move to the groups. In the C&I group, organic sales were up $4.7 million or 1.5%, now including $13.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency first quarter as reported volume declined $9.1 million. From an earnings perspective C&I operating income was $46.5 million, about the same as last year. The operating margin was up 40 basis points to 14.4%. Organic volume, RCI, and the effect of foreign currency drove that rise. We've been speaking for some time about the importance of our torque product line, well robust performance in our specialty torque division was particularly encouraging, with a high single-digit increase this quarter. And beyond that, growth in the critical industries was evident in the quarter. Both those gains were partially occluded or partially attenuated by spotty performance in some of our international markets.","Now, critical industries showed variations across the businesses. Up for natural resources, the military, education, and general industry, partially offset by some softness in aerospace, but overall showed a positive outlook. We're confident in and committed to extending in the critical industries, and we have seen continuing gain. Now 10 straight quarters of growth authored by a strengthening lineup of innovative product, matched to the task and designed specially to make work easier in the uniquely challenging industrial workspace, and our torque lineup is an example of that expanding strength.","As a matter of fact, torque and critical industries are natural partners, and we've been investing to pursue the possibilities. A great example, just introduced, is Snap-on's ControlTech CTech Micro Torque Wrench fitted with Bluetooth Low Energy technology, BLE technology, and offering created by customer connection and innovation.","Our traditional Snap-on specialty is torque in a compact body. And we combined that strength with our recent acquisition Sturtevant Richmont's expertise in wireless torque programming and documentation. It all came together to make critically work much easier, much more productive with this extraordinary product. The Sturtevant Richmont BLE system enables remote programming to match in order the varying torque values required to complete many essential tasks in aerospace, the military, or oil and gas. And the remote communication model that does that seamlessly packages inside the Micro Torque Wrench, the micro wrench body, making the wrench able to operate in almost any space, including around those very tight inline fasteners that are so common in aerospace solutions.","The ability to program and the ability to program a rage of torque values in order, and the ease of access means that the Micro CTech BLE does the work of four to five mechanical present wrenches, a significant cost reduction and a clear gain in efficiency. And beyond that advantage, the BLE Micro documents the actual torque supply avoiding the need for multiple torque audits in critical applications, saving even more time. The BLE Micro ControlTech guided by customer connection with the aircraft industry, enabled by the capabilities across the Snap-on division has been received by excitement, and it demonstrates the way our product line is expanding to solve the most critical of tasks. C&I, driven forward with customer connection and innovation, and it is working.","Now, on to the tools group Tools Group, organic sales up 2.9%, a mid single-digit increase in the U.S., a return to the target growth range. And as a partial offset, a low single-digit decline internationally in places like the U.K. The operating earnings, $67.2 million, down $1.7 million, including $3.1 million of unfavorable currency. That represents a margin rate of 16.4%, lower by 60 basis points, but driven mostly with 50 basis points of currency headwind, so the Tools Group, another quarter of expanding sales in the U.S. and sales advancement overall with solid operating margins.","We believe our van network remains quite strong, and it's evident when we meet franchisees. As I did with a group of them just this last weekend at the U.S. Franchisee Advisory Council, or when I meet with them individually as I also did last week, once again they uniformly express confidence in the strength of the business, displayed excitement about our products, and declared optimism for their future trajectory. I tell you, you can't help but leave these encounters energized. It convinces us how strong these businesses are.","The van network has seen some variation though, but we are quite confident of the opportunities, and the tools team continues to work with focus and urgency across its geographies to drive the upward trajectory with programs or promotions or with great new products. When we speak of products we turn to Snap-on value creation, customer connection and innovation, creating new offerings, solving critical tasks, and we're doing just that in the Tools Group.","For example, last year, we released an innovative new socket line, the Flank Drive Xtra, we call it the FDX. It improved churning power - it has improved churning power, better fastener engagement, and greater strength. It's a patented designed that grips the fastener further off the corner with the more angle socket wall for greater turning power. That's where it gets it greater turning power; twenty percent more in nominal situations, fifty percent more when applied to worn or damaged fastener; the real problematic difficulty in repair. It exceeds the power of already industry-leading standard sockets. We believe we already have by far the best range of hand tools. The FDX makes it better. And the technicians agree. Hand tool sales are up nicely, demonstrating our product strength and contributing to the tools group's rising trajectory.","Now let's talk about another category, tool storage, also up in the quarter. Helped in part by our new heavy duty mobile workbench capable of supporting up to 2000 pounds; 1300 on the bench top and 700 on the lower shelf. The new bench has adjustable leg allowing technicians to adjust their workstation to match the work -- customize the work surface just how they like it from 30 inches to 40 inches high. It's ergonomic, healthy, and safe. It also includes several storage solutions; optional drawers in various configurations allowing the techs to store those very valuable tools, those jewels with security. And they have special side panels with 22 accessories, accommodating frequently used bulky or metal units. Snap-on heavy duty bench has strength, durability, friendly ergonomics, and flexibility all in one product. And it's well on its way to achieving a hit million dollar product status. And we believe it has much more of a runway. That's tools group, improving growth, continuing profitability underpinned by strong product.","Now let's speak about our S&I. First quarter organic sales declined 0.05%, close to flat. Reflecting low-single digit increase in our Undercar equipment operation, partially offset by a low single digit growth on our businesses focused on OEM dealers. Our S&I operating earnings of %83.6 million decreased $2.2 million including $1.5 million from unfavorable currency.","Operating margin was robust, 25.5%, flat despite the lower volume. Now the OEM facing businesses did advance a recovery after several quarters of downturn. We said that the pullback will be a temporary phenomenon. And in fact, it was. That area has now improved. Having said that, we continue to clearly see abundant runways for growth in our S&I group. And we are working to take advantage of those opportunities again with new products like our recently introduced school bus diagnostic kit.","The school bus package provides the repair technician with a guide to standard preventive maintenance procedures and offers quick capabilities for analyzing vehicle performance problems with that special application. The new kit it features our NEXIQ pocket HD heavy duty handheld unit, unique diagnostic software and full array of cables and accessories. School bus repair is a clearly -- it's clearly a critical task, and our new kit makes that effort more effective and easier.","Also in the first quarter, we entered the motorcycle diagnostic market with our new P1000 handheld. Based on customer connection, new system build and underserved need for an all makes all model motorcycle diagnostic solution based on our customer connection, we knew we would well received. And that's just what happened. We are confident in the strength of our S&I product line. And that possibility is not just from our internal views or internal measures.","Recently, we were acknowledges by Undercar Digest magazine with that publications naming four of our new products to its 2019 list of the top 10 tools; two Mitchell 1 repair products. Our ProDemand repair information system and our Manager SE Shop Management suite were selected. And two diagnostic products, our groundbreaking Apollo handheld with intelligent diagnostics and our Thermal Imager Elite were also recognized in the top 10; four in the top 10.","The Undercar Digest awards are selected by readers, shop owners, and technicians. People who earn their living by being accurate and efficient when diagnosing and repairing today's vehicles. It's clear that these awards are independent verification of Snap-on's ongoing commitment to customer connection and innovation, but most of all to the extraordinary results of that focus. We keep driving to expand our S&I's position with repair shop owners and managers making work easier with great new product, developed internally with Snap-on value creation, or added by our strategic and coherent acquisitions. And we're confident it's a winning approach. So those are the highlights of our quarter continued progress, sales growth, and profitability gains, overcoming headwinds, RS&I group challenged but seeing some recovery in the OEM facing business, strength in the U.S. van channel and further progress in the critical industry.","Snap-on Value Creation driving a wide array of new products, broad array of new products, as I've demonstrated here, and improve processes more than offsetting the turbulence or offering more than offsetting turbulence. Offering an as adjusted 19.1% optical operating margin up 10 basis points and driving an as adjusted $3.1 EPS up 7.9%, it was an encouraging quarter.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?","Aldo Pagliari","Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results as summarized on slide six. Net sales of $921.7 million in the quarter were down 1.5%, reflecting a 1.4% organic sales gain and $26.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Your organic sales gain this quarter principally reflected mid-single digit growth in the U.S. franchise operations of the Snap-on tools group, and low single-digit growth in the commercial and industrial segment.","Consolidated gross margin of 51.2% improved 80 basis points, primarily due to the higher organic sales, savings from our CI initiatives and 10 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $284.2 million benefited from the $11.6 million legal settlement Nick mentioned earlier. The operating expense margin of 30.9% improved 50 basis points as the 120 basis points benefit from the legal settlement was partially offset by 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects in higher cost.","Operating earnings before financial services of $187.4 million or 20.3% of sales included $5.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, and the benefit of $11.6 million from the legal settlement, excluding the legal settlement, operating earnings before financial services as adjusted was $175.8 million or 19.1% of sales, compared to $177.7 million or 19.0% of sales last year.","Financial Services revenue of $85.6 million and operating earnings of $62.1 million increased 3.1% and 9.1% respectively from 2018. Reflecting continued growth in our financial services portfolio, as well as improved bad debt in delinquency of our performance. Consolidated operating earnings of $249.5 million are 24.8% of revenues included $6.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and the legal settlement. Excluding the legal settlement, operating earnings as adjusted was $237.9 million or 23.6% of revenues compared to $234.6 million or 23% of revenues a year ago.","Our first quarter effective income tax rate is 24.3%, including an increase of 10 basis points related to the legal settlement compared to 26.2% last year. Our Q1 2018 rate included 120 basis points related to the implementation of tax legislation in the United States, excluding the tax charge, the effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 as adjusted was 25.0%.","Finally, net earnings on a reported basis of $177.9 million or $3.16 cents per share, including an $8.00 unfavorable impact associated with foreign currency compared to $163.0 million or $2.82 per share a year ago. Excluding $0.15 per share for the legal settlements, adjusted earnings per share was $3.1 up 7.9% compared to Q1 2018; adjusted earnings per share of $2.79, which excluded net debt items and tax charges last year.","Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I group on slide seven, sales of $322.5 million in the quarter decrease to 2.7% reflecting a 1.5% organic sales gain more than offset by $13.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Your organic growth included a high single-digit increase in sales in our specialty tools business, as well as low single-digit gains with customers and critical industries. These increases were partially upset by a low single-digit decline in the segment the Asia Pacific operations, as well as lower sales in some of C&Is, Latin American markets, such as Mexico, Argentina, and Chile.","Gross Margin of 40.4% improved a 140-basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the higher organic sales volumes, savings from RCI initiatives and 40 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. The operating expense margin of 26% increased 100 basis points primarily due to 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency, and higher sales related spending and other costs. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $46.5 million were unchanged from last year while the operating margin of 14.4% increased 40 basis points from 14% in 2018.","Turning now to slide eight, sales on the Snap-on tools group of $410.2 million increased 1.4% reflecting a 2.9% organic sales increase partially offset by $6.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Your organic sales gain includes a mid-single digit increase in the United States, partially offset by a low single-digit decline internationally. The sales increase in the U.S. reflected stronger sales of hand tools, tools storage and diagnostic products. Gross Margin of 44.6% included 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects remained unchanged from last year. The operating expense margins of 28.2% increased from 27.6% last year, primarily due to 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects and higher other costs.","Operating earnings for the Snap-on tools group of $67.2 million included $3.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects decreased $1.7 million from last year, while the operating margin of 16.4% including 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to 17% in 2018.","So, into the RS&I group shown on slide nine, sales of $327.9 million decreased 2.7% reflecting a 0.5% organic sales decline, and $7.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The lower organic sales reflect a low single-digit decline in sales of Undercar equipment, partially offset by a low single-digit increase in sales to OEM dealerships. Weakness in Europe impacted RS&I's overall sales growth in the quarter. Gross margin of 48.2% increased 10 basis points from 48.1% last year, the operating expense margin of 22.7% compared to 22.6% a year ago. Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $83.6 million decreased $2.2 million from prior year levels, while the operating margin of 25.5% was unchanged from last year.","Now turning to slide 10, operating earnings from financial services of $62.1 million in revenue of $85.6 million increased 9.1% and 3.1% respectively from a year ago. Financial Services expenses of $23.5 million decreased $2.6 million dollars primarily due to lower provisions for credit losses. As a percentage of the average portfolio financial services expenses were 1.1% in the first quarter of 2019 at 1.3% in the first quarter of 2018. The average yield on finance receivables in the first quarter was 17.8% for both 2019 and 2018. Respective average yield and contract receivables was 9.1% and 9.2%. Total loan originations of $252.5 million increased $5.2 million or 2.1%, primarily due to a 2.4% increase in the originations of finance receivables.","Moving to slide 11, our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.1 billion of gross financing receivables including $1.8 billion from our U.S. operation.

I'll now turn the call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts, Nick?","Nick Pinchuk","Thanks, Aldo. Let me sum up, the step on first quarter. Step forward, advancements in several important sectors. The continuing strength of snap on value creation overcoming the challenges and driving improvements in overall earnings and in margins, we continue to be confident in the vehicle repair market, growth in the technician base, the aging of the car parts, the ongoing changes from model to model, the increasing complexity of repair, the rising need for diagnostic aids and greater repair data. These are continuing and favorable trends that offer substantial opportunity. And we believe we're best positioned to take advantage. We saw some confirmation of those possibilities play out in the quarter.","Significant progress in the U.S. Van channel up by mid single digits returned to its target range and recording its third straight positive quarter and our vehicle OEM businesses return to growth after three down quarters. Of course there were challenges in the quarter that did partially mask the progress.","Unfavorable currency, the largest impact we've seen for some time spotty markets driven by the macro environment in places like the U.K., France, Mexico and other parts of Latin America. But despite those challenges, we prevail the snap on value creation process is driving attractive and profitable new products and authoring a range of process improvements that overcame the difficulties and authored OI margin of 19.1%, up 10 basis points and an adjusted EPS of $3.01 up $0.22 or 7.9% despite the challenge.","It was an encouraging quarter which we believe points to abundant opportunities and confirms that snap on has the position, the capabilities, the products, the markets and the markets to continue our positive trend through the rest of 2018 and beyond, 2019 and beyond.","Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. Our first quarter results, our positive trends of performance and our significant opportunities going forward would not be possible without your extraordinary contribution for your success in driving our progress. You have my congratulations and for your continuing dedication to our team, you have my thanks.","Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.","Gary Prestopino","Hi, good morning everyone.","Nick Pinchuk","Good morning, Gary.","Gary Prestopino","How are you? Good, good. A couple of questions just real quickly, Aldo, that benefit on the patent litigation that has -- that was a U.S.-based issues, there's no FX impact that either way, right?","Aldo Pagliari","That's correct, Gary.","Gary Prestopino","Okay. Then, hey, Nick, could you maybe, in terms of the tool storage, and I'm not looking for an exact number, but did you see both a year-over-year and sequential increase in tool storage product sales in the quarter?","Nick Pinchuk","Yes, well year-over-year was up. I think the first quarter is always a little weaker than the fourth quarter on most situations. So I don't think it's a comparable thing. We were pretty encouraged by it though. But I think more than that I'm encouraged by hearing the way franchisees are reacting to our product. I spent a whole day with our National Franchisee Advisory Council over the weekend and they couldn't say enough about it. With some of our new colors and wraps and so on, and some of the new products, that bench, we launched the 1422. We started out calling it the AN, but - the IQON, but that had to do with a special surface. And this takes advantage of that, only it's kind of a much more versatile thing. And that's just an example of the kind of cool things that our guys are bringing out, and they're driving tool storage volume. Now of course, again you have to keep earning their confidence and earning their excitement, but we feel pretty good.","Gary Prestopino","Okay. And then you said the dealership business bounced back and you feel pretty good about it. That tends to be lumpy. I mean what gives you the confidence and the visibility there, at least for 2019?","Nick Pinchuk","You know, I'm seeing new products and new technologies roll out and I think this is just me talking in terms of my opinion, but I think having worked in the auto industry, what happens is when they behold, an auto industry it turns down like a needle [ph]. And I think IHI predicted downturns in the new car sales. They tend to think about it for a little while. I think they tend to understand -- try to understand where they're going to put their money. And so from time to time it does put a freeze on our projects, not to mention they match technology and so on. And I think after a while they realize how lucrative the aftermarket is with parts and services, so they start investing again. And I think that's what we're seeing. Plus we're seeing programs come out. We can see the programs rise. So, we feel okay about that, although we don't give guidance or anything, but I feel kind of positive. And we said it was going the come back.","Gary Prestopino","Okay, and then lastly -- given the technological complexity of vehicles and all, I mean are you kind of looking at your business, again I don't want specific numbers, but do you guys look at it as a mandate of that, if we got 70 new products out that hit the one million sales mark in 2018, the goal is to increase that every year, every year, every year?","Nick Pinchuk","Well, you know, yes. But I don't like the -- I haven't given out the number because I don't want to nail myself to the cross of that thing. In other words, I don't want to be reporting on it, but generally we want to launch more of those, and we have. In fact I'll give you the -- and note that last year, I think we launched six or seven times more new products than -- about six-and-a-half times, or six to seven times more new products than we had launched in 2006, so about 10 or 11 years ago, so there's been quite -- new hit products, million-dollar products. So, we have been driving it upwards, and it's kind of one of our metrics that we follow here, although if it went down one year I wouldn't be slitting my wrists or anything or really wringing my hands.","But on the other hand, we like to see it goes upward. And we also are expanding our product line, not million-dollar products, but the products that address different customers in critical industries. So last year, we introduced 5,242 new products in that area just because we have a whole range of those vertical industries, and we want to adapt to particular demands, particular applications. So that's what's driving our business, new product. And the range of it is what I try to say or try to give a feeling for in my presentation.","Gary Prestopino","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.","Bret Jordan","Hey, good morning, guys.","Nick Pinchuk","Good morning.","Bret Jordan","Could you talk a little bit more about the diagnostics products through the tool vans, I mean maybe give us some -- I think you mentioned Apollo being particularly strong, but maybe give us an update as to where Zeus is. And then my follow-up question for Aldo -- sorry, go ahead.","Nick Pinchuk","Okay, no, go ahead.","Bret Jordan","And I guess the follow-up question is for Aldo really on a housekeeping, just corporate expense, how should we be thinking about that and on sort of an annual run rate. The last year or so we've had some puts and takes as far as legal income or loss. I guess what do we think about core corporate expense spending level.","Aldo Pagliari","I'll answer that one first, I'll let Nick dive into diagnostics. Corporate expense clearly benefited mostly this quarter by the $11.6 million reduction in our liability under the legal matter. But also it benefited in the quarter from about $1.6 million to $2 million or so of pension related expenses, which now fall below the line of the new accounting standard. So pension expense should continue on moving forward, however in the middle of the year you'd typically get the true-up of your census data, find out how long people are living, things of that nature. So, long answer to your question, Bret. I'd still say it's in the $90 million range, $92 million range on an annual basis. And again, you can get puts or takes on that depending on what level of spending might be around due diligence if you're looking at acquisitions or what the actual healthcare cost to the company come in at, that's what creates some noise around the fringes.","Bret Jordan","Okay, perfect.","Nick Pinchuk","Okay, all right. Look, in diagnostics. The diagnostics was up in the Tools Group, fairly -- the Tools Group was kind of a good quarter we thought. I mean you would say it was a good quarter, but was kind of broad advancement, so diagnostics was up positively. The P1000 was the -- the motorcycle diagnostics was a good one, but others sold reasonably well. I didn't say the Apollo was up gangbusters or anything like that, I just referred to Apollo as recognized by Undercar Digest. So, I don't really want to get into what sold and what didn't sell, because you can drive yourself crazy trying to analyze the ups and downs of different diagnostics in the quarter, different diagnostic sales or any different product line in the quarter. We find that not to be a very productive exercise because it depends generally on what people have on the van and how we promote them and how they're focused on selling and what captures their attention. And that changes from quarter to quarter. But I think it's fair to say that it was a fairly robust -- I think I can say fairly robust quarter in diagnostics in Tools Group.","Bret Jordan","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","Yes, good morning, everyone.","Nick Pinchuk","Morning.","David MacGregor","Good morning. Congratulations on a good quarter.","Nick Pinchuk","Thank you.","David MacGregor","Could you start off by just talking, Nick, about the regional kickoffs and how did orders compare year-over-year?","Nick Pinchuk","I think orders were about -- I guess it varied from place to place. There was quite a bit of variation this year from place to place. I think it wasn't anything special I would say. But we've learned -- David, what we've learned about this is that I think as you -- I don't if we've learned it, we've known it all along, I think we've kind of tried to articulate this. Whether you're talking about SFC or whether you talk about the kickoffs, they are only one component of the forward action. The biggest thing that happens in the kickoffs, of course, having more orders is better than -- having more orders than - really robust order is better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick, but it doesn't deliver the quarter. And so we had a good kickoff season, but I wouldn't call it really gangbusters. On the other hand the follow-ons were very strong as well.","So I think it's useful to look at it, but it isn't definitive even for the immediate quarter. We felt good about it. I particularly felt good about the training that occurred and some of the coaching that occurred in those situations, because our product line is only getting more complicated. It's more powerful, and it's generating great margins, as you can see in our product lines.","David MacGregor","How would you say promotional activity kickoffs compared year-over-year?","Nick Pinchuk","I think about the same. One of the great things I heard -- I read a lot of things. One of the great things, I was with the franchisees this weekend, like I said, last week. And one of the great things, music to my ears, they said \"You've given us the best values we ever had.\" That's what I want them to say. By the way, our margins overall for the corporation, 51.2%, gross margins I'm talking about. I don't like to talk about gross margins, but in this instance I will. 51.2% against currency was the highest in 20 years. The Tools Group - the Tools Group -- around the highest in 20 years, but the thing is very good. And the Tools Group was very robust, and it against 40 basis points of currency. So I love people saying you gave us great value. And by the way, that great value translated into good margins for us.","David MacGregor","Right. Well, Nick, maybe my next question, you could open the Tools Group gross margins up for a little bit, like you did last quarter. And I think last quarter you talked about -- it was negative back ships, raw material issues, there was some negative FX from RCI. Could you just open that up? It was a little bit stronger than we expected, and I'd love to understand the puts and takes\u2026","Nick Pinchuk","New products. New product drives a lot of that. That's one of the things. And our guys' programs are very creative, and they impel selling, and they attract franchisees even if it's not new product, so that's part of the magic of the magician doing it. But coming back to your question, we had about, I think, in gross margin we had about 40 basis points of bad news in currency. And then there we had a slug. I don't want to really get into material costs and tariffs and all that stuff, there's a lot of turbulence. And we're not as vulnerable as a lot of people, but we have impact. Everybody else knows what's happened with material costs, it's going up. We usually -- we offset them. So in this quarter, the Tools gross margin is a great example.","Look, you got currency. You got turbulence in the supply chain. You have some impact in tariffs, which we worked through. And yes, we've kept it flat. We had all of those running through our overall P&L and she shook them off, plus big currency. So I'm pretty happy about Snap-on value creation this quarter.","David MacGregor","Was there much change in the international gross margins?","Nick Pinchuk","I think there was. I think in general, you know, as you might think, in the U.K. U.K. has been struggling a little bit, so we tend to want to try to get that started back on the train. And so anybody who is running a business like that that's in that kind of turbulence really tries to push around in terms of maybe making some concessions and so on. So I don't think the international gross margins were as robust as the U.S., for sure. And it reflects the idea that the sales were down. And that's what those guys do, that's what we ask them to do, get the train started again, and then we worry about getting our money after that train starts.","David MacGregor","Thanks. Last question for me is just the originations, up 2.4%, I guess, on the finance receivables subset. Is it possible that -- you talked about the strength in storage and in diagnostics in the Tool segment, was it possible your ASPs were down? Units were up; ASPs were down or at least were muted? I'm trying to reconcile the 2% with kind of the commentary that\u2026","Nick Pinchuk","I'll let Aldo talk in a minute, but I got to say this. First of all, there isn't temporal connection between the originations in one quarter and the selling, of course because there's time differences and so on there's a lot of things that flow through this. So it's not a productive -- I don't think it's very easy, even by us, to be able to necessarily tie those two together very directly. You have to look over at March at time and look for -- because I guess the best way to say it is, for connection between sales of new products -- sales of product and originations a quarter isn't necessarily a significant time period.","David MacGregor","Okay.","Aldo Pagliari","I've got to agree with that, David. It's just a matter of timing more than anything else. So the other slight differences to make your modeling more difficult, you have to remember the EC originations will report that as not currency affected. So, you look at the currency variations, they create some noise as well. But mostly it's timing.","David MacGregor","So what would the timing influence have been on that 2% number?","Aldo Pagliari","Well, we'll wait and see. We'll see what Q2 has to portray. It depends what the franchisees do with selling off what they bought in Q1, doesn't it.","David MacGregor","Yes. Okay, thanks, gentlemen.","Nick Pinchuk","Sure, thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn","Thank you. Good morning.","Nick Pinchuk","Good morning.","Christopher Glynn","So, just a question about C&I, it's always a little bit lumpy, you get strong quarters, some softer quarters. Just wondering if you see the backdrop to support the kind of mid single-digit performance you expect over the long-term in the ensuing periods. And in particular what might be moving around with the APAC in the critical industries?","Nick Pinchuk","Yes, look, I think you could argue critical industries, this quarter we had a couple of -- we've gotten a couple of big government jobs, big defense systems that are military jobs that are good for us. The idea that government go and cross the T's and dotting the I's and getting all that stuff out we're confident we're going to have those, but they were delayed out of the quarter, and that that kind of was created at that attenuation of some significance for the C&I Group. And then, there's a few markets which give them some problems particularly and gave them some problems this time, they sell into Latin America. They had some problems and they had some weakness in those markets. Mexico tends to be a bigger market for them in this situation. And so, they had those kinds of difficulties if you talk about Asia-Pacific, China is very good news on China. China was particularly down, but India was really encouraging. So I think we're looking forward, we're starting to think that China and India are horns on the same boat where everybody starts to think that that China is the big Kahuna and everything will India is starting to come up for us. We're starting to get big shells work, we're making increases in leaps and bounds in that environment and we don't see it attenuating. So I'm reasonably encouraged.","Now of course aren't probably going to kick myself for saying this, but C&I is one of the most international businesses and there are turbulences around the world. You don't have to look at Europe too hard to see Germany wondering what's happening to the industry there. You see the U.K. and so on. So, you see some ups and downs but C&I did okay in those markets, they had problems in the peripheral markets like Mexico and Latin America and in Middle East and so on. I don't think that's going to last.","Christopher Glynn","Okay, thanks. And then I don't\u2026","Nick Pinchuk","I feel pretty, I just the reason it is that I feel pretty positive about are our products. For example, Asia-Pacific start to sell to people like Cormack with the ATC, the ATC start to become the tool storage Foreign Object Damage product of choice in Asia that takes off it's good for us.","So I feel good about those things.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. And then for the SOT margins, some apparently nice mixed recovery from the fourth quarter you talked about new products in particular hitting and you had some discounting I think to end the year last year, so just wondered if we should expect the mixed dynamics and discounting to flop around a little bit or if the first quarter is really a lot more representative than fourth quarter?","Nick Pinchuk","Yes, look I think what happened in the fourth quarter was more like we wanted to focus on customers. I think what we said was in diagnostics we wanted to focus on customers that weren't that interested in software. So we energized around the last generation products the solace and the modest. And sold those and of course they were last generation, so they tended to be less margins and other things. We that would be what happened in the fourth quarter, we're pivoting away with that, away from that now and we're making some adjustments in our new generation product lines to appeal to people who are less enthusiastic about software and still we're able to sell it to them.","So I don't think that's going to repeat itself although Murphy's Law being what it is, I don't think by intent that will repeat itself. I don't see us going there by intent. I feel pretty good about the tools March now. Currency is going to continue. I mean what we see is that currency was pretty big this quarter, I think $6.2 million, $0.08 we see if everything stays away it is now, we see next quarter's kind of the same thing starts to get better in the third quarter and it kind of flattens out to fourth quarter but we're going to see currency headwinds in the Tools group in particular in the quarter, so we won't get rid of that. That's the thing, but I still feel pretty good about the margins I think when I talk to our franchisees and I talk to their guys they seem confident there's a spring in their step.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. So you did see the network's success in driving some incremental interest in the intelligent products for mass?","Nick Pinchuk","Yes, I think what I'm saying is we're making we made adjustments around that and we're launching new products, we're going to launch new products as we go forward and we did see some improvements this quarter, the fourth quarter as I said was a specific activity that said, I think I said we found after several quarters of driving intelligent diagnostics with the big data package, we're leaving a certain customer segment behind. So we went after them in the fourth quarter, we're not going after them anymore because we thought we sold them. We added them. We got them in the fold back in the fold.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. And for\u2026","Nick Pinchuk","Not doing special this time.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. And just a quick one on international, is that just kind of stable leaky or still getting hands around what's going on with the international franchise?","Nick Pinchuk","Wow, our job is to fix things like that, okay. But so, you can get better, but it's still a headache. You mentioned U.K. to me and the Tools Group and I immediately get a migraine, but it is getting better Europe -- in the last few quarters have gotten better. So it hasn't been to Australia still problem, but some of them gotten better. So that particular business has gotten better still not as fast as the U.S. I do feel okay about it. So I think our people are taking action. And we're not just not sitting still we're acting on this. And so, I believe we're on an upward trajectory, the time concept of that structure. The slope of that trajectory is another question.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks very much.","Operator","We will take our next question from David Leiker with Baird.","Joe Vruwink","Hi, this is Joe Vruwink for David.","Nick Pinchuk","Hello, Joe.","Joe Vruwink","I did that mid-single digit growth and U.S. Tools Group pretty well match rates of sellouts in the quarter.","Nick Pinchuk","Yes, it was -- I think, the sales of the bandwidth a little bit lower, but generally, when you look over, three, four or five quarters are about the same. What's going on a van is going off, so no big difference.","Joe Vruwink","And when you think it, I think you said it's three straight quarters now have kind of a nice return to growth in the U.S. tools business. When you think about the driver behind that, obviously on these quarterly calls, so you talk a lot about new product and I think you've had some compelling new product in the last three quarters to drive it, how much of the return to mid-single digit would you squarely place on new product as opposed to maybe some other initiatives you might have tried out?","Nick Pinchuk","I don't know. I mean, I think new product is a thing, which energizes the franchise it's a kind of thing, which gets people to get on the van. They buy the new product and they buy some other things as well. Now, of course, that is necessarily true, it's a $10,000 toolbox or something. But generally, if they're buying a let's say, in FDX instead of sockets with FDX, a Flank Drive Extra, you get them on the van, they end up leaving with something else usually. So I think there's that kind of thing. So I don't think we never really track how much of new product drives that. I do know, though that it's a robust portion because they drive good margins.","Anytime we bring out a new project -- a new product, we get our value for them. And so, you see the Tools Group nice margin. That's why we liked the new product. And the cool thing about it is, despite what people might think is that generally the changing vehicle complexity is pretty strong. And the cool thing about this is I know that some people would say that technicians aren't growing quickly and you know they are growing like 1%. But everywhere I go, people say I can't feel the jobs I have. So we're seeing, I anticipate in the future, some influx of new technicians. That's why we're spending all it's time and schools. That's why we have 468 schools using Snap-on certified Snap-on certifications. And we're in 2500 schools because we're making those people that are going to eventually fill those slots, customers for life.","So I feel okay about I think the Tools Group is pretty good. Now I would correct you on one thing. I did not say that it was robust growth for three quarters; I only said it was a growth for three quarters. So some of that growth was a little slimmer than the mid-single digits, let's say. But it's a positive to see them moving upwards, if there's a trajectory there, that if you're a guy like me, you're pretty encouraged.","Joe Vruwink","Yes, and then just a return, since you brought up the mechanic and shortage we have in this country. One of the byproducts is if you are a mechanic, you're obviously getting very healthy earnings growth at the moment, a good wage growth.","Nick Pinchuk","4.4% ELS data.","Joe Vruwink","So when you think about the improvements and the risk metrics of the asset book. Obviously, delinquencies moving around -- moving down, maybe switch back to the health of the mechanic customer. How much is not related to that however, and maybe more conscious actions by Snap-on in the last two years to maybe skewed the risk of the profile a bit differently than in that '15-'16 timeframe?","Nick Pinchuk","Well, I think there is both in there. It's hard for me to -- it's hard for me to parse between those. I mean you will be entitled to both of those ideas. Look, I think the thing is I mean people have talked about this. And I think somebody might reasonably ask me and say, well, is that the appropriate level of losses? Well, I think people have worry that those losses were going to go through the roof. I think not.","It's certainly we have been sitting at and we have been dealing with that for a long time. And it has not gone through the roof. And by the way, the fact does anybody thinks the finance company isn't a good business? It is. And so, I do believe we feel pretty confident about the quality of those loans, and getting better is a combination possibly of both things, I think.","Joe Vruwink","And then, one last question. For the international tools grew business to ultimately only be down low single digit, was that better than you expected entering this quarter given the threat of Brexit and maybe the chaos that creates?","Aldo Pagliari","The guys who run those businesses are listening to this call. So, I am not going to say that I was happy with being them. That's all I will say about that.","Joe Vruwink","Okay. Fair point. Thanks very much.","Aldo Pagliari","Thanks.","Operator","We will take our next question from Curtis Nagle with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Curtis Nagle","Great. Thanks very much and so apology if I missed this point, but diagnostics within RS&I was at up or down. And then, do you guys have any new platforms launching ex motorcycle?","Nick Pinchuk","Yes, look, diagnostics in the tools group was up. Diagnostics in the RS&I group can be split into two categories. One is sales for the tools group. And then it sells a variety of software and diagnostic-related software and handheld units outside the tools group outside the van distribution. So the sales through the tools group were up in the quarter for diagnostics. The sales outside of the software particularly in the U.K. that software that was down quite a bit in this quarter, so that the -- the net of that diagnostics inside RS&I was down some, but if you parse them, healthy to the tools group. Outside that channel, down primarily because it's software stuff that rolling -- software stuff that was rolling through Europe and it wasn't as strong. It wasn't strong.","Now in terms of introductions, it's already been announced that we are bringing out -- I was told not to talk about this on the call, but since you asked we have already announced the introduction of something called the Triton which is the replacement sort of like the one level down from the ZEUS and above the Apollo. You might -- so that kind of business it's replacement for what we call the MODIS. And that's been launched just recently -- just in the second quarter. So, we didn't have any sales at all in the first quarter. And we are still kind of rolling it out. When you roll these things out, you don't necessarily roll them out nationally. So that has the kind of thing that's happening now. But, we are pretty -- I think talking to the franchises over the weekend who had some of -- whom had seen it and had the -- saw the presentation, they were pretty positive about it. It's a $35 to $4000 product. Good product.","And we think it will be a good seller. It adds the addition of scoping. So, it's aimed at mechanics who are working on projects that are high value and they can't afford to replace the component that they found is the problem. And has taken them three hours to remove, they can't afford to replace that problem. It takes three hours to remove and replace it and find out it wasn't bad. While the Triton different than the Apollo will allow you test that component before you take it out, and say is it good or bad. So it avoids big mistakes and makes it much more efficient in the garage for those people who are doing those kinds of activities.","Curtis Nagle","Got it. It's very helpful. I appreciate it, Nick. And then I know it's a new category for you guys, but I guess it starts on potential to -- or how much you can grown motorcycle diagnostics? How big is that business?","Nick Pinchuk","I don't know. We just we launched it in the first quarter with a good seller. We will see. I think we feel pretty good though. I mean there are a lot of motorcycles around. Lot of motorcycle shops, and this is the only all makes -- or pretty much all makes all models diagnostic. So it's as I said on the call, it's an underserved market. It was received enthusiasm. I feel positive about it. But to dimension it, it's a little early. We are not experiencing that thing yet. It is a good seller over in the quarter. Sure.","Curtis Nagle","Okay. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.","Nick Pinchuk","Okay.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Ivan Feinseth with Tigress Financial Partners.","Ivan Feinseth","Thank you for taking my call and congratulations on another great quarter.","Nick Pinchuk","Thank you, Ivan.","Aldo Pagliari","Thank you.","Ivan Feinseth","My question is with all the great torque tools that you make, you really don't talk about opportunities in just general OEM manufacturing. I think there is so many areas of manufacturing for pumps, compressors, pretty much every bolt needs to torqued. Have you seen the opportunity?","Nick Pinchuk","No, we actually have a category called general industry. I did mention general industry as being up in the critical industries area. And that's where we use torque. And you are very right. We would use -- we do use it in general industry quite a bit. They tend to be more one-off type of applications where the airplanes like I said there are lot of different situations where you can categorize them in bigger buckets.","I think the general industry tends to be a little bit more customized. So, we tend not to mention in these calls, but it's a big category for us. You are very right. And so, we have a lot of opportunities there. And that's why we acquired Sturtevant Richmont. We acquired fast torque. We acquired Norbar to add to that capability of City of Industry, California. We will be coming -- we feel pretty good that in the industrial sector we may be the top torque business.","We believe we may be the top torque business. And we are getting better because we are matching all our capabilities like talked about Sturtevant Richmont with their wireless capability together with a micro capability to compact capabilities of our City of Industry, our traditional strength putting together that BLEC tech micro. That's the kind of thing we are see in the future. And we believe that torque because everybody is looking for more positioning including the automotive industry, you know, by the time vehicles come precision is going to be really important because you don't want to be hitting the automatic part if you are not in precise calibration.","Ivan Feinseth","Yes, I am excited -- I like acquisition you have made in the torque area and I think there is a huge growth opportunity there.","Nick Pinchuk","Thanks.","Ivan Feinseth","And I am also excited about new motorcycle diagnostic system, so I look forward to hearing\u2026","Nick Pinchuk","Yes, that will be cool. Hopefully -- I can't believe we didn't do it earlier. So when I was saying\u2026","Ivan Feinseth","Yes, me too.","Nick Pinchuk","There are so many opportunities at Snap-on for growth. Every time we do something like this, we say to ourselves what happened. How is it we didn't think of that earlier? So, -- okay.","Ivan Feinseth","Congratulations and thanks again.","Nick Pinchuk","Thank you very much.","Aldo Pagliari","Thank you, guys.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Sara Verbsky for any additional or closing remarks.","Sara Verbsky","Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. And as always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference.

Baird","Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research","David MacGregor - Longbow Research","Liam Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Richard Hilgert - Morningstar","","Operator","Good day and welcome to the Snap-on Incorporated, Third Quarter Results Call. Today's conference is being recorded. ","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Leslie Kratcoski, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Leslie Kratcoski","Thanks Ryan and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's third quarter results, which are detailed in our Press Release issued earlier this morning.","We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick-off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.","As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on our website next to the audio icon for this call. These slides will be archived on our website along with a transcript of today's call.","Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections, are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.","With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick.","Nick Pinchuk ","Thanks Leslie. Good morning everybody. As usual, I\u2019ll start with the third quarter highlights, provide an update on the environment and speak a bit on the trends. Aldo will then provide a detailed review of the financials.","In the third quarter we again showed progress along our runways for growth and for improvement and we saw those gains across all our business segments. Sales were up 7% from last year, 5.6% of acquisition related volume coupled with a 6.2% organic rise. Our operating margin before Financial Services reached 16.2%, up 140 basis points. ","When you add the $37.7 million in operating earnings from Financial Services, which increased from $31.6 million in 2013, the consolidated operating margin was 19.6% in EPS. That was $1.76, up $0.33 or 23.1% from the $1.43 registered just last year. ","For our automotive related businesses, the environment, it continues to be favorable. Actually it\u2019s been this way for a while and our Tools Group and our Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group are both well positioned to take advantage. You can see that in the performance; another quarter of solid gains for both groups. Clearly the enhancements to the franchise network and our expansion with dealerships and independent repair shops are driving a continuing positive trend. ","In the Commercial & Industrial Group or the C&I Group there was also direct evidence of growing strength. SNA Europe activity increased again, now up three straight quarters. The industrial division, Critical Industries grew by double digits, showing gains in both the U.S. and internationally and the Bellwether emerging markets of China and India, they also registered a quarter of relatively robust progress. ","Now as in past periods, C&I does have some headwinds. The European economies are mixed with particular turbulence in the east. The U.S. military somewhat recovered from its prior lows and is still uncertain territory and various Asian countries can be impacted from time to time by local conditions; elections, or changes in economic policies, like the new tax levels in Japan. But you know, there will always be headwinds. ","They\u2019ve been a factor in each of our quarters for sometime. They were present again in the third quarter and we overcame, because we are well positioned to confront the challenges and proceed down our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise network, expanding repair shop owners and managers, extending to critical industries and building in emerging markets. These do represent avenues for considerable advancement and there has been clear and consistent progress in along each of those paths and the third quarter is more testimony.","At the same time those growth drivers are joined and supported by the benefits of Snap-on value creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement or RCI. These are the processes, the tools we use each and everyday to drive improvement. Our quarterly results, the increases in operating margin demonstrate progress along each of these dimensions, but this quarter, especially in customer connection and innovation. ","Customer Connection: Snap-on\u2019s continuing pursuit of Repair Shop insight, the understanding of our customers work based on the hours and the days we spend with working men and women. ","Innovation: Taking that practical insight and matching it with a keen understanding of what\u2019s made possible by modern technology. Into the quarter those processes resulted in three prestigious product awards, all are evidence of Snap-on bringing it together, the practical with the possible for a good effect. ","We were again honored with the MOTOR Magazine Top 20 Tools Awards. The winner this time was the Two-Piece, Impact Swivel Extension Set, created to assist technicians to difficult to reach fasteners, like transmission bolts, driveline bolts, cylinder heads. Its laser-welded pivot pin allows for smooth full 30 degrees swivel action and more efficient power transfer. Great for those difficult bolts and heads in tight spaces. It clearly makes critical work easier. ","Snap-on also received two Professional Tool & Equipment News Innovation Awards for the Semi-Deep Flip Socket in the Hand Tools category and for our Digital Video Borescope the BK6500 in the Inspection Tools category. Our Flip Socket saves technicians time. ","The convenience to using one tool to remove the two most common sizes of underbody fasteners, it speeds up things in the shop, we see it. I\u2019ve mentioned this tool before. The P10 (ph) Award is just another accolade for what has turned out to be a very popular offering and great example of customer connection combining with innovation. ","Also recognized by the P10 (ph) was our new BK6500, Digital Video Borescope, offering a true digital image and the largest viewing screen in the market. It diagnoses internal engine problems, inspects door panels, checks for corrosion inside radiators, examines break pad wear and looks inside transmissions and axel housing, all time saving activates. ","I mention these awards, because they are just the most recent recognitions of a growing list of popular hit parade products that provide unique customer connection and guided advantages, fueled by the observations of our franchises and direct sales people, all committed to connecting with our professional customers and translating that insight into productivity innovations and Snap-on advantage, and all of that shows in the result of each group in the third quarter. ","Now, to focus on those individual groups. Lets start with C&I. Lets start with the Commercial & Industrial Group. Organic sales were up 9.4%, with sales to customers in critical industries leading the way. Operating margins reached 13.7%, up 60 basis points from last years 13.1%, volume growth and the benefits of Snap-on value creation and customer connection had a hand in those results, the C&I results as well. ","Our industrial direct salesmen recognized the difficult of torquing large fasteners in the constrain spaces, so common to power generation plants. Our engineering team used this insight to develop or revised torquing process, utilizing a special compact torque wrench configured specifically for closed corners. The new process makes work easier, makes tasks easier for professionals all over the critical power generation industry; courtesy of Snap-on Customer Connection & Innovation. ","Speaking of critical industries, broad progress was clearly evident in the quarter. Power generation activity, aerospace volumes, shipments to natural resource customers and sales to the U.S. military, all critical and all up by strong double-digits. ","Lets talk about the U.S. military for a moment. Entering the year it had been a headwind due to budgetary constrains. But a recent resurgence has caused for guarded optimism. With that said, the availability of future government funding and the timing of order activity remained difficult to predict and so the overall trajectory of military sales is still uncertain, but its been improving. ","As for SNA Europe, that operation recorded overall gains again. Our fourth straight quarter of growth and it continues its positive trajectory of profitability. Operating margin was up again this quarter, well outpacing volume. Not only leveraging the additional activity, but realizing the benefits of RCI and past restructuring activities. SNA Europe strong. So that provides a bit of color on C&I. ","Now onto the Tools Group. Organic sales up 6%, significant growth in the U.S. and internationally. Operating income in the quarter of $49.5 million compared to $41.9 million in 2013. Operating income margins of 13.9% rose 130 basis points from last year\u2019s 12.6%. The additional volume, as well as the operating improvements from RCI translated into significant margin gains. ","When you consider the root to the Tools Group success, some of it can also be found in the growing power of Snap-on value creation. I\u2019ve spoke often about the Rock N Roll Cab Express vans, enhancing the franchisees sales opportunities through expanded space, so we can display the full range of tool storage products to customers. ","If you have been following these calls, you know its been working, and the third quarter was no exception. But beyond the selling assist, the Rock N Roll vans have served as a valuable platform for customer connection. We\u2019ve uncovered a wide of range of tool storage innovations for trim, drawer, colors and other features, all from the interaction on the van. ","A recent example is a newly introduced super wide drawer, now installed as a popular option in the epic tool storage line. The idea came from the Rock N Roll Van and now it\u2019s a big seller, helping to stock the Tools Group growth. ","Third quarter is also when we hold the Annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference, our SFC. This year was in Orlando. More than 8,000 attended. Principals from over 3,000 North American routes and their families and their guests; product showcases, business seminars, new van operating programs, all designed to build franchisees success and in a follow-up survey the franchisees almost unanimously recommended participating in next year\u2019s conference, a great endorsement. ","But beyond the formal survey, beyond that survey, I was there myself. I spent time with many franchisees and I believe I have never seen the more positive about their presence or with greater confidence in the future, the Tools Group; awarding winning products, unique mobile demonstration vehicles like the Rock N Roll Express and motivated and committed franchisees. We\u2019ve made it a priority to invest in the franchisee proposition and it\u2019s showing in the third quarter results. ","When you speak of the van channel, we also must consider the strategic contributions of Snap-on credit. Our Financial Services arm helps create opportunities across our origination, but especially within the Tools Group. Credit had a strong presence in Orlando at the SFC, supporting franchisees with innovative new programs aimed at enabling sales of those big-ticket items, which are so essential to franchisees success. And if you look at the numbers, Financial Services OI up $6.1 million or 19.3% in the quarter, you know its working. ","Now lets move to RS&I. Total sales were up 7.3%, 4.4% organically excluding the Pro-Cut acquisition. The operating margin, 23.3% increased from 22.9% last year. The volume gains came primarily from higher sales and essential programs to OEM dealerships and from increases in diagnostics and repair information products, serving independent repair shop owners and mangers. ","In the third quarter the RS&I Group, through the Equipment Solutions Division expanded our profile in automotive dealerships with several essential tool programs supporting vehicle launches, putting new models and redesigns or existing platforms. ","Equipment solutions also provided new essential diagnostics for specific repair campaigns; one designed to identify electrical issues and to other to isolate causes of vibration and noise; new essential programs for dealerships launched in the quarter and helping fuel RS&I growth. ","Serving in the independent shops, Mitchell 1 again recorded significant gains with its heavy-duty repair, connect product, securing business with several new key customer networks. Repair Connect provides a complete range of trust repair information and solutions for independent and fleet truck shop and its becoming widely embraced across the heavy-duty market place. ","Customer connection also played a large role at RS&I during the quarter. For example, for under car equipment, repair shop insight guided the development of a communicating like between our wheel balancer and customer information networks, unique data such as tread depth and the radial and lateral run out can now be shared directly with the customer\u2019s database. And in the quarter this feature was the deciding factor in converting a large German supplier of wheel logistics to the Snap-on balance of the line up and there are many more similar examples. ","We also introduced our most recent acquisitions to international customers at Automechanika, the biannual Automotive Industry event held during September in Frankford. Challenger Lifts were presented at the show for the first time as part of the Snap-on family and it generated broad interest with a wide range of customers from diverse geographies, signaling a new international opportunity for that product line. ","Pro-Cut was also introduced at the show as a Snap-on product line, and the audience was attentive and appreciative. We believe it\u2019s a sign of good things to come. So as you can see, there was a lot of initiatives across many end customers, dealerships and independence, domestic and international, all contributions to RS&I gains in serving repair shop owners and mangers. ","Well, that\u2019s the highlights of the quarter. Sales up 7%, fueled by significant increases across the board in each group, clear evidence of progress along all our runways for growth. Snap-on value creation, driving improvement, customer connection, innovation, solving critical tasks and offering hit parade products, growth and improvement, brining our OI margin to 16.2%, up 140 basis points. It was an encouraging quarter. ","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over Aldo. Aldo.","Aldo John Pagliari","Thanks Nick. Our third quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $806.3 million in the quarter increased $53.1 million or 7% from 2013 levels, reflecting broad-based gains across all of our operating segments. ","Organically, sales increased 6.2%, excluding $5.6 million of acquisition-related sales and $0.7 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Consolidated gross profit of $393.9 million increased $29.6 million from 2013 levels.","The gross margin of 48.9% in the quarter increased 50 basis points, primarily due to the benefits from higher sales and savings from ongoing RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $263.3 million increased $10.3 million, primarily due a higher volume related and other expenses. The operating expenses margin of 32.7% improved 90 basis points from 33.6% a year ago, mainly due to sales volume leverage.","Restructuring costs of $2 million in the quarter compared with $1.7 million of such costs last year. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $130.6 million in the quarter increased $19.3 million or 17.3% and as a percentage of sales improved 140 basis points to 16.2%.","Operating earnings from Financial Services of $37.7 million increased 19.3% over prior year levels. Consolidated operating earnings totaled $168.3 million and the operating margin of 19.6% improved to 170 basis points from 17.9% a year ago. Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 31.8% compared with 32.6% last year.","Finally, net earnings in the quarter of $103.7 million or $1.76 per diluted share compared to net earnings of $84.6 million or $1.43 per share last year, representing a 23.1% increase in earnings per share.","Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & Industrial or C&I Group on slide seven. Sales of $298.8 million in the quarter were up 9.4% organically, primarily reflecting a double-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries and a single-digit sales increase in our European-based hand tools business.","Gross profit in the C&I group totaled $111.8 million in the quarter. Gross margin of 37.4% decreased 70 basis points from 2013 levels, primarily due a shift in sales mix that included higher sales to the military, as well as increased restructuring and other costs. ","These year-over-year gross margin impacts were partially offset by savings from ongoing RCI initiatives, including continued improvements within our European based hand tools business. ","Operating expenses of $71 million in the quarter increased $2.2 million over 2013 levels, primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 23.7% improved 130 basis points, mostly due to the sales volume leverage, including benefits from the higher military sales.","As a result of these factors, third quarter operating earnings for the C&I segment of $40.8 million increased $4.8 million or 13.3% from 2013 levels, and the operating margin of 13.7% improved 60 basis points from 13.1% last year.","Turning now to slide eight. Third quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $355 million increased 6% organically, reflecting mid-single-digit sales increases in both our U.S. and international franchise operations. ","Gross profit of $154.8 million increased $12 million from 2013 levels and the gross margin of 43.6% increased 80 basis points, primarily due to benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $105.3 million in the quarter increased $4.4 million from 2013 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related expenses.","The operating expense margin of 29.7% improved 50 basis points from 30.2% last year, principally due to sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, operating earnings of $49.5 million for the Snap-on Tools Group increased $7.6 million or 18.1% and the operating margin of 13.9% improved 130 basis points from 12.6% last year.","Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group shown on slide nine. Sales of $271.2 million increased $18.5 million or 7.3% from 2013 levels. Excluding $5.6 million of acquisition related sales or $1.6 million of favorable foreign currency translations, organic sales were up 4.4%. ","The organic sales increase primarily reflects a double-digit gain in sales to OEM dealerships and a mid single digit increase in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. These organic sales increases were partially offset by a low single digit decline in under car equipment sales, largely reflecting continued weakness in Eastern Europe related to demand for big-ticket items. ","Gross profit of $127.3 million in the quarter increased $10.6 million over 2013 levels. Gross margin of 46.9% increased 70 basis points as savings from ongoing RCI and other cost reduction initiatives were partially offset by a shift in sales that included higher volumes of lower gross margin products, including increased essential tool and vacillation sales to OEM dealerships.","Operating expenses totaled $64 million in the quarter and the operating expense margin of 23.6% increased 30 basis points, generally due to the inclusion of operating expenses for Pro-Cut. Third quarter operating earnings of $63.3 million for the RS&I group increased $5.4 million or 9.3% from prior year levels, and the operating margin of 23.3% in the quarter improved 40 basis points from 22.9% last year.","Now turning to slide 10. In the third quarter earnings from Financial Services of $37.7 million and revenues of $53.6 million, compared with operating earnings of $31.6 million on revenue of $45.1 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.6% compared with 17.4% last year and the average yield on contract receivables of 9.5% compared with 9.6%. Originations of $221.6 million in the quarter increased 8% from 2013 levels.","Moving to slide 11, our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $1.4 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.2 billion from our U.S. Snap-on credit operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extending credit loans to technicians. During the third quarter our worldwide Financial Services portfolio grew approximately $39 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.","Now turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $88 million in the quarter increased $3.7 million from comparable 2013 levels, primarily due to higher 2014 net earnings, offset by increased working investment. Net cash used by investing activities of $56.6 million included $35.8 million to fund the net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $22.3 million in the quarter compared with $19.3 million last year.","Turning to slide 13. Day sales outstanding for trade and other receivables of 64 days at both the end of the second and third quarters compared with 62 days at 2013 year-end. Inventories increased $50.2 million from 2013 year-end levels, essentially to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions and from the addition of inventories related to Pro-Cut.","On a trailing 12-month basis inventory turns of 3.6 compared with 3.7 at the end of the second quarter and 3.8 at 2013 year-end. Our quarter-end cash position of $124.7 million decreased $92.9 million from 2013 year-end levels, largely due to the repayment of $100 million of debt in March of this year.","The net decrease in cash also reflects year-to-date impacts of funding, $549.2 million of new finance receivables; dividend payments of $76.8 million, the repurchase of 591,000 shares for $67.5 million, $63.3 million of capital expenditures and the acquisition of Pro-Cut for $41.3 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by $425.1 million of cash from year-to-date collections of finance receivables and $300.7 million of cash from operations. At the end of the third quarter our net debt to capital ratio was 25.9%. ","In addition to our $124.7 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. At quarter end we had $36.7 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.","I'll conclude by mentioning a few outlook items for the remainder of the year. We continue to expect that our full year 2014 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our 2013 rate of 32.3%, and we continue to anticipate that capital expenditures for the year will be in the range of $75 million to $80 million.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?","Nicholas Pinchuk ","Thanks Aldo. Well, we are encouraged by our third quarter. Sales up 7%; significant activity gains in each of our operating groups. Yes sure, there are headwinds, but that\u2019s nothing new. Our growth trend has passed through turbulence in almost every quarter and we believe the third quarter performance again represents solid evidence of progress along our runways for growth, enhance the franchise channel. ","The Tools Group grew at 6% continuing its string of positive gains. Group OI rose 130 basis points and we believe our network of franchisees are growing in strength and confidence. Expanding with our repair shop owners and managers, RS&I grew at 4.4%, had an OI margin of 23.3% and successfully continued the integration of Challenger and Pro-Cut.","Extend to critical industries. Organic sales were increased 9.4%. Strong gains in aerospace, oil and gas and the military; SNA Europe sales growing again with profit rising even faster. Build in emerging markets, continuing to strengthen the physicals and seeing it payoff. ","Progress along our runways for improvements. Snap-on value creation, safety, quality, customer connection and RCI offering great new products and improving profitability, driving optical OI margin for the corporation to 16.2%, up 140 basis points.","We do believe the quarter\u2019s results are tangible evidence of the abundant opportunities available along our runways for growth and are clear confirmation of the power inherent in Snap-on value creation. We\u2019re encouraged, but we believe there is more, much more and our team is positioned with the capability and the intent to take full advantage and to continue the trajectory of positive performance for the foreseeable future.","Now, before I turn to questions its time once again to speak to our franchisees and our associates. I know many of you are listening. The encouraging results of the third quarter and the ongoing favorable trends due to your extraordinary capabilities and your considerable effort. For your contribution to our performance you have my congratulation, and for your continuing commitment to our team, you have my thanks.","Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from David Leiker with Baird.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird","Good morning everyone.","Nick Pinchuk","Hello David.","Aldo Pagliari","Good morning.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird","So can we talk Nick or Aldo, just kind of the pace of sales through the quarter and there\u2019s some concern that July and August might have been okay, but September started the slowdown at all. Is there anything you can characterize in terms of what you saw as you moved through the quarter?","Nick Pinchuk","Well, we never really characterized the calendarization of our sales, but those who listen to us like you do, those who listen or watch us would know this and that July and August are vacation seasons in the Europe and the United States. For Europe and Northern Europe its July and then August in Southern Europe, so July and August are afflicted by vacations and the same pretty much applies to the van business in the United States, where we have the SSC in August for a reason, because that\u2019s when the guys who are driving the vans want to take a little vacation. ","So you might be entitled to the fact that those months might be a little bit more tepid or certainly more variable and then you might be entitled to the fact that in a relatively strong quarter, that quarter would have to be delivered at the end. I think this is kind of logical sense. So without commenting on the week-by-week or day-by-day, I think you can infer that we had a fairly strong end, given that our quarter is so large.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird","How much of the strength that your seeing, both on the revenue side and the margin momentum carries over into Q4 and into 2015.","Nick Pinchuk","Well, I don\u2019t see anything that interrupts that strength, I\u2019d say that. We never comment on the forward looking months, but I think when I look at our positions along our run rates for growth and the power of our improvement, we see it carrying over the positions with the franchisees. They are more confident than ever before, I said it just a few minutes ago. ","You can see the critical industries. The critical industries seem to be humming. Military is coming back, although I did say that can be uncertain, but boy, increases are better than a poke in the eye and its been increasing fairly well, so you see that. RS&I just cranks along and anything in the auto repair business I think is fairly strong at this point.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird","And then just the last item on this, what about Europe? Obviously there\u2019s a lot of concern. We talked to a lot of people. Some think Europe might be rolling over. The Europe business has been flat on its back for several years here and just starting to bounce up. Any thoughts on how that might play out?","Nick Pinchuk","Well, a couple of things. First of all, certainly we see turbulence in the east like we said for several quarters. We were up again, the fourth straight quarter of growth in Europe and again, they were on vacation in July and August, so this is a fairly \u2013 from that perspective, it was a fairly positive quarter in terms of trajectory, sort of like trajectory. And I will say, our European business is coming off the mat. We are still down 20% to 25%, so we\u2019ve got a long way to get back to where we were in 2008. So I feel okay about Europe at this point.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird","Okay, and then just one last item here. Aldo in the working capital, looking at the cash flow statement, that\u2019s about a $24 million increase in the use of working capital year-over-year. I don\u2019t think the acquisitions are in there, but can you talk to that a bit.","Aldo Pagliari","Certainly. The increase is largely reflective of higher demand plus our intention to provide better service levels to our customer base. At this time you\u2019ll pick up a little bit of a seasonality effect coming out of the Snap-On franchisee conference that you mentioned. It was a pretty well attended conference, pretty good order book and some of the inventory increase reflects that ordering activity. Also accounts receivable are up pretty much the same. 64 days at it was at the end of last quarter, but again that\u2019s tied more to the sales increase.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird","Okay, terrific. Thank you very much.","Nick Pinchuk","Thanks David. Bye.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.","Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research","Hey, good morning everyone. ","Nick Pinchuk","Good morning.","Aldo Pagliari","Good morning.","Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research","Hey, Aldo I kind of missed your narrative in terms of the sales increases in the RS&I segment, I think \u2013 what did you say, it was high single digit sales to OEM dealerships and low single digit sales to independent repair shops. ","Aldo Pagliari","No, I think I said it was double-digit sales to OEM dealerships and mid to high single digits in sales of repair information and diagnostic products for the independent shops.","Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research","Thanks. All right, hey Nick, I want to just talk obviously Europe and David mentioned this with his questions, but could you tell us exactly how much the sales in Europe were up in the quarter if at all.","Nick Pinchuk","Well, the sales, if you are talking about SNA Europe, it was up \u2013 I would say you could characterize it as low single digits. Kind of the same as it was at the last quarter. Although last quarter we would have characterized it as mid single digits, so I mean it was a little bit lower. ","But I think when I look at the total that goes in and goes out, we saw some really strong growth in places like Spain and Italy and Denmark and Finland and some weakness in some other places. Europe as always varying from quarter-to-quarter, we think we kind of had the same quarter with volume growth again and leverage on the bottom line that outpaced the growth.","Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research","Okay. Although collectively if you put all the European economies together, they are a mess, they are not growing. I mean, is it still a function of that. You are penetrating the market at a greater rate, adding new products, just executing better, is that really what\u2026?","Nick Pinchuk","I think that\u2019s it. I mean I think its \u2013 I spend a lot of time of this call trying to emphasize the power of customer connection and innovation by another way, the mechanism by which we generate new products and so in Europe you have new products. ","For example, in Europe we have something called the Bahco ERGO Tool Management System. A system, which we put in critical applications. The box, which takes care of tool control, is customized to the customer and we put Bahco tools inside. It\u2019s a version of what we do in the United States with the Snap-On brand, only its Bacho and its fitted to each individual customer; that\u2019s driving some of our sales, so individual product improvement is helping. ","Secondly, we are just getting better at selling than we were before, because of RCI and our efficiencies and thirdly, I think to be frank here, you know as I said, I think I\u2019ve said on many of these calls, we are coming off a pretty deep dip. We are down 20% to 25%, so you know the world doesn\u2019t have to be that rosy for us to grow. ","And so I think you put those three things together and you would say, look we\u2019ve been growing in Europe for several quarters. Four straight quarters now and people have been mourning for a while and we\u2019ve just been growing through those headwinds. ","Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research","Right. And then could you give us some idea. With the Rock N Roll vans and the TechKnow vans, they are just the U.S. based phenomenon, correct?","Nick Pinchuk","Not exclusively, but mostly. To give you an idea for example, this quarter \u2013 I think in the end of the quarter we had like 59 Rock N Roll cabs. I think about five were in the international outside of North America, so there was a few and they grew a couple. One in the United States, one in North America and two in Europe and we have 25 TechKnow Express vans and they are just in the U.S.","Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research","Okay. Are there plans to expand the actual physical van count for both of those categories?","Nick Pinchuk","Well, there\u2019s certainly a plan to \u2013 the Rock N Roll cab, we\u2019ve got quite a few. I would think international we\u2019d be adding a few more perhaps; we\u2019ll be looking at that. U.S. we\u2019ve got kind of pretty much the nation covered. You might add one or two as you go forward. The TechKnow Express, there are plans to add more as we go forward.","Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research","Okay. And just in terms of your best guesses, that on basis points of sales, I mean what would be the incremental contribution from having these vans out there to the Tools Group sales.","Nick Pinchuk","Gee, its hard for me to say Gary, because they don\u2019t actually sell, they just promote the product. And so they go out there and are like a rolling showroom and the guy gets on. As you know, he gets on the van. He sees all these tool storage boxes or these diagnostic units and he ends up ordering from the franchisee who is in that territory. So it\u2019s a tough guess to say well, would it have sold anyway? ","Certainly what\u2019s happened is, since we\u2019ve had the Rock N Roll cabs for like a couple of years now, tool storage has outpaced the tools group for sometime and our big ticket items again, which is a favorable sign actually, big ticket items outpaced the Tools Group sales in general, and that of course has been driven by this, but I don\u2019t think we have a number. We just know they are helping us. ","We believe they are paying back. We can afford them because of the 6% growth, the 6% growth this time, the 6.6% last time, the 6.6% the time before that and the drop to 130 basis points improvement. We believe it\u2019s in the mix, but we haven\u2019t worried about payback in general or how much it\u2019s boosting. Sorry, I can\u2019t help you too much.","Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research","Well, that\u2019s fine. Thank you very much.","Nick Pinchuk","Yes, sure.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David MacGregor - Longbow Research","Yes, good morning everyone. Great job. Great quarter Nick.","Nick Pinchuk","Thanks.","David MacGregor - Longbow Research","Yes, outstanding.","Nick Pinchuk","We did a great job.","David MacGregor - Longbow Research","Yes, everybody really pulled together and it really shows. I guess I had similar questions about franchisee productivity for next year and you\u2019ve had the Rock N Roll cab Express and TechKnow vans. ","Clearly financing opportunities have been a facilitator to some degree and of course you\u2019ve had a very strong new product introduction queue. Are there other things driving franchisee productivity into 2015 and maybe can you talk specifically about the extent to which financing opportunities are enhancing franchisee productivity. You talked about it at the conference. There was a strong\u2026","Nick Pinchuk","Sure. I mean I can talk about this a little bit. The thing is there\u2019s a number of things. I think first is just general productivity. We\u2019ve got the Rock N Roll van, the TechKnow Express and what they are doing is they are amplifying the power of the space, that\u2019s the van. The van after all is rolling retail space and TechKnow Express and the Rock N Roll cabs are amplifying that on a time-shared basis from route to route and that\u2019s clearly allowed us to reach out for more technicians. ","You know as I said, we don\u2019t call on all the technicians. We don\u2019t have all the technicians on our sales book at one time in the United States. So we have opportunity to add more, just from those at existing basis, that\u2019s helping.","Secondly, it\u2019s a productivity issue, because our guys are real busy and so the idea doing something like RCI, just like a factory. Looking at the van like a factory, figuring how to make work easier for them, ratchet repair for example. Making the ratchet repair more easier is one thing we can do, things like that, how to bounce inventory. ","We\u2019ve just rolled out; we\u2019re rolling out and its kind of completing the roll out of a brand new point of sale computer system. We call it chrome. It\u2019s going to help the van drivers\u2019 productivity immensely and then when it comes to finance, finance is just a matter of since its now in the house, the finance programs are tailoring. The credit companies are tailoring their programs just to what the franchisee needs and therefore making it easier for him; one, from an actual point of view and an execution point of view and two, not in substantial, making it easier to understand. ","We\u2019ve done a lot of work in making these programs easier to understand. I would say four years ago you kind of needed a semi PA. You needed to be an analyst at one of the Wall Street firms or one of the investment firms to be able to understand some of these credit programs, but now it\u2019s a lot easier and so those are the kinds of things we\u2019re doing.","David MacGregor - Longbow Research","So when you talked about rolling out a line of new credit programs at the conference this year, were they just easier to understand or was it making credit more available?","Nick Pinchuk","Well, easier to understand, one; and two, making credit more available and this way we did a couple of things. One is, we refined our model so that we can think about the actual credit, the actual applicant and better decide whether it\u2019s a good risk or not a risk and want to take the credit. ","And then look at the franchisee and consider more effectively the franchisees record in choosing and recommending and collecting when making a choice around that, and putting that together in the credit profile and allowing more people to get credit, because the combination of the franchisees endorsement and the credit rating of the individual borrower, the customer made it for a more target rich environment for us, a more informative environment and therefore we were able to do a little bit more activity.","David MacGregor - Longbow Research","You are just shifting gears to maybe growth by acquisition. You\u2019re putting some great organic growth numbers. You talked about being willing to go forward and making growth by smaller acquisitions, bolt on acquisitions. Give us a sense of what you see over the next 15 days, maybe 18 months.","Nick Pinchuk","We\u2019ve got a long pipeline of possibilities and every quarter we\u2019re acting on, we\u2019re reviewing acquisitions and considering possibilities. Some of them are small, some of them are pretty large I think, but they are all what I would call coherent. ","That is, they lie on one of those four runways for growth in terms of enhancing the van channels and expanding repair shop owners and managers, understanding critical industries and other things and so we\u2019ve looked at some really big ones that would ease up a huge portion of our fire power and decided well, maybe that isn\u2019t for us or it isn\u2019t quite \u2013 its only got a very \u2013 not enough of the business fits us and we\u2019ve looked at some smaller ones like Pro-Cut and so on and we pulled the trigger, but we\u2019re looking at them actively all the time. The pipeline, the prospects are fairly large though and it continues to refresh.","David MacGregor - Longbow Research","I was just going to say, can you remind us on your priorities. Is there a particular segment your leaning towards or does it \u2013 what should we think about\u2026?","Nick Pinchuk","No, the priorities are any of those runways for growth, but as a practical matter, as a practical matter, expanding repair shop owners and managers, giving us something more to sell like Pro-Cut brake lathes or a Challenger Lifts is something that is high priority. Giving us something that would give us more to sell or give us more presence with critical industries is another area that we\u2019d be looking at.","Now we would consider emerging markets with the vans, but I think the acquisition targets are less. There\u2019s less available in those areas that fit so coherently in those places.","David MacGregor - Longbow Research","Last question is just, across your three segments, where do you still have the most immediate opportunity for RCI?","Nick Pinchuk","I\u2019d say C&I, but C&I had an encouraging quarter, 13.7% OI margin. That is the highest OI margin ever by C&I and the last \u2013 we only hit when its high, the highest OI margin and we hit it in the second quarter of 2008. It was on considerably more sales. I think $20 million or $30 million more sales. ","So in fact C&I has made a lot of progress and we see more opportunity going for it, but I hate to say that, because to tell you the truth, I think there is ample opportunity in all our businesses. Like I said many times, if we never got another dollar of incremental sales, we would drive the profitability upwards.","David MacGregor - Longbow Research","Great. Thanks very much. ","Operator","And we will take our next question from Liam Burke with Wunderlich Securities. ","Liam Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc. ","Thank you. Good morning Nick. Good morning Aldo. ","Nick Pinchuk","Good morning. ","Aldo Pagliari","Good morning. ","Liam Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc. ","Nick, could you give us a sense as with innovation being a big driver of growth, how the pace of hot products have been this year.","Nick Pinchuk","Well yes, sure. I hate to, I don\u2019t like to pin myself down, but we are ahead of last year. Last year was a record. I hesitate to say a record, because it was as high as is more than we\u2019ve seen since we\u2019ve been measuring our hit parade products, which by definition, our definition is a product which sells $1 million in the first year after launch. And you might remember that I said last year we hit a level that was lets say between four and five times what we had just in 2006 and we are ahead of last years pace as of now. ","Now, of course you got to launch it, its got to sell a $1 million, so who knows. I think there\u2019s some great products in the pipeline, but whether the customers are going to like it or not, I\u2019m not sure. Sometimes I\u2019m not simpatico with the customers, but fortunately the guys who launched the product and design are, so I have confidence that we are ahead. ","Liam Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc. ","Okay and on the diagnostics, you spoke a lot about the system sales, both the OEMs and the Independent Services. How have handheld diagnostics been selling to the technicians, the service technicians?","Nick Pinchuk","They\u2019ve been strong. We\u2019ve had a good strong year in diagnostics. We just launched a new product, which is rolling out on our service line. It\u2019s got some great new features, faster and having perform more capabilities, bigger screen. It\u2019s incredibly profitability and its incredibly popular, sorry, incredibly popular, and so I am positive about that. ","Diagnostics is the movement of \u2013 people can relate to the RS&I business because you see the information. You can see the technology and the products. But one thing I want to offer is, when you are talking about critical industries, you are talking about some \u2013 in the C&I side you are talking about some fairly sophisticated items. ","I was just down at an aerospace facility, at an aircraft manufacturing and repair facility and I was talking to customers, speaking to customers, because that\u2019s where it\u2019s expanding. I talked to one young technician there, who started to take about low frequency ebbing current; an assessment of structural damage or structural weakness in airplane fuselage. ","He is one of our customers using our tools and he is talking with great authority about this kind of technology or another different guys talking about magnetic residence to determine weaknesses in the fuselage. So even on an RS&I side, I mean even on the C&I side, in critical industries, you are seeing a tremendous deployment of technology in criticality that gives us opportunity to innovate around that. ","Liam Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc. ","Great. Thank you, Nick. ","Nick Pinchuk","Sure.","Operator","And we will go next to Richard Hilgert with Morningstar. ","Richard Hilgert - Morningstar ","Thanks and good morning everybody, good quarter. ","Nick Pinchuk","Thanks.","Aldo Pagliari","Good morning Richard. ","Richard Hilgert \u2013 Morningstar","Most of my questions have already been asked, but wanted to visit a little bit about the different between margin expansion from RCI during the quarter versus the improvement that we saw in volume and in areas like the military and over in Europe and especially Europe C&I and in the hand tools side. Can you differentiate there or give us some kind of an idea of what the degree is of margin improvement from both of those. ","Nick Pinchuk","I kind of resist doing that. If you look at our numbers over time, I kind of view it like this. I kind of view volume leverage and productivity at flat volume as horns on the same goat. You basically get higher sales and you do it with the same people who are slightly less, and it drops through with a great rate, that\u2019s RCI, because you fundamentally enable your people to do more with the same. ","Then now other people might call that leverage, but we can consider that RCI if we see reasonable drop through. And the same kind of thing, its sort of the same version, if the sales are flat and we are able to reduce cost, like spend less or maybe use less, do the same kind of support to the tools group, but do it with less cost, let fright for example, less fright cost or less material cost or less design cost, those kinds of things are a positive at flat sales. ","But we try not to differentiate them. We try to put them together and not worry about the difference. Our only view is we will go up every quarter, not every quarter, we will go up in a trend continuously and we believe in that trend of improved profitability, whether there is increased sales or not. Increased sales, it contributes to it, but we believe it will go up even if we don\u2019t have increased sales. But I can parse between the two styles, because I think they intermingle and support each other. ","Richard Hilgert \u2013 Morningstar","But obviously breakeven has improved bottom line and I look at what EBITDA was five years ago versus where you are at today. We are looking at a 900 basis points improvement from the bottom. So any idea, can you give us some kind of an idea of magnitude on \u2013 has the breakeven improved maybe 100, 200 basis points in your opinion? ","Nick Pinchuk","You know I again resist it. I don\u2019t think of it in those terms. I really don\u2019t think of it in those terms. I think of it in the terms that I just \u2013 I and the Snap-on team think of it in these terms. We don\u2019t necessarily look back so much. ","We look forward and say \u2013 and not that we don\u2019t know where we\u2019ve come, but we say to ourselves, look, our task. We sit her now. Our task is to improve next year, improve going forward, and we find components of that and we have programs which will generate savings associated with things like design, cost reduction for products, less material. Maybe a little bit less expensive way to do the same thing with somewhat more quality, we\u2019ll do that or we\u2019ll find ways to enable people on the line to be able to do more. ","For example, we will \u2013 I\u2019ve done this myself. We work in a factory and bring down setup times and that will allow more throughput to the factory and more changeovers in the factors, so therefore more throughput and I can do more volume with the same people. ","And so we don\u2019t \u2013 and we have a myriad of projects in both those areas, some of them work really well, some of them don\u2019t, but I don\u2019t think we worry ourselves so much about which ones contributed to us. More or less we think about what\u2019s the total result at the end. That\u2019s what\u2019s worked for us for 900 basis points. ","Richard Hilgert \u2013 Morningstar","Okay.

We have on the call today, Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Finance Officer.","Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance.

After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.","As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion.

Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.","With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. I'll start this call with some highlights of our second quarter. I'll speak about the general environment and about the trends we see, and I'll take you through some of the progress we've made. Then, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.","Our second quarter results were encouraging. We believe they once again offer strong evidence of clear Snap-on advancements along our runways for both growth and for improvement. Organic sales were up 8.4% from last year. The operating margin expanded by 100 basis points. And earnings per share, they reached $2.03, up 12.8% compared with the $1.80 reported last year.","Our reported sales increase was 3.1%. That total includes the continuing weight of unfavorable foreign currency translations this quarter, an impact of $43.4 million. Including the incremental $2.8 million from last year's Pro-Cut acquisition, our total reported sales for the period \u2013 our sales for the period were $851.8 million.","The opco operating margin reached 17.7%, up from 16.7% in 2014; and as I said, representing 100 basis points increase, more than offsetting the 40 basis point impact on profit from unfavorable currency.","Financial Services operating income grew to $41.4 million from last year's $34.8 million, driving our consolidating operating margins, financial services plus opco to 21.1%, higher by 140 basis points. It wasn't our encouraging quarter.","From an overall macro perspective, we believe the conditions remain favorable for our businesses serving automotive repair customers, the businesses like the Tools Group and the Repair Systems & Information, our RS&I Group.","In the second quarter, the Tools Group organic activity increased 11.2%. The tailwinds of changing vehicle technology and the ageing of the fleet continue to provide opportunity. And the rising strength of our van network and our robust continuing line of new products, they enabled Snap-on to take greater advantage of those tailwinds and clear \u2013 and it's clearly evidenced in the numbers.","In RS&I, they had organic gains of 3.3%, led by higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, increased sales to OEM dealerships, and higher sales of undercar equipment; all serving to offset the particular challenges in Russia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, where that Group had made particular progress in prior periods.","For the Commercial & Industrial, C&I, there are also continued signs of advancement. Organic sales up 11.2% in the quarter. And for C&I, along our runways for growth, we saw important and clear headway; headway in our efforts to extend into critical industries, in our European business, and in several emerging markets. That progress was one against pockets of turbulence in geographies like Europe where the uncertainty of Greece looms; in places like Japan, where recovery is sporadic; and in the U.S. military. U.S. military has been a somewhat unpredictable sector. Well, in the second quarter, U.S. military activity experience for Snap-on, another strong period, up double-digits from last year.","However, we do remain cautious on the military business there. This is a period of uncertainty. Changing deployments and budget pressure, make it difficult to predict the future trajectory of that business with any confidence. But having said that, having said that, we believe we're well positioned in the military sector to make the most of any available opportunities, any available openings. Overall, the C&I results are quite positive. The opportunity is definitely outweighing the challenges and the results they confirm it.","More broadly, for the whole operation, for the whole of Snap-on. The operating income gains across the corporation clearly demonstrate the leverage and the power of the Snap-on value creation processes. Safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, they all drive our improvement every day; and they help to offer 100 basis point gain in the quarter, overcoming the significant challenges.","Now, let's highlight some of the advancements in growth and in improvement demonstrated by the individual groups. We'll start with C&I. As I just said, an 11.2% organic sales gain, and that follows a 9.8% organic sales gain in the first quarter. C&I's operating income margin was 14.3%, up 100 basis points, both the higher volume and the benefits of Snap-on value creation drove that raise. And there were some very positive volume gains.","SNA Europe registered its seventh straight quarter of year-over-year growth, a promising trend, outperforming the storm clouds that occupied the headlines of Europe. The industrial division saw particularly strong activity in the aviation sector, a key area of our focus in extending to critical industries. Some of those aerospace gains can be attributed to our growing line of innovative new products specifically aimed at that industry, products like our new array of aircraft tire gauges and inflators. When it comes to aircraft tires and struts, proper measurement and inflation are key for safe takeoffs and landing as well as for breaking predictability and effectiveness. We talk about critical industries, those sound kind of critical for people who travel.","Raising the bar in that arena our new line of 300 PSI analog and digital tire gauges offer improved accuracy. Our approval for hazardous environments incorporate a reflective glow dial or a backlit display. It makes \u2013 they make the technicians' work more effective, safer and easier meeting all type of challenges in all types of conditions. Also in the quarter and aimed right at aviation, we introduced the new Snap-on Electro Static Discharge-Safe Precision Pliers.","They're designed for use on static-sensitive components in circuitry, with a specifically designed handle to dissipate electricity, improved squeezing torque control and a low profile design for greater accessibility than the standard pliers, all features that are valued by professionals, performing those critical aviation tasks.","The 300 PSI tire gauges and static discharge safe pliers, innovative new product, adding to our growing aerospace offering and clearly demonstrating our efforts to roll the Snap-on brand out of the garage to extend into critical industries like aviation. And the second quarter results, they confirm that it's working.","Now, let's speak about SNA Europe. Our European hand tool \u2013 our European-based hand tool business. SNA Europe, broad organic growth and gains in the period, up mid single-digits, growth in Spain, United Kingdom and in the Nordic region. And besides that volume rise, SNA Europe continued its trajectory of operating margin improving, leveraging the additional sales, but also realizing the benefits of RCI and Snap-on value creation against a backdrop of substantial Euroland turbulence.","SNA Europe, sales up for the seventh straight quarter, but once again, profits up more. And we're also continuing to build in emerging markets. Asia-Pacific was another contributor to C&I growth. Activity up in relatively uneven markets like Korea and Indonesia. C&I did have an encouraging quarter, but we know there's still more opportunity; opportunity to continue building on the momentum generated by our European operations, to strengthen our position within emerging markets, and to proceed forward down our runways of critical industries extending to even more customers.","Now, let's move to the Tools Group. Sales were up 11.2% organically with double-digit gains in the U.S. and internationally. Operating margin, up 17.1%, up 70 basis points versus the 16.4% recorded last year and overcoming within the quarter 120 basis points of unfavorable currency impact.","That 70 basis point improvement brings our Tools Group OI margin to new levels, and that margin performance clearly speaks to our improving position. And when combined with the growth this quarter, demonstrates the success we're having on this decisive runway, enhancing the franchise network. You can see it in the sales and you can see it in the overall franchise health metrics, trending positively again this quarter.","Snap-on franchisees are a committed and capable group and you're convinced of that every time you meet one of them. And we're working hard every day to support their effort through creative marketing, access to in-house customer financing with Snap-on Credit, and a growing array of innovative new products.","Products like our new ratcheting combination wrenches with an innovative design, higher strength and enhanced durability. Our new ratcheting gear design safely delivers 25% more torque and 95% longer fatigue life; innovative Snap-on technology enabling the transfer of more power in a thinner, smaller diameter wrench head helping to access and remove the most stubborn of fasteners in tight, tight spaces. The Dual 80 design with an 80 tooth ratcheting gear and dual pawls minimizes the swing arc that's needed to move fasteners.","A great enabler, a great enabler in the engine compartments of today's vehicles. And, of course, the new wrench features our unique Flank Drive wrenching system that consistently minimizes fastener damage.","Snap-on's new line of combination wrenches raises the bar for professionals in performing critical and difficult tasks. It's a winning tool line on an existing product platform, a direct result of Snap-on value creation shaped by customer connections, direct observations in the shop, and delivered by the Snap-on innovation process. It's already generating excitement in the repair shops all over this country and there's more to come.","Now, the growing strength of our van network \u2013 our rolling selling space, it's what the van network is \u2013 is evident with the increases in big ticket sales. And a considerable boost comes from our hands-on demonstration vehicles like the Rock N' Roll Cab Express vans, 66 of them, bringing a much wider range of our tool storage line-ups directly to the shop, more colors, more shapes, more options and more choices displayed across our customer base.","And if you've been listening to these calls for anytime, you've heard the story of this innovative marketing initiative, the Rock N' Roll van, expanding our van selling space. And they continue to be a significant contributor to the Tools Group.","In the quarter, big ticket sales were up strong double-digits and our demonstration vans were a big driver. But those vans weren't the only factor, big ticket gains were also propelled by new two storage products; winning offerings like our special edition 95th anniversary box, another in a long line of our customized tools storage systems. We mentioned them, I think, on the last quarter's call and they've been popular. Technicians upgrading their workspace, celebrating our milestone year, and providing clear testimony to the strength of the Snap-on brand positioned in shops all around the world.","Another key advantage for the Tools Group is our Financial Services on Snap-on Credit, strategic programs aimed at smoothing the way for those big ticket purchases. Our credit company plays an essential role in enhancing the van network, and again this quarter, it did just that. Well, that's the Tools Group, attractive new products guided by customer connection, innovation marketing and a unique credit facility, all increasing the power of the Snap-on van channel and driving sales to new levels.","Now on to RS&I, organic sales growth of $8.7 million or 3.3%. The second quarter operating margin, 24.4%, rising 120 basis points compared to last year's 23.2%. Margin expansion, another demonstration of RCI in Snap-on value creation. The organic sales gain was broad-based, the diagnostics and information businesses selling to independent repair shop owners and managers with a mid single-digit gain in volume helped by new products.","Products like the ETHOS Tech, our newest diagnostic handheld offering, aimed \u2013 is aimed at individual shop technicians and first-time diagnostic buyers. The ETHOS Tech is a full function scan tool with a quick boot-up, streamlined interface, a large color screen, and full comprehensive coverage of car makes and vehicle systems, all the features that are so important even for the entry level technician in today's environment where vehicle diagnostics are becoming essential for everyday maintenance as well as complex repair.","More technicians than ever before will be using diagnostics in almost every job and ETHOS Tech is a great way for them to get started. Also in the quarter RS&I released its latest software update for our PRO-LINK Ultra, supplying truck shops with even broader diagnostic data covering both diesel and larger gasoline engines. The PRO-LINK Ultra, it's capable of diagnosing commercial vehicles from light diesel to Class 8 heavy-duty trucks. It delivers the widest coverage ever available in \u2013 at a single handheld diagnostic tool, including data for major vehicle system. It's a great enabler for the \u2013 it's a great enabler that, I guess, quite simply provides heavy-duty technicians with the range of diagnostic information now necessary to perform their daily task. And it's becoming the choice across the heavy-duty sector.","Equipment division registered a low single digit organic sales rise, overcoming the turbulence in Eastern Europe. Some of those gains were offered by our new aligner, the V2400 launched just this period. The V2400 designed for premium OEM dealerships and for high-end wheel service shops, places that require advanced alignment techniques. It offers increased accuracy and repeatability, higher resolution cameras that produce live alignment and diagnostic data, passive lightweight front and rear targets that improve durability, and advanced dimensioning that identifies frame or structural damage or mismatched tire sizes; a regular cause of vehicle pulling or driver complaint, all of those are features that aid greatly in technician productivity. We believe we have an exceptional product in this next-generation aligner and early returns indicates that our customers are saying the same thing.","Speaking about the equipment division, May marked the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of the Pro-Cut on-car brake lathes. We're excited to have Pro-Cut as part of the team. When we put Pro-Cut advanced brake servicing product line \u2013 Pro-Cut advanced brake servicing product line together with another recent add, Challenger Lifts, it gives us more to sell to vehicle repair shop owners and managers, to customers in independent shops, national service chains, and OEM dealerships. And when packaged along with our other established RS&I products, Snap-on now offers a wider range of shop solutions than ever before.","So to wrap up RS&I, we see new diagnostics, unique truck repair information, and a growing undercar equipment offering driving positive trends, improving our position with repair shop owners and managers across the globe. Well, that's the highlight of our quarter, growth and improvement.","C&I strength at SNA Europe and emerging markets and in critical industries, expanding margins.","The Tools Group, growing double-digits again, robust sales and operating margin continuing to enhance our franchise network. RS&I, advancing its position, making gains in both independent shops and OEMs, growing operating margins by 120 basis points. And Financial Services, raising its contribution and helping provide strategic evidence of growth for out Tools Group and overall for the corporation.","Sales increasing organically by 8.4%. Opco operating income margin of 17.7%, up 100 basis points. EPS $2.03 in the quarter, 12.8% higher than the $1.80 last year. It was another encouraging quarter.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo who will take you through the financials in detail. Aldo?","Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.","Thanks, Nick. Our second quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $851.8 million in the quarter were up 8.4% organically.","On a reported basis, net sales including $43.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, increased $25.3 million or 3.1% from 2014 levels. As you know, Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Largely due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our year-over-year Q2 sales comparisons by 570 basis points.","Consolidated gross profit of $419 million increased $18.6 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to benefits from higher sales, savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects. The gross margin of 49.2% in the quarter improved 80% from 48.4% a year ago.","Operating expenses of $268.2 million increased $5.9 million largely due to higher volume-related and other expenses, including higher pension expense, partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation and savings from RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 31.5% improved 20 basis points from 31.7% last year. No restructuring costs were incurred in the second quarter of 2015. In the second quarter of last year, we incurred $1.4 million of such costs.","Pension expense in the quarter was approximately $2 million higher as compared to the prior year, mostly reflecting the impacts of lower discount rates as well as increased life expectancies. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $150.8 million in the quarter, including $12 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased 9.2% and as a percentage of sales improved 100 basis points to 17.7%.","Financial Services revenue of $58.7 million in the quarter increased 13.5% from 2014 levels, while operating earnings of $41.4 million increased 19%. The increases in both revenue and operating earnings primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio.","Consolidated operating earnings of $192.2 million in the quarter, including $12.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased $11.2 million. And the operating margin of 21.1% improved 140 basis points from 19.7% a year ago.

Finally, net earnings of $120 million or $2.03 per diluted share increased $13.9 million or $0.23 per share representing a 12.8% increase in diluted earnings per share.","Now, let's turn to our segment results. Starting with Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group on slide seven. Sales of $295.8 million in the quarter were up 11.2% organically, reflecting a high single-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries, a mid single-digit increase in the segment's European-based hand tools business, and a double-digit increases in both the segment's power tools and Asia-Pacific operations.","Gross profit in the C&I Group of $112.9 million in the quarter increased $1.1 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to the benefits of higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects. The gross margin of 38.2% decreased 70 basis points largely due to a shift to lower gross margin sales, including higher sales to the military and increased sales in our Asia-Pacific operations.","Operating expenses of $70.7 million in the quarter decreased $2.9 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by higher volume related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 23.9% improved 170 basis points, mostly due to sales volume leverage, including benefits from the previously mentioned sales shift.","As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $42.2 million, including $2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased $4 million from 2014 levels, and the operating margin of 14.3% improved 100 basis points.","Turning now to slide eight.

As of quarter end, our balance sheet includes approximately $1.47 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.27 billion from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operations. Approximately, 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. During the quarter, our worldwide finance portfolio grew approximately $63 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.","Now turning to slide 12.

At quarter end, we had $35 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.","This concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. Now, I'll turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","Thanks, Aldo. Well, that's the Snap-on results. Once again, we believe the period stands as clear testimony to the opportunities abundant along our runways for growth and for improvement. And it confirms our team's capability to keep taking full advantage despite the challenges, like unfavorable currency, turbulent economies and varying industry dynamics, we are progressing along our runways for growth.","C&I organic sales rising 11.2%; OI margin 14.3%, up 100 basis points, extended to critical industries, gains in aviation and the military, building in emerging markets. The Tools Group enhancing the van channel, wielding the network more powerfully than ever. Organic sales up 11.2%; OI margins 17.1%, a 70 basis point increase. And RS&I, organic sales up 3.3%; OI margin 24.4%, an increase of 120 basis points. And the overall corporation growing organically at 8.4%, overcoming the headwind. And we demonstrated progress down our runways for improvement. The Corporate OI margin was 17.7%, up 100 basis points more than offsetting 40 basis points of unfavorable currency impact.","Putting it all together with Financial Services' contributions, earnings per share reached $2.03, up 12.8% against the wind. Second quarter was encouraging and we believe it demonstrates again that Snap-on has the inherent advantages, the opportunities and the capabilities to advance, to resist the turbulence, to keep progressing, and to extend our positive trend of performance as we go forward.","Before I turn the call over to the operator for questions, I'll speak a moment to our franchisees and associates. As always, I know many of you are listening, please know that the encouraging results of the second quarter would not have been possible without your dedication and capability, your demonstrated skill, clear commitment, and extraordinary contribution to our team; you have my congratulations and you have my thanks.","Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll take our first question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yes. Good morning, everyone. Congratulations Nick on a great quarter.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","Thanks. Thank you.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","I guess I'm struck by the slow originations growth, up 8.9%, and what looks like divergence against a double-digit growth in big ticket. And I'm mindful that credit typically exists on the sell-through. Is it possible that your franchisees are just seeing a much higher level of inventory right now and that would have explained that divergence or maybe you could help us understand that?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","There's a lot of vintage in that. Fundamentally, there is questions of timings, there is a secondary market that comes into that, there is the questions of the how much \u2013 what are those actually sold at versus what we sell, what sales price we book versus what the van driver books. The numbers are something like this, I think they're \u2013 what were they, 8.9% this quarter?","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","And originations in 11.2%. But last quarter, they were reverse, it was 14.2% versus 12.9%. And the quarter before that it was \u2013 in other words, 14.2% was the originations and 12.9% was the Tools Group, and 7.5% (36:16) was the originations in the fourth quarter and 11.8% was the Tools Group. So they don't match up perfectly. We are unconcerned \u2013 we're not concerned about anything like that. And we don't see anything like buildup of inventory in the vans at all. This is just a matter of timing and the differences I pointed out.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And that big ticket growth, you were talking about the double-digit growth. Is there any way you can help us understand the difference between price mix growth versus volume growth?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","You mean \u2013 well, I think \u2013 look, the big ticket items are \u2013 you mean, in terms of big ticket growth itself or the effect on Tools?","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yes. No, the big ticket growth. I'm just trying to understand how much of that was from \u2013 I'm presuming you're talking about revenue growth and I'm just wondering how much of that...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","Yeah, yeah. No, if you're talking about revenue growth. Generally, big ticket prices are \u2013 when we're talking about \u2013 when I talk about big ticket growth, I'm talking about what the big ticket items were a year ago, and they've grown actually at double-digits, a little faster than the Tools Group. And, in fact, that's, I would say, apples-to-apples in terms of pricing. So it's pretty much volume growth in that situation.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Volume growth. Okay. And then last question, just \u2013 there's been a lot of talk about competition within the diagnostic space and there's been a lot of evolution lately in terms of how people are going to market the value prop and how it's packaged. Are you feeling the increased presence of competitive product in the market? That might explain the lower organic growth rates in RS&I or how should we think about that?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","I don't think so. I mean, first of all, it's one quarter; that's one thing. And that can be moved up and down. But the diagnostics and information business \u2013 the sale of diagnostics and our information products into independent repair shops, which is the space we're talking about, was up fairly strongly in the quarter. I think we said high single digits. So \u2013 mid-single digits. So that was a little bit better than RS&I. And then second thing is, I would offer that \u2013 I was just on these Rock N' Roll \u2013 I was on one of these techno vans recently. And the van driver told me, he said, we're not associated \u2013 we're not worried about competition, our biggest competition is the difficulty in getting to a technician and explaining to him the product, getting him to appreciate the value of our business. He didn't cite any competitors at all. In fact, I never see \u2013 I was just with 1,200 customers over the weekend and that \u2013 10 days ago, and they were talking about this product and basically they talked about the idea that it was better than anything else we had \u2013 better than anything else we had brought out.","Secondly \u2013 I mean, thirdly, I would suppose that when you \u2013 when we survey independent technicians, when we ask them what's your preferred form of diagnostic, it's still overwhelmingly Snap-on. I think the numbers, the latest numbers we have are 60 for Snap-on, 11 for number two. So you see all those. Now, if you come back to RS&I, I suppose your question was RS&I; I personally think, we were encouraged by the RS&I growth because of the equipment business, which tends to get dinged because of Eastern Europe.","So ironically, equipment business was \u2013 grew, I think Aldo said, low single-digits. So it's somewhat of a drag from a volume point of view, but from a margin point of view, because in my remarks, I talked about that new aligner, the V2400, hey, that's a great product and it's selling very well and it's a great margin generator for us.","So what you saw from an equipment business actually was a little bit of drag on RS&I revenues, but a boost on RS&I margins, because of the aligner business, because it helps you understand RS&I a little bit more.","But we don't see, actually we don't see, at least in my interactions from the market. So logically or at least in talking to market we don't see much pressure and then empirically, we don't see it in our numbers as pressure either.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Is there any way you can size for us the size of the Eastern European undercar business as a percentage?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","I don't think I want to get into that granularity, but...","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Sure.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","...but I can just say that that business is bigger for equipment -bigger than for equipment than anybody else, because \u2013 and it becomes a historical thing. We made better inroads in Eastern Europe and the Middle East than almost any of our other businesses. And so it has been particularly impacted by this particular downturn and in this particular set of economic dynamics. Now, we have other \u2013 we're not mourning or wringing our hands over that, but when you start slicing the corporation down into pieces, that you start to see it a little bit more like it comes out in RS&I.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thanks very much. Great quarter.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Leiker with Baird.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. This is Joe Vruwink for David.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","Hi, Joe.","Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.","Hello, Joe.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Sticking with diagnostics, Nick, when you originally started throwing out a gross target for that segment and thinking it would grow kind of near to 5% rate. I believe the strategy at that time was to sell a diagnostics unit to a repair shop, and now you're talking about selling diagnostics units to each technician within that shop. And so how might that change maybe the longer-term growth profile for the business knowing the evolution of that strategy?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","Well, first of all, I'm not abandoning the idea we're selling for the shops. I think we still have a lot of runway in terms of, what I would call, the downtown diagnostics, the things that will stand up and tell your fortune, the higher level ones that a shop would buy and might have one or two of them in the shop. We still have a lot of runway in that area, so \u2013 and it's a very important product line for us. And, in fact, we feel pretty positive about the possibilities and the opportunity for that opportunity, but I think what you say is very true.","We now know that more and more of the repair activities in a shop are going to require diagnostics. I think I said possibly on the last call that roughly 40% of repairs require diagnostics today, and the new cars 80% of the repair. So you can see how that's going to go as new cars roll into the marketplace. And so maintenance techs as opposed to the repair techs, guys who do oil changes and battery changes, and just tune up the cars are going to have to use diagnostics to do these kinds of things to reset some of the parameters that they start with, that they change when they make these changes. And so we'll be looking to sell diagnostics, those things. That's the purpose of the ETHOS Tech.","So you would expect that that would add a boost to that. But I would still say, I would still say \u2013 let's not talk of 4% to 6%, I would still say that if you look at the long-term sort of over the horizon opportunities for our businesses, I would rank C&I with the critical industries and the emerging markets as the highest growth opportunity. It's got unbounded opportunity.","If you look at \u2013 I would say, this particular one sits in the middle. And then the Tools Group, we've been able to wield that model better and better reach more technicians, but at the end of the day, it is bounded. So I'd put them in those pieces. Now maybe you might (43:58) between the 4% to 6% number, but I \u2013 for our overall business, but I still see RS&I in that middle, in middle.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And I probably won't get you to update the range itself today. So I guess I can move on to my next question.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","Really, what I'm saying \u2013 let me just try to clarify. When I said 4% to 6%, I meant generally we can grow at that level. If you want to look at the Tools Group, we said it'd be at the bottom. We can grow at that level, roughly double GDP, without necessarily coming up with things that would make our models more powerful. We could capture more customers, we could add more \u2013 no accelerators. Now, you see what happened in the Tools Group, we got accelerators on top of that breaking through the barriers of space and time.","I was just on a techno \u2013 I just said I was on a techno van, we talked about that. We always \u2013 we always thought about that, well, it saves time. And what it does is both the Rock N' Roll cab and the techno van save time for the franchisees, because when the franchisee rides in parallel with these vans a couple times a year, it's like a training seminar. Because the guy who's running the van is an incredible salesman, and it saves our franchisee from going to a training center \u2013 seminar to learn how to sell tool storage or to learn how to sell diagnostics. And that's one of the reasons why the sales are up, we not only added to the retail space, but we also boosted the capabilities of our franchisees. That's why same-store sales have been up greater than 6% 20 of the last 21 quarters, that's the kind of effect. So I think if we keep discovering ways to do that, we'll beat that 4% to 6%.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Sure. Now, that's great color. Shifting gears a little bit, what's your experience around China before Snap-on and while at Snap-on? Is there anything going on in that region that gives you pause or areas of concern that you might be seeing just given your experience there?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","Look, China is \u2013 I would see China through Tiananmen. you got to remember. So I was there when \u2013 I remember going to the hotel, The Shanghai Hilton and I stayed there three days, I never saw another guest. And three months before that, it was like going to the gold rush. So you see a lot of variations in China, I think this is quite normal. You're seeing some variation, but nothing that would affect my view of the long-term trajectory. I see opportunities for us. The repair ways will rise, we will take advantage of it. The shape of that advantage, we have to figure out going forward; that's really our situation.","Of course, Asia is now \u2013 I think it's correct and popular to say that Asia is varying and it is. You see variations in India, Modi isn't catching on quite a bit. You see Indonesia coming back actually. Japan is actually getting a little better. We had a pretty good \u2013 we had a reasonable quarter in Japan. Korea came back, even though MERS has given us some problem, we had a good quarter in Korea. So you have variations, but nothing that interdicts the long-term view. And I spend six weeks a year there.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And nothing \u2013 if the long-term in China is so positive, what about more the near-term, any risks or volatility?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","Well, yeah \u2013 sure, there's volatility, but we're not looking for a meltdown, that kind of thing, there's volatility. There is volatility in China of course. We have good \u2013 we have great quarters, we have medium quarters, those kinds of things. Our Asia-Pacific business, as Aldo said, they grew double-digits in a quarter. Okay?","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Liam Burke with Wunderlich.","Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, Nick. Good morning, Aldo.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","Morning, Liam.","Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.","Morning.","Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Nick, I'm sorry, I'd like to stay on Asia-Pacific for a moment. You have had a fair amount of upfront investment there. It seems like you're getting growth. But in generally, directionally, are the margins you're getting out of the region or the direction of the trends, are they on track with expectations?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","Sure. Actually, we have no worry about, I think, the margins in that regard. I mean, it's the geography, it's the P&L geography. I think, you saw in Aldo's discussion again on C&I how \u2013 I think, gross margins were down 70 basis points and we made it up on SG&A, well it was SG&A up 170 basis points. And what's \u2013 the principle component of that was the geography of certain big players, and Asia-Pacific is one of them, lower gross margin, lower SG&A, but OI margin kind of on track for what we like to do, if you adjust for that forward investment. So we feel okay about that. I think we continue to be confident in that regard.","Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Okay. And staying with C&I, you mentioned power tools as being a driver of growth. Typically that's \u2013 is that unique to the quarter or is there something going on in the market where you're getting a step-up in demand there?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","I don't think it's anything in the market, I think it's \u2013 look \u2013 I think \u2013 actually, I think we hit a bonanza this quarter and you know what we did? We actually took power tools and garbed them in the 95th anniversary colors. And remember me talking about the box, how people like, signed up for this $10,000 box to put, in effect, a shrine to our corporation in the workplace. Well, if you offer it to them at a couple hundred dollars, they're even more enthusiastic.","So part of what we're seeing there is this kind of push. We put the \u2013 our half inch pneumatic impact, which is a popular product, but we garbed it in the 95th anniversary or the cordless ratchet or our air hammers, things like that, or our cordless impact, and those have become popular. I don't think it's a special demand thing. I think power tools are kind of people \u2013 they wear out, people buy them periodically and it's like a new car, you show up with a new color and especially 95th anniversary colors for Snap-on is a collector item and it's a particularly compelling color. And so they like that.","Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Thank you, Nick.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","That's what's driving it.","Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll go next to Tom Hayes with Northcoast Research.","Tom L. Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning gentlemen.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","Hi, Tom.","Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.","Morning, Tom.","Tom L. Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Hey. Just wondering \u2013 staying on the C&I Group for a little bit, you called out, Nick, aviation and military doing well. I was just wondering if there's any segments that were lagging your expectations. And then just...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","Yeah...","Tom L. Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","...maybe just kind of a follow-up is, just kind of reset where you have the larger international exposure in the C&I Group?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","Sure. We had a good quarter \u2013 this happens every quarter. We have variations because we have six or seven critical industries in that area. This quarter, we happen to have a good \u2013 we had good progress in aviation, heavy duty \u2013 the heavy duty sector was strong for us, railroads were strong, oil and gas was weak. I think \u2013 but actually, I'm not so sure, last time it was up against the wind. And I think, for us, we're just starting to penetrate these areas. So they're not so driven by the economics as they are, when you're just starting to penetrate, you can get quite a variation from quarter to quarter, that's the kind of thing we saw.","We saw some flatness in things like mining, stuff like that. But, generally, that's the \u2013 military was up double-digits. We kind of expect C&I to keep \u2013 the idea of extending to critical industries to keep going, to keep moving.","Now, I don't say it happens every quarter. I mean, this is a great example. I mean, I say every second quarter that we feel very good from a C&I \u2013 we feel very good right now about our Commercial & Industrial trajectory, we feel very good about our Tools trajectory, we feel very good about our software and diagnostics trajectory. But that's the trajectory \u2013 and without giving \u2013 I'm not warning anything or saying anything about \u2013 third quarter's always squirrely. I mean we have vacations in the third quarter and so on.","So you can't tell what sectors will be going in and out, because we have our franchisees going on vacations sometimes usually in the third quarter, Europe is on vacation. So it's hard for me to predict it for every quarter. But I can tell you, we feel very encouraged by the trajectory. And I'm not in any way trying to say that we're going to have a tepid third quarter or anything like that.","Tom L. Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay, great. And then just following up on the Tools Group, certainly there's a nice step up in operating margin both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Being relatively new to the story, I was just wondering if there is anything unique in the quarter kind of one time that moved it up or does it just reflect continued strong growth in the RCI and maybe new tool roll outs?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","Yeah, it's all of those. Look, I think what's happened in the Tools Group is in the quarter \u2013 as you know, we focus on quarters, but the limited information \u2013 the limited indication of what's going on in the Tools Group though has been doing this for some time now. Like I said, the numbers are something like this, what, 11.2% this quarter organically, 12.9% the quarter before that, 11.8% the quarter before that, 6.2% the quarter before that, 6.6% the quarter before.","So they're kind of \u2013 they've been growing at 6% plus for, as I said, 20 of the last 22 quarters in effect almost defying GDP gravity. And so they're learning, they've learned. This management team has been in a while. They're learning how to wield this capable, tremendous model even better, things like the Rock N' Roll cab, the TechKnow Express, learning what products, learning the power of garbing the power tools into the 95th anniversary, figuring out how to do that, figuring out how to do \u2013 that's the things that are occurring. And that when you marry it up with RCI, that allows you to do these things more effectively, allows you to drive profitability upwards as well as volume.","One other thing is that \u2013 I think I've said this is that \u2013 one of the things that works for us, kind of a tailwind in a way is that we're a company that has complex product offerings, 65,000 SKUs and we keep turning out more, because we try to solve everybody's \u2013 we try to solve a wide array of problems well the idea of modern technology, 3D printing, finite element analysis, X-ray diffractometers that allows you to look more accurately at the metallurgy, the kinds of things we get out of \u2013 more accurately getting the information out of customer connection into the mark \u2013 into our innovation process; those kind of things accrue with amplified advantage to somebody who has a complex product line, you're seeing some of that.","Tom L. Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.","Hey, Gary.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","Good morning, Gary.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Good morning. A couple of quick questions. Your emerging markets business, Nick, I don't think I either quoted or you said it, but what was the growth there? And what's the percentage of sales now out of emerging markets?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","It's 10%. And the growth was \u2013 well, it depends if you talk about Eastern Europe as emerging markets, right. Eastern Europe.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Right.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","Right. Okay, so I mean. Yeah, okay, if you want to roll that in, it ain't so good but the thing is Asia-Pacific grew double-digits. So you can look at it that way. I think \u2013 we actually have some businesses that weren't so bad in Eastern Europe, but, generally, it was an element of pain this period. And I \u2013 so I think you could call that an offset. Asia, okay. Asia, okay. Middle East, if you want to call that emerging market, that was kind of weak. South America was okay, Chile was up, Argentina was up. So you kind of got a balance there, a cocktail of things.","So let me just summarize. Asia-Pacific double-digits. I think South America, the South \u2013 the Latin American countries, the bigger ones for us were up more \u2013 kind of double-digity type stuff. Eastern Europe tough, down. And Middle East, down. So that's where we are. And you roll it all up, when you classify something reasonably, a rational man would classify as emerging markets 10% of our business.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you. And then, you \u2013 at times in the past you've talked that you try and do 40 plus products, new product introductions that generate over $1 million of sales. It just appears to be, from the last couple of calls that that number has increased. And could you comment on that?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","Actually \u2013 go ahead, sorry.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","No, I was just going to add. I would assume that as newer cars proliferate, that is going to dictate to you \u2013 your company as to what new products you're going to come out with as the car part (57:39)?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","I agree. You're right. Actually, I agree. I think we have great opportunities. And the thing I've said is, the way we measure the effectiveness of our innovation process, one of the measures is the number of hit products, $1 million sellers in the first year of after first year of being on the market. And I think you and I have been in this conservation that we were four, five \u2013 in the last couple of years, we were four times, five times what we were just in 2006 and we keep pushing that envelop.","It's not so much \u2013 I think we're getting better at doing that. It's not so much a number counting game it's getting better and they're having more impact and they're driving more sales and they're doing better things.","Like \u2013 just like, I'll tell you what, it sounds like not so important. But the idea of the combo ratcheting wrench that will have a low profile, 25% more \u2013 25% more strength, 95% more life, will get in smaller spaces, that one is going to be a great product for us, and people are so excited about it. People are saying that's the kind of thing we're \u2013 so I think we're not only bringing out a lot of them, bringing out better ones, because the whole product development process, we're more effective at it.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Thank you, Nick.","Nicholas T.

Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.","Good morning, Richard.","Richard John Hilgert - Morningstar Research","Just curious about \u2013 on the new product development side, we're seeing more and more penetration of things that are related to active safety and autonomous driving or assisted-driving automated systems, these kinds of things.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","We love it.","Richard John Hilgert - Morningstar Research","Yeah. I was just going to ask, are you already preparing for these kinds of things...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","Yeah, we love that.","Richard John Hilgert - Morningstar Research","...like what you're hearing from customers?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.","Sure. Because we love this thing. I mean, if you think about it, okay, autonomous driving. The thing is that \u2013 if they go to autonomous driving, there used to be an incredibly \u2013 before autonomous driving, there would be an incredibly complex computer system for any imprecisions on the car, that was called the human brain. Think about alignment for example, if the car was a little bit out of alignment, you could adjust the wheel a little bit. Now, if you have autonomous driving, let's say automatic parking, you better not be out of alignment, you're going to hit the parking meter.","And so that's going to require many more procedures and more precise procedures and we're the company to give it to you. So we love those kinds of actions. And so we're thinking about it, particularly around anything around calibration very much helps you. And that's sort of the equipment business \u2013 that's why we're so excited about the new V2400 aligner, because it's kind of a downtown aligner which creates more accuracy and therefore fits right into this.","Richard John Hilgert - Morningstar Research","Okay.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Leslie H. Kratcoski","Thanks, Rica, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's second quarter 2012 results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick-off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.","As usual, we have provided slides to supplement our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on our website next to the audio icon for this call. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript of today's call. Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.","Finally, today's discussion and presentation include reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude an $18 million arbitration settlement gain recorded in the second quarter of last year. Please refer to our earnings release issued this morning and to the slides accompanying this webcast for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to those most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.","With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. As we normally do on these calls, I'll begin with some of the highlights of our second quarter and I'll provide my perspective on the business and on the various markets in which we operate. Then I'll turn the call over to Aldo for a detailed review of the financials.","I will say that we were encouraged by the results. EPS of $1.30 represents a rise of 14% from last year's comparable $1.14. Organic sales were up 4.5% despite the clear headwinds of Europe. The OpCo operating margin of 14.2% increased 60 basis points, overcoming an $8.3 million in higher restructuring charges. And Financial Services added $25.6 million in operating earnings, up from a comparable $17.5 million in 2011.","I'll remind you that in the second quarter of last year, we resolved the dispute with our former Financial Services joint venture partner and recorded at that time a one-time $18 million pretax arbitration settlement gain. That settlement was worth $0.19 a share. And given the nature of the item, I've excluded it, as we believe it's appropriate from the FinCo earnings and the EPS comparisons I just referenced.","On balance though, the quarter was another positive point, extending an encouraging growth trend. That continuing trend demonstrates significant progress along our clearly defined runways for growth. Extending into critical industries, building in emerging markets, enhancing the franchise network and expanding in vehicle repair shops.","And the operating margin expansion is a reflection of our Snap-on Value Creation Processes at work. As I said before, these are a crucial set of principles that we apply every day. A focus on safety, on quality, customer connection, Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI and on innovation. It's a powerful framework and it is helping to fuel our results. I mentioned that the OpCo operating margin expanded by 60 basis points from last year, but I'll also point out that this year's restructuring charge in the second quarter included $6.8 million for the settlement of a pension plan related to our Canadian tools storage facility, which we closed last year. But for that item, the margin expansion would have been 150 basis points. That increased profitability is a strong testimony that the positive contributions of Snap-on value creation.","Now regarding sales growth. The numbers appeared to validate that we are building advantage in each of the 4 areas we've identified as being decisive for our future. Critical industries where the penalty for failure is high. Another double-digit gain for our industrial division, with the growth rate in the aerospace sector leading the way.","Emerging markets. In addition to strong double-digit gains in China, as you probably would expect, we also saw a particularly large uplifts in places like Indonesia and Russia.","The franchise channel what we call auto mechanics or auto technicians, volume is up 10% in the quarter with strong operating margin.","And finally, in vehicle repair shops, we saw growth in categories that are quite important to those shop owners and managers. Sales in the RS&I business that provide diagnostic units, repair information and shop management systems were up high single digits.","So we're clearly progressing along each of our runways for growth. That said, Europe remains a major headwind, no surprise to anybody I guess. The macro -- and the macroeconomic environment in Europe -- but the macroeconomic environment in Europe is muting the progress being achieved in other arenas.","As in the first quarter, the mature markets in Europe were down from last year, but we're somewhat encouraged that despite the general news, the comparison hasn't gotten any worse since the last quarter. Overall, Europe remains a mixed story. The core mature markets are down similar to last quarter and the emerging east, especially Russia, continues to expand robustly. It helps to offset the larger declines in the South. So Europe remains a challenge. But for us, it's been that way for some time and on balance we've been able to navigate the turbulence and register encouraging results overall.","Now let's have some of the highlights for each of the segments. The C&I group. The C&I group grew organically by 5.1%. This is a group of businesses where we have much of our focus on emerging markets and on serving customers in critical industries, and there was strong progress in each of those runways. Our Asian operation and our industrial division, the bellwether of our critical industry activity, both registered double-digit increases versus last year. But the C&I group besides being the home of our critical industries and our emerging market efforts is also the home of SNA Europe and the ongoing challenges of that particular geography. That means the overall C&I growth was achieved while more than offsetting -- that growth was achieved by more than offsetting the turbulence of Europe.","Now the operating margin in the C&I segment was 11.6%, up from 10.4% last year. And this year's results at 11.6%, includes $3.2 million in restructuring, substantially greater than the $0.5 million we spent last year. Given that C&I is where we have our largest European footprint, the results are encouraging. The Snap-on Value Creation Processes are driving improvements and our growth runways are yielding results.","In the industrial division, the critical industry center, we have solid gains in serving natural resource customers.","We also had strong growth in aerospace and aviation. It was a highlight of the quarter. So I'll offer some color on that sector. Aviation certainly fits the definition of a critical industry. And in that way, our automated net area -- our Automated Tool Control unit, ATC, continues to be an important product that raises -- that has raised Snap-on's profile. Each quarter, this high-tech package, which improves productivity, along with asset control, is showing up on more flightlines. We're seeing it in more repair maintenance and overhaul operations and in more aircraft mechanic training facilities. Coupled with our expanding tool offering, we're filling those smart boxes with a wide array of Snap-on products and fueling industrial division growth.","Another example of focus on aviation customers is during the quarter, we began serving with far greater intensity, the airline maintenances -- the largest airline maintenance facility in the United States. A location that employs over 4,000 technicians. They wanted Snap-on there full-time, and we accommodated. So focus, product and presence. We're expanding each in the critical industries and it's paying off.","One final note on aviation. It's an area that's importantly driving international expansion for Snap-on, helping to offset some of the European impacts. In fact, our international rise in the industrial division actually outpaced the growth in the U.S. More and more, we're selling expanded toolkits around the globe to airlines, to aircraft manufacturers and in support of military F15 and F35 fighter fleets.","Now speaking of international expansion in Asia, our new Undercar products, designed specifically for customers in that region, help drive the double-digit growth of our Asia-Pacific operation. This high visibility, high-value product category is particularly important in emerging markets. And in both India and China, we saw growth rates for our undercar equipment that substantially exceeded our overall growth rates for those countries. As the repair wave rises in Asia, we were particularly well-positioned and aligner sales are a testimony to that effect.","Moving to the Tools Group. Volumes were up strongly in the second quarter, rising 10% above last year's level. The operating margin of 13.7% compares to 15.5% last year. Now remember, this year's results do include $6.8 million of restructuring charges for the pension settlement related to last year's facilities closure. Without that charge, the margin this year would have been 15.8%. I believe that these overall numbers speak to the absolute strength of the van channel and to the trends that continue to be positive. We believe, we believe strongly that enhancing the Van network is an important runway for Snap-on. One way we're doing that is with innovative new marketing campaign, generating excitement with mechanic customers. In the second quarter, we launched what we call our Masters of Metal Tour. It's a traveling caravan that offers -- it offers an outstanding opportunity for new as well as already committed customers to experience firsthand Snap-on's latest innovations and our hottest tool offering. That customized the mobile showcase celebrates automotive technician as masters of their trade, and Snap-on factory associates as masters of their craft. It features state-of-the-art touch screen technology and it gives attendees the opportunity to see just how Snap-on innovative products are designed and are engineered. Each tour is also paired with an especially equipped truck that we call the rock 'n roll cab. It's loaded with a large range of tool storage product that allows those big ticket products, big ticket boxes to be presented with a visibility and a variety that's not possible on a typical franchisee van. When the Snap-on tour comes to town, it really is quite an event. Generally taking on a party like atmosphere. Oftentimes it coincides with a car show or a fund raiser for a worthy cause and the local franchisees gather their vans right alongside that mobile tour to demonstrate and sell their tools and all this serves to generate significant brand exposure for Snap-on. It's been one of the drivers behind our robust tools group growth this quarter.","One of the innovative products that -- it's got a number of products on this tour, but one of innovative products highlighted on that tour is our new line of quick release ratchets. They incorporate our unique dual 80 technology, along with a locking feature that holds the socket in place when needed and a push button for easy removal. That's a clear productivity enhancer. But in the past, these types of ratchets were considered to be not as durable as traditional tools. Well, Snap-on engineering has made the new ratchets, almost 30% stronger than the competition. We believe that the best such product on the market and the reception seems to confirm just that.","I've often talk about big-ticket sales in this conference -- in these calls. Big-ticket items in the Tools Group in particular, higher dollar purchases of diagnostics and tool storage units. These purchases represent a larger commitment and therefore, they serve as a barometer of customer's financial well-being as well as their confidence. While sales of big-ticket units -- items remain at robust levels, in fact tools storage sales have been particularly strong as a result of the rock 'n roll cab. Not only are these cabs traveling with the Masters of Metal Tour, we also have a small fleet of them, operating singly, accompanying individual franchisees to repair shop location, calling on technicians with unique mobile showrooms. I'll tell you, when these cabs go into a franchise route, they drive tools storage sales and you can see that in the Tools Group second quarter numbers.","So that's some of the highlights of the Tools Group. Now on to the Repair System & Information or RS&I Group. This is where we server primarily garage owners and managers, and we're expanding Snap-on's presence throughout the vehicle repair shop. Sales in RS&I were up only slightly, 0.2% from last year. RS&I does have a large undercar equipment business in Europe that was down, reflecting the overall macros. Upside of Europe, for both the overall RS&I group and for the undercar equipment business, the gains were mid-single digits. So I think it's fair to say that the group is moving forward, but that progress is masked by the European turbulence.","Now operating margin. Operating margin for RS&I rose strongly to 23%, up substantially from 20.9% last year. That increase was driven by growth, high single digits in the higher-margin businesses. The operations that provide, as I said before, diagnostics, repair information, shop management systems to the independent garages, all places where Snap-on has great products and strong position.","Speaking of independent shops, last quarter I mentioned the launch of our new Mitchell 1 repair information products. We call it ProDemand. I'll give you a quick update.","This new software enhances technician productivity. It offers faster and more accurate searches, and improved access to other online data like wiring diagrams and technical service bulletins. It's been a big hit. Customer enthusiasm is apparent and we're expanding our position as a result, that's one of the reasons why we're seeing these sales up in this area. Another innovation helping expand Snap-on's presence in the garage is our recently launched alignment audit system. It uses computerized 3D modeling, high resolution cameras, armed with an extensive database of vehicle information to provide a quick alignment audit. It significantly improves shop efficiency, and it does generate more shop revenue. With the new Snap-on system, any service technician can perform the audit in approximately 60 seconds and present the customer with a complete color-coded report that helps sell needed service that might otherwise have gone unnoticed. Early reaction, I have to tell you, has been very positive. With shop managers commenting that the unit provides a better return on investment than any other equipment currently available. The Snap-on alignment audit system joins a list of other new undercar equipment products like our RFV 2000 diagnostic wheel balancer, which just won an innovation award at an important trade show in Germany. Our new selling automatic tire changer, our new aligner specifically designed for the Russian market, all of those are good strong new products in this segment.","Customer connection and innovation, Snap-on Value Creation Processes, resulting in attractive new products that are helping us to expand with vehicle shop owners and managers. Heavy duty diagnostics has been another positive for RS&I. We made a commitment a few years back to expand in that area, and that effort is paying off with good growth rates. We started expanding in government fleets, an attractive opportunity that would not have been possible without the investments. So all these innovative products from ProDemand information system to the alignment audit have been crucial in offsetting Europe and in driving strong profitability, the strong profitability for RS&I.","So those are the highlights as I see them. Overcoming headwinds to post sales gains, expanding operating margins and clear progress along our strategic runways. The second quarter was an encouraging confirmation that even in turbulent times, our strategic initiatives -- even in turbulent time, continue to offer growth and our Snap-on value creation continues to drive improvement.","Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for a review of the financials. Aldo?","Aldo J. Pagliari","Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales in the second quarter totaled $737.9 million. Excluding foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 4.5%, led by double-digit growth in Snap-on tools and across the majority of our businesses serving customers in emerging markets in critical industries.","Consolidated gross profit of $349.9 million in the quarter increased $7.7 million from 2011 levels, and gross margin of 47.4% improved 30 basis points from 47.1% last year.","Operating expenses of $245.3 million in the quarter were up $1.9 million from 2011 levels and the operating expense margin improved 30 basis points from 33.5% last year to 33.2% this year.","Restructuring cost in the quarter of $10.2 million were higher by $8.3 million as compared to prior year levels, largely due to the inclusion of $6.8 million as anticipated for the settlement of a pension plan, following last year's closure of the new market Canada tool storage facility.","Operating earnings before Financial Services of $104.6 million increased $5.8 million year-over-year and improved as a percentage of sales, 60 basis points from 13.6% last year to 14.2% this year despite 110 basis points of higher year-over-year restructuring cost.","Operating earnings from Financial Services of $25.6 million in the quarter increased $8.1 million or 46.3% from comparable 2011 levels, which exclude last year's $18 million arbitration settlement gain.","Operating earnings of $130.2 million in the quarter increased $13.9 million from comparable prior year levels, excluding the settlement gain. And operating margin improved 130 basis points from 15.4% a year ago to 16.7% this year.","Finally, net earnings in the second quarter of $76.4 million or $1.30 per diluted share increased 14.2% from comparable 2011 levels of $66.9 million or $1.14 per share, again excluding the settlement gain related to last year's earnings, we had $1.33.","Now let's turn to our segment results starting with the Commercial & Industrial Group or C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $283.4 million for the quarter were up 5.1% organically from 2011 levels, primarily as a result of continued double-digit sales increases across the majority of our businesses, serving customers in emerging markets in critical industries. These increases were partially offset by mid-single-digit sales decline in our European-based hand tools business as a result of further market weakness, particularly in Southern Europe.","Gross profit of $104.3 million in the quarter increased $1.9 million from 2011 levels, and gross margin of 36.8% improved 20 basis points year-over-year, largely due to the savings from ongoing RCI initiatives and favorable foreign currency effects. These gross margin improvements were partially offset by $2.6 million of higher restructuring cost to improve the segment's cost structure in Europe.","Operating expenses of $71.5 million in the quarter decreased $1.7 million from 2011 levels and the operating expense margin of 25.2% improved 100 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage.","As a result of these factors, second quarter operating earnings of $32.8 million for the C&I segment increased 12.3% from 2011 levels. Operating margin of 11.6% in the quarter improved 120 basis points from 10.4% last year despite a 90 basis point impact from the higher restructuring cost.","Turning now to Slide 8. Second quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $325 million increased to $29.5 million or 10% organically, largely due to continued higher sales in the U.S. Gross profit of $137 million increased $4.6 million from 2011 levels despite $6.2 million of higher year-over-year restructuring cost, as anticipated, that settled a new market pension plan.","As a result of the expected higher restructuring cost, gross margin of 42.2% in the quarter declined 210 basis points from 44.3% last year.","Operating expenses of $92.5 million in the quarter increased $6.3 million from 2011 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 28.5% improved 30 basis points, largely due to benefits from sales volume leverage and contributions from ongoing RCI initiatives.","Operating earnings of $44.5 million in the quarter for the Snap-on Tools Group declined $1.7 million from $46.2 million last year, as contributions from the higher sales volumes were more than offset by expected higher restructuring cost.","Operating margin of 13.7% in the quarter decreased 180 basis points from 15.5% last year, including 190 basis point impact from the higher restructuring cost.","Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Second quarter sales of $227.4 million increased $0.4 million organically from 2011 levels as a high single-digit sales gain of diagnostics and Mitchell 1 repair information products was partially offset by reduced undercar equipment sales in Europe and a low single-digit decline in sales to OEM dealerships.","Gross profit of $108.6 million in the quarter increased $1.2 million from prior year levels. Gross margin of 47.8% in the quarter improved 200 basis points from 45.8% last year, primarily due to a more favorable sales mix that included higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products.","Gross margin also reflected savings from ongoing RCI initiatives, including contributions from design cost reduction. Operating expenses of $56.4 million in the quarter decreased $2 million from 2011 levels, and the operating expense margin improved 10 basis points to 24.8%. Operating earnings of $52.2 million for the RS&I group increased $3.2 million or 6.5% and operating margin improved 210 basis points to 23%.","Now turning to Slide 10. Second quarter earnings from Financial Services of $25.6 million increased $8.1 million, excluding last year's settlement gain, primarily due to continued growth of our on-book finance portfolio. Originations of $175.6 million in the quarter rose 14.7%, reflecting both higher sales in our Snap-on Tools segments and increased participation in our credit programs.","Moving to Slide 11. As of second quarter end, our balance sheet included just over $1 billion of gross financing receivables, including $854 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation and $156 million from our international finance subsidiaries.","In the U.S., $693 million or 81% of the financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Since 2011 year end, our on-book financing portfolio has grown approximately $75 million. The pace of the portfolio's growth has continued as expected and is naturally decelerating as the transition of the CIT-owned portfolio nears completion. In 2012, we continue to anticipate that for the full-year, the gross on-book portfolio will increase by approximately $125 million over 2011 year-end levels. Regarding finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.","Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $91.7 million for the quarter includes the effect of $20 million of additional discretionary cash contributions to our U.S. pension plans. In 2012, we also intend to make required contributions of $12.6 million to our foreign pension plans and depending on market and other conditions, may make additional discretionary cash contributions to our U.S. plans. The $91.7 million of cash provided this quarter from operating activities compares with the $13.7 million use of cash in the second quarter of last year, which primarily resulted from the return of $89.8 million of cash previously withheld from CIT following last year's arbitration settlement.","Capital expenditures totaled $18 million in the quarter and $40 million year-to-date. For the full-year, we currently anticipate capital expenditures of $70 million to $80 million, including the construction of a fourth factory at our Kunshan China location, which is expected to be completed by year end.","As seen on Slide 13, days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 56 days improved from 58 days as of 2011 year end. Inventories increased $15 million from 2011 year-end levels, largely to support continued higher demand in the United States. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.9x compared to 4.2x at 2011 year end. Our quarter end cash position of $174 million decreased to $12 million from 2011 year-end levels. Primarily due to the continued funding of new loans originated by Snap-on Credit, U.S. pension contributions of $45 million, share repurchases of $38.1 million and dividend payments of $39.6 million. These year-to-date uses of cash were largely offset by cash generated from operations.","Our net debt to cap ratio of 33.2% compares to 34.3% at 2011 year end. In addition to our $174 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper market should we choose to do so. As of the second quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities.","This concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I'll now turn the call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Thanks, Aldo. We are encouraged by the second quarter results. More than anything else, we believe that it confirms Snap-on's abundant runway for improvement and for growth. It extends our favorable trend, achieved despite turbulence in Europe, which given our position in Spain has been with us for some time. The quarter shows we are making strategic progress in the areas that we believe are decisive for our future. The Van network is stronger. Sales were up double digits again with the U.S. leading the way. We are extending into critical industries, also up by double digits in the quarter. A strong position is being built in emerging markets. Sales growing substantially above local GDPs and physical capabilities, factories, product lines, distribution, all strengthening.","And we do see progress with repair shop owners and managers. Although overall RS&I is flat, the crucial high margin core of diagnostics, repair information and shop management systems grew at high single digits, bringing RS&I profitability to a high level. And again this quarter, we're seeing Snap-on Value Creation Processes, driving progress on our runways for improvement. OpCo OI percent of 14.2%, up 60 basis points despite substantially increased restructuring.","I think everybody knows that these are interesting times and there are challenges. But we've been facing headwinds like Spain for some time. We're confident of our capabilities, encouraged by our strengthening position, focused on our abundant opportunities and believe that we will continue to find advantage despite the turbulence.","Before I close, I believe it's appropriate to recognize that Snap-on's results and the encouraging trends reflect the extraordinary effort and our strong commitment and the strong commitment of our associates and our franchisees around the world. I know many of them listen to this call, so for your energy, for your dedication and for your support, you have my congratulations and you have my thanks.","Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question, Mike Wherley with Janney Capital Markets.","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I wanted to talk a little bit about the critical industries. You mentioned that you signed on with a large airline maintenance facility, and I'm wondering, are there other potential opportunities like that and do they deliver the same margins that you might get in your other critical industries business?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","There are different -- there are many more opportunities. Of course, that's the biggest one, the United States, that's why mentioned it. But what I meant there was focus, product and presence. And at the base of our extension into critical industries, is the fact that in the past, Snap-on would sell on an almost default basis to some of those customers. We were calling on the 4,000 -- we were calling on that site, but very sporadically. We never focused on it as a distinct customer base that we wanted to solve their problems and make their work easier. And this an example of what we will be doing around the country with other places, focus on them, call on them as they need, provide a product line that fits them. Now we're doing that there, it's just early days, we started that in the quarter, but there are many other places to do that in -- to do the same thing. Regarding margins, the margins are just as good with that business as they are throughout the corporation.","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And is it something where you have sort of a direct way to sell to those technicians or is it something where the maintenance facility just buys them for the technician?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","It's a mix. In this particular, in fact, I think, in this facility, it's a mix, the facilities buy some and the technicians buy some. And we sell it through a direct presence that's there virtually every day. It's kind of a direct sale. And if you look at the landscape throughout the country or throughout the world, you would find a mix of what you just described. In some facilities, the facility buys and provides the tools and in other facilities it\u2019s the technicians themselves.","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just one other question I had on the...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","But let offer, in any case, that's a classic example of a Snap-on positioning. It's why it doesn't matter to us so much who buys because the buyer is not -- is usually not a corporate buyer, it's a buyer located very close to the point of use. Even if it's the facility, he's up close -- that buyer is up close and personal to the technician themselves, so the technician has a great influence on what actually gets purchased. So that means that our -- the capabilities of the Snap-on products are quite appreciated and weigh heavily in the purchase, that's why we get the margins.","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And will you be extending credit to those technicians?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","No.","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. The other question I have was just on the restructuring that you're doing in Europe to sort of reset those cost levels in the S&A Europe. Is that complete, and when do you expect the benefits to sort of be fully realized?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","It's not complete. That's an ongoing basis. You'll probably be some more restructuring going forward, the kind of restructuring you've seen in other quarters if you look back in our history, you'll see we're kind of controlled restructurers and we have had restructuring in most quarters. And you're going to see that in our future, much of it directed at S&A Europe, so that will happen. When you see benefits, I would say, it's hard to say it varies from project to project, but a good rule of thumb would be to say 2 year paybacks. And that will give you some indication of how -- what gets off it from the spending.","Operator","David Leiker, Robert W. Baird.","Unknown Analyst","This is John Wein [ph] for David. Just on the C&I margin this quarter, it was up 140 bps on what essentially is flat revenue quarter-over-quarter. I'm just wondering what exactly is going on there. Whether it's mix or some of the European restructuring already is starting to take place?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, I think it's -- I don't know what you mean by flat. I think it's up 5.5% on an organic basis.","Unknown Analyst","Sequentially, sorry.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Right. Are you saying sequential?","Unknown Analyst","Yes, sorry.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I think 5.5%. If you're talking about recorded -- reported, that has currency inside it. But on an organic basis, it's up -- it is sequentially flat, I know. What you're seeing in C&I is a number of different things. One is, of course, the effect of the Snap-on Value Creation Process as we obviously turns a focus on it in the past couple of quarters so you're seeing that flow through in terms of things like RCI, Rapid Continuous Improvement. And then you are seeing some improvements in Europe and the bottom line associated with some of those restructuring coming through. So you're seeing both of those effects happening. I don't think you can call it a mix thing. We're not seeing much mix in C&I. So that's -- what you're seeing there is pure productivity.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, great. On the -- for a long time, you've had kind of a 15% OI margin target for the OpCo. And essentially, you're already there if you make the adjustments. I'm just wondering when looking ahead and looking the further leverage you can pull, is it more on the manufacturing side where we could expect a greater improvement in gross margins? Is it on the operating expenses or SG&A? Just any feel you might have for that.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, I think it's all of the above there. I think there are -- I think we've said fairly consistently over the years that we see 2 distinct runways. One, what you're referring to are runways for improvement, but Rapid Continuous Improvement, driving better efficiency and productivity even at flat sales. And you'll see that play out both in gross margin and in SG&A and in operating expense. And then, you'll see leverage associated with growth that goes forward because we believe those runways are open to us. Things like extending the critical industries and expanding in the repair garage and building in emerging markets, and the Van network, which has been mid-double digits for 3 or 4 quarters now. So I can see all 3 of those things in play. A kind of efficiencies around both areas and margins and expenses, and the leverage associated with volume. Now I'll quickly say that the leverage is not as -- leverage isn't always as definable each and every quarter as you might think, because sometimes you get more sales and the RCI effect to handle all sales to raise the productivity of your factory doesn't adjust quickly enough and you'll get some inefficiencies at first, and as RCI catches up, that drops to the bottom line much more effectively. You get that leverage. We see that in some of our results, particularly the Tools Group this time. The other thing I'd emphasize pretty carefully, as I look out and I see these runways for growth, and I see that growth happening and I see the operating margin happening, this is over a longer term. When we look forward to the third quarter, for example, everybody will probably want to know about the third quarter, this is the most uncertain quarter for us every year. There's a lot of windage in our third quarters. So we see things like the effects of European vacations and the effects of the Van vacations. Remember the van drivers are owner-operators, usually single person in the business. So when they take the couple weeks off or a week off for a vacation, the Van doesn't roll. So our third quarter is not a trend quarter. It's a quarter that has a lot of variation in it. But when you look out over time, we're going to see that -- those 3 things in place, leverage and productivity improvements both at the gross margin line and the operating expense line.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, great. That's helpful. Just wondering given where the euro is and the potential headwind it creates, how much of your SG&A is incurred in Europe or denominated in euros?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, I guess, I don't know if I have that number exactly. I can offer this to you that about -- what do we say, about 22% of our business is in Europe. And the euro denomination about 15% of our activity is in the euro currency. So if that's helpful.","Unknown Analyst","No, yes, that's helpful. And then my last one is on the growth in the Tools Group. You add Mac Tools had high single-digit growth during the quarter. So you've obviously beat that, and I'm guessing if I just did a U.S. to U.S. comp, your U.S. tools business grew above the 10% that the overall segment did, so I'm just...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes, it did.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. So just trying to get a sense of -- from my side what exactly is going on, and one of the things just kind of thinking about it, having the credit operation internally now, have you been able to kind of pull some levers or maybe do some creative promotions now that you're managing that, that you weren't able to do when CIT was running it? That might be helping you capture incremental tool buyers?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Actually, you said a lot of great things there that are accurate. Let me just say first, the tools group has put together 3 or 4 outstanding growth quarters around 9%, 10%. And you have to give credit to the team there. They are hitting. In baseball parlance, they are pounding the ball. And so a lot of credit has to be given to that team for this. And what you're seeing with them are a couple of things. One is, is that we have some great new products, like I talked about, the ratchet -- the flexible ratchet. Then we have the marketing efforts like the rock 'n roll cab which is generating to think about it, a van is really small and so how many boxes can a van driver carry on his van? So when the mechanic gets on, he can only see 2 colors or 2 sizes, the rock and roll cabbie can see a whole wall of this stuff and so it generates a sort of the impulse purchase. And so you're seeing that great marketing effort. And then, our van network has been just getting stronger and stronger when you look at the health metrics of the van, the sales were up, the equity is up, the terminations are down -- just gotten stronger right off the recession because we invested in them. And finally, we've invested in productivity in our vans. So that our drivers are spending more time selling. So you've got those 3 things happening, you got all 4 things happening, that's driving those sales. And so that's how I explain that, the van business and the expansion there.","Operator","Dax Vlassis with Gates Capital Management.","Dax Vlassis - Gates Capital Management, Inc.","Nick, just curious on the margin side. If you add back the restructuring charges, you're well in excess of a 15% target. I'm just wondering there was another question about this -- the growth of that and the sustainability of that. Can you speak to the new benchmark you've sort of set as far as margins in the go forward from here if -- some of that...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Okay. I'm really happy about the 15.8% in tools and the number without it. But it's one quarter, so I don't know if I'm actually resetting my benchmarks yet. I've got to think about it. And I would also say that when you look -- I just want to emphasize, when you look forward, things happen from quarter-to-quarter, we feel pretty good about our trends, but this is one quarter and I am confident in our upward trend. I am confident in the runways for growth and improvement. But I'm not sure I yet want to reset my target based on one quarter achieving it.","Dax Vlassis - Gates Capital Management, Inc.","But around this level, let's say, in the first half of this year, did you feel that's a sustainable margin sort of basis to look at the business?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Sure. I think so, but I want to say that we've been here -- we're just getting to this level. And when I say something, I don't mean every quarter.","Dax Vlassis - Gates Capital Management, Inc.","Of course.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Every quarter. I'm talking about -- I think it's a great sustainable direction. I've already said that the third quarter is kind of squirrely, and you never predict anything about this. But I think over trend -- over the trends, this is a good base for thinking about our business. And I've also said to so many, I think maybe I said to you when I met with you, is that I believe that Snap-on. And I've been around the block. This is not my first rodeo. I've been around the block and Snap-on has a great, great franchise in the broadest sense in terms of brand, in terms of products, in terms of customer reception, customer loyalty and if we can't get top level returns, then we'd be disappointed.","Dax Vlassis - Gates Capital Management, Inc.","And then my second question is around the cash flow. It looks like, especially given the contributions that the free cash flow cash, flow from ops minus CapEx that you generated in the quarter was the highest in 2 years. It's great to see you generating such strong cash. Can you talk about your future? It looks like you're stepping up a little bit on the CapEx for the second half of the year. And can you just talk about your working capital management and whether you expect to sustain this great cash flow? And then on top of that, to add on to that question is uses of cash. Can you talk about the acquisition environment and if there's any areas that you can put a larger amount of shareholder capital to work at good returns?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes, I think, talking about moving forward, our uses of cash, I think I've said in the past are to invest in the business, and you've seen us step up CapEx. I think we raised our target this time because we can see opportunities to invest in, particularly in things like capacity and so on we can -- and in emerging markets. So we can see great opportunities for payback in those things and we're actually getting more capable in spending. So one of the things that keeps you -- that makes this possible is we're just getting more effective in managing those CapEx expenditures. Secondly, you just talked about it, the working capital, as you grow, you need working capital. I have cautioned everybody that I don't see working capital as a source of cash going forward. It will be probably a use of cash going forward because we expect to grow. And then I see M&A, I see acquisitions around the coherency of our businesses, around the critical industries, around the repair shops serving owners and managers and in emerging markets. I see acquisitions to make in those areas. And so those are the places where we'll be spending our money.","Dax Vlassis - Gates Capital Management, Inc.","But have you seen any -- are you closer to doing something than you have been in the past or is it...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I don't think we'd comment on those kinds of things. But I think we are obviously closer. We're getting further out of the credit company.","Dax Vlassis - Gates Capital Management, Inc.","My final question is with respect to the earning assets of the FinCo. Is there any -- I mean, I know there's going to be some further growth for the rest of this year given the targets that you sort of set for '12, but it's really not that much in capital investments from here as far as receivables and contract receivables or finance receivables. What would be the growth rate past '12? Are we getting to the point where you're not going to have to make any more investments and it'll just be pure cash that rolls off from the operating income of that business?","Aldo J. Pagliari","This is Aldo. Just to comment, Dax, I think if you look past 2012, the growth of Snap-on Credit will be more closely aligned to the growth in the Snap-on Tools Group. Largely the CIT transition will have been completed by the end of this year. So whatever the Tools Group grows, it won't -- they never match up perfectly quarter-to-quarter, but it's a good reflection. And what that means is that you'll still probably see the portfolio growth, be consuming slightly more cash than what you would get if you allocate interest expense and taxes as we do in our cash flow slide to the Financial Services segment. So there'll still be a user of cash to some extent, but not to the extent that it is today.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Let me just add one thing at the end. I think I mentioned the use of cash, and I take it as a given around here and that is dividend. We have paid a dividend every quarter since 1939 and we have not reduced it. So that's part of our DNA here. So that would be another use of cash that I want to make sure that I don't overlook when I discuss it here.","Operator","Gary Prestopino, Barrington Research.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Going through your narrative, you mentioned some countries in Europe that were particularly strong. And I couldn't all write that down. Could we go through that? I mean, and then some of the weaker ones...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I think I only mentioned Russia pretty much in Europe in the script anyway, but you can think of -- really what we're talking about, Gary is the periphery, the Eastern Europe and we put Turkey in there and things like Belarus and other places. If you think about -- actually the Maghreb countries would be part of that. So they would be -- we happen to sell into Northern Africa. So I kind of think of it as a circle around Europe. In the middle, we're selling some in those areas. So that's where the business is up. Why we're encouraged by that is that, that seems to us to confirm that the business in Europe is still robust and has a great value proposition as long as the economies are unafflicted, people keep buying.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","So these are newer countries to you, so this would be considered part of your emerging markets initiatives or am I incorrect?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes. I think mostly, mostly. Actually not North Africa so much. We've been in North America for the dog\u2019s age. But Russia and Belarus and places like that.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","What I'm trying to get at -- so in your established countries, you said Spain and Italy are bad. Very bad. As you went through the quarter, ex Spain and Italy, in your more established countries, did you start to see a slower growth if that's the best word or more...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","No, what we saw -- those are down. It is like this. How I would describe Europe is like this. The Spain, deep reductions. Spain -- the Southern Europe is deep reduction. As we've seen, the periphery up robustly and the core is mid-single digits down. That's what we're seeing. And what we -- I think a one little nuance in this call is -- or this report is we're not seeing decelerate -- we're not seeing acceleration of that downward motion. It's still down, but the comparisons are about the same. But they haven't gotten worse. That's sort of the report I would give you as our look on Europe.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","So it doesn't feel like it did in 2008?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, yes, right. Well, 2008 -- 2008, yes. It doesn't feel like that. It doesn't feel like it was in the first quarter. I think things -- we thought things, the fourth and the first quarter of 2011 and the first quarter, we saw things getting deeper. On a year-over-year basis, things aren't getting any deeper now. They're still agony on a year-over-year basis. But it isn't -- the hole isn't deepening.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just kind of a rhetorical question, I mean, your sales were up about 1.5% quarter-over-quarter. Without foreign currency, it was about 4%. And even given that low single-digit sales growth numbers, if we extrapolate that going forward, do you still feel these RCI initiatives would be enough to expand your margins even with such sluggish sales growth?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","First, I beg to -- if it's possible for me, I beg to differ a little bit in your characterization of 4.5% as low. I have always characterized our growth as 4% to 6% organically. And 4.5% Is within that range. And so, therefore, from my perspective, this is just another data point. I never said we were going to hit 5% every year right in the middle of that in the quarter. So to me, the organic growth is kind of what you expect. We'll see some bigger than that. But I like being in the range. And I believe Snap-on value creation, I think I've said this before, Snap-on value creation, it authors improved profitability at flat sales, let alone small growth, small growth. So I think that's a factor, of course, your margin expansion gets slower then, but you still get that -- you still get margin expansion.","Operator","Richard Hilgert with MorningStar.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just a few quick questions here. With the economy here in the states appearing to slow down a little bit, are -- your driver is saying and are you seeing fundamentals in the repair businesses still holding up? I know the revenues were good in the quarter still, especially in the Snap-on Tool business, but I'm just curious here as you exited the quarter, what some of the driver feedback you're getting? Have collections started to be a bit slower and are folks looking to repair their vehicles a little bit less at this point and trying to postpone some repairs?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","No. The answer to this is no. I was just -- about 2 weeks ago, I was with 700 customers at the national NHRA championships in Joliet, and I didn't get to meet all 700 of course, but I got to meet quite a few of them, and they were uniformly positive. And just a couple of days ago, I was out on a van riding around the countryside stopping at garages and shops and so on. And they seemed, I would say, fairly positive and full of business. So I don't think that the grassroots level you see much out there in terms of moaning or saying, this is -- things are tough or anything like that. I don't see that. Now there's the odd person that has a problem depending on what's been happening, particularly if it's a franchisee and let's say Ford and General Motors have closed a dealership in his area, so he's re-adjusting with other stops we give him. But generally, I'm seeing fairly good positioning. Now I'll remind you that we view ourselves as recession-resistant, not immune. So what happened the last time is when the recession eventually rose people kept buying -- people kept repairing cars. The journal was running articles like economy is glum, but repair shops hum. And what happened was our customers kept buying short payback items like wrenches and hand tools, but they stopped buying big-ticket items like toolboxes, tool storage units, and we're still seeing that business robust.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","How about on the industrial side?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I don't think so either. We're not -- again, we operate in criticality. So generally, our customers hold on to our buys a little longer. And what I mean by operating in the space of criticality is that you're selling to someone who knows that if the machine he's or whatever he's maintenancing or whatever he's supporting has a problem, the consequences of failure are high. Therefore, he has a tremendous motivation to try to pay for the repeatability and reliability of a Snap-on level product. And so that tends to be more resilient. Now it's not unaffected by recession either, but we were up double digits in that business. And there's a lot of landscaping there. The military was flat, the government was flat, the aerospace is up, natural resource is up and it's always so. There's always landscaping, but it was pretty good. Emerging markets. People ask me about emerging markets all the time, but everybody's talking about China slowing down, and it maybe so. But if you think about this, repair business in China hasn't even started, the repair wave hasn't started. They sold more in cars in China than any place else in the world last year, but all the cars in the road are new versus -- and not many of them, 60 million, 70 million cars on the road and they're all new versus United States where there are 300 million cars on the road and the average is 11 years old. So the business hasn't even started in China, just rising. So when we look at our results, we're not a good barometer of economy there. We should be rising anyway because our sector is just rising.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. The $21 million currency hit in the quarter in revenue. You've got operations set up over in Europe. Do you have your cost pretty much in line with your revenues in terms of currency impact?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Actually, yes. The profitability impact was lower than that. So it's not -- you're looking at that $21 million is give or take -- government work is 3% impact, the profitability impact is substantially lower than that. Looking forward, you'll see. You can -- if the exchange rates stay where they are, you could be thinking about 3% again I guess. And then I think when you start to look at year-over-year, the comparisons get a little easier as you get out into other quarters.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Right. Okay. So then in environment where the euro is gaining ground against the dollar, we would see more of an increase in revenue, but less of an increase in profitability?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes, right. Right, sure. Sure.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","On the RCI initiatives, what kind of a cost savings run rate would you project coming out of RCI? I mean you've been doing this program for quite a while now? What would you expect in terms of the kind of magnitude of cost savings that you can continue to get from RCI?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, I think that's hard to say, but I think you could say $25 million, $30 million a year or something like that, those kind of numbers. I don't know. We try not to put a number on that. I kind of try to address that when I said the restructuring paybacks was 2 years in Europe.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","You count restructuring the same as RCI?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","No, not -- no, it's not the same. We have restructuring, but we also get RCI. They're different -- they're distinct things, but, I guess, I was trying to give you some kind of a view of the kinds and numbers we were going to get out restructuring. But you can look at that number, you can go back and look at our productivity numbers, you can see the kinds of numbers we've generated on an annual basis, on sort of flat sales, and I think you could see that going forward. Normally, how I answer this question is that people I think are -- I don't know if this is your concern is that, maybe you run out of opportunities. And I don't think we are. I think there's a lot of a -- Snap-on. Mainly because there are a lot of processes in Snap-on. A hand tool is heavily integrated if you think about it. You don't buy many components. You have a piece of steel comes in the back of the hand tool plant, the finish products goes out the output front and really, pretty much everything that goes into the hand tool is done inside the plant, you don't buy anything for it. So there's a lot of opportunities for RCI and then you have 65,000 SKUs, which creates a complex landscape. So we see a continuous run, but I hate to commit any one particular number. I know you'd like to have one for your model, but I hate to commit to that. I just say that I believe we hold ourselves to a standard that on flat sales we expect to have improvement.","Richard J.

Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's second quarter 2013 results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer.

I'll start off today with the highlights of our second quarter. I'll cover the general environment, then I'll discuss some of the progress down our runways for both growth and improvement. Aldo will then provide a detailed review of the financials.","Much as we've seen over the past several quarters, we were again able to overcome the substantial headwinds to post solid sales and profit gains. Our organic sales increased 3.1% from last year's level, with opco operating income rising to $117.8 million or 15.4% of sales, and Financial Services contributed an additional $30.6 million, up $5 million from last year. It all added up to a consolidated operating margin equal to 18.4% of revenues and EPS -- and an EPS of $1.50, which is up more than 15% from last year's $1.30.","Now there are a couple of items in this year's year-over-year comparison that should be noted. First, last year's results were impacted by a relatively high restructuring charge, which included $6.8 million for pension settlement at our now closed Canadian tool storage facility. Also this year, we incurred $4.4 million in higher stock-based and mark-to-market cost that was primarily related to our recent share price increase and to more participation in our long-standing employee and franchisee stock purchase program. But even after adjusting for these 2 items, we believe that the year-over-year comparisons represent encouraging progress. Related to our quarterly sales of $764.1 million, in addition to the 3.1% organic increase, we also had $8.5 million or 120 basis-point contribution from our recent acquisition of Challenger Lifts. Along with a negative 70 basis-point impact from foreign currency, the total result was an overall sales increase of 3.6%.","Now at a macro level, we haven't seen much change in the external environment from the last 2 quarters. Our Tools Group and our Repair Systems and Information, or RS&I group, both which primarily serve the automotive repair sector, are showing mid to high single-digit volume gains. However, those increases and the generally favorable market environments in those automotive-related segments are somewhat offset by Commercial & Industrial, or the C&I group. You may remember that the businesses in C&I are where we feel the brunt of our major headwinds and the overall unevenness in the world economies. You see it continuing this quarter mainly with softness in Europe and the impact on SNA Europe; our hand tool business is based in that region, and in reduced military spending driven by troop withdrawals and budgetary constraints. So there are challenges, but as I see it, there's also further progress. We do believe that this quarter's results clearly demonstrate the benefits of and the balance inherent in the strategies we're pursuing as we proceed down our runways for both growth and improvement.","For growth, we've identified 4 areas that are critical to our future: enhancing the franchise channel; expanding in the garage; building in emerging markets; and expanding into critical industries. And again this quarter, strategic progress in those areas more than offset the impact of the external headwinds.","Let me focus for a moment on customer connection and innovation. These are 2 key components of Snap-on value creation and they're helping drive our growth. Just this past quarter, Snap-on was again recognized for innovation when Professional Tools and Equipment News, or PTEN, recognized us with their top Innovation Awards in 5 categories. I've mentioned some of these products in the past, and I'll highlight a few more now on the heels of their wins. In the tool storage category, Snap-on was recognized for our diagnostic mobile workstation. It's a complete diagnostic and information system packaged in a secure, fully enclosed unit that's on wheels, so it can easily be moved around the garage, going right to where the work needs to be done. The station was designed for use with our VERDICT handheld unit. It provides custom foam cutouts for organization of accessories, a mounting place for a monitor and plenty of storage space for other tools.","Another of these award-winning products was the AC Touchless Wheel Clamp. This unique design allows alignment techs to securely clamp the tire in one single and fast motion without touching the rim. Now today, that's important because cars -- today's cars have ever more varied and sensitive and expensive rims. People worry about rim damage, this fixes it.","And lastly, of these recent winners -- and lastly, of the recent winners, I'll mention the BK8000 wireless digital inspection scope. This tool provides the technician with the ability to visually inspect areas that are normally inaccessible but are important to see, like under the dash, behind the engine block, inside the transmission housing or engine. And has a screen that's 40% larger than the competition, touch interface, rechargeable aluminum -- lithium batteries, and more memory than ever before for digital video. This scope is a worthy winner of this award and is a popular seller.","One important additional fact that I think everybody should know or recognize is that the PTEN award -- about the PTEN award, is that they're voted on by actual users. So the Snap-on products selected as innovation leaders were chosen by a panel that included active technicians and shop owners, those who will actually use the product. We believe that customer connection is a big advantage for Snap-on. With our 4,800 franchisees around the world, hundreds of direct salespeople, calling on 600,000 repair shops and many more critical work sites, we have great insight in the products that will make work easier for professionals. The PTEN awards, selected by the same professionals, are evidence that customer connection innovation are advantages for Snap-on and you can see it in the results.","Now demonstrating our balance between growth and improvement, we also saw stronger operating performance in the quarter. In fact, the opco operating margin of 15.4% recorded in the period does represent a new level. You see everyday, we're applying the elements of Snap-on value creation: safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement, or RCI. It's a focus that moves up along the runways for improvement and the gains can be seen not just in those areas benefiting from our increased volume, but other places. In fact, maybe more telling, even though C&I group was down in sales this quarter, it still achieved a 12.6% operating margin. The impact of the sales decline was checked and limited. That's Snap-on value creation.","Speaking of C&I -- I'll move to a discussion of each of our segments. C&I sales of $266.2 million were down 5.4% organically, with an additional 70 basis-point drop from currency. Operating income was of $33.6 million, actually was up, as I said, a reasonable job eliminating the impact from the drop in volume.","For the group, there really wasn't much change from last quarter's sales picture. Year-over-year activity comparisons were about what we've seen in the past. SNA Europe was down, high-single digits overall, but their profits were up, the benefits of RCI and the restructuring actions we've taken in prior periods. And as expected, military was down again, big double digits. So the headwinds and trends remained about the same, with the normal period-to-period variation seen across individual markets. In short, our overall view and outlook remains the same. The military decline did more than offset gains in -- elsewhere in industrial business. Remember, this is the business that's primarily focused on extending the Snap-on reach in the critical industries, places like aviation, mining and oil and gas. In the past, I've spoken of expanded product line to serve customers in those critical industries, and we continue to have successes with new customers and products.","One highlight this quarter was strong gains with international aerospace customers. We're reaching more maintenance, repair and overall facilities around the globe. And that extension is aided by new products like our control tech, electronic torque wrench, patented technology to achieve the fastest and most accurate torque and angle combo in a single motion; added durability, important for the critical industry environment; an audible indicator; a vibrating handle; an LED display, all to alert the technician as the proper torque is achieved and bring him right in on target. And it incorporates Snap-on's dual 80 technology, providing more precise yet stronger ratcheting. It just launched, just launched this past quarter, and it's being well received by professionals across the critical industries.","One more point, one last point, remember that C&I is where we have our primary effort to penetrate emerging economies. These geographies were much as we saw in the first quarter, with India, the Philippines, Turkey and Russia, being particularly positive this quarter. So we'd continue to build position and make progress along that decisive runway.","Let's move to the Tools Group. Organic sales were up 7%, an encouraging volume gain. The operating margin of 15.7% in the quarter represents a new high for the group and compares to 13.7% recorded last year. Now you remember, that there were higher restructuring charges in the second quarter of 2012, $6.9 million of which was in the Tools Group mainly for the Canadian pension settlement. I also mentioned the franchisee stock purchase plan. This quarter, we had $1.8 million higher cost associated with that plan in the Tools Group. These 2 items impact the year-over-year comparisons. But adjusting each, but adjusting each year for the 2 items, this year's operating margin of 16.3% would compare to last year's at 15.8%, still strong growth.","Big-ticket sales were -- for the Tools Group, big-ticket sales were significant growth drivers in this period. Diagnostics and tool storage units, those products were strong. We believe, it's important for us, because we believe that big-ticket activity provides meaningful evidence of the financial well-being of our customers, and it's a good barometer on the overall health of the auto repair sector. And those sales, those big-ticket sales are being supported by Snap-on Credit. It's an important advantage for us.","Not only is Credit helping to drive big-ticket activity in North America, but we're now extending some of that advantage in the international van operation. The well-established programs and expertise we've developed here are being applied to our advantage in places like the U.K. and Australia, improving service, increasing customer satisfaction and driving more growth.","Tools Group performance was also driven by customer connection and innovation. 3 of the 5 PTEN Innovation Award winners are sold by our franchisees. And our many more new products like the innovative S6810 impact flip socket, an 8-millimeter and 10-millimeter hex on the same tool, saving technicians' valuable time and moving today's underbody panels that have dozens of different, different-in-size fasteners, a process required even for routine repair and maintenance. This tool is a big saver.","Or products like our new digital display circuit testers that provide the technicians with a no-guess voltage rather than having to estimate it based on bulb brightness, we took technology and features from a more advanced multimeter and applied it to a common handheld tester. Now it sounds simple but since April, we've sold tens of thousands of them, well over $1 million in value.","The group's performance testifies that we are progressing along the strategic runway of enhancing the van channel. You can see it in the franchisee health metrics, sales up, franchisee turnover down, trends positive. So based on the second quarter, the Tools Group appears to be hitting on a lot of cylinders.","Now for RS&I. A total sales of 8.7 -- a total sales increase of 8.7%, which is made up of an organic rise of 4.9% and additional -- and an additional contribution of 380 basis points from the acquisition of Challenger Lifts, and a 40 basis-point impact from unfavorable foreign exchange. The operating margin was a strong 23%. We continue to see strength in our business providing independent shops with diagnostics and repair information, and in serving OEM dealerships with essential hard and diagnostics tools and with electronic parts catalogs. Gains in those businesses drove RS&I growth in spite of flat sales for undercar equipment, a product line that has been impacted by the decline in Europe where we have a relatively large position. Obviously, one of the big highlights for RS&I this quarter was the Challenger Lift acquisition in mid-May. We're excited to add Challenger to our portfolio, a well-established brand, a complementary product line. We believe that the acquisition is a step along our path of coherent growth. It will broaden our product line and help us to better serve customers who are repair shop owners and managers.","Moving away from undercar equipment. Snap-on's presence is expanding in other parts of the garage and here too the gains are driven by an ever-growing offering of innovative and new products, like entry-level diagnostics. Earlier this year, we launched the successful MICROSCAN 3 and ETHOS Plus in North America, basic diagnostics. Now in the second quarter, we rolled them out internationally in the U.K. They're quite -- and they're quite popular, and these are important entr\u00e9e products introducing technicians to Snap-on capability, creating customers for life who transition into utilizing our full diagnostics line up. Mitchell 1, our repair information business, has also been launching new products to serve the important medium- and heavy-duty truck market. Our new truck labor estimating product, we believe the most complete such database available for estimating truck repair, has been well received and adds to our already strong and growing line up in that segment.","It's clear to us that we're gaining traction with truck repair shop owners and managers. You can see it with this new estimating product and it's evidenced with our truck repair information offering, which registered a 25% increase in customers since this time last year.","So that's the highlight to our quarter: advancements along our runways for growth and for improvement; continued expansion with strength in the Tools Group and RS&I, overcoming the external challenges in C&I and its headwinds; and better performance, Snap-on value creation driving improvements, higher profitability across the corporation despite the challenges.","Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo before making a few closing comments. Aldo?","Aldo J. Pagliari","Thanks, Nick. Our second quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $764.1 million in the quarter increased 3.6% from 2012 levels, on an organic basis, sales increased 3.1% excluding the $8.5 million of sales from Challenger Lifts and an unfavorable $4.7 million impact from foreign currency translation. The year-over-year organic sales increase primarily reflects continued higher sales in the Snap-on Tools Group, along with higher sales to OEM dealerships, and increased sales of diagnostics and repair information products. These sales increases more than offset lower sales to the military and lower sales in our European-based hand tools business.","Consolidated gross profit of $373.2 million increased $23.3 million from 2012 levels. Gross margin of 48.8% improved 140 basis points, largely due to lower restructuring costs, as well as savings from ongoing Rapid Continuous Improvement, or RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $255.4 million increased $10.1 million, primarily due to higher volume-related expenses and $4.4 million of increased stock-based and mark-to-market expenses. The operating expense margin of 33.4% compared with 33.2% last year.","Restructuring costs in the quarter totaled $1.8 million. Last year, restructuring costs totaled $10.2 million and included $6.8 million for the settlement of a pension plan following the 2011 closure of our Newmarket, Canada facility. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $117.8 million increased 12.6%, and as a percentage of sales improved 120 basis points from prior year levels. Operating earnings from Financial Services of $30.6 million increased $5 million or 19.5% over prior year levels. Consolidated operating earnings of $148.4 million increased 14% over 2012 levels, and the operating margin of 18.4% improved 170 basis points from 16.7% a year ago.","Our second quarter effective income tax rate was 32.5%. We continue to expect that our full year 2013 effective tax rate will be comparable to our 2012 full year rate of 32.8%. Finally, net earnings in the quarter of $88.4 million or $1.50 per diluted share compared to net earnings of $76.4 million or $1.30 per share last year, representing a 15.4% increase in diluted earnings per share.","Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I group, on Slide 7. Sales of $266.2 million were down 5.4% organically from 2012 levels, primarily due to a double-digit decline in sales to the military and a high single-digit sales decline in our European-based hand tools business, as a result of ongoing economic weakness in that region. Gross profit in the C&I group totaled $105.4 million in the quarter. Gross margin of 39.6% improved 280 basis points from 36.8% last year, primarily due to savings from ongoing RCI initiatives, particularly in Europe, and lower restructuring costs.","Operating expenses of $71.8 million in the quarter were essentially flat with prior year levels. The operating expense margin of 27%, however, increased from 25.2% last year, primarily due to lower sales. As a result of these factors, second quarter operating earnings of $33.6 million for the C&I segment increased $800,000 from 2012 levels, and the operating margin of 12.6% improved 100 basis points from 11.6% last year.","Turning now to Slide 8. Second quarter sales from the Snap-on Tools Group of $346.2 million increased 7% organically, reflecting increases across both our U.S. and international franchise operations. Gross profit of $152.9 million increased $15.9 million from 2012 levels, primarily due to $6.8 million of lower restructuring costs. The gross margin of 44.2% in the quarter increased 200 basis points from 42.2% last year. Operating expenses of $98.4 million in the quarter increased $5.9 million from 2012 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related costs and $1.8 million of increased stock-based and mark-to-market expenses associated with our franchisee stock purchase plan. The operating expense margin was 28.5% in both the second quarters, 2013 and 2012. As a result of these factors, operating earnings of $54.5 million for the Snap-on Tools Group increased $10 million from prior year levels, and the operating margin of 15.7% increased 200 basis points from 13.7% last year.","Turning to the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I group, shown on Slide 9. Sales of $246.2 million increased 8.3% from 2012 levels, including $8.5 million of sales from the recent acquisition of Challenger. Excluding the Challenger sales and unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales in the quarter increased $11.1 million or 4.9%, primarily due to a high single-digit gain in sales to OEM dealerships and a mid single-digit gain in sales of diagnostics and repair information products. Gross profit totaled $114.9 million in the quarter. The gross margin of 46.7% decreased 110 basis points from 47.8% last year, primarily due to a shift in sales mix that included higher volumes of lower gross margin products, including the higher sales of essential tool and facilitation products to OEM dealerships and sales from the Challenger acquisition. These gross margin decreases were partially offset by continued savings from ongoing RCI initiatives. Operating expenses totaled $58.2 million in the quarter, and the operating expense margin of 23.7% improved 110 basis points from 2012 levels, primarily due to contributions from sales volume leverage including the effects from the sales mix shift discussed above and savings from ongoing RCI initiatives.","Second quarter operating earnings of $56.7 million for the RS&I group increased $4.5 million from prior year levels, and the operating margin was 23% in both the second quarters of 2013 and 2012.","Now turning to Slide 10. In the second quarter, earnings from Financial Services increased $5 million or 19.5%, and originations of $203.1 million rose 15.7% year-over-year. Revenues in the quarter increased $4.6 million, primarily due to continued growth of the on-book finance portfolio and higher average yields. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.4% in the quarter increased 30 basis points from 17.1% last year, and average yield on contract receivables of 9.6% in the quarter increased 20 basis points from 2012 levels.","Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $1.15 billion of gross financing receivables, including $976 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation and $169 million from our international finance subsidiaries. In the U.S., $785 million or 80% of the financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Year-to-date, our worldwide on-book financing portfolio grew approximately $61 million. For the 2013 full year, we anticipate that the gross on-book finance portfolio will increase by approximately $100 million over 2012 year-end levels. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. I'll also note that the CIT-owned portfolio, which continues to be managed by Snap-on Credit, is down to $35 million with the extended credit portion at $5 million.","Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $110.1 million in the quarter increased $18.4 million from $91.7 million last year. This quarter we made cash contributions of $10.4 million to our U.S. pension plans, including $10 million of discretionary contributions. Also in the quarter, in investing activities, cash of $52.5 million was used to support a net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $16.7 million in the quarter compared with capital expenditures of $18 million last year. For the full year, we continue to expect that capital expenditures will be in the range of $70 million to $80 million.","Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 61 days was unchanged from 2012 year-end levels. Excluding the impact of currency, inventories increased $25 million, including inventories from the Challenger acquisition. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.8x compared with 3.9x at year end. Our quarter end cash position of $174.7 million reflects the year-to-date net funding of $74.4 million of finance receivables, share repurchases of $62.1 million, dividend payments of $44.4 million and the acquisition of Challenger for $38.2 million, as well as capital expenditures of $31.4 million. These uses of cash were largely offset by cash generated from operations, including higher levels of net income.","Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 29.9% compares to 29.7% at 2012 year end. In addition to our $175 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets should we choose to do so. At quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities.","This concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Thanks, Aldo. Our second quarter was encouraging. The Tools Group growing and getting stronger, franchisee health metrics trending positive, new products creating excitement across our customer base, volume up 7%, profits continuing their rise to 15.7%. C&I, challenged by ongoing headwinds but offsetting the impact of the volume decrease with strong operating performance. Sales were down but profits were up, with an OI margin at 12.6%. And RS&I, expanding with repair shop owners and managers, independent and OEM dealerships, maintaining encouraging levels of profitability, organic growth at 4.9% and profits at 23%, a coherent acquisition focused on repair shop owners and managers, brought onboard with positive effects.","Overall, we believe the quarter's performance offers abundant evidence that the Snap-on future is playing out growth and improvement. And we believe we'll continue to advance along those 2 broad runways as we move forward throughout the year and into 2014. Before I close, I recognize that the encouraging results of the second quarter would not have been possible without our extraordinary franchisees and associates. Once again, I know many of you are listening to this call, so for the success and progress you've achieved, you have my congratulations. And for your contribution, commitment and support, you have my thanks.","Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from David Leiker from Baird.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Another continued progress here towards your goal ultimately, you're doing a great job. A couple of things here. As we look at C&I business, can you give us any color on the sequential performance there? I mean I understand the year-over-year, but are you seeing things stabilize when you look at it relative to Q1? Or are we still declining?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","No, I think, you're looking at similar -- I think we would characterize it as not congruent but similar to Q1. I think I said in Q1 that the military would -- military still down big time, but it's operating on a somewhat lower base and that's the primary difference between the 6%. I think it was down 6.3% year-over-year in the first quarter. It's down, what, 5.4% in this quarter. That's the major player. You got some goes ins and goes outs in terms of, okay, from critical industries, one critical industry is up in the first quarter, and the stars are maybe mining in the second quarter, things like that. You got those things up and down. And then in Asia\/Pacific, in the emerging markets you got, including Eastern Europe, you got some ups and downs in markets, but pretty much the same stuff. We are seeing another constant, though. A positive constant is that the effects of Snap-on value creation, I think, are working pretty well. And I think sequentially, the sales aren't much different but the profitability is higher. So that's looking pretty good. Whether we look at it sequentially or year-over-year, you can see the effects of Snap-on value creation working through, and you can see it actually, very dramatically in Europe, where the sales are down again high single-digits and the profits are up. So sort of a similar quarter for us.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And that well, too, for European tool business as well, that that is stabilizing here sequentially?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes, I'd say it's not decelerating downwards, yes, right, like it has been for a while. It's sort of stabilizing. We're not seeing worse news. I think that's a fair statement, yes.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then as we look at the tool business and you've had some great initiatives here over the last several years that drive productivity and sell more products to the van channel, it sounds like your starting to take that into your international market. Can you talk where you are in the timeline of that and whether we could see a similar response in those international markets that we've seen in the U.S. markets in recent years?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","It's very early days in that regard, so -- because the international markets are -- the vans are -- even though we kind of say the vans -- we talk about them as vans, the vans in England are slightly different than the vans in Australia, that are slightly different than the vans in U.S. So we're very early days in that. So I think you just got to stay tuned in that regard. Our van -- we're still building the marketing efforts. You can see, written on the face of the Tools Group financials, we're still spending more on marketing. For example, I think we've got, what is it, 42 Rock N' Roll vans now and that's up, and we're going to like 51 by the end of the third quarter. And we've got a new van called the techno-van [ph] . This is a -- remember that Rock N' Roll Cab Express was focused on tool storage so that it could kind of aid selling and tool storage where we have these new vans, 4 of them on the road now, which talk about diagnostics. Particularly the big-ticket diagnostics. You get on this thing, it's got flat screens all over the place. It allows the customer to kind of -- the shop owner or the technician to kind of work the thing on a big 16 by 9 screen so it's dramatic for them, and shows them all the features of the diagnostics. It's working pretty well for us. We have 4 of them now, we're going to, I think, about 10 by the end of the third quarter.","Operator","We'll go next to David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Great quarter, Nick.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Thank you. It's a -- I think this is a -- the OI margin was a high watermark -- the EPS is the high watermark. But you kind of -- when you're moving upwards, you kind of expect to have a high watermark every year. So...","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","A few questions for you, but before I ask my questions, I guess, the first one is just, once upon a time, 15% was kind of the target margin and I'm just wondering if at some point, we'll see a comfortable sort of talking about the next leg of your growth.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes, okay, I know. But before we get overheated about the 15%, remember that I kind of said mid-teens, but for like a year. So I kind of think it's more or less a year. And I'll point out to everybody, like I do every second quarter call, that our third quarter has some seasonal issues to -- seasonal -- and I don't want to say issues, but seasonal headwinds in terms of the vacations in Europe, and the van drivers have got to take vacations some time, and they usually do it in the third quarter. So our third quarter is usually, I'm not saying -- I'm not forecasting bad news or anything. I'm just saying it's more imprecise and more capricious than other quarters. And I think if you look over history, it's usually our weaker quarter. So you kind of got to look at it over a full year basis.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. First question, just on the tools business, you talked about the strength in big ticket. That 7% organic growth, is there some way we could sort of bifurcate that between ticket and transaction? What was the growth from the average ticket?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I don't really want to get into it in that granularity. I'll just tell you that big ticket was substantially, well, bigger than the 7%. It was quite strong. But I don't want to tie myself to that wheel of explaining big ticket and small ticket in every quarter because there's a lot of variation. But I will tell you that we -- and the reason why I don't know if you recall this, but the reason why we focus on big ticket is we learned that it is an indicator of weakness of the economics in the marketplace because during the recession, we saw some really weak numbers in big ticket, people demurred or they decided not to purchase and the fact that we're seeing this makes us feel pretty good about the marketplace.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Can you say what big ticket represents as a percentage of the segment?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, I don't know if I have that number actually, but I think you could say like between tool storage and big ticket diagnostics, my ballpark sausage math would say like a quarter, something like that.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Or 25%?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","But -- no, that's helpful, that's helpful.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Of course, that's not [ph] detailed, but I'd say around that number.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","And could you -- last quarter, you talked about sort of the 3-month pattern within the quarter. I wonder if I could get you to just address that again this quarter, how the 3-month pattern played out. Did you see strength at the end of the quarter, that was June...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","3-month -- well, we always see a little bit of strength at the end of the quarter. I don't know, I've been in business decades and I see this everywhere. And so you always see that kind of thing at the end of the quarter. But I'll tell you, it's what -- I wouldn't say it didn't happen like the first quarter. Remember what I said in the first quarter, I think, that I said the first quarter was dominated by the idea that things were very weak in the first couple of weeks of 2013. I think it had to do with uncertainty around sequestration and the -- what with the Social Security tax increase and the changes in the tax rates, and I think we've found that our customers were afflicted by the bad -- their perceived bad news for breakfast they were seeing every morning, and then we saw a build through the quarter. I'm not sure people thought -- kind of believe me, but I think this played out in the second quarter. Our Tools Group growth was at 3.5% or so on, or 3 and change in the first quarter, but we said it was stronger at the end, and I -- that growth carried on into the second quarter. But I wouldn't say in the second quarter, it was to the same extent as the first quarter. We didn't have some terrible time and then move on toward the end of the quarter.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Sounds like it was more linear. I wanted to ask...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes. And I'll remind you that we -- despite the fact we got 7%, we always say that we've grown at 4% to 6% organically in the Tools Group, is towards the bottom of that.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Right. So then on the RCI achievements, can you just talk about how much RCI contributed to the quarter?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Well, I can talk about it in terms of -- I mean, let's not talk about in terms of OI or something like that. But let's say, if you look at our margin improvement, 120 basis points, right, you could say 110 of that is restructuring, sure, but there was the stock plan that cost you 50, 60 basis points. Challenger has a weaker profitability than average, that's a 10 and 40 for market. So you put those kind of negatives together, it's about 100. Between volume and RCI, you got another 110 positives. So I'd say RCI is 80, 90 basis points of positiveness.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Was it fair to say most of that was in Europe?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","A lot of it was in Europe, but I would say that we had good progress in a lot of different places. Our RS&I, which is not -- is only 25% Europe, had good RCI. And Tools Group made some RCI contributions, too, if you peel their results, you'd find it. So I think we saw it everywhere but more in Europe, to a greater degree in Europe.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Last question, though -- if you take the industrials business out of C&I and isolate that, so excluding Europe and excluding Asia and just talking about your critical industries, you obviously had a negative comp, a big negative comp in the military business. It sounds like mining was good. If you view those as a portfolio of businesses it sounds like they were up year-over-year. Can you talk about the extent to which they were up year-over-year, and the extent to which they...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I would just say they were up single digits year-over-year, if you take out the U.S. Military. You saw it, we got good news in mining, the international business, we're finding we're reaching out. The cool thing about that is we're now seeming to be able to project ourselves better in that business even to the international businesses, so we felt okay about that. I just want to clarify one thing, I'm sitting here thinking, what -- your question about big ticket, were you asking the total corporation or Tools Group?","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","I was thinking about Tools Group but any way you care to describe it [ph]...","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Okay, I mean, I -- sorry, I gave you the total corporation. The Tools Group is more like 35%, 35% and change, yes, 35% to 40%, or something like that.","Operator","We'll go next to Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","You were talking a lot about new products, that's all good. Are you kind of accelerating some new product introductions as you're growing here? I mean, you always had a goal of 40 new products with $1 million of sales or more. Has that been accelerated?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes, it is. We're getting better at it. That's a simple point. I think our customer connection and our innovation, I think you've been to our Innovation Works, you can see where we -- we take customer observation up close to design and it's all part of Snap-on Value Creation Processes, but it didn't take -- Snap-on knew how to develop new products before, of course, and we had the idea of being in the workplace and observing it. But now we've boiled it down to repeatable and reliable processes and we get better at that. So we're getting better at documenting what we see, in other words, determining a sense of the practical, what's needed in the workplace. And then we're adding higher -- I don't want to say high tech because a lot of people have this stuff, but for us higher tech stuff like X-ray refractometers, and electron microscopes, and more use of finite element analysis, so we model in 3D printers, and that stuff. So we're sort of upgrading our engineering capability to more than it's ever been before. I'm not saying it's anything better than anybody else, but upgrading of where we had, and it's coming together for more new products. And I think I said that last year our new products, our hits that were $1 million sellers, were 6x or 7x what they were in 2006. So we're rolling out new products. And then I'll tell you what, this is an important thing because I was just on a van the other day, and I'm up here in Wisconsin, and a guy gets on the van and he says -- this is a guy who has been working for 25 years, the techs working on transmissions and I remember the guy's name, but I won't say it on the phone, is in our auto up here. And he says, jeez, I've got a huge number of ratchets, but look at these new ratchets, they're going to help me and save me a lot of time. So he bought 2 new ratchets, even though we had like 15 or 16 ratchets already. And so that's an important characteristic of our growth scenario, is that cars keep changing. And the faster we can bring out new cars guided by customer connection -- new products, new tools guided by customer connection, the better we grow, the more share we take. That was a good example of it the other day, and we're doing more of that.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Good. Good to hear. And then can you maybe just talk about Europe in terms of -- you had always said the Southern tier was weak, the Northern tier was holding its own. Are you seeing the Northern tier kind of slip here, talking about France, Germany? Lower [ph] countries?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes, France. I don't like to hear the word France, makes me -- gives me headache now these days. It wasn't so good last quarter. So France, yes, you're right. I mean, I think -- I don't want to overplay Southern Europe. I mean, Southern Europe is getting so small for us. It's getting a lesser and lesser factor, but Southern Europe was down but the core Europe, France, was down pretty -- was week this quarter. Benelux was weak. Germany was a little better, the U.K. was better, Sweden was weaker. In general, you're right. If you talk about year-over-year comparison, South got a little better, the core got a little worse, the periphery was good. So like I said, we feel good about Europe because -- about our SNA Europe business because one, we're not taking capacity down yet we're finding RCI improvements. We're finding productivity improvements so we have higher profitability on lower sales; and two, we haven't dismantled the value-creating nature of the business because anybody who has money that is in the periphery, places like Russia and Northern Africa and so on, and the Middle East, they're buying. So that's an endorsement that what's happening in Europe was still pretty strong, they're just waiting for the markets to come back.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","So the last question would be in terms of the emerging markets. You'd always said that that was 5% to 10% of sales. I would assume that that's trending closer to the 10%? Or has it exceeded that?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","It's over 10% now. It's over -- it's just over -- it's a slice over 10%. Of course, you realize our numbers aren't that precise and so on and all these, but it's over 10%. So we're moving upwards.","Operator","We'll go next to Liam Burke with Janney Capital Markets.","Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Nick, you talked about the profitability step-up in the C&I segment in Europe. Looking at the critical industries business without Europe, do you still see a gross margin step-up as well in the rest of the segment?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes, you see productivity improvements, of course. We spend in that segment to try to extend into Europe, for example. The idea, I think in my remarks, I talked about international aviation business as you know. And so if you just strip back the core business, you'll like the profitability of it. On the other hand, we have, like in the Tools Group, we have an overlay of spending to talk about penetration, but still I like the profitability of the business.","Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And you made the Challenger acquisition this quarter. Is the pipeline continuing to be healthy there on the acquisition front?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Sure. Yes. I mean, I think it's -- the Challenger is a great poster child for the type acquisition we'd make, not necessarily the size, although it's not a bad -- we like that size, but it doesn't mean we wouldn't do bigger, but it's right down our wheelhouse, we think, about giving us more to sell to one of our key customer bases. So we have a series of acquisitions that we keep looking at and Challenger was, I guess, the first one we've done in a while after the, I guess, credit company. I like to say the credit company being an acquisition, given that it was $800 million or so. And yes, we have a pipeline. We continue to work on it.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Adam Brooks with Sidoti & Company.","Adam Brooks - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Just a few quick questions here. Given your performance in C&I in the last few quarters, do you have a more optimistic view on the long-term margin? Can we get to that mid-teen range just within the segment, or has nothing really changed and this is kind of what you've been expecting?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I'm not quite sure. Let me try to answer what I think you asked me. I see this as a mature, a mid-teens -- I think I've always said, how I've done this, I've said, look we're going to the mid-teens, the components of that will be the RS&I group up around the 20s, the Tools Group kind of around the mid-group and C&I hanging around a little bit below that, but not -- but approaching mid-teens, and I have full confidence that that's the case. I mean, C&I, we're kind of happy about the C&I quarter. The 12.6% is pretty strong if you look at historical performance of C&I, and yet it's taken all these hits from the headwinds. I mean, that's headwinds city for us. You got Europe. You've got the military. It's a tougher place to be these days but they perform pretty well. So I see them moving on up. I'm not saying next quarter or something like that, but I just think the opportunities are very clear and we're confident in those businesses.","Adam Brooks - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay, and then maybe just a little bit on Challenger now that you have it under your belt just for a few months, maybe some color on any opportunities that you see now, anything that's gotten you a little bit more excited.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Look, I think, funny, when you acquire somebody, all of a sudden when you're touring these garages, you start noticing the names on the list more, and I was just, like I said, I was on a truck the other day, and it seemed like every garage had Challenger Lifts and I know that's not the case. They're not the largest lift manufacturer. So I think, one, talking to technicians, I found that it has a -- it reinforced my idea of great reputation. That's one thing. Secondly, we have opportunities to roll that business out into international. It's not an international business now, but we have equipment selling in international markets in Europe and in particularly Asia, so we're very excited about the opportunity to take that product portfolio and spread it into those places. And it's pretty important about emerging markets because you see, emerging markets they're building new brick and mortar all the time around auto repair garages, and the first thing that gets thought of when you're putting brick-and-mortar in your automotive repair garages is the lift. So if you have a strong line up there, it gives you a leg up in selling. We like that. So we're pretty excited about it.","Adam Brooks - Sidoti & Company, LLC","And do you think now, being under the Snap-on umbrella, you can bring the margins up on that business? Or are they where you think they're going to be?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I mean, I hope we can bring the margins up. I think we -- that's why we have Snap-on value creation. We think Snap-on value creation is safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement, imprinted on any operation makes it better. So one of the things we've always said about our, I think, have said about our acquisition strategy, is we acquire somebody coherent, so we get the synergies around sort of strategic alignment. It helps us with our customer base. But that doesn't diminish the idea that we have opportunities to make almost any operation better. We're confident of that.","Operator","We'll go next to Richard Hilgert with Morningstar.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Over in Europe, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, since that market is down as much as it is, what's your experience with the franchisees over there? How do you motivate the group? Are you seeing many of them fold up? And also curious about, are you seeing many of the independent mechanic shops closing up, too?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Okay. Let's talk about this. Europe is a little bit bifurcated. Let me kind of give you the landscape, remind you of the landscape a little bit. The franchisees, overwhelmingly in Europe, are concentrated in England because our van business mostly works where technicians own their own tools. So the places -- the place in Europe where they own their own tools is the U.K. That business has not been as affected by the downturn. It's had its weak moments but it isn't as -- it didn't have as much problems as the other businesses. And so, therefore -- having said that, though, we have worked very hard to make sure that our franchisee population stays the same. So the franchisee, we haven't seen any huge downturn in the franchisees in the U.K. And so that's maintained robust. We have some vans in places like Germany and Netherlands, but they're not really that weak -- they're not really that big. Most of the business in Europe is the direct and distributor business which we sell through SNA Europe and our other divisions, not the Tools Group division. And you remember that C&I is 33% Europe, RS&I is 25% Europe. They're way above the Tools Group. And so those businesses have been impacted. But they're broader-based and not just -- C&I is the -- the C&I business is another -- is an industry and culture and a lot of other different things. Now what we've noticed is, in Europe, that our customers we sell to distributors, our customers have not gone away. So it appears to us that the base, the customer base, is still intact. So the long and short of this is, I guess the long and short of my answer, is that we don't see any deterioration in the opportunity in Europe. We see the customer base still there. We believe the morale of our people are still pretty high because there's nothing like seeing your sales down and your profits up. You feel pretty good about it, so they feel strong. And because we believe in the opportunities going forward, it's why through all this restructuring, through all the RCIs, through all the restructuring we did in Europe, we didn't take out any capacity. That's one thing we demanded in terms of the restructuring plan. We demanded that no capacity go out. We reduced based on being able to do the same with more during this period. So I hope that answers your question.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. U.K., new car sales are actually up there versus the rest of the Europe which has been down most of the year. So I would imagine that you're still seeing fairly good business in the U.K. then?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes. The U.K -- look, the Tools Group was up, I think, about the same internationally as it was in the U.S. But the U.K. might have been at the, like at the lower end of that, but still up pretty good, like 4%, 5%, something like that. So still, I think, good.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right. On the CapEx, you've been running -- the run rates have been pretty low compared to what the full year expectation is. It's been 1.8%, 1.9% for the first and second quarters, percent of revenue, and your full year run rate is -- the $70 million, $80 million comes out to something like maybe 2.3% to 2.6% of revenue. We're going to see the third quarter and the fourth quarter being high 2%, low 3% spend?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes, I suppose. Look, I don't actually think of it that way. I kind of think that we're thinking about -- we have, what, 31.5% or so year-to-date. So okay, I think we still like a 70 to 80 number. There's a lot of variation from quarter to quarter on these things. And I still think the 70 number -- 70 to 80 is a decent number to forecast. So if that means going up in the second half, yes [ph] .","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Is there anything in particular in the second half of the year in terms of capital spending, any one big project or something that's ramping up?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","No. I don't think...","Aldo J. Pagliari","It's fairly broad-based. We have investments both in the U.S. and the international arena earmarked for the second half. It's pretty broad-based.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Yes, and then one last question. A large part of your success is your ability to bring out new product and be in tune with what the market needs, having new technologies or having new tools that meet a certain criteria that the market wants. And I was curious to know, do you have any kind of information or analysis on, say, the percentage of your product portfolio that is new over a certain time frame?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I do not. I think, look, everybody has a different view of this. But for me, I don't like -- I'm not a big fan of that metric. The metric we like is, and now I'll tell you why we like it, is a tool that sells $1 million in the first year. And the reason is because when you ride these vans, what you see is a new tool, the guys get on the van and get excited. And okay, they buy the new tool but then they buy a whole bunch of other stuff, too. So it drags other products with it. So for us it's a matter of not how many new products there are, but how many exciting new products or how many products make the hit parade. That's what I was talking to Gary Prestopino before, and so that's what we measure. And as I said, the number of new products last year that sold over $1 million in the first year, and we're pretty strict about this, was up 6x to 7x from 2006. So our innovation process and our customer connection process are improving. It's our life blood. Because if you think about this, we guarantee a lot of our tools for life, so how is it we have a business? And the reason is is because the guy needs, instead of 16 ratchets, he needs 18, because the cars change. That's the biggest driver in our business and that fits in with this innovation. And so, we seem to be doing better on that. So the metric I like to offer is, tools over $1 million, and that was over 50 last year.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Over 50 last year?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","Yes, over 50, you got it [ph].","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","In 2012? Okay.","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","2012, yes.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Sarah Hunt with Alpine.","Sarah Hunt - Alpine Woods Capital Investors, LLC","Quick -- a couple quick questions for you. One, you mentioned that you were doing fairly well with auto OE repair shops. So are you taking share from somebody? Or is that market just getting better?","Nicholas T. Pinchuk","I think you would have to say some of both. We'd like to think we're taking share. It's hard -- Sarah, it's hard to assess share in this space because we're basically 65,000 SKUs. Okay, if you add 3,000 more, is that taking share? I don't know. You see what I mean? And so, I think we do believe, though, our sales are getting better in these shops, we're selling more to each individual shops, the franchisees and the individual sales. Franchisees are selling more, the individual salesmen are selling more. So we believe we're taking some share.","Sarah Hunt - Alpine Woods Capital Investors, LLC","Okay. And then the next question is on interest rates. So we've seen a lot of movement in the last 4 weeks or so, based on various interpretations of what the Fed is going to do. For your own financing piece of the business, how rapidly do you need to or have to adjust as interest rates change? Or how are you looking at that now that you've got the finance portfolio as internal?","Aldo J. Pagliari","Sarah, this is Aldo. I think that actually we have a little bit of a headroom, I believe, in the interest rate arena. And the reason I say that is our finance receivables and contract receivables tend to be of relatively high interest rates in the market, reflective of the credit profile of the customers that we serve. And our philosophy is we finance the credit company long. And what I mean by that, if you look at our pro forma statements that are attached to the earnings release, we use the Snap-on average all in debt expense rate and that's at about 5.6% more or less at the end of June. So we don't use floating rate debt to really finance the receivable portfolio. And if today, if we had issued 10-year paper as an example, I'm guessing the rate would be about 3.6-ish, somewhere around that neighborhood. So you'd see, we still have 200 basis points of headroom before I think that our cost of funds would start to impact squeezing the spread of what we charge customers and what we pay.","Sarah Hunt - Alpine Woods Capital Investors, LLC","Okay, and that would really be a temporary, I'm guessing sort of a temporary issue, if rates are going up. I mean, unless they're steadily going up and you're chasing it, I would think that you're probably -- that, that would -- as rates go up, that gets reflected on what you charge folks. Is it not?","Aldo J. Pagliari","Sure, it would be. I think it would be a little bit of a lag effect because in some situations that we do charge rates that are sometimes the highest rates allowed by law depending on the circumstances and the profile of the customer, and those laws change probably on a lag basis, I'm going to guess, versus the open free-market rates.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Leslie H. Kratcoski","So this is Leslie Kratcoski. I'd just like to thank everyone for joining us today on the call and, as always, for your interest in Snap-on.

Thank you for joining us today to review Snap-on's fourth quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today, Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer.","Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance.

Both can be found on our website.","With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?","Nick Pinchuk","Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Today I\u2019ll start as usual with a view of our quarter \u2013 our fourth quarter, give you an update on the environment and the trends we see. And I'll take you through some of the turbulence we've encountered and the advancements we've made. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of the financials.","The comparative results for the quarter and the full year each include special non-recurring events that affected our as reported levels. So to provide greater clarity, as we have in the past, we\u2019ll refer to the amount excluding the one-time effect as an as adjusted number to make everything comparable. And when you look through it all, similar to the third quarter, Snap-on did see external headwinds in a number of areas. But we met those challenges and moved forward. We did have disparities from group to group and within each group, but overall we're encouraged by our position and our possibilities.","The fourth quarter demonstrated elements of progress that were somewhat attenuated by economic turbulence and challenged geographies and by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency. As in the recent past, we show progress in the U.S. with growth across most of our operations in that area. So volume in the U.S. continued it\u2019s upward trajectory, but our operations in Europe, they show countervailing weakness in several major countries.","And as I said, there was also a meaningful impact from currency translation and transactions. So we had significant headwinds. But once again, I think our advantages prevailed. Organic sales were up 0.6%, sales gains in critical industries and repair information and independent \u2013 and equipment for independent repair shop owners and managers and continued growth at the U.S. van channel. We had advancements in power tools and tool storage and customized tool sets. It all combined to circumnavigate the variations and move us forward overall.","Opco operating income before financial services of $171.4 million, including unfavorable foreign currency compared to $182.1 million in 2018, which included a $4.3 million one-time benefit from the settlement of an employee-related litigation matter. Excluding that legal matter, fourth quarter as adjusted OI was $177.8 million. Now RCI was evident in the quarter, but it wasn't able to offset the negative foreign currency and the economic weakness of Europe.","For financial services operating income of $62.2 million was an increase from last year\u2019s $56.1 million. That results combined with Opco for a consolidated overall operating margin of 22.5% compared with 23% last year or 22.6%, 22.5% this year compared to the 22.6% as adjusted, excluding the legal benefit last year. Our quarterly EPS of $3.08 was above the 2018 as adjusted EPS of $3.03. As reported Q4 2018 EPS including the one-time legal matter was $3.09. So those are the numbers in general.","Let's speak about the markets. We believe the automotive repair environment continues to be generally favorable. Having said that, in the areas serving vehicle OEMs and dealerships, we have seen some pause, lower new car sales in the years did impact dealer buying habits and the number of projects continued commissioned by the vehicle OEMs decreased.","For independent repair shops, however, the things look different. Based on what we've heard \u2013 what we're hearing from franchisees, from technicians, from shop owners, the optimism in the independent repair shops is strong and unaffected by new car sales. And our sales in that sector in the U.S. have been positive and they continue to be so. So we believe vehicle repair remains a favorable place to operate. But the critical industries we're seeing progress, strong activity in the U.S. aerospace, military, heavy duty sectors, somewhat offset by softness in the international area, centered on general industry and international aerospace.","But our overall activity trend continues to look quite promising and the trajectory of our critical industry business is clearly positive. Our Industrial division demonstrated the opportunities in critical industries. Overcoming the headwinds of Brexit and the general softness in Europe, registering gains driven by it's customized product kits, matching the product to the task. We do believe we're well positioned to confront the challenges of this particular period, making progress along our runways for growth, despite the turbulence.","We also have competence that we have continuing potential in our runways for improvement. The Snap-on value creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement. There are constant fuel for our progress, especially customer connection. Understanding the work of professional technicians and innovation, matching that insight with technology. We believe our product lineup is getting stronger every day and we keep investing to make it so.","You see, vehicles are getting more complex, technicians need assistance and so our products are getting more sophisticated to match the rising requirements. And Snap-on products are keeping pace. And our franchisees and our direct sales force, face to face with technicians are in the perfect position for showcasing our powerful new offerings and for demonstrating their use right in the workplace. It's a great opportunity in the changing environment of today and we're working hard to take full advantage.","So across the corporation, I would characterize our markets as mixed positive with significant potential yet turbulent from period to period and place to place. Now for the full year, sales up $3.73 billion represented an organic increase of 1.2%, a similar story to the quarter, growth in the U.S. buffeted by Europe. The U.S. franchise is arising, particularly turbulence in the UK van channel, critical industries growing against the wind and strength with independent repair shop owners and managers balancing the shortfall in OEM dealerships.","As reported, Opco OI margin for the year was 19.2% compared with last years 19.4%, excluding the one-time benefits in both years, the full year as adjusted Opco OI margin was 18.9%, including 20 basis points of foreign currency drag compared with the as adjusted 19.3% in 2018. And when we include the operating income from financial services, the $245.9 million, which rose $15.8 million, the consolidated operating overall margin for the corporation was 23.7% or as adjusted 23.4% flat with last years as adjusted level. So reported earnings per share for the year was $12.41, up 4.5%. And excluding the non-recurring events, the EPS was $12.26, up $0.45 or 3.8% compared to last years as adjusted number. So those are the numbers.","Now let's talk about the individual operating groups. Let's start with C&I. Fourth quarter reported sales for the group including $900,000 of acquisition related volume and $3.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency grew $9.2 million or 2.7%. Organic sales for the group increased $11.8 million or 3.5%. The period saw strong performance from our Power Tools division up double-digits, affirming that our innovative new product tools are resonating with automotive technicians.","Beyond that, the Industrial division registered low-single digit growth with mixed results across the industries and geographies. As I said, military was strong and U.S. and aerospace, heavy duty also rose overcoming decline in the international sector. For the first time in a while, a long time actually, volume for SNA Europe, our European-based hand tool business was off in the quarter, driven by weakness in several major arenas, including Germany, the Nordic countries and France. C&I\u2019s operating margin was $45 million, down $5.8 million, including $0.6 million of unfavorable currency. That reflected primarily the industrial gains being more weighted towards the lower military sector, diluting the group's operating income down to 12.8% compared to the 14.8% recorded last year, when there was a more typical balance of customers.","I mentioned earlier that our power tools operation registered a strong quarter, sales were up double-digits. Well that gain was on the strength of our new cordless products. Products like the new 14.4 volt, CTR762 3\/8 inch Ratchet, we call it the Brute. As the name would imply, it was designed specifically for automotive jobs that require substantial muscle, tasks like exhaust manifold removal, brake caliber replacement and general suspension work. The CTR762 Ratchet combines thematic-like power, 70 pound feet of torque output with the convenience of a cordless platform and the Ratchet mechanism, the head and the neck are strong, robust enough to handle even more force 158 pound feet of manual torque. It is a Brute and the technicians recognize it.","The new Ratchet also has a variable speed trigger for improved control and it can reach 175 RPM free speed. That means quick fastener removal. So launched on October and it's been well received and it's easily one of our hit million dollar products. Also in C&I, our torque product line is making great strides. Like we said, it was driven in part by a widening array of new offerings for customers and critical industries like our new powerful 18 volt cordless EvoTorque line, designed for railroads and wind turbans and natural resources and other critical industries where remote repair and maintenance is a norm. EvoTorque covers a torque range of 150 pound feet to 4,000 pound feet and it comes in six basic models, three single speed and three auto two speed.","And adding significantly, it's the result of the synergies made possible by Norbar's recent additions to the Snap-on family. The Evo's innovative design, what makes its power, is the combination of a powerful and robust Norbar gearbox and a Norbar beam transducer with an organized handle -- with an ergonomic handle and an 18-volt battery platform from our Snap-on power tools division. The result is a torque wrench that's compact, portable and accurate, plus or minus 3%, while similar tools are much less precise, generally within plus or minus 5%. Industry feedback has been quite positive, and the sales are pretty brisk.","Now let's turn to the industrial division, focused on critical industries outside the vehicle garage. Gains now accomplished for 13 straight quarters despite a weakening in Europe. And the ongoing positive trend has been driven by customer connection, extending our understanding of critical work, and that progress can be measured in a number of new tool solutions we offer each year.","Well, last year, we added almost 5,700 new products. It's a critical -- it's our -- it's critical to our industry -- critical industry lineup. That's quite a few products, 5,700. It's a design and logistics challenge to be sure but it's a large advantage with critical industry customers. We're rolling the Snap-on brand out of the garage with increasing strength. Critical industries is a great opportunity, and we're addressing the possibilities with new products aimed at solving the tasks of consequence that inhabit that critical arena.","Now on to the Tools Group. Organic sales are up 1.3%, with continued growth in the U.S. operation, up low single digits, a positive that was again, this quarter, offset by a decline in international operations, principally in the UK. Operating income in the quarter was $54.3 million and compares to $57 million in 2018. The OI margin was 13.2%, an 80 basis point decrease, including 40 basis points of unfavorable currency, the turbulence in the UK and the investments we're making in training and field support to expand franchisee selling capacity to match the demands of our more sophisticated products and to capture the opportunity in the changing repair environment.","In the quarter and throughout the year, the Tools Group did confirm the underlying market-leading position of our van network. We believe the franchisees are growing stronger. That's clear in the franchisee health metrics we monitor each period. They continue to trend favorably, and that positivity was acknowledged by multiple publications all listing Snap-on as a franchisee -- franchise of choice. This quarter, Snap-on was once again ranked among the top franchise organizations, both in the U.S. and abroad.","We were again recognized by the Franchise Business Review, which, in its latest ranking for franchisee satisfaction, listed Snap-on as a top 50 franchise, marking the 13th consecutive year we've received that award. We were also ranked number two among all franchises in Entrepreneur Magazine's 2019 list of Top Franchises for our Veterans. And abroad, Snap-on was ranked number one in Elite Franchise Magazine's top UK franchises, rising three spots from last year and finishing above many well-known international brands in the publication's largest-ever competition. So despite the difficulties in the UK economy, our franchise remains very positively regarded. To me, that's good news for the future.","Now this type of recognition reflects the fundamental strength of our franchisees and of our van business in general and would not have been possible, it would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of innovative new products developed through our strong customer connection, leading to customer connection, leading to a multiple -- to multiple new innovations as a result of our insight and experience in a changing vehicle repair environment.","One of the latest additions to our lineup, an example of this is our Milwaukee-manufactured GM head bolt socket developed from connections with a loyal Snap-on technician. The 0.5-inch drive 13 millimeter socket enables efficient head bolt removal and installation on General Motors' light truck gen-5 V8 engines. The socket special drive design summons the torque necessary to break free even heavily corroded head bolts, and the 4-inch socket height allows technicians to clear the rocker arms in the GM engine design, making repairs easy, even in the difficult GM V8 engine compartment and believe -- another great example of customer connection.","And believe me, just as another subject, and believe me, we're working hard to strengthen our tool storage lineup. The effort is \u2013 and the effort is bearing fruit. Tool storage is up in the quarter and up in the year. We recently add the KRSC430A professional grade shop cart to add \u2013 to our lineup on mobile tool solutions. It\u2019s a new 40-inch cart that makes it easy to move even very heavy tools from bay-to-bay and it offers a sliding split top \u2013 split lid, which allows quick access to frequently used tools, manufactured in our Algona, Iowa plant, right in the heartland.","The heavy-duty cart body is entirely welded with a double-wall design for lasting strength. It also features interchangeable doors, customization to fit any job. The initial launch went quite well, and it\u2019s clear the new cart will be another one of our hit products. Well, that\u2019s the Tools Group, expanding its success in the U.S., balancing the international operations, continuing to develop innovative new product, building underlying strength.","Now RS&I, volume in the fourth quarter was $335 million. That\u2019s down organically, 1.5% with gains in sales of undercar equipment and diagnostics and repair information products being more than offset by decreases in the business focused on vehicle OEMs and dealerships. It was another turbulent period for that lumpy project-driven OEM sector.","RS&I operating earnings in the quarter were $87.2 million, down $200,000 from last year, including $200,000 of unfavorable foreign currency. OI margin for the group was a strong 26%, up 30 basis points from last year\u2019s level and with basically driven by growth in information products, growth in information products paving the way to that 26%.","Along those lines, in terms of innovation products, our Mitchell 1 division which provides the software independent shops continues to succeed pursuing customer connection and innovation, bringing great new products to improve shop efficiency. We just launched \u2013 our Mitchell 1 just launched. Our new online appointment scheduling capability, in addition to our already extensive repair shop management software, vehicle owners can now request an appointment with just a few clicks on the shop\u2019s website automatically alerting garage schedulers of their request.","It\u2019s a great efficiency tool. As part of our Mitchell 1 shop management for independent garages. And it\u2019s another example about how Snap-on value creation is authoring the continuing upward trend at Mitchell 1. Speaking of Mitchell 1, we just opened a new facility for that information business and enhanced operating and design environment. We\u2019re investing in Mitchell 1 and we expect more success.","RS&I also launched in the quarter. Our new PRO-LINK Edge heavy-duty \u2013 it\u2019s a heavy-duty diagnostic handheld, a bigger screen, easier to use interface, faster vehicle connection time, updated software and increased vehicle coverage. Snap-on is already the leader in heavy-duty diagnostics. The PRO-LINK Edge will expand that advantage. It was just introduced at the end of the year and so far it\u2019s looking good. We keep driving to expand RS&I\u2019s position with repair shop owners and managers, offering more new products to sell developed by value creations process that are added by our strategic and coherent acquisitions and we\u2019re confident that\u2019s a winning formula. Well that\u2019s our fourth quarter.","Arena\u2019s \u2013 areas of both challenge and advancement. We believe, we leave the year stronger than when we entered. And in the end, an EPS for the quarter of $3.08 up from the as adjusted $3.03 from last year and for the full year, as adjusted EPS at $12.26 rising from the as adjusted $11.81 overall progress, hard one against turbulence.","Now I turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?","Aldo Pagliari","Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6.","Net sales of $955.2 million in the quarter were up 0.3%, reflecting a six tenths of 1% organic sales gain, $3.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $6.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales gain this quarter reflected low single-digit growth in both the Snap-on Tools and Commercial & Industrial segments, partially offset by a low single digit decline in the Repair Systems & Information group. Similar to the trends, we experienced in Q3 of 2019 overall, on a year-over-year basis, sales to customers in the United States increased, while sales in Europe continued to exhibit weakness.","Consolidated gross margin of 47.2% compared to 48% last year. The 80 basis point decrease primarily reflects increased sales and lower gross margin businesses, 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 29.3% increased 40 basis points from 28.9% last year. Q4 of 2018 included a $4.3 million or 40 basis point benefit associated with the legal settlement that Nick mentioned earlier.","Operating earnings before financial services of $171.4 million, including $2.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $182.1 million in 2018, or $177.8 million as adjusted for the legal settlement. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 17.9% of sales, compared to 19.1% last year or 18.7% as adjusted.","Financial services revenue of $83.9 million and operating earnings of $62.2 million increased 1.5% and 10.9% respectively from 2018, primarily reflecting year-over-year growth in our financial services portfolio and improved portfolio performance resulting in lower provisions for credit losses.","Consolidated operating earnings of $233.6 million, including $2.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $238.2 million last year, or $233.9 million as adjusted. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings of 22.5% compares to 23% last year, versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter as adjusted operating earnings margin of 22.6%, which reflected a 40 basis point benefit in the legal settlement. This year\u2019s operating margin was lower by 10 basis points. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 22.3% compared to 22% last year.","Finally, net earnings of $170.6 million or $3.08 per share, including a $0.04 unfavorable impact associated with foreign currency, compared to $175 million or $3.09 per share a year ago. In 2018, excluding a $0.06 per share benefit from the legal settlement, adjusted earnings were $3.03. For the full year 2019, fully diluted earnings per share of $12.41 increased 4.5% over $11.87 per share as reported last year.","Now let\u2019s turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $352.9 million in the quarter, increased 2.7%, reflecting a 3.5% organic sales gain and $9.9 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $3.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic growth included a double-digit gain in our power tools business, a mid-single-digit increase in our Asia Pacific operations, and a low-single-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries, particularly sales to the U.S. military. These increases were partially offset by a low single-digit decline in our European-based hand tools business. ","Gross margin of 35.5% decreased 300 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to increased sales and lower gross margin businesses, including sales to the military. Sales in the fourth quarter to the military were up significantly both year-over-year and sequentially. The operating expense margin of 22.7% improved 100 basis points from 23.7% last year, primarily due to higher volumes and lower expense businesses. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $45 million, decreased $5.8 million from last year and the operating margin of 12.8% compared to 14.8% in 2018.","Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $411.7 million increased 1.1%, reflecting a 1.3% organic sales gain, partially offset by $1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase includes a low-single-digit gain in our U.S. franchise operations, partially offset by a low-single-digit decline internationally. Gross margin of 40.2%, including 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects remained unchanged from last year.","The operating expense margin of 27% increase from 26.2% last year, primarily due to higher field support investments. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $54.3 million, including $1.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, decreased the $2.7 million from last year, while the operating margin of 13.2% including 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to 14% in 2018.","Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $335 million decreased 1.4%, reflecting a 1.5% organic sales decline and $2.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by $2.6 million of acquisition-related sales. The organic decrease includes a high single-digit decline in sales to OEM dealerships through our equipment solutions business, partially offset by low-single-digit gains in both sales of undercar equipment and sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers.","Gross margin of 47.7% increased 20 basis points from 47.5% last year, while the operating expense margin of 21.7% improved 10 basis points from 21.8% in 2018. Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $87.2 million, compared to $87.4 million a year ago, and the operating margin of 26% increased at 30 basis points from 25.7% last year.","Now turning to Slide 10. Operating earnings from financial services of $62.2 million increased 10.9% versus the fourth quarter of 2018. Revenue of $83.9 million was up 1.5% from a year ago. Financial services expenses of $21.7 million decreased $4.9 million from last year\u2019s levels, primarily due to decreases in the provision for credit losses, reflecting improved portfolio performance as well as lower variable compensation and other costs. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1% and 1.3% in the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018 respectively.","The average yield on finance receivables in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 17.5% compared to 17.7% last year. Principally, reflective of the credit quality of customers originating loans over the past several months. The respect of average yield on contract receivables was 9.2% in both periods.","Total loan originations of $262.4 million, decreased $4.7 million or 1.8%, primarily due to a 3.7% decrease in originations of finance receivables, partially offset by higher originations of contract receivables, principally franchise finance.","Moving to Slide 11 \u2013 year-over-year \u2013 our year-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.1 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.86 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio grew $24.3 million in the fourth quarter. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.8% for U.S. extended credit remains stable and reflects the seasonal increase we typically experienced in the fourth quarter. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, the largest portion of the portfolio trailing 12-month net losses of $49.4 million represented 2.91% of outstandings at year end, down 6 basis points sequentially, supporting continued stabilization in the portfolio\u2019s credit metric performance.","Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $196.7 million in the quarter, decreased $19.2 million from comparable 2018 levels, primarily due to increases in working investment and cash paid for taxes. Net cash used by investing activities of $41.4 million included net additions to finance receivables of $24.6 million and capital expenditures of $21.6 million.","Net cash used by financing activities of $139.2 million, included cash dividends of $59 million and the repurchase of 435,000 shares of common stock for $71.2 million under our existing share repurchase programs. Full year 2019 share repurchases totaled 1,495,000 shares for $238.4 million. As of year-end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $359.6 million of common stock under existing authorizations.","Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivables increased $2 million from 2018 year-end. Day sales outstanding of 67 days were unchanged from 2018 year-end. Inventories increased $86.6 million from 2018 year-end, primarily to support the introduction of new products, higher levels of demand across critical industries, including demand for U.S. manufactured hand tools, as well as to improve service levels to our customers. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.6 compared to 2.9 at year-end 2018.","Our year-end cash position of $184.5 million increased $43.6 million from 2018 year-end levels. Our net debt to capital ratio decreased to 22.1% from 24.2% at year-end 2018. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities. As of year-end, we had $193.6 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.","That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I\u2019ll briefly look at a few outlook items for 2020. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. We currently anticipate that our full year 2020 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 23% to 24%. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?","Nick Pinchuk","Thanks, Aldo. Snap-on fourth quarter. Near-term uncertainties, unfavorable foreign exchange, a downdraft in Europe, in particular, Brexit difficulties in the UK, but progress against those headwinds, significant progress. Overall advancement hard won against the headwinds.","Opco organic sales up 0.6%, OI margin of 17.9%, down 80 basis points from a 2018 as adjusted result impacted by the mix of critical industry sales being more weighted to the lower margin military sector by unfavorable currency and by spending to enhance the franchise network. Overall advances, continuing strength in RS&I and the repair information business, 26% margin.","Favorable trends in the industrial business, gains in the U.S. van channel, and there were significant strides in strengthening our product line across the organization, more customization, more sophistication to match the opportunities of the changing repair environment. And a finance company recording gains in the NOI, which combined with opco to reach an OI margin of 22.5% in the quarter compared with an as adjusted 22.6% of last year. EPS for the quarter at $3.08, above the as adjusted $3.03 recorded last year.","Overall, we believe firmly that our business is strong, and we\u2019re confident that going forward, we have the opportunity, the position, the product and the team to confront the headwinds and continue on our positive trajectory through 2020 and beyond.","Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I\u2019ll speak directly to our associates and franchisees. I know many of you are listening. To the entire Snap-on team, we recognize the results of the quarter and of the year are authored by your individual and collective efforts. For your dedication to our progress and for your commitment to our corporation, you have my thanks.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Curtis Nagle with Merrill Lynch.","Curtis Nagle","Good morning. Thanks very much for taking the questions. So I guess, first, Nick, a question for you. How would you describe, I guess, the operating environment of tools this year versus last in terms of things like relative competition, underlying fundamentals, product rollout for you guys? Would you expect organic growth to be higher, kind of stay the same? And that optimism that you\u2019d mentioned in the call, would you say that\u2019s perhaps higher than, say, a year ago?","Nick Pinchuk","I would say so. I think, look, I believe I said it right at the beginning. I believe we leave 2019 stronger than we entered. Our product line is stronger than ever. We are seeing progress in the \u2013 not as fast as maybe we would like in the U.S. van channel but it is moving upwards. This was a stronger quarter than in the past on a year-over-year basis. And so we feel pretty positive about that. I think when we talk to our franchisees, we understand, and the technicians, we understand our underlying strength.","The simple point is, can we arm our franchisees with enough efficiency to wield the complex products, the sophisticated products to sell in the environment they are as opposed to being capacity bound or time bound? I\u2019ve talked about the time-bound nature of the van business for a long time. That\u2019s why we\u2019re investing in it, and we\u2019re starting to see the results. Against that though, we see turbulence in the UK. The UK was actually a little worse this quarter. On the other hand, Brexit did get signed, and so therefore, without any inside information about the time line, that should make it better going forward.","So I feel okay about that.","Curtis Nagle","Great, fair and sure. And then a quick follow-up, I guess, for Aldo. How should we think about the balance of product and customer mix in 2020 in C&I in terms of how this could impact the gross margin? Perhaps we see continued pressure because military seems to be doing well, maybe that\u2019s a one-off. Could that reserve \u2013 reverse in terms of that mix impact to gross margin?","Aldo Pagliari","Well, the military, Curt, I\u2019d say, in the quarter was probably the highest sales of one particular job in the military that we\u2019ve talked about before. You call it the GMTK, the general mechanics toolkit, so actually, it was up at a double digit in year-over-year comparison as well as sequentially as I mentioned. It will be a significant contributor in Q1, however, not probably to the same level as it was in Q4. And on top of it, what was lacking in Q4 were some of our international sales in the critical industries. They tend to be pretty good margin contributors so if they come back to what I call more normal levels, you get a little bit more cover and get a more traditional gross margin mix. So we welcome the sales to the military, don\u2019t get me wrong. And they\u2019ll move forward over time, but they should have less of a mix effect as you get a little bit more normalized impact in the overall critical industries.","Curtis Nagle","Okay. Fair and sure. Thanks very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn","Thank you, good morning. I had a question about the Snap-on Tools margin and the seasonality. You used to see that always ramp 3Q into 4Q, and last year\u2019s assumed anomaly at the time but that repeated this year into the seasonal volume ramp. So wondering what\u2019s changed there. Is this a new dynamic with kind of sequential gross margin pressure, 3Q to 4Q for SOT?","Nick Pinchuk","Actually, it may be a new dynamic for us. It wasn\u2019t just last year. I think there have been two years of this kind of move downwards. Some of that may be driven by, we have robust Christmas promotions, and they \u2013 sometimes, they tend to be a little bit lower margin. I think the thing that you might ask, okay, it\u2019s 40%. The gross margin was 40%. 40.2% was flat with last year, and last year, we had significant discounting associated with the Diagnostics business. You might be asking \u2013 well, you might ask, why isn\u2019t that up? And I think the story is this.","Last year, we had that discounting. We had some effect of currency but not as much, and we had some small effect \u2013 some effect of the UK. This year, we got 40 basis points of currency and 20 basis points of the UK effect, and so you put those in and you end up having 60 negative. And so we had margin improvement actually year-over-year in the quarter. It\u2019s just that higher currency impacts in the quarter associated with the Tools Group transaction effect and the UK still being a problem for us. So they overcame that and flattened the gross margin.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. But taking this year in isolation, what caused the decline sequentially?","Nick Pinchuk","Well, I think we\u2019ve seen generally a decline sequentially. And what has happened in the decline, what drives the decline, we\u2019re seeing more and more of this is our factories tend to be seeing it like, for example, when you roll into the fourth quarter, especially if \u2013 as the hand tool business has risen and become a higher portion of our product, the factories, which is the most integrated product in the United States, you see things like over Thanksgiving and over Christmas, you see the effects, those expanded hand tool factories, the effects of those weighing a little bit more than the third quarter in terms of the days off they have. So you have worse absorption in this quarter. Fundamentally, your sales are going up, but your absorption is going down because of the days worked.","That\u2019s, I think, what we\u2019ve seen. If you go back two quarters, when we didn\u2019t have this discounting and this legacy sales in the fourth quarter that was really the effect. And I think we\u2019re going to see that going forward in this kind of calendarization.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. And just wondering if \u2013 looking at the inventory increase and the lower turns, wondering if there was any reserving in the quarter for excess or obsolete inventory or if possibly, that\u2019s something that might be an outcropping of the higher inventory levels at some point?","Aldo Pagliari","I don\u2019t think anything more than normal, Chris, this is Aldo. The nature of our inventory is such that when you get the lower market cost or market criteria, we feel pretty good about where our levels of scalability are at. I think the biggest increase in inventory actually is new product introduction. And the take-up pace was not as rigorous as we would like for that, and we\u2019re confident looking to the future. But as you know, we keep targeting a higher level of sales growth. And when we don\u2019t achieve it, the product is there and available but it\u2019s in inventory rather than in the sales line.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. And then last one for me. The CFO was down a bit year-over-year from very high levels last year with a fair amount of inventory pressure. Just wondering if that\u2019s a good setup for pretty strong CFO growth in 2020 that we could expect.","Aldo Pagliari","Well, certainly, I see there\u2019s no reason that inventory has to grow to the same degree it did in 2019. We try to take a measured look at that. Some unique characteristics in 2019 were that we have more sophisticated kits among our critical industries customers. As I said, we had a heavy dose of new product introductions. We\u2019ll have elements of that in 2020, but as you\u2019re suggesting, there\u2019s no reason that the increase in inventory has to be to the same magnitude as what we saw in 2019.","Christopher Glynn","Great. Thanks, Aldo.","Operator","We will take our next question from David Leiker with Baird. And David, your line is open. Please check your mute button.","Hearing no response from David, we will move to Bret Jordan with Jefferies.","Bret Jordan","Hey, good morning, guys. Could you talk a little bit about diagnostics in the U.S. van channel? I know you guys were doing some educational work at the franchise event back in August. And maybe an update as to how we\u2019re doing with ZEUS and Apollo.","Nick Pinchuk","Okay. I can give you versions of that. The \u2013 we had strong \u2013 we\u2019ve had \u2013 we continue to train the people and we\u2019re working with our field force, our diagnostic sales developers and the techno vans and so on, the field source to try to, just as you say, try to expand the capabilities associated with that. We had a \u2013 it was up double digits and it was up very strongly in the third quarter.","Diagnostics was down in the fourth quarter, selling to the franchisees, but the movement from the franchisees to the end user kind of followed more traditional paths. So I would figure that the \u2013 if you step back and you look at it and you say, okay, up in the third quarter, kind of down in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s kind of a continuing the same level as before. So therefore, we would say we have more work to do in trying to get our franchisees to understand how to sell this product. It\u2019s kind of moved forward.","And ZEUS had a good quarter, by the way, so that was an encouraging data point for us. So with the ZEUS good quarter, we feel that there is some progress because that\u2019s the most difficult thing to sell. So now we\u2019re going to have to make sure we work on Apollo and TRITON to get those stronger. And so I suppose one of the lessons we get out of this is we may have cracked some of the case for ZEUS but we need to do a little bit more on of Apollo and TRITON.","Bret Jordan","Okay, great. And then on the UK, you talked about it being turbulent but may be getting better with Brexit. Is there any change in the van count over there, given the challenges that those distributors are seeing?","Nick Pinchuk","Yes, there has been a change, but not \u2013 it\u2019s very small actually. It moves up and down. I think in the middle of the downturn, it was down a little bit but would bounce right back up. So I would say not more than ordinary motion really. It hasn\u2019t really changed that much. I mean, the UK has been a headache for us really, and it punches above its weight in terms of \u2013 on the margins of our performance. But we\u2019re working hard to try to get it under control. We\u2019re working with the products. We\u2019re trying to train the franchisees so they can make the most of things. Generally, it\u2019s short payback items they\u2019re selling. It\u2019s the big payback items that tend to come down in uncertainty.","With Brexit being signed, I don\u2019t know. But I think as people understand what\u2019s going to happen in post-Brexit, the certainty returns and the automotive repair market snaps back in the UK. I pretty much believe that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to play out. We\u2019re just happy that they signed Brexit on January 31.","Bret Jordan","Yes. And Aldo, one question, I guess, around the credit book. Are the loan terms, as the credit quality is going up and obviously reflected in lower rates, are you seeing shorter loan terms as well?","Aldo Pagliari","No. With the \u2013 generally speaking, with the higher price point of products, generally speaking across the board, the franchisees elect up to five-year terms. And I don\u2019t see that \u2013 that actually has trended slightly upward. The migration has been more to a little bit north of four years is the average in the overall portfolio. So I haven\u2019t seen really much of a change in that.","Bret Jordan","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from David Leiker with Baird.","David Leiker","Good morning, can you hear me?","Nick Pinchuk","Good morning, we can hear you, yes.","David Leiker","Let\u2019s just chuck that one up to user air. Two things. If we look at the Snap-on tools field support spending, I think we\u2019re probably on two full years of that right now. Is that fair?","Nick Pinchuk","No, I don\u2019t think so. I think we started it maybe in the fourth quarter of last year. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s two full years actually. That\u2019s my memory about it, yes. And we\u2019ve kind of ramped it up here. So\u2026","David Leiker","So how do you \u2013 can you talk a little bit about how you determine, calculate if that\u2019s working and driving incremental returns of kind of return on investment or some kind of metrics of how do you gauge the success and executing and delivering on that?","Nick Pinchuk","Well, there\u2019s \u2013 I think there are twin axes on this, David. I think one is the overall \u2013 we\u2019re focused on the U.S. really, of course. And this \u2013 I think we made that clear. There\u2019s a separate effort going on to remediate in the UK. I think our number one effort is what happens with sales in the U.S. van channel and it\u2019s been moving upwards. So this quarter was better than the last in terms of a year-over-year basis. So we can feel it moving upwards, maybe not as fast as everybody would like and maybe not as fast as we would like, but that\u2019s an indication that we\u2019re moving the boulder upwards.","We\u2019re expanding the capacity to sell. And that\u2019s one issue. Then there are the local issues, just like question recently, if we\u2019re focused on diagnostics, what happens with the individual diagnostic platforms? Because after all, this training gets done platform by platform by platform by platform, and types of customer by types of customer and types of customers. So we kind of segment it that way, platforms by customer.","And so the success in those nodules or how we evaluate it. And it\u2019s not just training. It\u2019s also things like we\u2019re adding a new set of vans, we call the Total Shop Solutions. We\u2019ve been expanding and we were at nine last quarter and 15 this quarter, not associated with diagnostics, but this is associated with other more longer payback sales like hand-spin tire balancers and diagnostic workstations, which include full storage box and so on.","So we evaluate how those things are occurring in each of the territories. So I think I\u2019ve said for a long time that one of the boundaries of the tools \u2013 the van business is the time and so what we\u2019re doing is trying to make the time more effective. Best thing is the sales. You figure that happens. If the sales goes up, that\u2019s the best thing to do. But we also have a sub-analysis. So that\u2019s how we do it. And we think it\u2019s working. I sure like to see it work faster, but we believe it\u2019s a way forward because we \u2013 go ahead, sorry.","David Leiker","Well, as I say, so if you look at that in terms of the absolute spend versus the driving through of revenues, is there a point \u2013 where is the breakpoint where you get revenues growing faster than the spend in that? And is there a point in time that, that spend actually can come back down at all? So how do you see that playing out?","Nick Pinchuk","Well, look, I see it playing out. When we start to get up around our target, we start to experiment about cutting back. I think the way the world works for us, and it\u2019s always worked this way, is we spend to capture sales growth. And then as we establish ourselves in that sales growth level and that sales growth level is defined by capacity, the capacity of the franchisees to sell, once we hit that, we try to improve and become more efficient in supporting that behind that wave of capture.","So once we get to like x percent growth, we say, \"Okay, we\u2019re there. That\u2019s our level.\" We kind of try to figure out how to do it more efficient. So we\u2019d like to be in the territory where we feel comfortable that that\u2019s an acceptable growth that\u2019s commensurate with the market, with the opportunities. Once we do that, we bring it back.","David Leiker","So with that running at low single digits in the U.S., you\u2019re getting close to that growth metric then?","Nick Pinchuk","Yes, but not as close as I\u2019d like. Yes, close, closer. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, that\u2019s true. Yes, it\u2019s hard but that\u2019s our method, David. We capture territory and then we make it more efficient.","David Leiker","And then just one item for you, Aldo. You didn\u2019t mention it and we\u2019ve had some conversations on this, but is there any update on the bad debt provision, the change in accounting there? Any framework you can give us to have a sense of what that\u2019s going to mean when you adopt it in Q1?","Aldo Pagliari","Well, I\u2019ll say this, the official and final reporting of that will be in our K, which is not so far away. I mean, we plan on releasing our K at the \u2013 before the end of next week, actually. So I\u2019ll leave that out there as a statement. But I\u2019ll say this, the workaround, it\u2019s been fairly intense and well done. And I\u2019m pleased with the energy we put into it so far. And you\u2019re talking about CECL. For others on the call, it\u2019s a reference to the adoption of CECL, which becomes effective for the corporation in January of 2020. So in essence, the true reporting of it occurs at the end of the quarter, actually. But I\u2019ll say this, is that right now, David, I\u2019m expecting that our overall adjustment will be something less than $10 million will be that order of magnitude. But the final number will be solidified within about a week.","David Leiker","Okay. Great. Thank you much.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Stember with CL King.","Scott Stember","Good morning, guys.","Nick Pinchuk","Good morning.","Scott Stember","Could you guys give a little bit more color on some of the other areas within tools as far as growth, like power tools and hand tools?","Nick Pinchuk","Sure, sure. This quarter, hand tools was down some, power tools up double digits. So like I said, power tools had a terrific quarter. And principally, tool storage up, diagnostics down some. So by the way, I encourage people not to get too overheated about these quarterly numbers because they move up and down, depending on what happened last quarter and what \u2013 when the new products hit. For example, power tools is strong this quarter because we have a great new product and everybody has been waiting for it. And so it rolls out. And so that\u2019s one of the reasons why it\u2019s strong now.","Because remember, our view of the world is the franchisees are capacity limited. We\u2019re building up. That\u2019s why the franchise business in the U.S. is growing again. But it\u2019s kind of a \u2013 you get a new product, it tends to squeeze out some of the other products. But that\u2019s the rollout. Hand tools\u2019 down this quarter after up for the year, but power tools up fairly robustly. Tool storage up again, diagnostics down. It\u2019s sort of the story this quarter. It was a different story last quarter.","Scott Stember","Got it. And moving over to RS&I, I know that we\u2019ve had a few really good quarters of sales comps. Part of it was the OEM business was coming back, but we see a return of choppiness there. How did you do in RS&I for the full year, again, on an organic basis? And given your commentary about some of the reluctance of some of the dealerships because of the weaker car sales, do you expect to get back to positive comps in 2020?","Nick Pinchuk","I think we\u2019re not sure what happens with the OEM dealership business. That\u2019s the thing that we say, well, that\u2019s a lumpy business. And having worked for Ford myself, I can tell you that they \u2013 this is a business that changes cash flow every month for five year. They change their attitudes every month. So we\u2019re not sure. If I look out and looking at the IHS forecast, they\u2019re forecasting down 1% to 2% next year. I would think we\u2019d kind of see the same kind of stuff out for a little while.","Now RS&I was up low single digits for the year. I think interestingly though, 26% for RS&I, I think, is the highest-ever gross OI margin, so they had an okay quarter from that perspective. It\u2019s just the sales were down because of that OEM business. But the information business, so where independent repair shops was up again, which was what drove that 26% because it\u2019s high-margin business, and Mitchell 1 is a \u2013 has been a consistent grower for us.","So if you look at the RS&I businesses, I\u2019ll step back and talk about them, Mitchell 1 seems to grow consistently. We just invested in a new building. We didn\u2019t do so without thought. And therefore, we think that\u2019s got a great future. Diagnostics tends to go up and down but we\u2019re training the franchisees to be more comfortable with the new groundbreaking product of intelligent diagnostics. We expect that to go forward.","The OEM businesses, which is about a third of the businesses, it\u2019s hard to predict, it can be lumpy. And significantly, lost in the sway here is the equipment business showed a positive this quarter for RS&I, and it hasn\u2019t been positive for a while. So we view that as a fairly \u2013 even in a turbulent quarter, we view that as one sign of good news. So going forward, I think \u2013 we think the OEM business, uncertain. Maybe it will be the same as this quarter for a while. But the rest of the businesses have good opportunity.","Scott Stember","All right. And just last question. Your view of the business longer term, are you maintaining your expectation that the company, longer term, could be a mid-single-digit grower on an organic sales basis?","Nick Pinchuk","Yes, yes. I think the market is there. I think we got the product and stake. I think we\u2019re capacity-bound. I\u2019ve said it \u2013 if you listen to us, for years, we\u2019ve said that one of the boundaries associated with the van channel, space and time, we\u2019re up against a time boundary. It\u2019s clear. You can see it, the way the world works. And so we have to break through that like we did in previous years. We had to come up with ways to make those franchisees use their time better, and we can do that, we think.","And then in the C&I business, if you\u2019ve 13 straight quarters for industrial and with 5,700 new products, now that gets more and more complex and it drives inventory, but the dogs are buying the dog food there. The only thing is, in this particular quarter, one of the big businesses was low margin. That\u2019s not going to happen forever.","Scott Stember","Got it. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","Good morning, everyone. A couple of questions. First of all, just given the amount of time we\u2019ve spent talking about the field support, can we at least put a number on what the impact was to margins, Aldo?","Aldo Pagliari","Well, I don\u2019t recall all the field support specifically. Obviously, it\u2019s an investment that we make along with other internal metrics that we have, David. But you could see the drag that it creates in the OE section of the financial \u2013 of the Snap-on Tools Group. But we\u2019re not going to dimension it exactly.","David MacGregor","So you can\u2019t give us some order of magnitude or any quant on that?","Aldo Pagliari","No, I don\u2019t think so.","David MacGregor","Okay. I guess, what percentage of your franchisees are up year-over-year in the fourth quarter?","Aldo Pagliari","What?","David MacGregor","What percentage of your franchisees would have seen growth in the fourth quarter?","Nick Pinchuk","I don\u2019t think we know that necessarily directly.","Aldo Pagliari","Yes. The U.S. is up low single digit, as we\u2019ve said, and you\u2019ll get a mix within that portfolio. Some, of course, will be higher, some will be lower than that. But we\u2019re not going to parse among the number of franchisees that are up or the number that are down.","Nick Pinchuk","Generally, we parse them by quintiles. And if you see the business up, it generally tends to be uniform across that. So what you find is, is that roughly 60% of the \u2013 60% to 65%, maybe two-thirds of the franchisees will be sort of in the same direction as the overall business. That\u2019s usually what happens in any one quarter. And those numbers swap in and out. It doesn\u2019t change that much from quarter-to-quarter, really.","David MacGregor","Okay. And then it seems like we\u2019ve got to a point in our world where people are buying online, and I\u2019m sure that technicians are no exception to that rule. You\u2019re selling tools on your website. Can you just talk about it? And maybe this is a way to sort of tie in with the whole notion of the time boundary you referenced in answering the last caller\u2019s question. But what\u2019s the opportunity to develop online sales here? Maybe find a way to pass the credit back to the appropriate franchisees that customers registered to. But talk a little bit about the opportunity to grow online as\u2026","Nick Pinchuk","I think our customers don\u2019t \u2013 we offer them online. But generally, our customers value the presence, the face-to-face presence of the franchisees. That is \u2013 I think that is the point. The idea of providing up close and personal counseling and guidance on how the explanation of the tool, which are getting more, I guess, more complicated, more sophisticated and the guidance on how to use it, then the idea of providing credit up close and personal, and then the idea of having a replacement right there is what our franchisees and our customers seem to like. They could go online but they don\u2019t necessarily avail themselves of that.","Now if we thought we were getting pushed by that, we would be looking at it a little bit more, but hand tools are up and you would think that would be the number one product line that would be bought online since it\u2019s less complicated than people tend to know hand tools. But the hand tools are up for the year. In fact, they\u2019ve been more robust over the past couple of years. So that\u2019s our kind of view of it.","We try to use the online capabilities to enhance. It\u2019s one of the things we try to do to enhance the efficiency of the franchisees in terms of their collections, in terms of the way they communicate with their customers on specials and those kinds of things. Those are the opportunities we see. We see the connection either through social media or traditional online, either Twitter, either Facebook or Twitter or in fact, texting or just email, not that many people use e-mail anymore. And for our franchisees to communicate and make our customers aware of things, that\u2019s part of our view of online and enabling the franchisees to be more efficient.","David MacGregor","So how would online growth look for you right now?","Nick Pinchuk","Well, I think it\u2019s not.","David MacGregor","Off a small base, obviously. But I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what\u2026","Nick Pinchuk","It\u2019s probably up some but not very significant. It\u2019s not very significant because online for us, our customers are looking at the idea, the support they get from the franchisees. So what we try to do is keep that franchisee supported in place because it\u2019s part of our advantage, and secondly, try to use whatever the electronic media is to enable the franchisees more, just as I said.","David MacGregor","Okay. Well, maybe I could follow up offline with you, it\u2019s an interesting topic. Thank you.","Nick Pinchuk","Sure.","Operator","And at this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Sara Verbsky for any additional or closing remarks.","Sara Verbsky","Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I turn the conference over to Snap-on's Vice President of Investor Relations, Sara Verbsky. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Sara Verbsky","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review Snap-on's second quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today, Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions. ","As usual, we have provided slides to supplement our discussion.

Both can be found on our website. ","With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start with the highlights of our quarter. I'll speak about the general environments, the trends we see, some of the headwinds we've encountered, and I'll talk about our progress. Then Aldo will give you a more detailed review of the financials. We believe that our second quarter again demonstrates Snap-on's ability to continue with the trajectory of positive results, overcoming both ongoing headwinds and the period-to-period variations, the variations of the current environment. We are encouraged by the results. like every quarter, we had turbulence from geography to geography and from operation to operation. North American -- North America was positive, with clear growth in that region across our operations and our groups. In this quarter, that progress was attenuated by a slowdown in Europe and the U.K., but also in the other some important markets like Germany. ","An example of that variation was evident in the Tools Group where overall organic sales were about flat. We had gains in the U.S. that were offset by organic decreases in international markets. ","There was also a meaningful impact from currency in the quarter, translation and transactions, significant headwind. So there was variation. But once again, I think you can say our strengths prevailed. ","Now the results. Second quarter. As reported sales were $951.3 million flat, down 0.3%, but it included a $19.5 million or a 200 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign currency and an incremental $1.1 million from acquisition. On an organic basis, sales grew 1.6%. The opco OI was $189.9 million, declined $3.2 million, but more than accounted for by $5.9 million in negative foreign exchange. Opco OI percent for the quarter was 20%, down 20 basis points from last year, again due to negative currency, but still representing the second highest level recorded by the corporation in its current configuration. ","For financial services, operating income grew to $60.6 million from last year's $57.8 million. That results combined with opco to raise our consolidated operating margin to 20.2 -- 24.2%, basically flat since 2018.","EPS was $3.22, up $0.10. So those are the numbers. From an overall macro market perspective, we do believe the automotive repair arena remains favorable. For the Tools Group, the technicians, we did see headwinds in certain economically impacted geographies like the U.K. and Australia, but we also sought continued gains in the U.S. And as we look forward, we do see further opportunities for advancements as the vehicle techs encounter even more complex repairs. ","The other side of auto repair, Repair Systems and Information, or the RS&I group, encouraging progress in the quarter, expanding our Snap-on's presence with repair shop owners and managers, capitalizing on a broader product line, a return to growth with the rise in the OEM programs. We like RS&I's potential moving forward. The repair shop is changing, upgrading. Both dealership and independent shops in RS&I is capitalizing on that trend with database solutions, great software products like our continually improving and gaining Mitchell 1 car and truck repair information software; powerful databases that are easy to use, helping the shop fix it right the first time and efficiently. ","For the commercial industrial group, the other piece of our -- the other market we play in, or the C&I group, sales were up across a number of sectors and geography and the critical industry's significant growth in the military. And our specialty torque division, an ongoing upward trend, meeting the need, which we always said for increased precision authored by more automated systems and growing momentum in new markets in C&I in markets like India, which has become a real strong strength for us. So overall, the results remain favorable. ","Tools Group. Continued improvement in the U.S., offset by headwinds in international markets, RS&I, resurgence in OEM dealerships and continued strength in repair information offerings and gains in multiple sectors and geographies across C&I. That progress outweighed the challenges, and results confirm it. And the strong operating income margin clearly demonstrated once again the leverage and the power of Snap-on Value Creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement. Snap-on Creation developing new products and solutions, borne out of insights and observations gathered at our customers' workplaces, which together with RCI, helped again drive the progress and overcame the current difficulties. That's the macro overview. Let's move to the segments. ","In the C&I group, organic sales were up $6.2 million or 1.9%. Now including $10.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency and an additional $1.1 million of -- from our acquisitions, second quarter as reported volume declined $2.8 million. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income was $48.9 million, about the same as last year. Operating margin was 14.6%, 10 basis points better. ","We've mentioned in April the pieces of this are these: that we mentioned in April the importance of torque in a world of increasing autonomous operation and precision. Well, that makes the positive performance of our specialty torque division, a high single-digit increase in volume in the quarter particularly encouraging. ","Europe overall was challenged, but SNA Europe delivered yet another quarter of sales growth achieved in a difficult environment in critical industries, variation across the segments, but overall, it was up showing positive progress and a promising outlet -- outlook. We're confident and committed to extending in critical industries. 11 straight quarters of growth authored by our strengthening lineup of innovative new products matched to the test. Our military segment had a strong quarter, capturing significant long-term contracts and product breadth and strength; a positive difference. And as I said, our torque business has been marching upwards, becoming a clear success story. And our recent innovation played a big part in that. Innovation evident in great new products like the ATech FR125 electronic torque wrench, launched early -- it was launched early in the quarter. It's got an extended range up to 125-foot pound, and it's enabled with our new torque angle adjustment capability. ","These days, automotive repair and maintenance procedures require a torque above 100-foot pound. And the new ATech 125 produced in our City of Industry California plant covers those expanded requirements. But beyond the torque capability, the unit has a stronger pivot point, utilizes our rugged dual 80 ratchet design. Combining both of those, the pivot point and the ratchet design, the 80 tooth ratchet design combining for more durability. ","It also comes with our patent pending. This is a cool thing, Multi Axis Gyro Compensation system. So that automatically adjusts torque results when the ratchet head is angled. So it provides and produces significantly greater accuracy when making measurements. ","Accuracy, versatility, durability; all-in-one. Technicians all over are looking to replace multiple mechanical wrenches with a single ATech 125. Snap-on's already the leader in electronic torque, and the ATech 125 makes us stronger and that will become more important as we go forward. The first shipments were delivered in April, and sales have been robust. ","Also in the last quarter, helping to mitigate some of the geographic turbulence, we launched a new window scale torque wrench in Europe, the Bahco 74W. It's aimed specifically at European -- or to the preferences of our European customers. It's produced by our recently acquired Norbar operation, and you know that's in the U.K., with the chemical resistance -- it's got its chemical resistant soft-touch handle using the well-regarded Bahco ergonomic design tools, makes for a really comfortable feel when you use the wrench. Each wrench also features a durable and accurate clicking mechanism that provides tactile and audible signals and is capable of standing 100,000 cycle, so it's quite durable. ","Consistent with the present -- also consistent with the preferences of Europe's techs, settings on the 74W can be quickly adjusted using a built-in window showing a dual scale for Newton meters or foot pounds. It's quite different than what we use in the U.S. in terms of the way we see torque, affording greater clarity and ease when reading torque value. Sales of the overall European torque line have increased double digits since the launch. 74W is shaping up to be quite a success for us. Well, that's C&I, a promising quarter, moving the down the runways for growth and delivering profitability. ","Now onto the Tools Group. Organic sales flat, down, I guess, 0.2%, reflecting a lower -- pretty much reflects lower sales in the international operations, predominantly in the U.K. and Australia, being partially offset by gains in the U.S. So pattern's similar to last quarter really. Operating earnings were $71.3 million, down $7.7 million, including $3.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency or a margin -- a wide margin of 17.6% compared to 19.2% from last year. That margin includes 70 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency and higher investment in field support activities, enabling the demand for our hand tools and underpinning the training for our Intelligent Diagnostics. So the Tools Group, another positive quarter in the U.S, balancing international turbulence. ","We do believe our van network remains quite strong. In late June, I spent some time with dozens of franchisees at the NHRA Nationals in Chicago. They had a quite positive outlook on the position and on the prosperity. But beyond the windshield surveys like that, we see other indications of continuing strength like the franchisee health metrics, we -- those are the numbers we monitor and evaluate regularly. Again this quarter, they remained favorable. So qualitative and quantitative indicators, both positive. And the positivity is just not from our own internal lens. It's reflected in the external view. In fact, this year, we're once again be acknowledged by the -- by an outside publications. Snap-on was recognized as the #18 in Entrepreneurs Magazine Best of the Best for 2019, the annual Franchise 500 ranking. That evaluates companies for more than 150 data points in areas of costs and fees, size and growth, franchise support, brand, power, financial strength and organizational stability, among others. Our position in this year's ranking represents a substantial rise over last year. And once again, once again, we scored highest in the Tools Distribution category. In fact, we've held that top spot for some time. ","Now this type of recognition, I think reflects the fundamental and contemporary -- fundamental contemporary strength of our -- for our franchisees in our overall van business. And it would not have been achieved, we would not have the enthusiasm for the franchisees without -- with other franchisees without a continuous stream of unique new products, hand tools were up in the quarter, and it was driven by great new products like our F80MP multi-position ratchet. Features ahead, that index is in 16 positions across 240 degrees, a number of different much variability, giving it much better -- and that gives it much better access to fasteners around blind corners. And it's also a 2-in-1 unit that functions both as an offset fixed-head ratchet and as a speeder with a 360-degree crank for quickly tightening or loosening fasteners, it's quite versatile. Sales have been strong, and we already have plans for additional drive sizes, different handle grips and more colors is going to expand into a full line. ","Another product of impact was the Snap-on SRPCR series. It's a snap ring plier line launched this quarter showcasing a significant design improvement. Snap-on ring pliers are versatile units that can be used on both internal and external rings, switching from compression to expansion mode, accommodating a variety of repair and removal and assembly tasks. This new design allows the technician to execute that compression-to-expansion conversion up to 80% faster, utilizes a quick-release push button rather than the thumbscrew mechanism that's common on competitor products and is on our previous model. Pliers, they're manufactured on Milwaukee plant. So we can do this because of advanced forging -- called forging techniques and high alloy steel, creates the strength and durability require -- to require to enable that new design and support that speed. ","Beyond the push buttons system, that unit also features extended jaws, making it easier to access hard-to-reach retaining rings. And to top it all off, it's got an ergonomic pushing for considerably more comfort and control. No wonder it's popular. Our new tools are, in fact, making a difference with the franchisees and in the Tools Group. ","Now on to RS&I. Sales of 348.8 -- $348.9 million, up $5 million, reflecting a $11.7 million or a 3.5 -- or a 3.5% organic gain, primarily due to return of the OEM dealerships, higher sales in the OEM dealership business, the essential tools business. Unfavorable foreign currency translation of $5.9 million was an offset, bringing the as reported rise to 1.7%. ","Now RS&I operating earnings are $88.6 million in the quarter, including an offset of -- including an offset of $1.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared with $88.7 million in 2018. The operating margin was 25.4%, down 50 basis points from last year's pretty strong 25.9%. The variance primarily effects -- reflects that the higher sales of OEM essential programs, which boost as a sales but tend to have lower operating margins than the average RS&I activities, still good margins. ","Having said that, we continue to clearly see abundant runways for growth in RS&I and working to take advantage. In addition to the new diagnostics and repair information offerings we have, we recently introduced a B2000 John Bean aligner that replaces the traditional workstation design with a more compact device utilizing an ordinary tablet and a new camera, a beam configuration, it's got considerable speed and ease-of-use and reported in a small overall footprint. It introduces imaging alignment to the compact segment of the market, and the reception has been pretty enthusiastic. ","Also in the quarter, we introduced our new unique calibration array. We're really excited about this, new calibration array, for Advanced Driver Assistance System, so ADAS. One of the prominent trends in -- it uses ADAS as one of the prominent trends in later-model vehicles. It's developed by our diagnostics team and special target operators, each option recalibrating collision avoidance systems after body repair or as glass replacement or even a wheel alignment, for all makes and models of torque facing cameras, the ADAS calibration system -- our ADS calibration system was ideal for general repair locations and for collision stocks, enabling those independent facilities as of now finalizes the repair without having to visit the OEM dealerships. That's a great advantage when operating in a more complex world, in a more complex sensor-enabled later operating on more complex sensor-enabled later-model vehicles. It's very popular. It's going to be even more popular. ","So to wrap up, RS&I, improving position for repair shop owners and managers, growth in OEM dealerships, driving organic sales gains, expanding product lines, margins down some, but still quite strong. Those are the highlights of the quarter. ","Tools Group, mixed; U.S., up; international, down. C&I recording an overall positive performance especially in torque. And RS&I expanding, strengthened critical repair information and raising its OEM project activity. Progress along the runways for coherent growth and advancements down our runways to improve. Overall sales increasing organically, 1.6%. Opco operating income margin, a strong 20%. The second highest level ever recorded by the corporation. EPS, $3.22, up again despite the headwinds. It was another encouraging quarter. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?","Aldo Pagliari","Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $951.3 million in the quarter were down 0.3%, reflecting a 1.6% organic sales gain, $1.1 million of acquisition-related sales and $19.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales gain this quarter principally reflected double-digit growth in sales to OEM dealerships and the repair systems and information segment and low single-digit growth in the Commercial & Industrial segment. ","Sales in the Snap-on Tools segment were essentially flat, but included low single-digit gains in the U.S. franchise operations. Overall sales to customers in the United States increased across all segments while sales in Europe, particularly the United Kingdom, continue to exhibit weakness on a year-over-year basis. ","Consolidated gross margin of 49.8% compared to 51% last year. 120 basis point decrease primarily reflects increased sales in lower gross margin businesses, 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. ","The operating expense margin of 29.8% improved 100 basis points, primarily due to organic sales volume leverage, including higher volumes and lower expense businesses, lower performance-based compensation costs and RCI savings. ","Operating earnings before financial services of $189.9 million, including $5.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $193.1 million last year. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 20.0%, including 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to 20.2% last year. ","Financial services revenue of $84.1 million and operating earnings of $60.6 million increased 2.6% and 4.8%, respectively, from 2018, reflecting a year-over-year growth in our financial services portfolio as well as lower provisions for credit losses. ","Consolidated operating earnings of $250.5 million, including $6.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $250.9 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin was 24.2% in both periods. ","Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 23.6% compared to 23.8% last year. During Q2 2018, our tax rate included a 20 basis point benefit related to the implementation of tax legislation in the United States. ","Finally, net earnings on a reported basis of $180.4 million or $3.22 per share included a $0.09 unfavorable impact associated with foreign currency compared to $178.7 million or $3.12 per share a year ago. In Q2 2018, excluding a $0.01 per share benefit related to taxes, adjusted earnings per share was $3.11. ","Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with C&I Group on Slide 11, sales of $335.0 million in the quarter decreased 0.8%, reflecting a 1.9% organic sales gain and $1.1 million of acquisition-related sales, which were more than offset by $10.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic growth included a high single-digit gain in our specialty tools business as well as the low single-digit increases in both the segment's European-based hand tools business and to customers in critical industries. ","Gross margin of 38.6% decreased 80 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to increased sales and lower gross margin businesses, including higher sales for the U.S. Military and to customers in India. The operating expense margin of 24% improved 90 basis points, primarily due to benefits from organic sales volume leverage, including higher sales and lower expense businesses and from RCI savings. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $48.9 million compared to $49 million last year, and the operating margin of 14.6% increased 10 basis points from 14.5% in 2018. ","Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $405.8 million decreased to 1.5% primarily due to $5.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Organic sales were essentially flat, reflecting headwinds in the United Kingdom and higher sales in the United States. The organic sales included a mid-single-digit decline internationally, nearly offset by a low single-digit increase in the United States. Gross margin of 45.1% decreased 80 basis points from last year, primarily due to 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. The operating expense margin of 27.5% increased from 26.7% last year, primarily due to higher field support investments and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. ","Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $71.3 million, including $3.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, decreased $7.7 million from last year while the operating margin of 17.6%, including 70 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to 19.2% in 2018. ","Turning to the RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $348.9 million increased 1.7%, reflecting a 3.5% organic sales gain, partially offset by $5.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales gain includes a double-digit increase in sales to OEM dealerships, principally through the segment's equipment solutions operation. Weakness in Europe again impacted RS&I's overall sales growth in the quarter. ","Gross margin of 46.3% decreased 100 basis -- 180 basis points from 48.1% last year, this is primarily due to the increased sales to OEM dealerships and higher material and other costs, partially offset by RCI savings. Sales for the equipment solutions operation tend to have lower gross margins and lower operating expenses associated with such activity. ","The operating expense margin of 20.9% improved 130 basis points from 22.2% last year, primarily due to the aforementioned effect of higher sales to OEM dealerships and the benefits from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $88.6 million compared to $88.7 million last year while the operating margin of 25.4% compared to 25.9% a year ago. ","Now turning to Slide 10. Operating earnings from financial services of $60.6 million increased 4.8% versus Q2 of 2018. Revenue of $84.1 million was up 2.6% from a year ago. Financial services expenses of $23.5 million decreased $0.7 million, primarily due to lower provisions for credit losses, partially offset by higher expenses related to the growth in the portfolio. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.1% in the second quarter of 2019 and 1.2% in the second quarter of 2018. The average yield on finance receivables in the second quarter of 2019 were 17.6% as compared to 17.7% last year. The average yield on contract receivables was 9.1% in both periods. ","Total loan originations of $263.4 million decreased $12.7 million or 4.6%, primarily due to decrease in originations of finance receivables resulting from lower year-over-year Snap-on Tools Group sales of big-ticket items. ","Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.1 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.8 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio grew $15.2 million in the second quarter. The 60-day-plus delinquency rate of 1.4% for the United States extended credit remains stable and reflects the seasonal improvement we typically experience in the second quarter. ","As it relates to extended credit for finance receivables, the largest portion of the portfolio, trailing 12-month net losses of $50.4 million represented 3.0% of outstandings at quarter-end, that's down 9 basis points sequentially, supporting continued stabilization of the portfolio's credit metric performance. ","Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $145.5 million in the quarter decreased $41.4 million from comparable 2018 levels, primarily reflecting net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including payments related to last quarter's legal settlement. Net cash used by investing activities of $65.2 million included net additions to finance receivables of $29 million, capital expenditures of $28 million and $8 million for the acquisition of Power Hawk, which provides rescue tools and related equipment for a variety of military, governmental and fire rescue and emergency operations. ","Net cash used by financing activities of $73.1 million included cash dividends of $52.5 million and the repurchase of 365,000 shares of common stock for $60.1 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of the end of June, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $445.3 million of common stock under existing authorizations. ","Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable decreased to $8.5 million from 2018 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 66 days compared to 67 days in 2018 year-end. Inventories increased $52 million from 2018 year-end, primarily to support higher levels of demand across critical industries, including demand for U.S. manufactured hand tools, new products as well as to improve service levels to our customers. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.7 compared to 2.9 at year-end 2018 and 2.7 in Q1 of 2019. ","Our quarter end cash position of $164 million increased $23.1 million from 2018 year-end levels. Our net debt-to-capital ratio decreased to 22.5% from 24.2% at year-end 2018. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities. And as of quarter-end, we had $154.6 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding, a reduction of $22.5 million since year-end 2018. ","That concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Thanks, Aldo. Well, that's our quarter. Encouraging progress. I think you could describe it -- we would describe it as encouraging and progress achieved against variation and headwind, challenges for sure. European operation, down. But a particular macro-related difficulty in the U.S. and the strong headwinds of unfavorable currency. We overcame with some encouraging positives: North American volume up; the Tools Group up in the U.S; new hand tool products driving enthusiasm and gain; at C&I the investments in torque, paying off with robust performance, matching the move to autonomy and precision and advancements in critical industries, it's gaining new military business and long-term contracts. And RS&I, a return of the OEM programs for vehicle dealerships, continuing strength in Mitchell 1 shops software. It all came together, overcoming the considerable difficulties of the current environment. Sales up organically 1.6%, OI margin at 20%, clearly among our best so far. And EPS up again to $3.22. And we believe we have the capabilities, the brands, the products and the opportunities to maintain that upwards earnings trajectory throughout the year and on into the quarters that follow.","Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our associates and our franchisees, Snap-on team. I know many of you are listening in or hear the call later. Once again, we made progress against the headwinds, and that advancement reflects your energy and efforts, your extraordinary contribution to our enterprise, for your achievement and accomplishment in prevailing, you have my congratulations. And for your dedication and your commitment to our team, you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Scott Stember with CL King and Associates.","Scott Stember","Just going over to the Tools Group, low single-digit increase in the U.S. I think we were mid-single digits in the first quarter, but it seems like some of the delta there is related to higher ticket items. That said, could you just give us a breakout of what tool storage, hand tools and specifically what some of the other categories during the course?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Yes. You kind of got it set. I mean, I think if you look at the originations, originations are down. So that's the big-ticket items were weaker. I think originations were down like 4.4%, 4.6% in the quarter. But generally, it's around diagnostics. ","If you look at that view, the diagnostics were lower than year-over-year. The Apollo launch was much bigger, it launches into a broader category of customers then the TRITON, which we launched. The TRITON launch was successful versus its prior people, but its prior iterations of that particular segments. And so we're pleased with the launch, but what we've learned with launching Intelligent Diagnostics is our franchisees tend to focus on it, and it tends to be a time-intensive sale. So it has uncertain results for the rest of the diagnostics lineup, and that's what happened in this time. ","There also is a pretty strong activity around hand tools. Hand tools is up again in the quarter, and I think one of its highest levels ever so. Hand tools are pretty good. So that sort of the story in that quarter, that kind of balance in that situation. ","Now you can look at the numbers, and you can see the margin and so on. So we had gross margins in the Tools Group. I think they were down 80 basis points. And there's about 50, 60 basis points of currency. So fundamentally, gross margin, that gross margin, the profitability was defined by what happened internationally where one of your levers around pricing can't use anymore, gross margins in the U.S. were actually up a little bit.","Scott Stember","Okay. And just going over the pond over to the U.K. because it seems like that's where the lion's share of the tools weaknesses abroad, seems like it's getting a little bit worse. And we've all know about Brexit and some of the impact over there, but maybe just talk longer term about the business over there as it compares to your automotive repair market and the expectations for that business?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Yes, I can do that. I can -- Go ahead, sorry.","Scott Stember","No, go ahead.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Yes. Look, I can do that. Yes, Tools Group, depends on how you look at the U.K. U.K. was down higher percentages year-over-year in this quarter. It's down I think it was down high single digits in the first -- in last quarter, the first quarter, it was down double-digit, somewhat double digits in the second quarter. But actually, sequentially, the number was about the same. So I'm not sure how to really react to that. You understand what I mean? So it may be -- it should have been higher because it was the second quarter or not. We don't think there's anything structurally wrong with that business. I've been over to U.K. just recently, myself, talked to people and I talked to a number of people who are in the government there, and they say, \"People are quite uncertain.\" And one of the things we know about uncertainty in our business, we saw this in the big recession in 2009, is the technicians have -- are cash-rich, but confidence poor. If they start getting attracted or discouraged by this bad news for Brexit with the macro issues, they start back and away from longer payback items, and that's exactly what's happening in the U.K. You're seeing a lot of backing away from tool storage and diagnostics. So that's what's ailing the U.K., really. ","You can see it in the -- you can see it in the originations. Originations are down in the U.S. but they're down bigger in the international and so that's really the situation. So when the confidence comes back, we believe we got a robust business there.","Scott Stember","Got it. And then just lastly...","Nicholas Pinchuk","God, I don't know. The problem with that is I don't know when the confidence is going to come back, but I think people feel like the Brexit situation is going to get solved. And I think it doesn't even have to be so. People have to believe that they see it way forward and now bring it back. I don't have any better answer than that for you.","Scott Stember","Got it. And just the last question before I jump back in the queue is RS&I. Nice bounce back of OE dealership business. Can you just flash out how some of the software products did? Just try to frame that out as well as diagnostics.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Yes. Look, I think -- sure. Well, diagnostics is down in the Tools Group, and diagnostics in RS&I tends to follow that. It also had some external sales in the U.K. And the U.K. has kind of shut down a little bit so you see some of that. It sells around in addition to the Tools Group itself, the diagnostic sales some direct to certain elements of the U.K. government. That is a weakness from year-over-year. So diagnostics is down in the quarter, but Mitchell 1, Bahco. So Mitchell 1 is a great business and all we see is excelsior ever upward in the repair information products, car and truck repair. That's what I'm trying to say in my message there is that repair information for the garages seems to be going pretty well. ","We believe that our diagnostics business goes well once we get our franchisees and the technicians comfortable with the huge power of Intelligent Diagnostics. Intelligent Diagnostics is a great product, just more complicated to sell because it's got so many nuances and features. So you saw -- you kind of -- so that all played out, I guess I'm giving you the features, but that all played out for repair diagnostics information in the independent shops to be about flat, about flat in that. And the OEM business, of course, was up nicely, and equipment was sort of flattish. I think it was up a little bit. So that's how diagnostics rolled out in the quarter, I mean not RS&I rolled out in the quarter.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn","I had a question about the progress of TRITON if we go into a little more detail. I'm curious about the interplay of channel fill into sell-through. How the staging original rollouts goes, and if that's one of the drivers in the second half?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Yes. It was a -- no, it was a national launch, but one thing that happened in the first two quarters of this year is we call them first time activations. Basically, we can see when a technician activates the software. And when the technician, not the franchisee, so we sell to the franchisee, he sells it into the industry, into the marketplace and that the technician who buys it get it activated. Well, activations are actually running ahead of our sales. So in fact, this is kind of a positive. TRITON itself, off to the franchisees met our expectations. It's not the segment that Apollo is. So met that expectations and, in fact, a little bit better than the last launch. The activations, and the activations always follow, and the activations so far are running ahead of our expectation. So we think that's kind of a positive sign, although who knows what will happen tomorrow, but the thing is that seems to be positive. So TRITON itself, I think, worked pretty well. ","We've seen this phenomena. When we launched the Intelligent Diagnostics now, it tends to draw the attention of the franchisee who only has set 24 hours a day, and they tend to spend more time selling it because they love the product. Everybody loves the software, harder to explain, little more expensive. And so it tends to diminish what happens in the other product. That's what happened this time. That's why we had the downturn. So we had a good launch, but yet the other product didn't sell as the way they sold another period to the way we expected.","What we're doing is -- so what we're doing is, I should add, what we're doing is, is that one of the things you see the OE and the Tools Group, one big component of that is the training seminars and the support systems for the franchisees to sell and to train the technicians and how to use this stuff and to realize how truly important it is and how they can't live without it.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. And then kind of a broad question on the second half. We're generally kind of banking on kind of a holding pattern within brand trends and mixed trends in the first half? Or there's some mix naturally kind of revert or unwind?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Look, I don't think anybody -- we wouldn't be happy with continued sales in the U.S. at 1% for an extended period of time. We wouldn't be happy with that, of course. Yet, we do get variation from period-to-period. So that's why we think this is not a bad thing in this situation with these economics, but we would -- we stick to our view that this is a 4% growing business. And absent huge turbulence like what's happening in the U.K., I would call U.K. a singularity. I would call Australia being under economic arrest at least in our sector. So I kind of can outpour those and say, \"It really is in our business.\" We would expect it to get better. ","Now the third quarter is always kind of squarely because we have the SFC and so on. And I'm not saying anything I haven't said 10 times before, but we still feel pretty confident. I think one of the challenges for us is to get that Intelligent Diagnostics down to an easier sale, a more natural sale and to get it out there, so it doesn't weigh down on our business. And then, of course, they keep coming with the new products. The hand tools are hotter than heck. If we can keep up that momentum, that's got to accrue to us. So if you look at our capital expenditures, we raised capital expenditures, and part of it is making the hand tool deliveries much more smooth, much smoother because we're investing in new facilities and our distribution systems in Crystal Lake and other places, in our hand tool factories like Milwaukee and other places. And some of our expenses in the quarter, the field support expenses was to support that distribution of hand tools, which were all through that distribution. And so on and so on.","Christopher Glynn","Yes. Just had a last one. Any updates on capital allocation or strategic levers? And in particular, as you look at valuations, it's been a lower for a little while here. Any benefits to going private? What kind of board-level discussions do you have in some of those respects?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Yes. We have discussions about this kind of thing all the time and so on. I think our -- we feel that -- look, we talk about capital allocation, we say we think this business has a lot of runway. So we think we can keep -- the best use of our capital is to invest in the business. And you can see it now we're investing in the hand tools. We're investing in the training of the franchisees to be able to sell this new -- this transformative diagnostic product better so we see that. Then we say, as we say, we have a dividend, we want to preserve the dividend and make sure it keeps going. We've never reduced it over the years. And then we look at share buyback. We bought back a significant number of shares in the quarter. I mean, I guess it supposedly can be a -- everybody can have a different view of what's a significant number of what we think was more than before. And we take advantage of when the stock price is in an inappropriate place, so we're not in a blackout period. And then we look at acquisitions, and we're looking at acquisitions as we speak. So we have all of those discussions all those things are discussed at the Board level and our level constantly. Probably, the Board and us talks about it regularly.","Operator","And next, we'll go to David Leiker with Baird.","David Leiker","I guess a couple of things to circle back around on. Nick, you did a great job at talking about some of the headwinds and some of the things that you're facing, and we've talked about them with you as well. You have -- and I just want to post this question to you as one of the hit that we talked about in the past and just see if there's any change in your view on it. But with 10 years into an economic recoveries, people have most everything that they need. You've talked about in the past about other use of money from your customers' pockets. Do you have any update, any thoughts on whether some of that might actually be behind the headwinds that you're facing right now from a demand perspective?","Nicholas Pinchuk","I don't know. I mean, the thing is I don't think so. I don't think there's anything different now than before. Maybe our technicians get a little more ease of credit, but I continue to feel, David, that this is on us. Whatever is happening here is on us. When I go out and talk to the franchisees and I just -- like I said I talked, I was just on a truck the other day and I talked to a number of franchisees across the country, 1 in Texas, 1 in California and 1 in the Midwest. And they don't seem to see it that way, that there's a shrinking of demand. It's on us to try to allocate their time the best and get products that will attract them. I think that is the solution. We don't see a back office technician. ","Now there can be, we had an interesting discussion, there can be a little bit of period-to-period variation. And one of the franchisees said, \"I live in a beer and Budweiser, a beer, a Budweiser and fireworks culture.\" In other words, around the 4th of July, everybody gets -- goes on vacation and they invest in fireworks and Budweiser. That's how we talked about it, so sales get down a little bit slow in the spirit. That's what he said. But I don't think -- he said it always comes back. So I don't think we don't see any indication of saturation or misdirection could be wrong, but nothing quantitatively or qualitatively said that. Certainly qualitatively, we're not seeing this qualitatively. We're seeing the salaries of the -- I think the salaries, the trailing 12 months grew by 4% for technicians. The technicians itself year-over-year grew by 1.7%. So that's BLS data. So we don't think there's -- and nominal spending on repair moved upwards a couple of percent. No real spending moved upwards a couple of percent year-over-year. So I think, I just think it's still robust, its execution. And one of the things I tried to mention here is, boy, trying to support that launch of Intelligent Diagnostics, it's a revelation, it's a revolution. And when I talk to franchisees, they need help doing it so that's what we're working on: To try to boil things down but just be the quick 7-minute pitch that will convince people.","David Leiker","Okay. And then just two numbers related questions. One is on the working capital. Although, if you could and I am looking at Q2 versus Q2 year-over-year, it's the cash flow statement. And if there's a way you could break that down, I know currency is going to be -- play a role in there, and there's probably some acquisitions, but just the drivers behind the increase in working capital here year-over-year.","Aldo Pagliari","The biggest increase is if you look at our divisions, the biggest increase is inventory associated with the Snap-on Tools Group, our European-based hand tools operation and industrial. Those are the ones that have been adding by the way the most, I'd say, across the range of most new products. We have new product additions, it's certainly one of them. The industrial, more specifically, has been pleasantly engaged in more project-based activity in assembly of kits, and they've been compiling more inventory to service those customers. As an example, the U.S. military being a significant one. ","And we're trying to improve our service levels, where when you have such a variety of SKUs that we offer across the board and you're somewhat dealing with an environment where people can use discretion to buy, maybe a little bit of an impulse element in there as well. Last thing you want to do is not being able to meet demand because you don't have the inventory on the shelf. So we are willing to err on the side of having adequate levels of inventory across those broad number of SKUs. And at least you got a couple of product ramp ups that are occurring. So for example, we're developing new leaps in some of our factories, and that requires some ramp-up investment. And our inventories are [indiscernible] as well. We're getting it a little low, we're trying to take advantage of the situation where we can and buy smartly. And that divestments is what drives the -- the operating variance, David, it's about $52 million. If you look year-over-year, you're taking out the effects of currency and acquisitions to give you a number.","David Leiker","Yes. Okay. And then secondly, you'd called out in the corporate expense line there a little bit of a variance there. You referenced there in particular instead of comp. Was any of that a reversal from what might have been accrued in Q1?","Aldo Pagliari","Well, there's an element of that, but you have a lot of performance-based compensation that runs through the P&L. So it is related actually to the stock price performance, which accreted more in Q2 of last year, it was actually what it did in Q2 of this year. So you get some variation there, but also the timing of certain expenses, some of them related to legal matters, some of them are related to other just corporate spending. Those are account essentially. So if you look at the back half of the year, my expectation, we typically spend in the quarter. More typical quarter, you're spending in the range of $22 million to $24 million. I see no reason that would not be a good forecast as we look to the back half of the year in terms of our spend.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Curtis Nagle with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Curtis Nagle","I guess just starting off. So I guess starting out just thinking about the gross margin for tools. It looks like currency was a fairly decent size headwind. How do we think about that for the remainder of the year? And is that primarily Canada? Or is that Europe?","Nicholas Pinchuk","No, the big kahunas there are you said Canada, but the U.K. and Australia. Those are the big players in the transactions there. They pretty much dominate that 80 basis points of currency of gross margin change. And so it's pretty much outside United States. ","And how this works out is normally, when currency has happened to us in the past, we've had RCI and the lever, and we have 2 methods of offsetting RCI and pricing, local pricing. But when you're down several quarters in a row and you've got double-digit deterioration in the U.K. and you've got some down ticket sales in Australia, you're appetite to price is a lot lower. So therefore, you're seeing that roll through, and that's really what's happening. The fact that the currency is visiting on the places where it's much more reluctant to test the waters or to push the pricing because we want the volume backup. That's really what's dominating that situation. ","U.S., as I said, I know a lot of people have been talking about discounting and promotions and all sorts, but actually it's up again in the U.S. because it's our people in the Tools Group are masters of making heat and light out of programs and really they don't, by and large, don't change their margins. The programs come out and they have different phases and the same names in all kinds of things, but their idea is to generate enthusiasm both with the franchisees and the customers. And I think given some times, it's they often do, but that doesn't mean we're actually net-net discounting.","Curtis Nagle","Got it. And perhaps not to extrapolate too much, but just as kind of focusing on the comment about spending behavior and maybe shifts to things like fireworks and Budweiser, which theoretically might be a reference to 4th of July. Was that a forward comment in terms of what's going on with demand?","Nicholas Pinchuk","No, it's actually -- it was Fourth of July. It was about -- look, it was kind of like he says, \"Look, when it gets warm, your technicians are thinking about other things and repairing cars as a simple\" -- well, it's kind of an anecdotal comment. It wasn't meant to -- ought to be a forecast of any kind. I was just trying to give you a view. David asked me if there was variation and appetite for buying or people decided to focus elsewhere. I said I didn't think so, except for this kind of very, very temporal thing that one of my franchisees or several of my franchisees say when weather gets good and vacation's coming, people may not buy as much then, but they make it up later. That's all. That's all.","Operator","And next, we'll go to David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","I guess I wanted to sort of go back to a couple kind of bigger picture questions. And credit has always been kind of a very important part of your value proposition to the marketplace. And so if you advance from the premise that people are using less credit now, does that leave you a little more exposed price elasticity on the tools? And you've always had a pretty high quality tool, not to beat it about it, but also a premium-priced tool and I'm wondering if maybe as credit become -- people become maybe a little less credit dependent just late in the cycle, if people are just becoming more price-sensitive and you're feeling that.","Nicholas Pinchuk","I don't think we're feeling price sensitivity any more than we always have. I mean, as you say, everybody's always known that if you buy a Snap-on tool, it's going to be more expensive. And I wouldn't characterize -- I think the characterization you're saying is a little bit not the way we would. We would say people aren't using, aren't buying big-ticket items from us, [indiscernible]. But when they're buying big-ticket items, they're using credit, and RA is credit itself, remember? ","Remember that when a guy buys a set of wrenches or a power tool, $600 power tool, he's probably paying $50 a week, and that's stretched out over 12 weeks or maybe, maybe even sometimes 10 weeks or 15 weeks, depending on how the franchisee does it. So everything is about credit, and the RA business is up. So I wouldn't say that credit, it doesn't appear to us, David, that credit is a question. People are reluctant to take it. ","Now if you're saying, if you tell me the U.K., then I don't know. I think the U.K., they could be saying, well, I don't know what's going to happen next week. So maybe I'm not going to -- that's where my comment is about, longer payback items. I think we find when pessimism or uncertainty seizes the psyche of the working men and women, including the technicians, they tend to invest in shorter payback things like power tools and hand tools and shy away from the longer payback stuff. That happens. We used to have seen that in the U.S. That's not a phenomenon here.","David MacGregor","Could you just talk about -- No, I appreciate you addressing that, Nick. Can you just talk about field inventory levels and inventory on the truck? Clearly, in terms of your reported numbers, your inventory numbers are up but just talk about what you're seeing out there and...","Nicholas Pinchuk","Inventory, I've seen -- look, I think -- David, I think inventory, if anything, I think our numbers say they're down slightly per truck, but it might be a blip -- I'm not sure that that's irrelevant. But having gone up, I mean the sales off the van have matched I think the sales to the van. So there's not -- we're not seeing any kind of buildup in recent -- the only buildup we've seen over time has been a buildup associated with the sales of the van network. But in general, recently, we're not seeing that kind of buildup so I wouldn't say -- the one thing I would say that I will say that I did say about diagnostics, I don't know what to make of this yet because it's not we don't have it upwards but it appears as though there's more -- there's been more activations than their buy, in other words, sales of the truck of diagnostic bodies and software activations than we have sold to the truck. So from an inventory point of view, that would tend to be a diminishment of that, you would think on the van, you would think.","David MacGregor","Can you reconcile -- sure. Nick, how do you square that with originations being down again? And I guess there's been couple of quarters in a row now where your sell-in has exceeded the originations. And I understand there's a timing difference, but that would happen -- last quarter, we would have seen that correct normalized.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Yes, David, there is a timing difference. Originations are down because the sales and diagnostics in the quarter weren't that good. That's why -- and so as I tried to lay that out a little bit, maybe I was unsuccessful, but that's the thing. One of our 2 major -- the big-ticket item of diagnostics wasn't as strong as in prior quarters. And so yes, there are timing differences and so on, but that accounts diagnostics account for the lion's share of the variation year-over-year originations. So I think...","David MacGregor","Understood. Last question for me is just you made reference in your prepared remarks to franchisee health metrics remained favorable. In other words, I guess you're still in the green zone, so to speak. Can you just talk to the second derivative on those metrics? And just maybe give us example, 1 or 2, that you put a higher level of emphasis on in terms of driving comfort that you're still in good shape?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Yes. Look, second derivative of, let's say, terminations, people leaving the system. Really the first derivative, it's been pretty flat. So I think generally the second derivative has been generally stable. It's not moving either way. In fact, I think that improved a little bit. It got slightly better in this quarter, so you would say the second derivative, I don't know, I'm trying to think of how that would work in terms of polarity, but anyway, it was favorable in this particular quarter. ","Now a really small amount, but generally, that's been about the same for several quarters now. It has been going I think -- I don't know I want to think back about 3 quarters ago, it had been up to then and had been going upwards, going the other way, had been rising, and maybe even up to the fourth quarter. It had been raising a little bit and so now it's kind of gone back the other way in terms of second derivative. So I don't know what to make of that, whether that's positive or negative. Generally, those things get driven by retirement. ","The difference between the -- what drove it upwards was retirements by people who had spent more times on the van, and they wanted to go to Hawaii or something for their retirement. And so those are the kinds of things, which are making the difference we saw more of those. I think this quarter, we saw rather less. Still up from, say, slightly from, say, 18 months ago, but down from, say, 5 years ago.","David MacGregor","Okay. And if I segue one of my last question, if I could. Just the diagnostics returns, was that a meaningful headwind to organic growth in the Tool segment this quarter?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Returns, you mean people giving us back diagnostics even to something?","David MacGregor","Correct. Right.","Nicholas Pinchuk","I don't know. I don't necessarily check all these things, but I don't think so. I haven't heard of that. No one's mentioned that to me so I don't think it was actually. I think it's essentially was, this is -- we sold enough TRITONs. We didn't sell enough of the other stuff.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.","Gary Prestopino","Nick, that ADAS product that you talked about, is that targeted specifically to the independent shop versus the franchise dealer?","Nicholas Pinchuk","Yes. Yes, yes, it is specifically targeted. The idea, Gary, is to make it versatile so it can accommodate the specificities of systems that are authored by different OEMs. It's pretty -- the whole ADAS thing is becoming very important for us. So one of the things we like is in Mitchell 1, we have a particular ADS suite where when people are repairing the ADS systems, they are -- they're able to go in a particular section of that repair information and can deal with ADS systems and the terms in which describe ADAS. And so it's one of the things that's driving Mitchell 1 upwards, Mitchell 1 was very strong in the quarter actually.","Gary Prestopino","Is that -- would that be considered a big ticket item must-have for the independent repair shops going forward? I mean, relative to the other diagnostics equipment so.","Nicholas Pinchuk","Yes, I don't know. I think it's certainly as expensive as a diagnostic unit so it's a big ticket item, but the independent repair shop is still slightly different. They make -- sometimes independent repair shops pay cash or credit card for these kinds of things. They don't always borrow from us necessarily. So it wouldn't necessarily impact the originations, it might, but I don't think so in this case. So I wouldn't do that. ","The thing about this is just to make sure it's clear, everything now when you hit your bumper now you need to worry about the ADAS systems. It's a -- it becomes a -- you have set the sensors that are in the bumper and you have to recalibrate just to be put on the bumper. So that's why there's more and more demand to this. The more there is the peripheral sensors, the more they have to deal with this. And that's why we're pretty enthusiastic about this, and it's been helping us, I think.","Gary Prestopino","Okay. And then just to be clear, a lot of talk here and the headwind that you saw in the U.S., if there was a headwind, was really revolving around diagnostics. It wasn't around tool storage and the bread and butter.","Nicholas Pinchuk","No. Tool storage is kind of flattish. It's okay. We've got tools storage okay. It was up versus the last time, quite being up sequentially. It was up so we felt pretty good about that. It's not's tool storage, it's diagnostics. I'm sure we'd like to have -- look, power tools is down, too, but that has to do with the launch, which is coming and people are waiting for like -- there are a lot of things I'd like to -- there are some things that I'd like to have better, of course, but if you will ask me to say, \"Well, what do you have to fix to make -- to get back to where you are?\" I think it has to do with making sure that diagnostics works [indiscernible].","Gary Prestopino","Okay. And then last question, I don't know if you have this, although if you have this, what was the negative impact of currency on EPS in Q3 and Q4 of last year for each quarter? Do you have that handy?","Nicholas Pinchuk","I think it was positive. I think it was positive last year, yes.","Aldo Pagliari","So I think, Gary, it's still going to be a headwind if we get into the back half of the year, not as the currency rates stay right where they are right now, we're still going to see some negativity in Q3 and a little bit in Q4. So it's gotten worse is what we would have talked about on our April call with you, but currency is still going to be a headwind over the balance of the year. It was really flat in Q3 of last year and it was about $0.06 negative in Q4 of last year.","Gary Prestopino","Okay. Because I looked back, and the sales impact was about a negative $12.5 million in Q3 and a negative $17.10 million in Q4 so that's why we're just wondering. So you're saying it would be flattened -- the impact in Q3 was flat overall from currency even with the negative sales?","Aldo Pagliari","Yes. No. Sometimes the sales is not the indicator to what gets to the bottom line, right? It's transactions, particularly in the Tools Group in the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada is embedded within the activity that you see in the gross margin line, not the sales line. All we're saying is last year, there was no EPS impact. There is a -- actually it was probably 0.2%of OI, I think, here in the last year. And this year, I expect it to be negative at rates they will have to that.","Nicholas Pinchuk","What happens, Gary, your sales gets driven by the euro and the pounds and the Canadian dollar. And then when you talk about profitability, you see a much bigger influence of the pounds and the Aussie dollar and the Canadian dollar. So there are different currencies that impact us for sales in the quarter.","Aldo Pagliari","And as an example, the pounds run from 1.24 to 1.25. It's worse than where it was at last year.","Operator","And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Sara Verbsky for any additional closing remarks.","Sara Verbsky","Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"19637":["Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA) Q2 2017 Earnings Conference Call July 20, 2017 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Leslie Kratcoski \u2013 Investor Relations","Nick Pinchuk \u2013 Chief Executive Officer","Aldo Pagliari \u2013 Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Liam Burke \u2013 FBR Capital","David Leiker \u2013 Baird","Scott Stember \u2013 C.L.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mrs. Leslie Kratcoski. Please go ahead ma\u2019am.","Leslie Kratcoski","Thanks, Anna and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review Snap-on\u2019s second quarter results, which are detailed on our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today, Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.","Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we\u2019ll take your questions. As usual, we\u2019ve provided slides to supplement our discussion.

Additional information regarding these measures is included in our earnings release issued today, which can be found on our website.","With that said, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?","Nick Pinchuk","Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start the call with some highlights of our second quarter. I\u2019ll speak about the general environment, the trends we see, some of the headwinds we\u2019ve encountered and the progress we\u2019ve made. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financial.","On an overall basis, our second quarter was encouraging, we believe that once again offered evidence of advancement along our runways for both growth and for improvement. Reported sales were up 5.6% to $921.4 million and that included unfavorable foreign currency translation this quarter an impact of $12.5 million. It also reflected an incremental $38.4 million from acquisition last years Car-O-Liner and Sturtevant Richmont operations and this year is BTC and Norbar business.","Our organic sales for the quarter rose 2.7% with varying increases recorded by every group. The opco operating margin reached 19.9% up from 19.1% in 2016, and that 80 basis point increase reflects the higher sales but it also represents the power of Snap-on value creation to driver earnings growth.","For financial services operating income grew to $54.6 million from last year\u2019s $49.5 million, combining with opco to offer our consolidated operating margin of 23.9%, up 100 basis point. Our earnings per share they reached $2.60, up from the $2.36 of last year a rise of 10.2%. Those are the numbers.","Now for the market, from an overall macro perspective, we do believe the automotive repair arena remains favorable. The Tools Group organic activity was up slightly, smaller again then the previous period. That said, we don\u2019t believe the second quarter results indicate a softening marketplace. We\u2019re not hearing or seeing that rather it reflects the specific headwinds like sales decrease around our tool storage product line.","On the other side of automotive, our automotive repair operations RS&I had strong volume in the second quarter. Organic sales growth with both independent repair shop owners and managers and with OEM dealerships, this marks RS&I\u2019s third straight quarter of high single digit progress in organic sales. Representing what we believe to be an affirmation of the positive auto repair environment.","Now for the Commercial & Industrial Group or C&I, organic sales were up mid single digit the highest for some time with progress across most of the industrial sectors and geographies and critical industries, gains posted in nearly every second \u2013 segment. Both in the U.S. and internationally, strengthen sectors like natural resources, heavy duty fleet, and particular progress in places like the UK and Mexico. Also positive for C&I was SNA Europe.","SNA Europe, our European hand tools business delivering another quarter of solid results in places like Spain, France, Denmark and Sweden more gains across the core of Europe. So overall the results remain favorable. Growth was slim in the Tools Group, but advancements with auto repair shops was strong in RS&I. There was a clear recovery in critical industries, and there were continued gains in Europe. Opportunities still outweighing the challenges and the sales growth confirms it, and the operating income demonstrated \u2013 they demonstrated once again, the leverage and the power of Snap-on value creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement.","Innovation and customer connection, the principles that guiding our organization in the ongoing development of productivity solution, borne out of the insights and observations gathered out of customers workplace and together with RCI once again this quarter helping to drive an 80 basis point OI margin gain. Well that\u2019s the sort of macro overview. Now let\u2019s move to the groups.","Let\u2019s start with tools. Organic sales were up 0.5%, there were two primary drivers that attenuating tool activity tool storage sales and destock. Tool storage was simply not the ever upward spring it\u2019s been in the past. We believe there are still abundant market opportunity the segment isn\u2019t saturated, however, our product line it wasn\u2019t as compelling as we\u2019ve had in recent periods.","The second quarter enhancements we tried, they were somewhat but they weren\u2019t enough, we need to do more in the upcoming Snap-on franchisee conference will be the initial venue for around of that new product. Also it appears that the Rock \u2018N Roll Cabs are special tool storage vans, have lost some of their excitement. We\u2019ll have to retool them. We\u2019ll have to retool them to get the customer attention, and we will.","And finally we regularly refine our credit programs to match franchisee practice and performance, this time we re-stripped our credit platinum levels and that change had some initial effect on tool storage. So we saw a weaker tool storage activity in both our sales and in the franchisees volume the sales off the truck. We\u2019re aiming to recover with new product and with a revitalized set of Rock \u2018N Roll vans.","The other product line, our tool storage. Sales off the van, sales from the franchisees to technicians are up nicely for products besides tool storage, they were near the top of our targeted rates. Our sales of those product, that is the Tools Group sales of those products to franchisees were mixed and tepid in total. It appears that the traditional de-stocking that proceeds the buying opportunities of the Snap-on franchisee conference SFC and always take place in July and early August, well that contraction crap into part of June.","The franchisees were selling robustly off the van with those products but drawing down their positions and ordering less new product. The reason that that these have been bigger than ever, offering more exciting products. Franchisees have been ordering more in that one being weekend and this year, we\u2019re getting ready earlier clearing the decks. That\u2019s said, even with a modest volume increase Tools Group operating margins rose 120 basis points to 19.5%. That 120 basis point improvement demonstrates clear progress to benefit the Snap-on value creation, more effective higher margin product, streamline product development and nice volume leverage internationally.","Advancements in the Tools Group are evident in the overall OI improvement, and they are apparent in our franchisee health metrics. The financial and physical indicators we monitor and evaluate continuously. They remain favorable an important categories like franchisee turnover. We believe our van network is growing stronger, I just visited several franchisees in the field and I can assure you that the confidence of those entrepreneurs was quite encouraging and besides those interactions during more formal discussions like our National Franchisee Advisory Council meetings, I heard similar comments. The people I spoke to are upbeat very confident of their opportunity going forward, that\u2019s the Tools Group.","Now onto C&I. A 4.7% organic sales rise with higher critical industry activity and increased volumes at SNA Europe and at our Asia-Pacific operations. For several quarters now the C&I businesses have demonstrated sales acceleration. C&I operating margin was 13.8% flat versus 2016 with volume and RCI gains being more or less to offset by the impact of our recent acquisition.","Importantly, the industrial division showed strength, broad \u2013 showed strong broad-based progress across the critical industries with most of those sectors advancing in the quarter. We believe the improving macroeconomic conditions coupled with our array of great new products and that\u2019s solving critical path is driving those favorable results.","Speaking of new products in the C&I Group, in the quarter C&I acquired Norbar Torque Tools headquartered in the UK, Norbar is a leading manufacturer of torque product offering a full range of wrenches, multipliers and calibrator that acquisition complements and expands our existing torque line by extending our range up all the way to 220,000 foot panels, more for the C&I team to sell to our customers and critical industries.","Norbar offers both power torque and strong line up of manual torque multipliers. The latest in that line introduced in the second quarter is the MTMB740 compact manual torque multiplier, this tool, it features compact design with a multiplier head just 2.6 inches in diameter enabling excellent access and easy handling, while still providing 5:1 multiplication ratio up to 740-foot panels, and that\u2019s Norbar tradition the construction is robust delivering a long life and minimal maintenance and its ideal for using tough environments like oil and gas, mining, power generation, railroad and heavy duty fleets in a range of critical industries.","Now C&I has been in Torque for sometime, with our manufacturing facilities in City of Industry, California more recently with our Sturtevant Richmont acquisition and Carol Stream, Illinois producing great products, selling to automotive, aerospace and other industrial customers. And in the second quarter, our City of Industry team launched it\u2019s ATech micro TechAngle quarter inch drive torque wrench, the smallest electronic torque wrench in the market, compact steel body, less than a foot in length and less than an inch in diameter and it weighed just under a pound.","That compares with our \u2013 by comparison to our standard ATech quarter inch wrench, at 16.5 inches in length and 1.9 inches in diameter and weighing nearly 2 pound. Engine compartments they continue to get smaller and tighter with each model year limiting the access and reducing the workspace. The slim design of our new ATech allows technicians to reach fasteners that are resource obstructed, reducing the need to remove components and saving considerable time in the repair shop.","And the products short overall length enables a compact swingarm. That\u2019s very important in a tight space of modern machinery. We\u2019re excited about the compact quarter inch ATech access and accuracy in one package, we believe it\u2019s a clear winner and early results support that view.","Now let\u2019s speak about SNA Europe, positive trends and the uncertainty that is Europe. SNA Europe registered it\u2019s 15th straight quarter of year-over-year sales growth and profit quarter to mark the 17th straight quarter of margin improvement defining the challenges over multiple geographies roughly four straight years of favorable performance, helping the C&I Group advance in both sales and profitability. And in the quarter Asia-Pacific operations, sales growth in countries like China and Taiwan lower volume in places like India, mixed results by country but positive result overall. C&I, turning in a promising quarter on broad gains and accelerating sales.","Now onto RS&I, organic sales rose 8.3%, high single digit gains of diagnostic and repair information products, the independent repair shop owners and managers a high single digit increase with OEM dealerships and a mid single digit in advanced in undercar equipment, growth across the board. And on a reported basis, including RS&I\u2019s $22.5 million of acquisition related sales volume grew 14.5% in the second quarter. Operating earnings of $81.9 million increased $7.4 million.","The operating margin of 24.2% was down 100 basis points but that was impacted by 120 basis points of lower margin in the acquisition. The broad organic growth was strong with independent and with dealerships. And innovation and new product paved the way. From the diagnostics division, our newest handheld offering ETHOS Edge enhanced industrial design, faster response time, configure to match specifically the needs of new tech, those just starting out and working on a more routine maintenance test and light repair.","The initial feedback on the ETHOS Edge is quite enthusiastic and early sales they\u2019ve exceeded our expectation. For the OEM dealership, in the quarter RS&I introduced a new \u2013 latest version of the next brand Electronic Data Link or EDL3, it is specifically designed for the needs of agricultural repair technicians across the service network of a large OEM. This essential tool responded to a need to connect ag equipment in the field to the OEM\u2019s diagnostic software, to access repair information in any environment Snap-on solve the problem and made it happen.","The EDL3 is just one example of our essential diagnostic program aimed at OEM dealerships, and those were nice part of RS&I\u2019s quarter. And undercar equipment, it was also up, mid single digit with particular strength internationally, solid growth in Europe and broad gains in lifts and balances, undercar equipment another positive quarter.","So to wrap up RS&I, substantial achievement across the division, improving our position with repair shop owners and mangers continuing a very favorable trend. So that\u2019s the highlights of our quarter. Tools Group lagging in sales but C&I and RS&I both recorded strong performance progress along our runways for coherent growth and clear advancement than our runways for improving. Overall sales increasing organically 2.7%, opco operating income margin of 19.9% up 80 basis points. EPS $2.60 arise of 10.2%. It was another encouraging quarter.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?","Aldo Pagliari","Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $921.4 million in the quarter increased $49.1 million or 5.6% from 2016 levels, reflecting a $23.2 million or 2.7% organic sales gain, $38.4 million of acquisition related sale and $12.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.","Foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q2 sales comparisons by 150 basis points. The organic sales gain reflects ongoing progress in serving the vehicle repair sector as well as more broad based sales growth to industrial market segments in our C&I Group and more than we\u2019ve seen in sometime.","Consolidated gross margin of 50.2% improved 80 basis points, primarily due to the benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effect.","Operating expenses of $279.3 million yielded an operating expense margin of 30.3% in the quarter unchanged from year ago and sales volume leverage and other benefits were offset by 70 basis points of operating expenses or acquisition.","As a result of these factors, operating earnings before financial services of $183.7 million, increased 10.4% and improved 80 basis points to 19.9%, despite the 70 basis point impact from acquisition and 20 basis point of unfavorable foreign currency effects.","Financial services revenue of $77.7 million increased $8.4 million from 2016 levels, and operating earnings of $54.6 million, including $0.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased $5.1 million.","Consolidated operating earnings of $238.3 million, including $4.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased 10.4%, and the operating margin of 23.9% improved 100 basis points from 22.9% a year ago. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 30.6% compared to 31.0% last year.","Finally, net earnings of $153.2 million, or $2.60 per diluted share increased $13.1 million, or $0.24 per share from 2016 levels, representing a 10.2% increase in diluted earnings per share.","Now let\u2019s turn to our segment results. Starting with C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $310.0 million in the quarter, increased $24.3 million, or 8.5%, reflecting a $13.3 million, or 4.7% organic sales gain, $15.9 million of acquisition-related sales, and $4.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.","The organic sales increase primarily includes a high single-digit gain in the segment\u2019s European-based hand tools business, and a mid single-digit increase in sales to customers in critical industries, which was generally wide ranging across the industrial end markets that we serve.","Gross profit at C&I Group of $120.8 million compared to $111.4 million last year and gross margin was 39% in both years. Operating expenses of $78.1 million in the quarter compared to $72.1 million last year. The operating expense margin of 25.2% was same in both years, primarily due to sales volume leverage, offset by increased costs, including higher cost for research and engineering activity, and 30 basis points of operating expenses for acquisition.","As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $42.7 million increased $3.4 million from 2016 levels, and the operating margin was 13.8% in both the second quarters of 2017 and 2016.","Turning now to Slide 8. Second quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $413.8 million decreased $2.9 million, or 0.7%, reflecting $2.1 million, or 0.5% organic sales gain and $5.0 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects a double-digit gain in the international franchise operations, largely offset by a low single-digit decrease in the U.S franchise operation.","Gross profit of $183.6 million in the quarter compared to $182.1 million last year. Gross margin of 44.4% improved 70 basis points, primarily due to benefits from sales of higher growth margin product and savings from our RCI initiative, partially offset by 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effect.","Operating expenses of $103 million in the quarter, compared to $105.8 million last year. The operating expense margin of 24.9% improved 50 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage in the international franchise operations.","As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $80.6 million, including $3.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $4.3 million and the operating margin of 19.5% improved 120 basis points.","Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Second quarter sales of $338.1 million increased $42.9 million, or 14.5%, reflecting a $24.1 million, or 8.3%, organic sales gain, $22.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $3.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.","The organic sales increase was again comprehensive this quarter, reflecting high single-digit gains in sales OEM dealerships and in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, as well as a mid single-digit increase in sales of undercar equipment.","Gross profit of $158.6 million in the quarter compared to $137.8 million last year. And the gross margin of 46.9% improved 20 basis points. As a result of 80 basis points of benefit from acquisitions, partially offset by a shift in sales that included higher volumes of lower gross margin product.","Operating expenses of $76.7 million in the quarter, compared to $63.3 million last year. The operating expense margin of 22.7% increased 120 basis points, principally due to 200 basis points of unfavorable impact from acquisitions, partially offset by benefits from sales volume leverage.","Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $81.9 million, including $1.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased $7.4 million from prior year level. The operating margin of 24.2% decreased 100 basis points, including a 120 basis points impact from acquisition.","Now turning to Slide 10. Operating earnings from financial services of $54.6 million on revenue of $77.7 million, compared to operating earnings of $49.5 million on revenue of $69.3 million last year.","Financial services expenses of $23.1 million increase $3.3 million, primarily due to changes in the size of the portfolio and an increase in the provisions for credit losses. While total provision expense of $13.4 million in the second quarter is up, $2.9 million year-over-year, it decreased slightly from $14.3 million incurred in Q1.","As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.2% in both the second quarters of 2017 and 2016. In the both the second quarters of 2017 and 2016, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.9%. The respected average yield on contract receivables was 9.1% and 9.3%.","Total loan originations of $270.6 million in the second quarter decreased $10.4 million, or 3.7% year-over-year, due primarily to a $12.4 million, or 5.1% decline in the finance receivables originations, resulting principally from lower year-over-year tool storage sales by the Snap-on Tools Group in the second quarter.","Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.9 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.7 billion from our U.S. operation. Approximately 82% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. In the first quarter, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew $50.9 million, or 2.7%.","As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these are tracking somewhat higher year-over-year, but continued to be inline with our expectations in view of an appropriate risk reward balance in this segment of our business.","As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, the largest portion of the portfolio trailing 12-month net losses of $40.4 million represented 2.61% of outstanding to quarter-end, up 51 basis point year-over-year and 14 basis points sequentially.","However, net losses related to finance receivables of $10.8 million in the second quarter sequentially improved by $0.4 million from $11.2 million in the first quarter. In addition, finance receivables more than 90 days past due stood at 0.9% of outstanding as the second quarter end, which was also a sequential improvement from 1.1% at the end of the first quarter.","60-day delinquency rate of 1.4% in our U.S. extended credit portfolio increased 30 basis points year-over-year, but remains stable compared to the first quarter. Overall, profitability in the financial services segment rose by 10.3% year-over-year, an improved $2.1 million sequentially.","Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $127.1 million in the quarter, decreased $35 million from comparable 2016 levels, primarily due to higher working investment partially offset by higher 2017 net earnings. During the quarter, we also elected to $15 million in the discretionary contributions into our domestic pension plan, an increase of $5 million as compared to Q2 2016.","Net cash used by investing activities of $138.6 million, included additions to finance receivables of $231.8 million, partially offset by collections of $179.1 million. Capital expenditures of $15.8 million in the quarter, compared with $20.6 million last year.","During the second quarter, we also acquired Norbar Torque Tool. Based in the United Kingdom, Norbar included in the C&I segment, is a leading European manufacturer of full range of torque products and has a strong present in the critical industries.","Net cash used by financing activities of $23.4 million included dividend payments to shareholders of $41.1 million and the repurchase of 535,000 shares of common stock for $86.7 million under our previously announced share repurchase programs.","We had saw opportunity in the quarter to step-up share repurchase and did so at higher level than usual. Year-to-date share repurchase totaled 745,000 shares for $122.5 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by a higher short-term borrowing, principally commercial paper.","Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $46.5 million from 2016 year-end level, including $15.4 million of foreign currency translation and $7.1 million from acquisitions. Day sales outstanding 66 days is up from 53 days at year-end including the impact of acquisition, which increase DSOs by about one day.","Inventories increased $70.9 million from 2016 year-end, primarily in support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions. Foreign currency translation contributed $16.6 million of the increase, as this $4.8 million from acquisitions. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.2 compared to 3.38 year-end.","Our quarter-end cash position of $89 million, increased a $11.4 million in 2016 year-end level. Our net debt-to-capital ratio was unchanged from 26.3% at 2016 year-end. In addition to our $89 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us access to the commercial paper markets. As of quarter-end, we had $83.5 million of commercial paper borrowing outstand.","That concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?","Nick Pinchuk","Thanks, Aldo. Snap-on second quarter Tools Group, tepid growth, but having the advantages going forward of a strong franchise network and a robust market. C&I accelerating growth, up mid single-digit, broad gains in the critical industries and the continuing upward march of SNA Europe and RS&I, another high single-digit quarter, up 8.3% organically each division contributing to that rise, confirming both the opportunities in automotive repair and our progress with repair shop owners and managers.","The positives of C&I and RS&I combining to overcome the challenges in tools, making for overall organic growth of 2.7% and Snap-on Value Creation, driving improvement, customer connection, innovation in RCI, authoring margin progress again.","Opco OI margins of 19.9%, a rise of 80 basis points against currency and acquisitions. And acquisition, presenting near-term margin dilution, but offering further landscapes for Snap-on Value Creation and margin improvement going forward, it was a quarter in which we saw a challenges, but overall, we overcame and demonstrated growth and improvement again. EPS of $2.60, up 10.2%. It was an encouraging quarter.","And we\u2019re confident. We\u2019re market that our markets have the opportunity, our businesses have the position and our team has the capability to continue our ongoing positive trend and performance going forward.","Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I\u2019d speak to our franchisees and associates listening to the call. The encouraging result to the second quarter reflect your capability and your commitment, for your ongoing achievement and your commitment. For your ongoing achievements, you have my congratulation. And for your extraordinary dedication to our team, you have my thanks.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll now take a question from Liam Burke with FBR Capital.","Liam Burke","Thank you. Good morning, Nick. Good morning, Aldo.","Nick Pinchuk","Good morning, Liam.","Aldo Pagliari","Good morning.","Liam Burke","Nick, can you give us some color on diagnostics sales and what the innovation or new product pipeline would look like in that area of the business?","Nick Pinchuk","Well, we don\u2019t like to give away the secrets that we\u2019re going to rollout say at the SFC or so because we like to electrify the people who go there. I just talked to our franchisee in California who said, he likes to get the fever when he goes on the floor. So we want to have that, but look, our thermal imagers are still selling well. That still got legs, that\u2019s the new category that\u2019s going well.","Overall in the Tools Group, the diagnostics category was up, I think mid single digits in the U.S. The U.S. numbers, have those. So if that was in part of that statement raise, and even in that we saw a destocking so it would have been up bigger without what we perceived to be destock, so you have that and then you have the ETHOS, which is the next level. We keep refreshing the platform.","Remember, there are four levels of platform. ETHOS, for the entry-level tech; SOLIS for the guy who kind of worked on breaks, and there\u2019s a whole bunch of the other little bit, more sophisticated jobs; MODIS for the guy who really works on the more complicated jobs and VERUS for the guy who works on those things that only happen on money.","So we rolled out the ETHOS and we\u2019re doing out some new wrinkles in the SFC, but the ETHOS has just come out, very early days. We have it in the script here, but that\u2019s only been selling for a little while, but the first numbers are pretty good. It was up nicely in the second quarter.","Liam Burke","Okay. And on the Rock \u2018N Roll Van, you said you were going to go back and do some things differently. What would you anticipate doing to improve the space constraints that the van drivers would have on some of the products?","Nick Pinchuk","Sure. One of the things that when we saw these results, I decided to talk to a bunch of franchisees. So in the last couple of weeks, I don\u2019t know when we got the results, but I\u2019d say a couple of weeks ago. Right away I met with guys from Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, rode some vans in Arkansas and Texas told the guys in New Hampshire, Florida and California and almost everybody said that the Rock \u2018N Roll Cab had lost some of its excitement.","So it\u2019s a matter of \u2013 it\u2019s not really the function, Liam, it\u2019s having people get on the van and saying, oh this is something different, an experience. I want to get on the van and experience because that\u2019s what they did before. So we\u2019ll do stuffs like rapid differently with some of our new facilities. We\u2019ll reorganize the tool boxes. We\u2019ll try to put some more spiffier and stuff on in terms of the box as on the van.","So I\u2019d like to say, it\u2019s a matter of this, when the technicians were getting on, they \u2013 they get feedback on them and they, think I saw this. Now some of the guys have bought because they look at the boxes, but other guys were kind of saying, I done that, so we\u2019re going to try to make it a different experience, move around some of the floor plan, maybe kind of put on some a little better computer aid, things like that.","So I think it\u2019s really to change the \u2013 I want to say the cosmetics of it more than anything else, so people feel as though they\u2019re getting a different experience.","Liam Burke","Great. Thank you, Nick.","Operator","We\u2019ll now move to David Leiker with Baird.","David Leiker","Good morning, gentlemen. How are you doing?","Nick Pinchuk","Good morning, David.","David Leiker","Couple things, I\u2019m trying to \u2013 I guess I\u2019m trying to slice the business up a little bit to get a deeper understanding on some of the pieces. Can you talk within \u2013 first of all, you said on the tools side that the destocking. Is there way to characterize what the selloff the truck volume was during the quarter?","Nick Pinchuk","Well, look. I don\u2019t think we want to get pinning down that variable, but what I\u2019ll tell you is sort of like this. You think about it this way. Tool storage was down fairly significantly even off the trucks, but less so than we had, okay. So that\u2019s why we say tool storage, the product line. We believe it needs to refresh. We need the marketing, the Rock \u2018N Roll vans need something that helps and so we\u2019re working on that.","If you look at everything else, if you take everything else, like this, two type you are very familiar with this, it\u2019s easy that the finance stuff and the RA stuff, the stuff that what we know is the stuff that the franchisee sells on his own credit like hand tools and power tools and shop and pack, and in some portions of diagnostics. That was up fairly significantly, towards the top of the ranges that we expect to see from the Tools Group.","So we would have classified that it as a fairly robust quarter, looking at the sales off the van, that didn\u2019t translate into our sales though. Our sales were quite mixed in those categories and a quite tepid. So what we \u2013 and you talk to the franchisees and what they said was it makes sense is that always July is the lowest quarter because people are getting ready.","But what happened over the years is more and more the ordering is taking place in these burst. That doesn\u2019t mean the second quarter becomes incandescent, but they\u2019re taking place at these bursts and so I think they\u2019ll be more aware of the need to kind of get ready for these orders. Last year, the orders in the SFC were up quite strongly in the before as well.","So what\u2019s happening is, is that they\u2019re bleeding out \u2013 out of July into June, that\u2019s what happened. We saw a significantly weaker tail end of June than we have seen in the past.","David Leiker","Okay. And then the other item you mentioned it couple of times in your call, obviously the topic going on in the marketplace today. Can you talk about the changes \u2013 the terms you did with your franchisees on the credit side, how frequently you make those changes, just some initial color behind that.","Nick Pinchuk","We make them pretty much every year, some kind of changes and I think since 2009 or 2010 we\u2019ve made significant changes in most of the years, in a lot of years so that happens. What you do is you look at how people are performing. You say how is the business? How are the franchisees? Who are big active parts? You try to restructure the program so it guides them to get the best out of their opportunity, and that\u2019s what we did.","And so that had some initial impact because we identified some customers who are weaker and we said some of the franchisees are having some of the greatest results, and that\u2019s where we strip them. So those franchisees would be focused on those guys and really couldn\u2019t deal with them as much. Whereas other guys, we have lots of faith and we let them deal with that same category, that\u2019s the restriking pretty much.","David Leiker","And then the last item here again on the credit side, if we could talk a little bit about, I mean you can tell by the yield that clearly, if you go back a couple of years, you took in some high-risk customers, some of that was after CIP funding the credit company. Recently, that seems to have backed off a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about what those credit losses are in the pool of high-risk customers when we\u2019ll see those flow through the credit losses in terms of peak loss period.","Aldo Pagliari","David it\u2019s Aldo. I think you\u2019re seeing that now when you look at the year-over-year differences in the rate of provision and the rate of charge-offs. And I don\u2019t think that you\u2019re going to see a decline in those rates, so to speak, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see an acceleration either. And I think if you look since the started of the year, there\u2019s been rather good amount of stability, so it\u2019s rather cut them out.","So the portfolio constituents are more or less where they\u2019re at right now, I don\u2019t see that changing very much. I think the franchisees are always adjusting as Nick suggested to the fact and circumstances that they face on the Street each and every day, but the portfolio losses right now are more or less stable throughout the year, at least year-to-date.","David Leiker","Is that fair to say, I\u2019m going to jump to the conclusion, but is it fair to say with that commentary that credit profile, credit risk profile, the people who are coming into the credit side on the origination side are similar to what the overall pool is today?","Aldo Pagliari","It\u2019s a hard question to answer because you have a \u2013 you have the portfolio whose customer FICO scores are improving and the other half of the portfolio that actually might be a little bit less than improving. So if you look at the mix overall, the average FICO score of the portfolio has been rather consistent, but anything goes out, it changes overtime but not dramatically.","David Leiker","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Aldo Pagliari","Sure.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take a question from Scott Stember with C.L. King.","Scott Stember","Good morning, guys.","Aldo Pagliari","Good morning.","Scott Stember","Could you maybe talk about the timing of when comparisons in the Tools Group get a little bit easier and most considerably with regards to tool storage? And then maybe secondarily, just talk about some of these changes in the vans, make them a little bit more exciting, increasing traffic into the vans for tool storage, when that will actually start to take place? Thanks.","Nick Pinchuk","Sure. Look, I don\u2019t know. Look, I don\u2019t think we ever think we have easy comparisons. I think we kind of look \u2013 I mean, okay. The comparisons are easier, but they\u2019re up 0.5%. This is the best second quarter ever in terms of sales. I mean, the increase wasn\u2019t the best, and the profitability is the best ever. So I don\u2019t think we think in those terms. I think the question is how you are going to restart, it\u2019s clear to us that the primary factor in the sale slim situation in tools was tool storage.","So first is product. Tool storage is among the most discretionary things. You\u2019ve got excite people they got to want it, they got to aspire to have it. We\u2019re working the SFC will come up in early August will be launching a whole bunch of new product that the SFC to try to roll people and excite them.","We tried some of that in the second quarter, some of it worked and it wasn\u2019t enough and then the tool storage and the van, the Rock \u2018N Roll Cab, there are I think 67 of them. So what we will do over the next, say, quarter, we\u2019ll be developing \u2013 in this quarter, let\u2019s say, we\u2019ll be developing possibilities for the new van. We\u2019ll probably test some of them and then we\u2019ll roll them out whatever works best. So it will be a test period, development period, a test period and then a rollout period.","And you tend to roll them out, so you should start seeing some of that as, well, I don\u2019t know, toward the later end of the year, things like that. But first is product. The first factor is product. First factor is product.","Scott Stember","Got it. And just last question. Yes, sure, you talked about the sell-through on the vans, I guess outside of the tool storage of being relatively strong or actually to the high-end of the year, which you look for. Can you maybe just give us a flavor of how high that was? Just give a comfort level to how strong the rest of the business is doing?","Nick Pinchuk","Okay. I\u2019d say that Snap-on should grow at 4% to 6%. I\u2019ve said this for a dog\u2019s age. That\u2019s my range. So I\u2019m talking to the end of that range. That\u2019s the kind of thing we talk about, right? Okay.","Scott Stember","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","We will now take a question from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.","Gary Prestopino","Hey, good morning all.","Nick Pinchuk","Good morning, Gary.","Gary Prestopino","A couple of questions. On the C&I Group, I think you said that you had some pretty good sell-through there in hand tools and then across various markets. But I\u2019m wondering, were all of the markets within the C&I Group, is this one of the first times where you\u2019ve really seen upsales year-over-year? And I\u2019m particularly interested if some of those laggard groups like military and energy are starting to energize.","Nick Pinchuk","Look, natural resources was up. Natural resources, in general, that sort of natural resource segment was up. International aerospace, which had been a laggard, was up. We\u2019re very pleased to see that. Military, actually, was flat. I kind of viewed that \u2013 kind of flat, it was up a little bit. I kind of view that as a positive, Gary, because the thing is military, as you know, it\u2019s kind of lumpy and it had been dominating our quarters. So actually, last quarter was sort of the same kind of thing, we had broad growth.","This time with military, not as much a factor in the growth situation. And this time, the same thing was the case. So this was a very healthy quarter and you\u2019re seeing acceleration in industrial. C&I\u2019s numbers, if you go back and look at them, you\u2019ll see that we threw, four quarters ago, 1.5%, 2.4%, 3% and 4.7%. So people, if you look at this, other people have looked at the segment and say, well, there\u2019s some deceleration. Well, this is acceleration. And so that\u2019s pretty positive, and the nature of that\u2019s been pretty good. And industrial has been up higher than that.","Gary Prestopino","Okay. And then some of the strength you\u2019re seeing in the RS&I Group with diagnostic equipment and other equipment, I\u2019m really more pertaining to diagnostic, do you feel that, that\u2019s a function of really rolling out some of these newer products? And in conjunction with that, you\u2019re starting to get some cars that are four or five years old that had maybe a higher technological content than cars that were 10 years old, flowing through in the \u2013 to the independent repair shop market?","Nick Pinchuk","Sure. There\u2019s a \u2013 I don\u2019t want to short change some other factors in there. But if you look at the diagnostics, it\u2019s a great tailwind. The increasing need for diagnostics to create repair, you know it as well as I do, is that 40%, 50% of repairs on cars today require diagnostic. But new cars, that\u2019s all the cars 11.5-year-old average car fleet, but if you look at new cars it\u2019s 80% of the repairs. So there\u2019s an increasing demand. You hear it in the shops when you go around. We have the best goal alternatives.","So you see our new products rolling out, exciting customers, solving their problems against the backdrop of their needs, that\u2019s partially what you\u2019re seeing, and diagnostics was up nicely in that quarter. But I wouldn\u2019t want to short change Mitchell, which is a purely short, purely software business, which provides repair shop management and provide repair shop \u2013 repair information, our Sure Track database with the 1 billion record that only we have of repair, shortcutting repairs. That was up big in the \u2013 nicely in the quarter. So you take those two things, I think diagnostics is in \u2013 I mean, RS&I, in general, is in a situation where the tailwinds are only intensifying and where the best game in town.","Gary Prestopino","Right, thanks. And then the last question really pertains to tool storage and you say you refreshed the product, refreshed the vans. When was the last time that you actually did something like this? And then how long after you refreshed did the sales start reinvigorating themselves?","Nick Pinchuk","I don\u2019t know. We didn\u2019t refresh. We launched the tool storage vans and this is \u2013 you got the first \u2013 when you launch, you probably \u2013 I think it\u2019s fair to say we had some periods where we\u2019re adjusting. But really, they\u2019ve been pretty much the same since we launched like five years ago.","Gary Prestopino","Okay.","Nick Pinchuk","So we haven\u2019t had that information in this kind of fleet. We haven\u2019t had this kind of fleet. This was a brand new idea. You remember I said it\u2019s the kind of idea that came to the Tools Group guys. We thought it was brilliant. It accelerated tool storage sales. But now, it\u2019s kind run out of mojo. Now we\u2019re still generating some sales, but franchisees are telling me that what they used to generate is now half of what they generated when they get these guys in a route, so we need to pump them up. But this is why we have managers to figure this out, that\u2019s what we do.","Gary Prestopino","Yes. I guess, what I was getting at, Nick, is there something on the product side that you \u2013 do you refresh every five years understanding like\u2026","Nick Pinchuk","No. No, I think we try to \u2013 what happens is, Gary, we try to roll out new product at the SFC or the kickoffs every year. This year, we\u2019re particularly energized to do it. So you can see sales, you can see ordering pretty quickly from the franchisees. I didn\u2019t get a feeling for that pretty quickly at how good that worked. The question is, is it going to play out into the marketplace? So there are two levels, getting the franchisees interested and then having the technicians look at it and say, \"Hey, I got to have that box. I already got a box, but I got to replace mine.\"","Gary Prestopino","So I guess the question I would have is relative to new products or product refreshes that you bring into this annual meeting that you have. On the tool storage side, have you done more in terms of maybe intro or refreshing product than you would usually do?","Nick Pinchuk","We\u2019re doing more and we\u2019re certainly going to do more in tool storage at the SFC this year than we have been in the past. So think about the SFC though, no matter how much the SFC orders are, remember, they\u2019re ordering for like six months, so it doesn\u2019t happen immediately, right? Okay. But we\u2019re doing more. Sure, this is the whole thing. We think the product line is weak. If it\u2019s not doing, we got to pump it up.","Gary Prestopino","Okay, thank you.","Nick Pinchuk","Thanks, Gary.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from David MacGregor from Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","Yes. Good morning, everyone. Just a few questions here for you. Nick, could you just talk about the destocking in the extent to which that may be related to some of the changes you made in the credit business?","Nick Pinchuk","We don\u2019t think it\u2019s that. We think the credit is \u2013 while the destocking is something completely different. The destocking is, we think \u2013 I think I try to \u2013 this is my view, David, is that, look, and I think it\u2019s our view here. There are two factors we\u2019re talking about on the Tools Group, destocking and the weakness in tool storage. Destocking is a completely different thing. The destocking is there driven by the size of the orders that are occurring in the SFC and the feeling that our people want to clear the decks. This is happening in every product line, not just tool storage.","So from our perspective, that\u2019s not really a factor there. If you come back to the tool storage sales, you could argue \u2013 and I think I did say that it\u2019s a tertiary effect, so we don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the primary driver. But re-striping had some initial effect on this, for sure, but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s the primary driver when we look at the numbers.","David MacGregor","Okay. Second question is on margins in the tools segment, which were pretty darn good. I guess, could you just talk about the strength at 19.5%, I guess given the flat top line, then how we should think about your ability to maintain this level of margin progression heading into the second half of the year?","Nick Pinchuk","I think a couple of things are in there. The first is that if you go back and you look at our numbers, it\u2019s not \u2013 if you look at our numbers by division, it\u2019s not unusual to see that kind of growth. It isn\u2019t necessarily directly proportional to the volume. I mean, we have RCI products and new products that rollout that are a lot more, a lot more capable and a lot more value, and therefore, higher margins as they rollout to the industry. So it really plays out how long those new products and how many new ones we rollout, and how effective they are. And then in this particular \u2013 so in this quarter, in that area, we have things like the PT850. I think I talked about it last time, our new half inch impact wrench, very, very popular product.","In the atmosphere of tepid sales, that one sold very well, nice margins. I talked about the long handle ratchet\u2019s that have the flex heads and were \u2013 gave great leverage and also gave great access, that sold better than \u2013 great margins. And these margins transformed our categories in terms of margins. What happened in the destocking in a lot of situation is some of the more standard and core product didn\u2019t sell as much because they were products that we\u2019re already on the van. And so that was, perhaps, lower margin so it\u2019s skews the thing towards there.","And then we had good leverage in the way our businesses were stronger internationally than they were in the U.S. and the compensation in the international is a little bit different. So we tend to get a little bit more leverage and drop through volume leverage out of the volume, so that\u2019s what made for that. I think it\u2019s hard to say what the sustainability is of this, but we believe, I\u2019ve said this over and over and over and over again, that we believe we can drive margins up, absent volume increases. And if you look at our numbers, 19.9% ain\u2019t chopped liver. It\u2019s our highest ever. And so you go back and you look at this quarter, for example, this quarter is very similar to last 20 quarters, 9 quarters were similar to this and we grew 100 basis points or more. So I really believe maybe the 19.5% isn\u2019t sustainable every quarter, but it\u2019s an indication we can reach that level and we keep going off those levels, that\u2019s our history.","David MacGregor","Just a couple of quick follow-ups here. The storage growth, I don\u2019t want to beat this thing to death, but Aldo, in his discussion, the originations mentioned that there have been $12.5 million decline in the originations related to storage, 5.1%. Is that a good proxy for how we should think about the extent to which storage was down year-over-year?","Nick Pinchuk","No. Storage is down more than that.","David MacGregor","Can you quantify that for us?","Nick Pinchuk","Well, storage is down double digits. I don\u2019t want to get confused here because I spoke probably for the first time on this call about sales off the van. Don\u2019t get confused about sales off \u2013 I\u2019m talking about our sales. Storage was down double digits. And so that played out into a different lower originations. But remember, in originations, originations are the franchisee sales. Their storage was down but not as much. And then you also have in that, you have other products like diagnostic units and other things like that so it\u2019s hard to make that characterization. But I just thought tool storage was painful.","David MacGregor","Yes. Last questions just on the originations. With originations maybe set to go through kind of a negative growth pattern here for at least the foreseeable future. This would presume that you got a little bit more cash, sort of discretionary use of free cash flow. You were jacking up your share repurchase activity this quarter, which was good to see. Do we expect to see that pattern maintain going forward? Do you sort of lean a little harder into the repurchase as use of cash?","Nick Pinchuk","No. I think we\u2019re always discussing the use of cash and we\u2019ve always said, I think, that you have investment in your business and you have acquisitions and you have dividend, and of course share repurchase is part of that. So we always consider that in the context of the cash availability, the authorizations we have from the board and the attractiveness of the pricing.","David MacGregor","Thanks Nick.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.","Bret Jordan","Hi, good morning guys. A question on the destocking discussion. I guess the franchisees have a minimum balance requirement anyhow. How close does the average franchisee runs to minimum balance? I mean how much more potential for destocking is there? Or are we really sort of out of \u2013 are we going to find some base relatively soon?","Nick Pinchuk","Look, I think this, I think we\u2019re going to see destocking through July then they\u2019re going to come up to the SFC. This destocking, I don\u2019t think \u2013 it wasn\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t think it was driven so much by people saying, I got too much inventory. It was driven more by the idea, that the ordering patterns are migrating toward big orders \u2013 more toward big orders at the buy, twice a year events. And they order these things because they, like I said, the franchisers get on the floor and they get the fever and are able to \u2013 for the first time, touch the product and they order the packages, they see the new product and they tend to order more and these things get delivered for like six, eight months after that.","So the lower they are \u2013 the better \u2013 the more stabilized they are going into that, they\u2019re starting to realize, the better off they\u2019re to manage that six, eight month delivery pattern that they\u2019ve signed up for when they go into these places. That\u2019s was happening so there\u2019s a little bit more ordering happening at the big events and less maybe on whatever the monthly events are. We have monthly events and so, I think, that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying. And because the SFC has been sold, I think that\u2019s what I\u2019m hearing because the SFC has been sold successful, people are bringing it down. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re thinking that, oh, I\u2019m joking on inventory.","Bret Jordan","Okay. I guess in your inventory, you talked about growth around new programs and future customer demand. Can you talk about the categories that you\u2019re growing? Is this RS&I inventory that you\u2019re building up because you\u2019re seeing so much strength there? Or just some increase in your inventory, as you seen a little bit of destock but you\u2019re building inventory with expectation as they\u2019ve tick it up in the current quarter?","Nick Pinchuk","Yes. The answer is for both of those. Look, I think we saw it some destock, but we\u2019re kind of confident that \u2013 as the SFC rolls out, that inventory is going to be quite useful that\u2019s we\u2019re building toward. The RS&I business, hey, it\u2019s smoking. It went well. I mean, the thing is in RS&I, in some cases, we can sell \u2013 we want to have inventory because we have quite good demand and even in the Tools Group, really. I mean, we sold \u2013 I believe, we sold every PT850 we could build this quarter. So I mean, the thing is you do have this kind of things, so we\u2019re happy to have some inventory going to the SFC for that kind of thing.","Bret Jordan","Okay. And then on the last call, we talked about \u2013 I\u2019m running a special sort of tool color program that was going to drive incremental demand. Have we\u2019ve rolled that out yet? Or is that something that coming in the current quarter around this big event?","Nick Pinchuk","No, no. We\u2019ve rolled it out and it worked, but didn\u2019t have enough effect. We rolled out a special call and we had a couple of split with top boxes, with the couple of minor changes. We did it as quick as we could because we \u2013 second quarter, we weren\u2019t quite ready for it. So we rolled that out and it worked pretty well. It was a purple box. Now, we have a number of different things like different mechanisms for the box, different power configurations for different product lines, different in array of more colors that come out in like an SFC. So it\u2019s a much more comprehensive thing.","Bret Jordan","Okay. And a housekeeping question for Aldo. On corporate expense, I think a couple of years ago, I think you guys have given some a range of guidance like 90 to 100 and we keep coming in below that. Should I think about future corporate expense being closer to what we\u2019re seeing this quarter? Or does that whole guide still hold?","Aldo Pagliari","I think the guide holds, Bret, for this year we\u2019re trending towards the low end of that range, so 90 is about a good target. The reason we have made a little bit the progress this quarter is every second quarter, we true up our pension calculations working with our actuaries. We got a little bit of good news and it\u2019s accounts for most of the year-over-year improvement this quarter, when it comes to that. And then as you go forward, you don\u2019t have the quite benefit of that one-time adjustment. So anyway, corporate expenses trend and may be more towards 90-ish.","Bret Jordan","Okay, great. I thanks a lot guys. I appreciate it.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks, good morning. On the \u2013 taking credit a little during the quarter, saw that in originations in tool storage, I think there is probably a relationship there. Would we expect a bigger impact in the third quarter with the full period of the tighter credit practices?","Nick Pinchuk","Well, you\u2019ll have \u2013 I think we have two months worth in this quarter. You\u2019ll have three months then. On the other hand, you\u2019re offsetting that. Anytime you make a change in credit, people tend to be take a little time to try to understand the new rules more with more clarity. This is just a fact. So I don\u2019t know. You could because you got one more month. On the other hand, you\u2019ll have people operating with more clarity. So I\u2019m not so sure. In any case, we don\u2019t expect the huge impact.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. And on the inventory, it sounds like your sort of we anticipating a tail-off of that. Do you think that the tools growth rate has probably put in a bottom here?","Nick Pinchuk","Well, I can never comment. I hate to do that because many times, I\u2019ve been humiliated by saying I thought that things were over, but look, we\u2019re not \u2013 this is a very slim quarter for the Tools Group, but I know they\u2019re going to work pretty hard to try to energize this tool storage business and we think the market is strong. So we\u2019ll see how that plays out. I guess, I can\u2019t make any predictions, but I think this is what we do. We revitalize products. We change marketing. This is the kind of thing that Tools Group does and over the years, we\u2019ve been pretty good at it. So I\u2019m confident in them. But I can\u2019t make any predictions on a quarter-to-quarter basis. That\u2019s difficult to say. I\u2019m pretty confident. So that the Tools Group is over time is at \u2013 in that range of 4% to 6%, I\u2019m very confident of that.","Christopher Glynn","Okay, thanks. And last one, I was going to ask about to Aldo, how long things that might cycle through this sort of increasing trend of charge-offs? But it sounded, Aldo, like you thought that trend is kind of matured at this juncture.","Aldo Pagliari","Yes. I think the kind of level of charge-offs and provisioning we\u2019re seeing right now will be reflective of what we\u2019ll likely see in the second half. You never know what certainty, of course, but like I said, the movement among the credit companies portfolios have been rather stable at this point in time. So we will go back through the level of provisions and what we had a year or so ago, probably not. At the same time, I don\u2019t see it accelerating.","Christopher Glynn","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to Ms. Kratcoski for any additional or closing remarks.","Leslie Kratcoski","Thanks, Anna and thanks, everyone for joining us today. A replay of the call will be available later on snapon.com, and as always, we appreciate your interest in the company. Good day.","Operator","And once again, that does concludes today\u2019s conference. And we thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
