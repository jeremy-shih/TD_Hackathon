Welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Q4 2015 earnings release conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's teleconference is being recorded.","And I would now like to turn the conference over to the Senior Director of Finance, Investor Relations for Intuitive Surgical, Mr. Calvin Darling. Please go ahead, sir","Calvin Darling","Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO, Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer and Patrick Clingan, Senior Director of Finance.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties.","These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 5, 2015 and 10-Q, filed on October 21, 2015. These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's EDGAR database. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.","Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com, on the Audio Archives section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website.","Today's format will consist of providing you with our highlights of our fourth quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Marshall will provide a review of our fourth quarter financial results, Patrick will discuss marketing and clinical highlights, then I will provide our financial outlook for 2016 and finally we will host a question-and-answer session.","With that, I will turn it over to Gary.","Gary Guthart","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on the call today. 2015 was a good year for Intuitive with increased use of our products around the globe and solid operational execution. Our focus in 2015 was to drive adoption of our platform in general surgery, expand our da Vinci Xi Surgical System product line, increase our organizational capability and performance in international markets and improve contribution margins for our newly launched products. Themes that emerged at the close of 2014 continued into 2015 with strong performance in general surgery and international procedure growth.","Full-year global procedure growth was approximately 14%, led by growth in general surgery, growth in the use of da Vinci surgical systems outside the United States and strength in urology. U.S. general surgery growth was approximately 31% for the year made up of strong growth in inguinal hernia repair, ventral hernia repair and colorectal surgery, use of single site in cholecystectomy and hysterectomy declined for the year. Outside of the United States, procedure growth was strong, rising approximately 26% over procedures in 2014. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call.","Looking at trends in capital sales for the year, capital placements increased in 2015 to 492 from 431 placements in 2014. Customer interest and acceptance of our latest platform da Vinci Xi has been positive with Xi making up the majority of placements for the year. In 2015, we shipped 298 systems in the United States, 90 in Europe, 77 in Asia and 27 in other global markets. Our operations teams remain focused on optimizing our manufacturing, design and supply chains for our newer products. Progress in the back half of 2015 has been solid with steady improvements in reducing product costs for our new systems and advanced instruments. We expect our product cost to continue to improve in 2016 and 2017 as a result of these efforts.","As we have said before, our offerings make up an ecosystem designed to encompass our customers' needs in building and running outstanding robotic surgery programs. 2015 was a year which we focused on enabling our ecosystem with new product launches globally. We launched our da Vinci Xi system with a core set of instruments, vessel sealer and Firefly Fluorescence Imaging in 2014. We broadened access to our Xi system with international regulatory clearances through the year. We also added our 45 millimeter Xi stapler in Q1 as well as Harmonic Curved Shears and a second set of instruments in Q2 of 2015. We submitted our 510(k) for our 30 millimeter stapler for Xi, single site instrument kit for Xi as well as other Xi accessories in the second half of 2015. I am pleased to report that we obtained FDA clearance for integrated Xi table motion this month.","In addition to products, our surgeon customers can choose from dozens of training courses provided by academic surgeons as well as courses designed for assistance and other operating room staff. Our customers own over 1,400 surgical simulators and over 600 dual consoles to assist them in technology training. In addition, our teams have provided detailed analytic and operational support for customers seeking to optimize and benchmark their programs relative to international norms. We believe the combination of these products and services are important to fully enable our customers.","Looking back at the full year of 2015, our operating performance is summarized as follows. Worldwide procedures grew by approximately 14%. We shipped 492 da Vinci surgical systems in the year, up from 431 in 2014. Total revenue was $2.4 billion, up 12% from 2014 and up 15% on a constant currency basis. Recurring revenue grew to $1.7 billion, up 11% and comprising 70% of total revenue. We generated $946 million in pro forma operating profit, up 16% from last year. Pro forma net income was $731 million, up 20% from 2014 and we repurchased 366,000 shares at an average price of $502 per share during 2015.","Turning to our operating performance for the fourth quarter. Procedures grew approximately 15% over the fourth quarter of last year. We shipped 158 da Vinci surgical systems, up from 137 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Total pro forma revenue for the quarter was $677 million, up 13% from prior year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $326 million, up 16%. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $293 million in the quarter, up 28% from the fourth quarter of last year and pro forma net income was $224 million, up 22% from Q4 of 2014.","As we look to the future, we passionately believe that robotic assisted surgery is in its infancy in application and technology. As we have improved our cost and supply chains for new products, we anticipate increasing our investments in key areas that will enable and drive the future of robotic assisted surgery. These include product investments in advanced imaging, advanced instrumentation and next generation robotics. We will also continue to invest in procedure, product and program analytics, international market development and economic and clinical validation.","Looking to 2016, our priorities are as follows. First, we will focus on the expanded use of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair. Second, we will work to advance our ecosystem, including expanding our Xi line and taking our Sp product line into initial clinical use. Third, we will drive our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia. And finally, we will continue to assist our customers in their efforts to maximize the comprehensive value of their programs.","I will now turn the call over to Marshall who will review financial highlights.","Marshall Mohr","Thank you, Gary. I will be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis which excludes the impact of our prior year Xi trade-in programs, legal settlements and legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased IP and investment impairments. We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there is no confusion.","Pro forma fourth quarter revenue was $677 million, an increase of 13% compared with $601 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 and an increased to 15% compared with last quarter. Pro forma revenue for the fourth quarter of 2014 excludes $4 million of revenue associated with offers made in 2014 to trade out Si product for Xi product. All trade out offers were either fulfilled or lapsed in 2014. Fourth quarter 2015 procedures of approximately 177,000 increased 15% compared with the fourth quarter of 2014 and increased 9% compared with the third quarter of 2015. Procedure growth was primarily driven by general surgery procedures in the U.S. and urology worldwide.","Revenue highlights are as follows. Pro forma instrument and accessory revenue increased 16% compared with last year. It increased 9% compared with the third quarter of 2015. The increase relative to prior year reflects procedure growth and increased sales of advanced instruments, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. The increase over the prior quarter reflects procedure growth and sales of advanced instruments, partially offset by customer buying patterns.","Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including initial stocking orders was approximately $1,840 per procedure. This metric has now been trending in a tight range between $1,830 and $1,840 per procedure over the past year with recent quarters reflecting higher sales of advanced instruments offset by the impact of foreign exchange.","Pro forma system revenue of $231 million increased 9% compared with last year and increased 32% compared with last quarter. The increase relative to the prior year primarily reflects increased unit sales. The increase relative to the third quarter reflects increased unit sales, partially offset by lower ASPs. 158 systems replaced in the fourth quarter compared with 137 systems in the fourth quarter 2014 and 117 systems last quarter. Approximately 72% of the systems shipped in the quarter were Xi which is comparable to prior quarter.","Globally, our average systems price of $1,550,000 is comparable to the fourth quarter 2014, slightly less than $1,600,000 ASP last quarter. Relative to the prior year, increases related to the lower trade-in mix were mostly offset by foreign exchange. The decrease relative to the third quarter reflects geographic mix and a lower proportion of Xi dual consoles. ASPs fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on geographic and product mix, trade-in volume and changes in foreign exchange rates.","Hospitals financed approximately 17% of the systems placed in the fourth quarter, down from 25% last quarter. We directly financed 20 systems, including placing the most operating leases, 16, since we began our direct leasing program in the second quarter 2014. As of the end of the fourth quarter, 49 of the 3,597 systems out in the field were under operating leases. We exclude the impact of operating leases from our system ASP calculations.","Service revenue of $120 million increased 9% year-over-year and increased 2% compared with the third quarter of 2015. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect the increase in our installed base of da Vinci systems.","Outside of U.S. results were as follows. Fourth quarter pro forma revenue outside of the U.S. of $219 million increased 11% compared with $198 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 and increased 45% compared with $151 million last quarter. The increase compared with the previous year reflects higher system unit sales and higher recurring revenue driven by procedure growth of 27%. Outside the U.S., we placed 75 systems in the fourth quarter compared with 66 in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 37 systems last quarter. Current quarter system sales included 13 into China, 11 in Japan, eight into Italy and seven into Brazil. System placements outside the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of these markets are in the early stages of adoption, some markets are highly seasonal reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns and sales in to some markets are constrained by government regulations.","The pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 69.6% compared with 67.1% for the fourth quarter of 2014 and 69.3% for the third quarter of 2015. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2014, the higher gross margin reflects lower inventory charges, improved efficiencies, partially offset by foreign exchange and a higher mix of our newer products, which carry lower gross margins than our mature products. Gross margin includes the impact of the medical device tax which has been suspended for the next two years. The medical device tax reduced our 2015 gross margin by approximately 70 basis points. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, on whether we are required to pay the medical device tax and costs associated with manufacturing efficiencies and product charges.","In 2014, we recorded pretax charges of approximately $82 million representing the estimated cost of settling a number of product legal liability claims under a tolling agreement. During 2015, we refined our estimate of the overall cost of settling claims and recorded additional charges of approximately $14 million in the first half of the year. There were no charges in the second half of 2015. Charges made related to this agreement are excluded from our pro forma results and are included in our GAAP results. As of the end of the fourth quarter, $24 million remained accrued on our balance sheet as a significant portion of the estimated cost have been paid.","Pro forma operating expenses which exclude reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expense and amortization of purchased IP, increased 7% compared with the fourth quarter of 2014 and increased 6% compared with last quarter. Year-over-year increase in pro forma operating expenses primarily reflects headcount additions and higher incentive compensation. The increase relative to the third quarter primarily reflects increased incentive compensation.","Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 24.9% compared with an effective tax rate of 23.5% for the fourth quarter of 2014 and 18.4% last quarter. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2015 included tax benefits of $29 million or $0.77 per share related to a recent favorable tax court ruling involving an independent third party.","In late December, Congress renewed the federal research and development credit, resulting in a benefit of $6 million or $0.17 per share. Congress also made the R&D tax credit permanent, so our 2016 rate guidance will reflect this benefit. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S. and oUS income.","Our fourth quarter 2015 pro forma net income was $224 million or $5.89 per share, compared with $184 million or $4.92 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014 and $199 million or $5.24 per share for the third quarter 2015. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends.","I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $677 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with $605 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 and $590 million for the third quarter of 2015. GAAP net income was $190 million or $4.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with $147 million or $3.94 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014 and $167 million or $4.40 per share for the third quarter of 2015.","We ended the year with cash and investments of $3.3 billion, up from $3.1 billion as of September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by stock buybacks. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 167,000 shares for $84 million at an average price of $505 per share. This brings our total stock repurchases for 2015 to approximately $184 million.","With that, I would like to turn it over to Patrick who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights.","Patrick Clingan","Thanks, Marshall. So the fourth quarter year-over-year procedures grew approximately 15% with U.S. procedures growing approximately 12% and international procedures growing approximately 27%. Full year 2015 procedure growth was approximately 14% with U.S. procedures growing approximately 11% and international procedures growing approximately 26%.","In the U.S., fourth quarter procedure growth of approximately 12% was driven by continued strength in general surgery procedures with solid contribution coming from mature procedures despite already high levels of market penetration. We do not expect the strong 2015 growth in established U.S. urology and gynecology procedures to continue in 2016.","In U.S. urology, fourth quarter growth in da Vinci prostatectomy and kidney cancer procedures continued at similar rates as earlier in the year. We continue to believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market. In 2015, procedure growth in U.S. urology was approximately 12%, led by an approximate 11% growth in da Vinci prostatectomy. We expect U.S. da Vinci prostatectomy procedure volumes to return to a level more in-line with prostate cancer incidence rate going forward.","In U.S. gynecology, fourth quarter procedures grew modestly year-over-year with growth in malignant and complex hysterectomy partially offset by declines in benign procedures. During 2015, a larger proportion of da Vinci hysterectomy procedures were performed by gynecologic oncologists compared to 2014. For the year, growth in U.S. gynecology procedures was approximately 1%. In 2016, sustaining growth in U.S. gynecology maybe a challenge as we believe the total market for benign hysterectomies will continue to decline at a low single-digit rate.","Fourth quarter growth in U.S. general surgery remains strong with robust growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures, being partially offset by continued declines in cholecystectomies. U.S. general surgery procedure growth was approximately 31% for the year with broad-based growth across several procedures, led by hernia repair, which generated the largest number of new general surgery procedures. Growth in colorectal resections was also stronger in 2015. In 2016, there remains a large opportunity in hernia repair and colorectal resections and driving adoption these markets remains among our top priorities.","During the quarter a group of general surgeons, led by Dr. Vorst from St. Joseph Mercy Health System and Dr. Carbonell from the University of South Carolina School of Medicine published their perspective on advances in ventral and incisional hernia repair in the World Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery. Within the paper, data comparing the robotic to open Rives-Stoppa technique for more complex hernias favored the robotic approach with the reduction in blood loss, shorter length of hospital stay, fewer surgical site infections and no difference in operative times or direct costs. The paper states that robotic approach \"permits relatively easy access to the interior abdominal wall allowing the surgeon to perform the ideal repair for that patient. It also might allow for standardization of surgical technique in order to develop a reliable approach to hernia repair that can be offered to an increasing number of patients.\"","Regarding our U.S. single site business, cholecystectomy volumes continued to decline during the fourth quarter, though mostly offset by a growth in multiport cholecystectomies. In addition, our single site gynecology procedure volumes declined in the fourth quarter. Taken together, single site procedures represented less than 5% of our fourth quarter U.S. procedure volume.","Looking abroad during the fourth quarter, the approximate 27% international procedure growth was led by the global adoption of da Vinci prostatectomy with solid contributions from kidney procedures, malignant hysterectomies and colorectal resections. For the full year, procedure growth was approximately 26%. Procedure growth in Europe remained steady throughout 2015. In Asia, procedure growth was led by broad-based adoption in China and South Korea and da Vinci prostatectomy adoption in Japan. During 2016, we expect several external factors to impact international procedure growth. In Japan, the Surgical Society has submitted for reimbursement of partial nephrectomies to the MHLW. Pending the MHLW's decision, this may serve as a tailwind to Japanese procedure growth. In China, we have placed 32 of the 38 da Vinci systems under the current authorization and sustaining strong procedure growth throughout 2016 may require additional authorizations from the government.","During the quarter, the global evidence for the cost-effectiveness for the use of da Vinci surgery in gynecologic oncology continued to build. A new study from Copenhagen University Hospital by Dr. Hurley and colleagues modeled the clinical and economic impact of the adoption of da Vinci for malignant hysterectomies capturing the comprehensive cost of care associated with these interventions. The study compared 158 open hysterectomies to 202 da Vinci hysterectomies and found that da Vinci hysterectomies were 17% less expensive than open hysterectomies based on operating cost and 7% less expensive than open hysterectomies when the da Vinci system cost was included. The study found the cost savings associated with fewer complications and shorter hospitalization more than offset the incremental costs associated with the use of da Vinci technology in the operating room. 2015 was a robust year for clinical publications featuring da Vinci surgery with over 1,600 papers published during the year, bringing total clinical publications to over 10,000.","This concludes my remarks. I thank you for your time. I will now turn the call over to Calvin.","Calvin Darling","Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our financial outlook for 2016. Starting with procedures, as described in our announcement last week, 2015 total da Vinci procedures grew approximately 14% to roughly 652,000 procedures performed worldwide. During 2016, we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 9% to 12%. We expect similar seasonal timing of procedures in 2016 as we have experienced in previous years with Q1 being the seasonally weakest quarter as patient deductibles are reset.","With respect to revenue, we expect 2016 capital sales to follow historical seasonal patterns, which we anticipate will become more pronounced with Q1 being sequentially lower than the recently completed Q4. System placements will likely continue to be lumpy, particularly in markets outside of the U.S. as some of these markets are in early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns and sales in to some markets are constrained by government regulations.","Turning to gross profit. We expect our 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 68% and 69.5% of net revenue. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product and regional mix.","Turning to operating expenses. As Gary mentioned, we will be increasing our investments in key areas that will enable and drive the future of robotic assisted surgery. We expect to grow 2016 operating expenses between 9% and 13% above 2015 levels. We expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2016, compared to $168 million in 2015. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $20 million and $25 million in 2016.","With regard to income tax, we expect our 2016 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5% and 28.5% of pretax income depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and oUS profits. This forecast does reflect the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2016.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question today comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Roman","Thank you and good evening everybody. I wanted to start with just one strategic question and one follow up on the financial guidance that Calvin just provided. Maybe on the strategic side, I was hoping Gary you could go into your thoughts as it relates to the competitive landscape in robotics? We have heard over the past several months announcement from a couple of emerging competitors and there is an expected announcement from another competitor later in 2016. Can you maybe talk about how you envision the competitive landscape unfolding and some of the activities you maybe undertaking to prepare Intuitive for moving from a monopoly type market to one that has multiple players?","Gary Guthart","Sure. As we look at value and competition, at the end of the day, value is going to be driven by the ability of these products and services to drive great outcomes and compared or weighed against the price of those things. So we think about it as an ecosystem. We think the ecosystem is really important. So it's easy to think just about the robotic system because that's the most visible part, but there is the systems, the instruments and accessories, advanced instrumentation like stapling, imaging systems, fluorescence imaging, training technologies like stimulators and dual console, clinical validation training courses offered by academic surgeons that number in the dozens, that whole set of products and ecosystem, we think, is important.","And so as competitors enter, they have to choose. Can they show that value in terms of outcomes and price and can they offer the set of ecosystem elements that they are going to be a useful? We have known for years and have anticipated for years. We didn't wake up yesterday and think competitors are coming, we better do something. So we have been thoughtful about what we need to do to create value for our customers. We have a range of products in the system side that has different price points for different feature content. We have different options that are available in terms of instrumentation price points. And so we think we are really well positioned.","There are some other companies out there that will be capable. We expect that customers will explore what they are offering. We think we are well positioned when that exploration occurs.","David Roman","Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just to go into the financial side for a second. Just trying to understand what you are saying on the margins for 2016. The gross margin range seems to imply that on an underlying basis, when you take of the benefit of the medical device tax you are seeing a deterioration from where you sort of exited the second half of 2015? What are the factors influencing that math? And then on the OpEx side, the 9% to 13% represents a pretty decent acceleration from what we saw this year. Can you maybe help put some of those investments into context? Where those dollars are going? And whether 2016 represents a new normal year of investment spending? Or there is something particular that you are after this year?","Calvin Darling","Sure, David. I will take you through some of the gross profit commentary and let Gary take you through some of the investments on the OpEx side. Like Gary said on the call, we are focused on reducing our cost of the new products and we have been managing our fixed cost very carefully. We are pleased with the progress we have been making throughout 2015. Our second half 2015 gross profit benefited from favorable product mix, essentially zero product charges and other favorable outcomes.","In 2016, we do expect to deliver continued cost reductions on the newer products, including the Xi, stapler, vessel sealer and Xi endoscopes. At the same time, as compared to the second half of 2015, we would expect a higher proportion of 2016 sales to be of the newer products. We would expect a lower proportion of dual console systems sales, probably higher proportion of system sales involving trade-ins and probably some product charges.","At some point, we would be more line with historical norms from the past. And while FX is not likely to be as strong a headwind as it was in 2015, it does appears as though it will have some negative impact on revenue and margins. And then lastly, I would say, from a competitive side, any pressure there or the impacts of that are unknown at this stage.","Gary Guthart","On the ultimately investment side, as I mentioned in the script, we think that there is significant opportunity to improve what surgeons can see during cases improving imaging through a variety of means technologically and we have been working on that for years and we will continue to do so. I think there is great potential there.","On the instrumentation side, we are expanding our stapling line and our advanced energy lines. The reception has been quite good. Those are not single instruments. They are really families of instruments and we are filling out those families as we go. We feel good about it and think it's important we will continue to invest there and we think that there are opportunities in robotics in terms of both structure, things like SP and other things that can change different segments of the market that can allow us to enter other procedures that we are not currently in today or access other regions of the world that may have different needs.","And so we will continue investing in those things.","David Roman","Okay. I appreciate all the detail. Thank you.","Operator","And we do have a question for the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Lewis","Good afternoon. Sorry, I want to come back to margins here for a second. The spread on margins and maybe Marshall or Calvin, so it's 68% to 69.50%, it's a wider spread of how you gave us the spread last year. So what defines the upper end and lower end of those ranges? And I guess secondarily, when I think about these product manufacturing improvements you are making, we seem to have a substantial impact on gross margins in the second half of the year. I guess I would presume those advantages or those costs would be a bigger tailwind in 2016 over 2015. Is that kind of a correct statement? Those two questions and I have a quick follow-up.","Marshall Mohr","To characterize the cost reductions, they had some impact in the second half of 2015. They will have a more significant impacted in 2016 and 2017. As Calvin had said, we will continue to focus on reducing the costs. I think the bigger improvement during 2015 had to do with the lack of product charges that we mentioned in Q1. And as we move forward, the range has really, the breadth of the range is really reflective of the items that Calvin gave you, which is that we expected to see a higher proportion of newer products, the extent of that we will see. We expect to see a lower proportion of dual consoles and a higher proportion of trade-ins. The mix of systems is always difficult to predict. And frankly geographic mix also has an implication here. And as I said in my script, there is a quite a bit of lumpiness to some of those geographic markets.","David Lewis","Okay. And then Gary just a quick strategic and margin question for you as well. So the expense to saw a couple years ago, you made a selective decision just to reinvest, This is a 50% increase in OpEx spending relative to 15%, 400 to 500 basis points above. Do you see this similarly as the opportunity to reinvest? And is the investments spend heavier on SG&A or R&D? And the follow-up is, on Sp as you mentioned, in light of what's happening with single site procedures, has that changes your thinking of the opportunity around Sp? Sorry for the couple of couple questions there. Thank you.","Gary Guthart","Sure. Yes. In terms of the balance of investment, it really is targeted in a couple of areas. R&D is clearly one area that will get investment and then support for international markets and some of those things are more structural, not necessarily just sales folks but clinical trials and other things. So that's where the balance or the bulk of that increase is going to lay in. And we think we have technologies that are important and we think we have process that we can bring that's important and that will serve us well in the long-term and in the future.","With regard to Sp, vis-\u00e0-vis single site, we think that Sp really enters and adds value in a different place than single site does. Single site tended to work on a little bit more limited workspace, a little bit more constrained set of procedures. Sp is both broader and more capable. Price points are a little bit different. So we think about Sp when we think transoral, transanal, colorectal, places where there is specimen removal. So we look at those things. We think about it.","Sp is less oriented towards cosmetic benefits and more aimed towards being able to reach complex structures where you need to.","David Lewis","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we question for the line of Tao Levy with Wedbush. Please go ahead.","Tao Levy","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. So maybe we can start with U.S. system utilization. When you do the math, you are reaching peak levels here in the U.S. in terms of averages. And so what's the dynamic currently in the marketplace whereby hospitals could potentially accelerate the addition of new systems in order to meet your procedure growth expectations that you have laid out?","Gary Guthart","Yes. To make sure I understand the question right, I think as we look at utilization patterns, one thing is important to remember around the world, but in the U.S. as well, is there is not a single customer profile that fits them all. So the average does not cover all the endpoints. And so we definitely see some integrated delivery networks who are very interested in optimizing procedures per system per year and just trying to drive that up to get better capital utilization and we will help them do that. We see other health systems that maybe in the exact same market, who were really interested in driving convenience for patients and for their surgeons and are willing to invest in capital once they get the minimum hurdle rate for procedure use or utilization.","And so we see both. Predicting which of those strategies is going to dominate into the year is always a little bit hard. And at the end of the day, we really focus the organization on great utilization and great support, whichever strategy our customer wants to take us down.","Tao Levy","Okay. And just my follow-up, you have talked a couple of times about investing more and more into imaging and aside from Firefly, we haven't seen anything very significant come out of other companies. So maybe you could highlight a couple of the interesting projects within imaging that we should be paying attention to? Thanks.","Gary Guthart","Sure. I think, the first statement is, I beg to differ, but I look at the imaging platform that we brought out with Xi and it's a fundamentally different technology basis, distal chip imaging. That gives us room to do some things from usability, reach and workflow point of view that were very hard to do otherwise. And so we continue down that pathway.","So for example, in Xi, you can move the scope arm-to-arm, There is not a dedicated robot to hold one endoscope. So that gives you the idea of port hopping, the ability to look around the abdomen differently. The other thing that distal chip imaging gets you is the ability to articulate your endoscope which is a part of the Sp product line is endoscopic articulation.","We continue to invest in that technology and expand our leadership position there because I think that both you can get better image quality and more flexibility and better price points by doing that technology. So that's one set of investments.","The other set is, as you mentioned with Firefly, the ability to look and see things that you can't see easily with a white light. So the ability to look and see beneath tissue or to highlight tissue structure and there are a set of technologies there that are useful and we are investing in, but those are longer term. They take a while to develop and as we get further down the pipeline we will share with you where we are.","Tao Levy","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Ben Andrew","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. On the initial Sp use, Gary, that you talked about and you listed a few applications there, should we assume that's where we will see some initial clinical work? And when might we see results from those, either published or discussed? Is that later this year, next year that maybe leads to next steps of commercializing the product?","Gary Guthart","Right. Yes. In terms of first question, those are places where we are intended to explore. So colorectal and in transoral. We will also explore other places in time but those are our initial experience. We expect to have our initial experiences. In terms of timelines, I am not ready yet to tell you when in the year it will happen. We are still in conversations with regulatory bodies about pathway and so as we get some clarity there, then we will describe to you later in the year.","Ben Andrew","Okay. And on that same main, if you look out three or four years, can the Sp platform be a material percentage of the company's volumes? Or is this something that probably remains a niche given the price point and we shouldn't really think differently about the distribution of 5% or 10%, if you will?","Gary Guthart","I think that it offers surgeons a different way to think about getting into the body and a different approach. It can deliver a lot of capability in a small package parallel into the body and it can move about the body quite easily in terms of multi-quadrant access. So I think it's hard to predict long-term. I think, for sure, near-term there are initiatives that I think it matters. Whether those initiatives grow into bigger opportunities, I think remains to be seen.","Having said that, the history of Intuitive and the history of technology is that as you bring raw technology into the hands of experts and they start to use and then develop it a way leads to way and I believe that. I think that we will see things that develop as surgeons get deep with it. How big that gets, impossible to predict right now.","Ben Andrew","Okay. And then lastly for me. Thank you for taking the question, by the way. The range of procedure guidance is a little wide to start the year obviously. And let's just try to isolate one effect if we can, China. So if we don't see another authorization for system sales, is that a material impact within the range? Is that a percentage point or two in terms of a potential swing? Or how should we look at, for example China specifically?","Calvin Darling","Yes. Thanks for the question, Ben. When it comes to procedure guidance, our focus is going to continue to be on driving growth in general surgery in our international markets, including China. When you look at the breadth of the range to your question, there is far bigger impact than just the system authorization in China when it comes to the mature procedures in the U.S. and the rates of growth that we may see there that benefited us in 2015 and certainly across a much wider range of markets.","Ben Andrew","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Matt O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","J.P. McKim","Hi everyone. This is actually J.P., in for Matt. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to get back to the margin profile for next year and ask it in a more simple way. So if you exclude the 70 basis points that you gain through the med tax credit, given the guidance you gave for OpEx next year, would we be expecting the adjusted EBIT margins to actually be down year-over-year?","Calvin Darling","Yes. I think there are a lot of layered assumptions that go into the model and we don't have specific guidance as it relates to that. Revenue would be one of factors certainly underlying the overall assumptions. So I think what we tried to do is lay out a lot of factors that would be impacting the gross margin as well as the investments we are making on the expense side.","J.P. McKim","Got it. And if I could ask one on the recent clearance to the integrated table motion. How is that sale going to be? And how are guys going to get revenue from that? Is that going to be sales from Trumpf Medical and you guys would get a piece of the revenue? Or how will that work?","Gary Guthart","Yes. I would say, Trumpf will sell the table in an independent transaction to the hospital. What we get out of it is, we sell a software upgrade package for the table that allows it to operate it in an integrated fashion.","Calvin Darling","Yes. I think for us the key here is we are working to make the operation more efficient, right. This will make the ability for surgeons to reposition the patient without having to withdraw the robot arms, redock during a procedure, make it more efficient and therefore it benefits certain groups of procedures and hopefully drive adoption. I think that's really the key benefit from our perspective.","J.P. McKim","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We do question the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bob Hopkins","Thanks and good afternoon. So I wanted to ask a question about 2016 revenue growth to start. Can you give us a sense as to where you see incremental opportunities for acceleration? So what are the areas where you see or product categories where you see the potential for accelerating revenue growth or entirely new growth drivers in 2016 versus what you experienced in 2015? Obviously we are well aware what the major growth drivers are, I am curious about the things that potentially are available to you in 2016 that weren't available in 2015.","Marshall Mohr","Yes. As you know, we look at 2016 in a couple places. I think that we have opportunities in oUS markets in various places that are important to us. Now there are some structural things that we have to overcome in and invest in and sometimes they are reimbursement and sometimes there are other parts of market access and we will do that. But I think the opportunity there is quite good. I think in terms of other verticals we are working on a 30 millimeter stapler, the 30-millimeter stapler is really targeted at thoracic procedures. Xi system design, part of it's design intent was to facilitate thoracic procedures and we are in early days there. So as time goes on, I don't think that's something that's going to leap out of the gate in the beginning part of the year, but things we are investing in from a product and support point of view that should build momentum over the next multiple quarters.","Bob Hopkins","And then Marshall, to follow-up on two quick things. On the revenue per procedure number and you highlighted, that's been very stable within a range but it feels like the cadence of new products will pickup as we move forward there. Can we expect that line item to start moving back up towards the old highs as we go forward here? And then the other quick thing I wanted to ask of you is, I appreciate the comment that 70% of revenues now come from disposables. Can you give us a rough sense as to what the relative profitability of that disposable stream is versus the capital side of the business?","Marshall Mohr","Yes. So first, talking about the range of I&A revenue per procedure, we would hope that we would be able to add to that number through increases in the advanced instrumentation including stabling and vessel sealing. As I said, that's been somewhat muted or offset by the effects of foreign-exchange over the last few quarters but there are other factors that could change that. I don't know what the historical high you are speaking about was, but I do think that there is room for it to grow going forward.","Bob Hopkins","It was about $2,000, I think.","Marshall Mohr","Yes. And then remember, that number has in it stocking orders and timing of other things. So longer-term, as you have a bigger and bigger install base, the relative value of stocking orders is going to go down and that has nothing to do with sort of the pure economics of the exchange. The other question was around recurring revenue and remember it's not just instruments, it is also service.","Calvin Darling","Yes. That's about 50% is instruments and accessories of revenue and 20% would be the service element to get to the 70% total recurring.","Marshall Mohr","And the margins on instruments and accessories are better than systems. And so as we get a quarter where we have a higher systems, then the margins are going to be lower.","Calvin Darling","And that trend is likely to be durable, the I&A and service will be higher margin than systems.","Bob Hopkins","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Brandon Henry with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Brandon Henry","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. So Intuitive has now shown two years of strong U.S. urology growth. Can you discuss the reason for this outperformance in urology and how sustainable you think this strong performance is in 2016?","Gary Guthart","Yes. Brandon, thanks for the question. A year ago, you saw a turnaround in the volumes of da Vinci prostatectomy in the U.S. kind of at the midpoint of the year and the back half of the year started to see some growth and that's sustained throughout 2015. And the rate of growth has been certainly above what we believe the incidence rates of prostrate cancer to be in the country. And also within U.S. urology is growth in partial nephrectomy as well which has been pretty consistent and sustained given the profile of what da Vinci technology brings to that procedure from both clinical outcomes and cost effectiveness perspective. As we look at 2016, our baseline assumption is that the high levels of growth that we have seen over the last six quarters are likely to begin returning more towards the incidence rates of the disease.","Brandon Henry","Okay. And then one quick question on Sp. Can you talk about why you decided to develop Sp as essentially an add-on to Xi platform and not as it's own standalone platform? And then maybe also talk about your expectations for Sp instrumentation and launch? Do you anticipate having a vessel sealer and a stapler at launch that will work with Sp? Thanks.","Gary Guthart","Yes. On the reason to make it compatible with Xi, I think is really a straightforward thing which is, a lot of the components are shared in terms of surgeon's console and imaging systems. We want customer experience to be seamless for our customers. We think there are surgeons who will go back and forth between Sp and Xi and what that means is that you want the user experience to be common. We also make it easier for hospital departments to acquire capital. If they already have a dual console or an Xi and they want to just add Sp card capability that makes the capital hurdle for them lower. And so it strengthens the Xi ecosystem and I think that is a good idea and it is well received. So that has made sense for us. We haven't yet announced what our instrument kit will be for Sp and when we get to that point, we will let you know.","Brandon Henry","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Richard Newitter","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just one on Sp and then I had one on the rotating bed. On Sp, Gary did you say that you are moving into clinical testing or some sort of limited launch by the end of this year? Does that mean that's your official launch at the end of 2016?","Gary Guthart","We don't expect material revenues in 2016. We are planning on clinical experiences in 2016.","Richard Newitter","Okay. Got it. And then on Sp, on the approval process, I know you said that it's in discussion with the FDA right now. There is a competitor of yours that has a device that they are saying that they think they can get approval for their device based on larger buckets or broader definitions of categories like urological procedures or general abdominal procedures. Can you help us understand if this is something that you have heard the FDA say to you as well? Or is it more nuanced than that and you need to go much more specific by individual procedures?","Gary Guthart","Yes. So the issue of broad claim language versus narrower claim language actually was a part of the discussion at the FDA workshop and I can refer you to those minutes and you will see pretty much what the exchange has been. The issue I would not view that as something that's architecture dependent or only offered to a certain company. That has to do -- and FDA is going to respond to these kind of products in like manner as far as I can tell and so that comes down to -- FDA asked for a certain amount of data based on the kind of things you want to talk to your customer about. And if you just want to talk about broad things and not specific things, then they asked for one set of data and the more specific you get, the more data they ask for around that set of specifics. So in general, it's a matching of data requirements with claims. And so they are describing to you a strategy around what they think they can do from a data requirement point of view. I think the playing field will be leveled here and to the extent that customers need a certain amount of information, then it's just going to be for all of us to go create that data and deliver it.","Richard Newitter","Got it. And just lastly on the bed. Can you help us understand what procedures, if any or certain types of surgeons that might have been on the sidelines for whom this product might push them over the fence and really drive adoption into procedures that otherwise might have been slower to adopt? Is there any specific procedures that could really open up? Thanks.","Gary Guthart","Yes. General surgeons routinely use that motion to do two things, to use gravity as a retractor. So it's an extra hand using gravity and for the anesthesiologist who manage the patient in terms of positioning with regard to other vital signs and things like that. So in procedures where you are trying to manage bowel for example, it is really helpful to have table motion and that is clearly something that jumps out. However once we have had it, we have now been CE marked in Europe and we have had a trial in different specialties, I think it's appeal is broad. So we thought about it upfront initially around general surgery. I think its appeal will be broader than that.","Richard Newitter","Thank you.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.","Gary Guthart","Rick, you will be our last questioner.","Rick Wise","Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it, Gary. Maybe just to start with you Gary, you said several times in the course of your prepared remarks and then the Q&A that robotics is in its infancy. Just a big picture for a second, are you emphasizing it because perhaps this next wave of pipeline products that you have talked about and maybe some you haven't talked about are getting you more confident or excited about the potential for another growth reacceleration or an inflection point in the adoption of robotic surgery. I appreciate the number of systems placed relative to hospitals is small but just wondered if there was anything more there.","Gary Guthart","Sure. I think a couple of things that excites me and leads me to believe there is a lot of opportunity, couple. One of them is that I think in the architectures we are in today in the markets for which we have clearances, there is still a lot of procedures that are being done open and have opportunity to be done minimally invasively with our products. And I think that comes down to execution and delivery of some of things we have in the pipeline.","Having said that, I think that as you just stand back and look out over the next decade and ask, do we think that robotic assisted surgery can impact more procedures or more types of procedures than they are being impacted today, I think the answer to that is, absolutely yes. Some things are things like Sp, products that look different. Sp won't be the last set of products that look different. We think there are opportunities for other products and technologies that can really make a difference in surgeons delivering great care.","And so we are excited about it. And we are investing in it and I think ask just about any surgeon, do you think that the use of computation analytics and robotics is going to improve your practice over time or become less important, the answered is pretty uniform that those kinds of technologies should help them if they are well delivered and well executed.","Rick Wise","Got you. Two last quick ones I will ask at the same time. Estimating accessories growth, I think for the first time in at least five quarters, maybe longer, certainty since 2012 annually did grow faster than procedures. Is there something that we should read into that with implications on next couple of years? Or is it just stocking, given the flattish revenues per procedure? And the second one I will throw at you at the same time, the bed approval. You launched it in Europe in 2015. Just maybe get your early experience there. Did it drive utilization or procedures or Xi or capital sales? Any color there would be welcome. Thanks. I appreciate it.","Calvin Darling","Yes. On the revenue per procedure, I don't think that's much more than what we said. There is a lot of factors that impact that particular metric. It has been running at a pretty tight range, $1,830 to $1,840. It did tick over to a growth this last quarter as we saw utilization of advanced instruments kind of more than offset some of the headwinds mostly from exchange. But again, I think a lot of those factors could vary in the future in terms of procedure mix, customer efficiency, buying pattern, foreign exchange. So it's really a lot of factors there.","Gary Guthart","On Xi, the surgeon feedback has been outstanding. Too soon to tell in terms of number of sites and duration as to what the changes in trends are, but we will be watching. Thanks, Rick.","That was our last question. As we have said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during the conference call, our organizational focus remains on increasing value by enabling surgeons to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma.","I hope the following comments from Dr. Solomon, a general surgeon from Orlando, Florida gives you some sense of the impact our products have in surgery. \"The advanced technologies and improved dexterity of the da Vinci Xi system have allowed me to perform complex minimally invasive operations with a statistically measurable improvement in outcomes. Our patients are clearly and reproducibly benefiting from less pain, a shorter length of hospital stay, less time off work and lower short and long-term complications.\"","We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and we look forward to talking to you again in three months.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Calvin Darling, Senior Director of Finance, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Calvin Darling","Thank you. Good afternoon. And welcome to Intuitive's third quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; and Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. ","These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 4, 2019 and 10-Q filed on July 22, 2019. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.","Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Latest Events section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website.","Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our third quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session.","Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Marshall will provide a review of our third quarter financial results, then I will discuss procedures and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2019. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.","With that, I will turn it over to Gary.","Gary Guthart","Thank you for joining us today. Intuitive has been enabling customers in their delivery of high-quality, minimally invasive surgery for 20 years, and we believe the adoption of robotics and computer-aided interventions is early relative to its long-term potential.","We measure our efforts by their ability to positively impact the quadruple aim; better outcomes, better patient experience, better care team experience, and lower total cost to treat per patient episode. This third quarter of 2019 was another solid one for Intuitive in pursuit of these aims.","Our performance in the quarter is a reflection of our progress, with procedures and system placements showing continued strength.","For the quarter, global procedure growth was nearly 20%, aided by an increase of approximately a surgery day relative to Q3 of 2018. Growth again centered on general surgery in the United States, with positive contributions to the global growth rate from Germany, Korea and Japan.","China procedure growth continues to be limited by installed base growth. Total procedure growth in China is responding positively considering the release of system quota and subsequent placements.","In the United States, year-over-year procedure growth for the quarter was 18%. General surgery again accounted for the largest increase year-over-year, accompanied by solid growth in urology and stable growth in gynecology. We also saw strength in bariatrics and cholecystectomy.","Hernia repair and colon resection growth rates were solid in the quarter. Improvements in system utilization by customers and alternative capital placement models are having a positive impact on our business.","Our US sales force productivity improved in the quarter as our new team members gained experience. Calvin will take you through global procedure dynamics in more detail later in the call.","With regard to our installed base, placement of new systems in the quarter was solid, with growth in total placements rising 19% from Q3 of 2018. Net of trade-ins and retirements, our da Vinci installed base grew 12% over Q3 2018 to approximately 5,406.","The mix of system placements this quarter moved towards our flagship Xi system and trade-ins were healthy. The proportion of systems placed under operating leases was 33% this quarter compared with 32% last quarter. As a reminder, total placements and the percentage of systems placed under lease or usage-based arrangements can vary substantially quarter-to-quarter.","Turning to expenses, we're investing in building our capability in international regions, launching new platforms, strengthening our computational capabilities, and executing projects that support future sale and provide leverage opportunities as we grow. Our spending is on track with our expectations. It is supported by solid procedure growth, capital placements, and product cost reductions.","Financial highlights for our third quarter results were as follows. Procedures grew nearly 20% over the third quarter of last year. We placed 275 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 231 in the third quarter of 2018.","Our installed base grew 12% from a year ago.","Revenue for the quarter was approximately $1.1 billion, up 23%. Pro forma gross profit margin was 72% compared to 71.5% in the third quarter last year.","Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $606 million, up 25%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $817 million, growing 24% over Q3 of 2018 and representing 72% of total revenue.","We generated a pro forma operating profit of $462 million in the quarter, up 18% from the third quarter of last year. Pro forma net income was $409 million, up 21%, and we repurchased $70 million in shares at an average price of $493 per share.","Turning to our investments in products, I'll start first with systems. We are in our phase 1 launch of da Vinci SP as we work to expand clinical clearances and build SP products at scale.","In the quarter, we proactively held shipments on SP endoscopes and limited new system installations for a limited time as we investigated a robustness concern on the SP endoscope. We resumed shipping endoscopes and systems in the quarter. Given the slowdown on endoscopes, we installed four systems to bring our installed base with SP to 38.","Customer response and early clinical results using SP remain encouraging. In addition, utilization rates for SP in Korea, where clinical indications are the broadest, are at Xi levels already, a testament to surgeons' engagement and our team's skill and design for usability.","With regard to additional indications for SP, we have been in discussion with FDA regarding data requirements for a colorectal indication. We expect this to require an IDE trial that includes follow-up analysis. This implies we do not expect the third indication of SP in the US in 2020.","While we had planned for a smoother launch of SP and product availability and new indications timelines, our teams are focused on building at scale and satisfying regulatory requirements for additional indications.","Interest in SP is healthy and clinical outcomes are encouraging, forming the basis of our belief in the long-term potential of the platform to improve care. The combination of additional indications for SP and our readiness for deployment at larger scale pace the speed of our SP commercial expansion.","In flexible diagnostics, our Ion platform is focused on need for accurate and timely biopsies to support definitive early diagnosis of suspicious lesions.","Since our 510(k) clearance in Q1 of this year, we initiated our first phase launch focused on clinical use, customer feedback and production optimization. First cases on the cleared system were performed at the end of Q1. There are now nine systems in the field, performing cases with the total case experience in the hundreds.","To date, the rollout is meeting our expectations with a mix of clinical trial sites and commercial sites. User feedback during this initial launch period has been strong.","For instruments and accessories, our team moved to full United States launch of our 45-millimeter SureForm stapler and obtained clearance for it in Japan and Korea in the quarter.","We also obtained 510(k) clearance for our new Curved-Tip SureForm 45-millimeter stapler and a new gray reload designed to staple thin structures. Recall that surgical stapling is a family of products that help surgeons in a range of procedures covering parts of the body from the rectum to the thoracic cavity.","Robotically-held staplers are a sophisticated technology, and our team is doing an excellent job filling out the product portfolio. Our experience has shown that procedure adoption occurs when the holistic needs of the care team are met, when the right system and imaging products come together with the right instruments and accessories. Stapling is another example of this synergy, with surgeon adoption of generation four da Vinci Systems with SureForm staplers gaining momentum.","Turning to imaging and analytics, we are working on computing and real-time cloud technologies that allow for tasks from telementoring to augmented reality.","We now have over 20 active telementoring sites that together have supported hundreds of cloud-enabled, real-time surgery sessions as we progress in building our real-time cloud capabilities. Feedback on the utility of these sites for case observations and mentoring has been supportive.","In augmented reality, we're working through logistics and installation of our first IRIS accounts to gather customer and clinical feedback. We expect first clinical cases on the IRIS system in the next few months.","Lastly, our surgical simulation products have become widely adopted in the installed base with more than 3,200 da Vinci simulators in the field.","Before turning the time over to Marshall, let's step back and consider Intuitive's evolution over the past few years. Over this period, general surgeons have increased their adoption of our offerings, underpinned by improvements in the quadruple aim and procedures they perform, from colon and rectal procedures, to hernia repair, cholecystectomy and bariatric surgery.","General surgery procedures span a broad range of complexity and economics. At the same time, we've extended our reach into key countries to support the adoption of robotic-assisted surgery into their healthcare environments.","We have flexed our company to better serve these customers, with the launch of new systems, new instruments and updates to our software, along with changes to our sales and support models and pricing structures.","Given the large global opportunity to pursue the quadruple aim, we believe the next few years for the company will be dynamic. We will guide the company to meet our customers' clinical and economic needs across this wide range of procedures and geographies. Doing so will involve continued investment in innovation for both technology and economic models, and we see a path to do both.","For the balance of the year, our focus remains in completing the task we set for ourselves. First, supporting adoption of da Vinci in general surgery and in key procedures in global markets. Second, launching our SP and Ion platforms. Third, driving intelligent surgery innovation. And finally, supporting additional clinical and economic validation in our focus procedures and countries.","I'll now turn the call over to Marshall who will review financial highlights. ","Marshall Mohr","Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website.","Key business metrics for the third quarter are as follows. Third quarter 2019 procedures increased nearly 20% compared with the third quarter of 2018, and increased approximately 2% compared with last quarter.","There was one more operating day in the third quarter of 2019 compared with the third quarter of 2018. Excluding the impact of the extra operating day, we would have been in line with our full year average growth.","Procedure growth continues to be driven by general surgery in the US and urology worldwide. Calvin will review details of procedure growth later in this call.","Third quarter system placements of 275 systems increased 19% compared with 231 systems last year and increased 1% compared with 273 systems last quarter.","We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems by 12% to approximately 5,406 systems. The growth rate compares with 13% in both the last quarter and last year. ","Utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, grew approximately 6%, which is higher than the 4% growth last quarter and below the 7% growth last year.","Our revenue overview is as follows. Third quarter 2019 revenue was $1.1 billion, an increase of 23% compared with $921 million for the third quarter of 2018 and an increase of 3% compared with $1.1 billion last quarter. ","Instrument and accessory revenue of $606 million increased 25% compared with last year, which is higher than procedure growth primarily reflecting customer buying patterns and increased usage of our advanced instruments. ","Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure was approximately $1,980, an increase of 4% compared with the third quarter of 2018 and an increase of 3% compared with last quarter. ","Systems revenue for the third quarter of 2019 was $339 million, an increase of 23% compared with the third quarter of 2018 and a decrease of 2% compared with last quarter. Relative to the third quarter of 2018, systems revenue reflected higher system placements, higher ASPs and higher lease-related revenue. ","We completed 92 operating lease transactions, representing 33% of total placements compared with 58 or 25% of total placements in the third quarter of 2018, and 88 or 32% of total placements last quarter. ","As of September 30, we have 560 operating leases outstanding and realized approximately $27 million of revenue related to these arrangements in the quarter compared with $14 million last year and $25 million last quarter. ","Operating leases create a future source of recurring revenue and reduce the volatility of system revenue, while the increased number of operating systems placed in the quarter dampen short-term revenue growth for the quarter in which they're placed. ","Operating leases include usage-based financings that we provide to certain hospitals with advanced robotics experience. We believe that our lease financing alternatives align with customer objectives and have enabled faster market adoption. ","Relative to systems purchased over the lease period, we earned a small premium reflecting the time value of money. And in the case of usage-based arrangements, the risk that those systems may not achieve anticipated usage levels. The proportion of operating lease and usage-based arrangements will likely increase long term and will vary quarter-to-quarter. ","We recognized $20 million of lease buyout revenue in the third quarter compared with $27 million last quarter and $8 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly from quarter to quarter and will likely continue to do so.","116 or 42% of current quarter system placements involve trade-ins, reflecting customer desire to access or standardize on our fourth generation technology and contributing to an Xi installed base growth of 41% year-over-year. This is an increase compared with 65 or 28% of system placements in the third quarter 2018 and 103 or 38% last quarter.","Trade-in activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict. However, given prior product trade-in cycles, we expect the proportion of installed base traded in in future quarters to decrease over time. ","79% of the systems placed in the quarter were da Vinci Xis and 17% were da Vinci X systems compared with 74% da Vinci Xis and 20% da Vinci Xs last quarter. ","We sold three Ion systems in the quarter. Ion system placements are excluded from our overall systems count and will be reported separately. Procedures and other information associated with Ion are excluded from our prepared remarks and will be reported separately when they become more substantive.","Four of the systems placed in the third quarter were SP systems. Third quarter SP placements were impacted by our decision to hold shipments of endoscopes, as Gary outlined.","Our rollout of SP Surgical System will continue to be measured, putting systems in the hands of experienced da Vinci users while we optimize training pathways and our supply chain.","Globally, our average selling price, which excludes the impact of operating lease revenue and lease buyouts, was approximately $1.57 million compared with $1.45 million last quarter and $1.54 million last quarter.","Similar to the second quarter, our mix of systems and customers in the third quarter was very favorable relative to prior periods. We had a high mix of Xi versus X and Si systems. We also had a low mix of distributor versus direct sales. ","Finally, in the third quarter of 2019, we had fewer multi-system arrangements where we provided volume discounts. ","The mix of systems, customers and the size of arrangements will vary over time. We expect system ASPs to be in a range of the midpoint of the first two quarters of this year. ","Outside of US, results were as follows. OUS procedures grew approximately 23% compared with the third quarter 2018 and increased 1% compared with last quarter.","Third quarter revenue outside of the US of $332 million increased 36% compared with the third quarter of 2018 and increased 6% compared with last quarter. The increase compared with the prior year reflects increased system instruments and accessories revenue of $37 million or a 32% growth and increased systems revenue of $40 million or 50% growth.","The increase in instrument and accessory revenue was primarily driven by procedure growth and customer buying patterns. The increase in systems revenue primarily is the result of increased ASPs, reflecting favorable geographic and product mix.","Outside of the US, we placed 90 systems in the third quarter compared with 75 in the third quarter of 2018 and 80 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 36 into Europe, 27 into Japan and 10 into China. 59% of the systems placed in the quarter were da Vinci Xis and 33% were da Vinci X systems compared with 43% da Vinci Xis and 48% da Vinci Xs last year.","21 of the system placements in the quarter were operating leases compared with 9 last year and 12 last quarter.","Placements outside of the US will continue to vary as some of the OUS markets are in early stages of adoption, some markets are highly seasonal reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns, and sales into some markets are constrained by government limitations.","Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the third quarter was 72% compared with 71.5% for the third quarter of 2018, and 71.3% last quarter. The increase compared with the third quarter of 2018 and last quarter primarily reflects higher system ASPs and product cost reductions.","Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of systems and instrument and accessory revenue, system ASPs and our ability to further reduce product costs and improve manufacturing efficiency.","We expect the return of the medical device tax in 2020, which will reduce our gross margin by approximately 70 basis points to 100 basis points. ","Pro forma operating expenses increased 31% compared with the third quarter of 2018 and increased 7% compared with last quarter. Spending is consistent with our plan and includes an order of magnitude of increase, cost associated with the expansion of our OUS markets, spending on our informatics capabilities, and investment in our infrastructure in order to scale the business.","We believe we have a unique opportunity to expand the benefits of minimally invasive surgery around the world and will continue to invest in the business accordingly.","Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 16.8%, reflecting $8 million of reserve releases primarily associated with the expiration of statutes of limitation in certain jurisdictions.","While we expect our tax rate to be between 19% and 20% in the fourth quarter, our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of US and OUS income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of one-time items.","Our third quarter 2019 pro forma net income was $409 million or $3.43 per share compared with $337 million or $2.83 per share for the third quarter of 2018 and $388 million or $3.25 per share for last quarter.","I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $397 million or $3.33 per share for the third quarter of 2019 compared with GAAP net income of $293 million or $2.45 per share for the third quarter of 2018 and GAAP net income of $318 million or $2.67 per share for last quarter.","The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee equity and IP charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition-related items and legal settlements.","We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $5.4 billion compared with $5.1 billion at June 30, 2019. The cash generated from operations was offset by stock repurchases, acquisition of Sch\u00f6lly Fiberoptic's 3D robotic endoscope business and investments in working capital and infrastructure during the quarter.","We repurchased approximately 141,000 shares for $70 million at an average price of $493 per share.","In the quarter, we grew inventory by approximately $67 million to $580 million, representing approximately 150 days of inventory. We continue to build inventory to address the growth in the business as well as mitigate risks of disruption that could arise from trade, supply or other matters.","In summary, our results for the quarter were solid. While we will provide you with detailed 2020 guidance in January, I want to highlight certain business dynamics that may impact your models.","As I noted earlier, we will continue to invest in the business, growing operating expenses as we see it, the substantial opportunity to expand the benefits of minimally invasive surgery. ","We also believe the percentage of leasing and alternative financing arrangements will increase over time. In addition, we believe the number of trade-in transactions will level off in the short term and then decline over time.","It is also likely we will see increased price negotiations and elongated negotiation timelines as competition get closer to launching new products.","These dynamics could result in profit fluctuations. However, we will continue to manage the business for the long term as we believe that the fundamentals of the business are strong. ","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Calvin who will go over procedure performance and our outlook for 2019. ","Calvin Darling","Thank you, Marshall. Our overall third quarter procedure growth was nearly 20% compared to 20% during the third quarter of 2018 and 17% last quarter.","Our Q3 procedure growth was driven by 18% growth in US procedures and 23% growth in OUS markets. Third quarter 2019 procedure growth benefited from one additional working day compared to last year.","Through the three quarters, working days are now roughly consistent between this year and last. Our Q3 2019 year-to-date procedure growth was 18%, equal to 18% growth through three quarters of last year. ","In the US, Q3 procedure growth was largely driven by continued strength in general surgery, with substantive contributions from gynecologic and urologic procedures.","In US general surgery, third quarter growth in leading procedures, hernia repair and colorectal, remains solid at days adjusted growth rates consistent with last quarter. ","Cholecystectomy growth continued to accelerate in the third quarter and now represents a significant driver of incremental procedures. While we remain cautious regarding the size of the addressable chole market for robotics, our recent data is encouraging. Growth in cholecystectomy represents a healthy mix of new and continuing surgeons, shows very little churn and sees increasing Firefly utilization.","Bariatric procedures, while still not an area of broad emphasis, again accelerated modestly in Q3.","Q3 US gynecology procedure growth was largely consistent with the first half of 2019 and last year, in the mid-single-digit range, with hysterectomy for cancer volumes accelerating modestly in the quarter.","We had surprisingly strong growth in US urology and dVP procedures in the third quarter. dVP growth was just over 10% for the quarter after having moderated to low-single digits in Q2. As a highly penetrated mature procedure category, we believe that our US prostatectomy volume should track to the broader prostate surgery market.","Third quarter OUS procedure volume grew approximately 23% compared with 23% for the third quarter of 2018 and 20% last quarter. Third quarter 2019 OUS procedure growth was driven by continued growth in dVP procedures and earlier stage growth in kidney cancer procedures, general surgery and gynecology.","In China, as in Q2, procedure growth accelerated modestly as new systems installed under the latest system quota began to provide additional capacity for incremental growth. The Q3 China procedure growth rate remained below the overall OUS metric.","In Japan, procedure growth was again strong at roughly 40%, reflecting growth in procedures granted reimbursement status in April 2018 and continued later-stage growth in urology procedures. Our emphasis in Japan remains on surgeon and team training and building proctoring networks.","Overall European procedure growth was largely consistent with prior periods with variation by country. German results were particularly strong, while results in the UK were below our plans.","Now, turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years.","Adoption of Intuitive systems for surgery is fundamentally based upon the clinical utility they provide for surgeons and positive procedure outcomes they enable for patients. We are now in the early stages of introducing the da Vinci SP to the market, and over 50 clinical articles have been published involving the SP thus far.","Last month, some of the first clinical research related to da Vinci SP usage in transoral surgery was published by JAMA Otolaryngology, head and neck surgery section. The research titled A Next-Generation Single-Port Robotic Surgical System for Transoral Robotic Surgery, results from prospective non-randomized clinical trials, was authored by Dr. F. Christopher Holsinger from Stanford, et al.","The objective of the study was to evaluate the da Vinci SP in head and neck surgery prospectively through concurrent non-randomized clinical trials. The study included a total of 47 patients across four institutions, three in the US and one in Hong Kong.","All 47 patients had tumors of the oropharynx and underwent surgery with the da Vinci SP. 40 patients had malignant tumors, while seven were benign. All 47 patients, 8 women and 39 men, with a mean age of 61, safely underwent transoral resection with the da Vinci SP without conversion to open surgery, laser surgery or multi-port robotic surgery. There were no intraoperative complications or device-related serious adverse events. ","Mean estimated intraoperative blood loss per procedure was 15.4 milliliters, with no patients \u2013 no patients received a transfusion.","Within 30 days, 45 of the 47 patients were eating by mouth and without the need for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.","The authors concluded, \"the use of the device appears to be feasible, safe and effective for transoral robotic surgery of oropharyngeal tumors.\"","I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2019, starting with procedures. Last quarter, we forecast 2019 procedure growth of 16% to 17%. We are now increasing our forecast and expect full-year 2019 procedure growth of 17% to 18%.","Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast our 2019 full-year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 70% and 71% of net revenue. We are now slightly increasing our forecast and expect full-year gross profit margin to be between 71% and 71.5% of net revenue.","Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix, and the impact of new product introductions.","Turning to operating expenses. On our last call, we forecast to grow full-year pro forma 2019 operating expenses between 24% and 28% above 2018 levels. We are now retiring the top end of the range and expect our full-year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 24% and 27%.","On our last call, we forecast our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $320 million and $340 million in 2019. We're now refining this estimate to the top half of the range between $330 million and $340 million.","We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $125 million and $130 million in 2019 compared to $130 million to $135 million forecast on our last call.","With regard to income tax, apart from certain non-discrete items impacting Q3, we have a consistent view of our tax rate. We estimate our Q4 pro forma tax rate to be between 19% and 20% of pre-tax income.","That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","David Lewis","Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions for me. Gary, just starting off on procedure acceleration. Even adjusting for selling, there's still a couple hundred basis points, maybe 200 basis points to 300 basis points of momentum acceleration into the third quarter. I wonder if you could talk about some of the drivers there. You talked about the gen surg capacity issues last quarter. Sounds that they've been resolved. But was that the principal driver of the momentum improvement or could just kind of point out other factors that drove this relative momentum acceleration into the third quarter? And then, I'd have a quick follow-up.","Gary Guthart","So, in general, general surgery was positive for us. I would not say that we have resolved all the constraint issues that we had talked about last quarter. We moved in the right direction. So, I think productivity for the US sales force was something we talked about last quarter. I think we took a modest step in the right way. We'll keep working on that. Likewise convenient access to systems. So, general surgery was strong for us, but I think there is more opportunity there over the long term.","We had \u2013 and Calvin had touched on it, we were positively surprised in the urology part of the business, and we're digging in a little bit to figure out where that positive surprises come from. Calvin, I don't know if you want to add to that.","Calvin Darling","No, that's it. You saw us kind of settle in the low-single digits last quarter and just over 10% this quarter, and we are working with our field team and customers to better understand the dynamics behind that.","David Lewis","Okay. Very helpful, and maybe just a quick two-part question on broader CapEx. And, Gary, the gross system placements this quarter, I know trade-ins and retirements looked heavier, but gross system placements in the US looked a little lighter. Is there anything you've seen from a change in the capital environment in the US that you're willing to call out? And then related to that, Marshall, your commentary on next year competitive dynamics, maybe could you share with us what you've seen from some of these new systems that have now been displayed in the US and Europe, any comments you're willing to provide there and how your commercial strategy may change next year as you learn more about these systems? Thanks so much.","Gary Guthart","On the first front, I don't know that we're a perfect read on the CapEx environment more broadly. We do think that procedure growth is, in the US, the dominant driver of additional systems over time. System capability, but also clinical installed base, access. So, I think we saw in this quarter, met our expectations.","I think the second question around spending looking into next year, I'll let Marshall take.","Marshall Mohr","Yeah. So, you were asking specifically about dynamics around potential competitors in my comment about the impacts that might have in terms of elongated negotiations or negotiations with customers. We know that when the competitors' products comes out that that will be an impact. When it comes out or when it will have an impact is less certain. And so, we're just trying to make sure that you understand that as those dynamics occur that you're not surprised.","Calvin Darling","Next question, please.","Operator","And next we turn to line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Good afternoon. And thanks for taking the question. Just maybe one follow-up to Marshall. On the operating margin and the OpEx spending that you talked about for next year, in the past, you've talked about not expecting constant deleveraging over time. But how should we think about margin pressure in 2020 relative to 2019 as you invest for top line growth and you potentially have new competition coming in? And I had one follow-up.","Marshall Mohr","Yeah. I think what you've heard from us and you've heard from others is that there is a substantial opportunity in front of us in terms the minimally invasive market. And so, we think about those opportunities. We think about the technology there necessary to take advantage of those to improve patient outcomes and we think about the global expansion. And so, that's where we're spending our money. We'll give you more precise guidance on what spending we'll do when we get to the January call. So, I'm not going to really comment at this point about magnitude of leverage or deleverage or whatever. But we will continue to spend on expansion.","Lawrence Biegelsen","That's helpful. And then, to stay on the 2020 theme, Calvin, on the guidance, the implied Q4, it's somewhere about 15% at the midpoint for procedure growth. Should we be thinking about more of the high-end here Calvin and maybe if you could talk about the puts and takes for next year. You have some good growth drivers from general surgery and international. Should we be thinking about kind of stability in procedure growth Thanks for taking the questions.","Calvin Darling","Yeah. I think as you look at Q4 and then further out into 2020, the growth drivers, as you say, Larry, are general surgery in the United States as well as growth outside the United States, and I think that's likely to continue to be the drivers. At the high end of the guidance range, I think we're seeing consistency with where we are on a year-to-date basis. But, again, in the third quarter, we saw benefit for some of the mature categories. I think at the lower end, you can contemplate some moderation there.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Thanks, guys.","Operator","And next we turn to the line of Rob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Robert Hopkins","Thanks. And good afternoon. I just wanted to ask a couple of quick questions on the comments you guys made on SP in the prepared remarks. It sounds like the regulatory pathway is moving around a little bit. Gary, is that a function of something specific with your process or is it just a tougher regulatory environment generally with the FDA with these new robotic platforms?","Gary Guthart","Yeah. I think it's probably the latter. As you look at both our products that are moving into new clinical domains and also a little more broadly across the med device industry, it looks like the environment is becoming more data centric or the data requirements are increasing.","Robert Hopkins","And then, also just wondering if you could characterize kind of the demand for SP generally and what your comments imply about kind of next year's growth opportunity in SP. Should we be thinking it's fairly limited until you get colorectal or do you see enough underlying demand that 2020 could see some nice sales of that product?","Gary Guthart","We won't forecast it for you yet on this call. I think, in general, there is an opportunity for the indications that we have and more indications are better. The clinical data that we're seeing and that's building in the database reinforces my support for the product line long-term. And I think there is also a set of indications beyond the colorectal that will be interesting to us. That said, we'll work with regulatory bodies to meet their requirements and that may take some time. That will pace us. So, near term, as we get closer to 2020 and get into it, we'll talk a little more about it.","Robert Hopkins","Thanks so much.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tycho Peterson","Thanks. I want to go back to some of the procedure commentary. The cholecystectomy recovery, can you comment on what you think might be driving that? And then, to your comments on the dVP step up, any early view on what might be behind that? Is that patients dropping out a watchful waiting or is there another dynamic there?","Calvin Darling","Yeah. On the chole side, Tycho, talked about the acceleration being driven by a healthy mix of the new surgeons and existing surgeons, not a lot of churn and increasing Firefly utilization. So, that feels a lot different than, say, our earlier experience with single site set of tools or it was more of a cosmesis-oriented value proposition.","And what's interesting is, while in the past, chole may have been a popular training procedure, and it still can be that, now it's not necessarily the first procedure. It's a lot more often that it's, say, a hernia repair that's the first procedure. And as general surgeons are applying robotics across their practices, chole obviously a big part of what they do.","So, there are reasons for optimism given what we see in the data, but we continue to monitor and analyze the growth trends closely and remain conservative about the overall opportunity.","Gary Guthart","On prostatectomy","Calvin Darling","Yeah, prostatectomy, I think we've pretty much stated on that. We were surprised and we're kind of digging into what the root causes may be.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then, on SP, it sounds like you worked through the endoscope issues in relatively short order. Should we think about any sort of catch-up effect in the fourth quarter in terms of installations? And then, any comments you want to make on the IDE trial, how big you think that might have to be?","Gary Guthart","On the SP endoscope, we have released supply and \u2013 but we still have some work to do and we will work through it really for SP endoscopy at scale. So, we can support the scale we're at today, but as we get bigger and what our long-term plans are, I want to see improvements in that product line. So, we will see \u2013 we're not ready to describe what the outlines of the trial yet are. Indeed, it finalizes in IDE, that will get published in public database and you'll be able to look it up and we'll point you to it.","Tycho Peterson","All right. And then lastly, any comments you can make on ASPs? I think, last quarter, there was a view that they would maybe step down, but, obviously, they didn't. So I'm just curious how we should be thinking about system ASPs going forward?","Marshall Mohr","Yeah. I think it's pretty specific in my remarks actually. For ASPs this quarter, we just saw a really favorable mix just like last quarter in terms of Xis and Xs and Sis. We also saw a really favorable mix in terms of lower distributor and higher direct sales.","As far as what you should expect going forward, I think what I said was for the remainder of this year. You should look at ASPs more similar to the mix between Q1 and Q2. And that's where we see it coming out, and that will reflect a higher mix of distribution sales in Q4, which is typical if you go back and look in our history.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And next we turn to the line of J.P. McKim with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Jonathan McKim","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to touch on just the uplift in instrument ASPs. Can you talk about maybe, A, the sustainability there and just what's really driving? Is it more advanced procedures or just more advanced instruments with the staplers and vessel sealers?","Calvin Darling","Yeah. Hi, J.P. It's Calvin. Yeah, we saw this \u2013 in this quarter, revenue per procedure was approximately $1,980 and that's the highest we've seen in quite some time. Marshall mentioned in his comments that we did see a benefit relative to the last quarter just due to timing of orders, but, obviously, higher usage of the advanced stapling and vessel sealings also contributed to the growth.","Going forward, clearly, the favorable timing of the orders should offset, but there is a number of factors that are going to kind of impact the trend going in different directions, including the anticipated continued growth in the advanced instrument usage, offset by an increasing proportion of lower complexity cases like cholecystectomy that we've talked about. So, I&A revenue per procedure is going to have variability quarter to quarter and I don't have a long-term direction to give you.","Jonathan McKim","Okay, that's helpful. And then, maybe just on \u2013 you've got the chest conference coming up this weekend. Maybe what can we or should we expect from you guys in terms of Ion, any single site data? And then, maybe what investors should be looking for in terms of the right way to sort of compare systems or what really is going to drive adoption and surgeon interest?","Calvin Darling","So, the conference, I think what you're going to see is a lot of what we've talked about on this call. We're going to talk about just qualitatively, I think, some of the early experiences in the field. We'll be doing a lot of test drives and talking about the system and its capabilities. I don't think \u2013 there is no new data that I think is going to be groundbreaking at the event.","Gary Guthart","In general, I think you'll see, from both sides, relatively early data. I think the larger market in Ion and robotic-assisted bronchoscopy will be data oriented in broader settings, looking at safety and efficacy. And as that develops, I think we're feeling pretty good. There have been systems in the market in the past, as you know, and I think a fair number of accounts, we'll wait to see what the data says. So, there is the future benefit kind of conversations that happen in the early market. I think a lot of the market will wait to see what that expresses like in clinical use.","Jonathan McKim","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.","Richard Newitter","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Wanted to just follow up on chole. So, I know that \u2013 I believe chole is a faster procedure relative to some of the more complex areas where the robot gets used. So, I'm just curious the extent to which you think just acceleration, kind of staying power, could that help alleviate some of the capacity and training issues that you've outlined in the past with respect to the mix of the types of procedures getting done?","Gary Guthart","I think it can change, certainly, the utilization rate for systems in the field. It can still create access challenges as different people vie for time. But as you just described, if they are faster through it. ","With regard to training, I think that high volume procedures allow surgeons to move through their early experiences more quickly, and that has a generally positive net effect.","Richard Newitter","Great. And I was hoping \u2013 thanks for the color on the China procedure growth metrics relative to the overall OUS. I was just curious, as you have more systems getting placed each quarter, how many quarters you think it might take to get \u2013 approaching the international average? And I think it would be helpful just to know where was the growth rate trending in the last two quarters. Thanks. Relative to this quarter.","Gary Guthart","Right. So, the overall OUS growth rate is roughly 23%. And in the last two quarters, we've seen some modest acceleration. We're probably approaching that right now. So, a successful scenario in the next quarter or two, we may crossover.","Richard Newitter","Thank you.","Operator","And next we turn to the line of Imron Zafar with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Imron Zafar","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Gary, you highlighted in your prepared remarks the stapling franchise. Can you talk a little bit more about, I guess, the 60 millimeter in particular and the impact you're seeing in terms of specific procedures, where you're seeing the uptake? Is it colorectal versus gastric sleeve? And then also, how much cannibalization are you seeing of the 45 millimeter in cases like bowel resection, et cetera?","Gary Guthart","60s mostly used in the lower abdomen. So, you definitely have stomach and in colorectal. There is modest exchange for the 45s where a 60 will do, [indiscernible]. But in general, I think that mix and surgeon selection in that space is pretty well understood from prior experience with laparoscopy. And we're not overly stressed about it.","Imron Zafar","Okay. And then, in Japan, I know last quarter you talked about some sequential slow down, but the metrics you gave today, the 40% plus procedure growth and healthy placements, I think 27, can you just talk about the contributors to procedure growth there? Is it still urology, non-dVP urology or general surgery mostly? And then, are you expecting more procedure reimbursement approvals in April 2020?","Calvin Darling","Yeah. So, as I mentioned on the call, a move back to 40% where we had been prior to last quarter. Last quarter, I think we largely felt the effect of a number of holidays or a fewer workdays in the quarter than this quarter where that recovered. So, that was the main thing. We're seeing increasing numbers of the 12 procedures that were granted reimbursement status in April of 2018, as well as continuing to see adoption of the urology procedures.","Gary Guthart","We don't think that the \u2013 of the 12 that were adopted, equal rate. And we'll see some start to break out from the pack, whether it's in colorectal or thoracic relative to some of the others. With regard to reimbursement opportunities going forward, it's something we track and we discuss with surgical societies for their support as needed. We'll see nothing to communicate with you at this time.","Imron Zafar","Thank you very much.","Operator","Next we turn to line of Craig Bijou with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Craig Bijou","Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. Gary, on SP, I think you mentioned that you might be looking at other indications. So, I guess, I just wanted to get a sense for. Given the IDE that will be required for colorectal, could we see another indication come in before seeing colorectal?","Gary Guthart","I can give you no reason to be optimistic for that.","Craig Bijou","Okay, fair enough. And then, Marshall, just your comments on the med device tax. I just wanted to \u2013 you said that you expected to come in \u2013 and I just wanted to get \u2013 is that just you being conservative or assuming that it will come in 2020 or is there anything else behind that comment?","Marshall Mohr","At this point, that is what is supposed to happen. I know there is lobbying efforts to try to change that. So, we're just telling you the way it is.","Craig Bijou","Also fair enough. Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Gary Guthart","Thank you.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Jason Mills","Hi. Thank you for taking the question. Wanted to follow up, Calvin, on the revenue per procedure. You've given us that data fairly consistently. So, [indiscernible] things would have to change quite significantly across several different procedures for that trend line to change over, let's say, the next three years. So, it's been on a nice, fairly decent upward slope. What would you say, I guess, over the longer term with respect to that trend line, given you have so much data, but it is a dynamic business? It would seem like it could continue to trend upward with some volatility quarter to quarter, but upward over a longer period of time. Maybe tell me what I'm missing, if that's incorrect","Calvin Darling","It has been increasing in low-single digits the last couple of years, anyway. I tried to mention that we do expect to see a continued contribution from the advanced instruments as a tailwind to the metric, but that's being offset by a number of factors. I mentioned increasing proportion of lower complexity cases. And fact is people are just becoming all the more efficient as time goes on as well, wasting less, doing less with more, and we help them to do that with some of the analytics we provide. So, those are the offsets. And so, you have the gives and the takes. So, at this point. I'm not ready to say whether the trend is going to continue up or be flat or trend down.","Jason Mills","Okay, fair enough. And, obviously, the big reveal, one of the competitors recently, the number that they continue to harp on was 2% robotic surgery relative to procedures done, whether it be general laparoscopic. I was wondering if you could, perhaps Gary, comment on that number from your perspective. Obviously, much more broad. If you could comment on that number or just give any general commentary as it relates to robotic surgery penetration. I know you talk qualitatively about it being early innings, but just specifically that quantitative figure, I'd like your thoughts. And then, specific to Japan as it relates to the penetration of robotic surgery, it would seem to be lower than that. I'd like your commentary with respect to that geography specifically, if you don't mind. Thank you.","Gary Guthart","Let's zoom out for a second and then we can zoom back in. I think the opportunity for computer-aided and robotically assisted surgery and acute intervention more broadly is clearly substantial and clearly durable. And that's going to draw in new entrants, which it's doing. I think those new entrants will help accelerate broader adoption more generally and customers will appreciate that choice. And I think they will look at that.","Our strategy over this period has really been, understand our customers deeply and understand the quadruple aim. It's really hard to do the total accounting of what the total available market will be. ","And what I'd ask you to look at is over time. What does it look like in the next couple of years? What does it look like in the next four? What does it look like in the next 10? I think some of our competitors as they speak about these opportunities are looking out pretty far. And, okay, that's a forecast. Hard to have an exact crystal ball. But, clearly, even speaking with our most candid critics, the idea that computer aids and robotics are going to make an impact more broadly in surgery is pretty well accepted. So, I think we're early innings.","Japan, I think likewise. A little bit different healthcare system. The single payer system that runs through MHLW or the predominantly single-payer system means that their requirements and negotiations using data with the government early are much more important and getting those right opened the market over time, and that's what we've been working on. So, clearly, that's an early set of opportunities for us as well.","Our methodology, when we think about total available market, is to be conservative in the early days, show that we can bring real value and then revise as we see greater depth. Other companies take a different statistical approach to that.","Jason Mills","Thank you so much.","Operator","And next we turn to the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Vijay Kumar","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just tacking on that last question, Gary. If just look at the medium-term outlook, right, just given where we are in the CapEx cycle, given the amount of product cycles that you guys have on a number of different platforms, where \u2013 I know, historically, you looked at utilization rates as being \u2013 on the system utilization rates \u2013 the growth in system utilization as being a leading indicator for systems. Is this now \u2013 given the acceleration we're seeing in procedures, is that a leading indicator for our systems? Like, you just give us a sense for what drives that systems next year because, obviously, you have competition. I'm just curious, given why we're seeing base procedures accelerating, is that an indicator for how we should be modeling systems?","Gary Guthart","I'll just draw a broader picture and I'll let Calvin speak to a little bit of the modeling. In the broader sense, we know that in a mature market that has experience with robotic surgery that procedure demand will drive the underlying system demand, and there's two ways that they go about it. One is capacity and they can get additional capacity by more efficient utilization of their systems. We have designed our systems with that in mind. We work closely with them and in various arrangements to help them get improved efficiency. They don't have to buy an X system if they don't want to.","The other thing is feature content. Does the product have the feature content that's required to do the procedures they want to do? And so, we work with them on those things.","Clearly, competitors will enter the market and make claims. And I guess what I would say for both customers and for shareholders, due diligence is really important. It's really easy to make claims on trade show floors and it's pretty hard to back them up in real life. And our experience in the world has been that there is a lot of noise in the beginning as those claims are made and then it takes a couple or three years in the actual clinical market and clinical use to see what the broad market thinks about that.","That will have an impact for us in the next few years. I don't know if it's next year or the year after, and I think that's what Marshall's commentary was. Signaling is that customers will evaluate and will take their time and that may change capital acquisition cycle timelines or otherwise and they change the nature of negotiations for us. But we're planning and thinking for the long term and we're focused on enablement of the quadruple aim and we'll be here for our customers as we go through that.","Calvin, anything you want to help with our modeling?","Calvin Darling","No, clearly, procedures are the catalyst for driving the demand for systems. When we look at our models, we would expect to see a continuation of the trend of increasing utilization over time.","Gary Guthart","Vijay, if you have a short follow-up, this is your chance. One last one.","Vijay Kumar","One quick follow-up, Gary. Headcount is up 30%, up from 5,000 to \u2013 we've crossed 7,000. That's an impressive, phenomenal number. I'm just curious now where that is going. Thank you.","Gary Guthart","Yeah. We try to balance our growth and our investments by both the opportunity and we think the opportunity is enormous and durable. And then, we balance it by what we think we can achieve and do well. And that really is what caps our growth in our spend. Absorbing, training, selecting, developing staff during rapid growth is really the challenge and that's what we are focused on.","As we get into 2020, 2021 and we'll share with you in future quarters what our plans are, but we try to balance those two things, being agile and pursuing the opportunity; at the same time, making sure we're not over extended and losing our ability to execute and be efficient.","So, thank you, that was our last question.","Gary Guthart","In closing, we believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute intervention. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim \u2013 better, more predictable patient outcomes; better experiences for patients; better experiences for their care teams; and ultimately a lower total cost of treatment.","We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human that flows from respect for, and understanding of, patients and care teams, their needs and their environment.","Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery. We look forward to talking with you again in three months.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

[Operator Instructions] And also as a reminder, today\u2019s teleconference is being recorded.","And at this time, I will turn the conference call over to your host, Senior Director of Finance, Investor Relations for Intuitive Surgical, Mr. Calvin Darling. Please go ahead sir","Calvin Darling","Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's third quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer and Patrick Clingan, Senior Director of Finance and sales operations.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties.","These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 5th, 2015, and 10-Q, filed on July 22nd, 2015. These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's EDGAR database.","Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com, on the audio archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website.","Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our third-quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights; Marshall will provide a review of our third-quarter financial results; Patrick will discuss marketing and clinical highlights and I will provide our updated financial outlook for 2015. And finally we will host a question-and-answer session.","With that, I will turn it over to Gary.","Gary Guthart","Thank you for joining us on the call today. Overall, company performance in the quarter was solid with robust procedure growth, solid capital performance and improved operating margins.","Starting with procedures, year-over-year growth in the third quarter accelerated to 15% compared with Q3 2014. Procedure performance mirrored our experience in the first half of the year with strength in hernia repair, colon and rectal resections, solid growth in prostatectomy, and stable trends in hysterectomy.","Internationally growth trends in the first half of the year continued in the third quarter. Growth in Europe, China and Korea was multi-disciplinary with particular strength in neurology. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call.","Turning to capital sales, we placed 117 systems in the quarter compared to 111 in the third quarter of 2014. Capital placements in The United States accounted for most of the growth in system placements year-over-year. Customers are preferring our most capable products and Xi systems and dual console configurations represented a larger proportion of placements in the quarter relative to a year ago. In Japan, procedure growth was solid and driven by growth in neurology. As we\u2019ve said on prior calls, the growth of the market in Japan will be paced by continued progress on reimbursement. ","Clinical investigators are submitting their partial nephrectomy data to MHLW for review, and ISI continues to work with key stakeholders in the reimbursement for additional procedures. While we have no assurance of additional procedure reimbursement at this time Japanese authorities will review reimbursement submission for partial nephrectomy for inclusion in 2016 national coverage. Conversations regarding reimbursement for other procedures are ongoing, however inclusion of other procedures and full reimbursement guidelines in 2016 are unlikely.","Turning to operating performance, our product operations teams have been focused on reducing cost for our new products and we have been managing our fixed expenses carefully. This quarter was another step in the right direction on gross margin, helped by product mix and some costs coming in at the lower end of their expected ranges. We will continue to focus on improvements in direct product cost over the next several quarters. As we look at long term financial position of our products we anticipate making targeted capital investments over the next few quarter and programs that we believe will facilitate better long term product and operating margins. Marshall will take you through this and other financial performance in greater detail later in the call.","In summary, our operating performance for the third quarter is as follows. Procedures grew approximately 15% over the third quarter of last year. We placed 117 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 111 in the third quarter of 2014.","Total pro forma revenue for the quarter was $590 million, up 10% from the prior year, and up 14% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Total pro forma instrument and accessory revenue increased to $298 million, up 10% over prior year.","We generated pro forma operating profit of $240 million in the quarter compared with $197 million in the third quarter of last year. And pro forma net income was $199 million compared to $145 million in Q3 of 2014.","We are deeply committed to advancing our technologies and offerings to benefit surgeons, their patients and hospitals. We have launched integrated table motion for Xi in Europe this October and have submitted our U.S. 510(k) application. Table motion allow surgeons to interactively use gravity for retraction and eases patient management during da Vinci Xi surgical cases.","As many of you saw at the American College of Surgeons meeting earlier this month, initial customer feedback has been strong. We also submitted our 510(k) for our single site instrument kit for Xi in the third quarter with the intent of bringing our single-incision tools to the Xi platform. In addition, we submitted a 510(k) application for a 30 millimetre stapler for Xi in the third quarter. This instrument has particular utility in thoracic surgery and includes a multi staple sizes including green, blue, white and grey reloads.","Regarding our next generation single-port technology, our technical teams continue to meet their development milestones for da Vinci Sp, having completed the build of our first 10 Xi compatible systems, five of which were slated for human clinical use.","We anticipate increased clinical evaluations of da Vinci Sp in 2016 particularly in transoral and transabdominal applications. Lastly, da Vinci systems are sophisticated network computing systems. The availability of these computational resources allows for both real time analytics that can provide surgeons relevant information for example the smart plant feature implemented in our stapler as well as anonymized utilization data that administration can use to help optimize robotic surgery programs.","We are developing increased computational capability in both real time and program level applications along with the field force of work flow experts; this analytic capability allows us to aid our customers both during surgery and in optimizing their robotic surgery programs.","As we\u2019ve discussed on prior calls for 2015 we remain focused on expanding the application of da Vinci and general surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair filling out our product line for da Vinci Xi and launching in key markets globally, developing our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia, advancing our technologies to improve surgery and lowering our direct product cost.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marshall who will review our financial performance.","Marshall Mohr","Thank you, Gary. I will be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes the impact of our prior year Xi trade-in programs, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased IP, and investment impairments. We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis.","I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We've posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion.","Pro forma third quarter revenue was $590 million, an increase of 10% compared with $534 million for the third quarter of 2014, and an increase of 1% compared with last quarter.","Pro forma revenue for the third quarter of 2014 excludes net revenue associated with the offers made in 2014 to trade out Si product for Xi product. All trade out offers were either fulfilled or lapsed in 2014.","Third quarter 2015 procedures of approximately 162,000 grew approximately 15% compared with the third quarter of 2014 and were approximately equal to the second quarter of 2015.","Revenue highlights are as follows. Pro forma instrument, and accessory revenue grew 10% compared with the third quarter of 2014 and was approximately equal to the second quarter of 2015.","The increase relative to the prior year reflects procedure growth, partially offset by foreign exchange and customer buying patterns. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including stocking orders was approximately $1,840 per procedure. This metric has now been trending in a tight range between $1,830 and $1,840 per procedure over the past four quarters with recent quarters reflecting higher sales of new instruments and the impact of foreign exchange.","Pro forma system revenue of $174 million increased 13% compared with last year and decreased 1% compared with last quarter. The increase relative to the prior year reflects increased unit sales, and higher average system selling prices. The decrease relative to the second quarter reflects a higher number of operating leases partially offset by higher average systems sales prices. ","117 systems were placed in the third quarter compared with 111 systems in the third quarter of 2014 and 118 systems last quarter. 77% of the systems placed this quarter were Xis compared with 53% in the third quarter of 2014, and 64% in the second quarter of 2015.","We expect the mix of Xi to Si product to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. Globally, our average systems price of $1.6 million increased compared with $1.45 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $1.5 million last quarter. Our third quarter 2015 ASP was our highest to date, reflecting an unusually high mix of dual consoles, including a high number of shipments to academic centers.","We shipped 29 dual console Xis in the third quarter of 2015 compared with 13 last year and 18 last quarter. We expect to return to our historical mix of dual consoles and therefore expect our future ASP to be lower than this quarter. ASPs fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on geographic and product mix trade-in volume and changes in foreign exchange rates.","Hospitals financed approximately 25% of the systems placed in the third quarter, up from 21% last quarter. We directly financed 20 systems; including placing the most operating leases 13 since we began our direct leasing program in the second quarter of 2014. As of the end of the quarter there were 36 systems out in the field under operating leases. Revenue from operating leases was less than 2 million in the third quarter. We expect the impacts of operating leases from our system if we exclude the impacts of operating leases from our system ASP calculations. The number of systems placed under operating leases will vary quarter-to-quarter.","Service revenue of $170 million increased 8% year-over-year and increased approximately 4% compared with the second quarter of 2015. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect the increase in our installed base of da Vinci systems.","Outside of the U.S., results were as follows; third quarter pro forma revenue outside of the U.S. of $151 million decreased 1% compared with $153 million for the third quarter of 2014, and decreased 10% compared with $168 million last quarter.","The decrease compared with the previous year reflects lower system sales into China and the impact of foreign exchange partially offset by higher recurring revenue driven by approximately 28% higher procedure volume. The decrease compared with the last quarter was driven by lower system unit sales and timing of customer instrument and accessory sales.","Outside the U.S., we placed 37 systems in the third quarter compared with 50 in the third quarter of 2014 and 46 systems last quarter o-US system placements included 9 systems into Japan compared with seven last year and 13 last quarters. 19 systems in Europe compared with 25 last year and 22 last quarter and no systems into China this quarter compared with 10 last year and none last quarter. System placements will continue to fluctuate quarter to quarter.","Moving on to the remainder of the P&L, the pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2015 was 69.3% compared with 67.2% for the third quarter of 2014 and 68% for the second quarter of 2015.","Compared with both the second quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2014 the higher third quarter of 2015 gross margin reflects higher systems ASPs, improved efficiencies, lower inventory charges among other factors. The increase in gross margins relative to the third quarter of 2014 also reflects charges to cost and sales related to the Si staple recall in 2014.","In 2014, we recorded pre tax charges of approximately $82 million, representing the estimated cost of settling a number of product liability legal claims under a tolling agreement.","During 2015, we have refined our estimate of the overall cost of settling claims and recorded additional charges of approximately $14 million in the first half of the year. There were no charges in the third quarter of 2015. Charges made related to this agreement are excluded from our pro forma results and are included in our GAAP results.","At the end of the third quarter, $30 million remained accrued on our balance sheet as a significant portion of the estimated cost have been paid.","Pro forma operating cost, which excludes the reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expense, and the amortization of purchased IP, increased 4% compared with the third quarter of 2014 and were less 1% less than last quarter. The year-over-year increase in pro forma operating expenses primarily reflects headcount additions and higher incentive compensation.","Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 18.4% compared with an effective tax rate of 27.2% for the third quarter of 2014 and 25.6% last quarter. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2015 included tax benefits of $29 million, or $0.77 per share related to a recent favorable tax court ruling involving an independent third party.","Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of o-US and U.S. income, and will not reflect a federal research and development credit, unless such credit is reinstated.","Our third quarter 2015 pro forma income was $199 million or $5.24 per share compared with $145 million or $3.92 per share for the third quarter of 2014 and $173 million or $4.57 per share for the second quarter of 2015.","Excluding the prior period tax benefits our third quarter 2015 pro forma net income was $170 million or $4.47 per share.","As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $590 million for the third quarter of 2015 compared with $550 million for the third quarter of 2014 and $586 million for the second quarter of 2015.","GAAP net income was $167 million or $4.40 per share for the third quarter of 2015, compared with $124 million or $3.35 per share for the third quarter of 2014 and $135 million or $3.56 per share for the second quarter of 2015.","We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $3.1 billion, up from $2.9 billion as of June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by stock buybacks.","During the quarter we repurchased approximately 70,000 shares for $36 million and average purchase price of $509 per share. This brings our total stock repurchases to approximately $100 million for the year.","And with that, I would like to turn it over to Patrick who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights.","Patrick Clingan","Thanks Marshall. As mentioned earlier, total third quarter year-over-year procedures grew approximately 15% with U.S. procedures growing approximately 12% and international procedures growing approximately 28%.","In the U.S. third quarter procedure growth were approximately 12% accelerated modestly from first half growth of approximately 10% driven by an uptick in the growth of general surgery procedures with solid contribution coming from mature procedures despite already high levels of market penetration, remains uncertain how sustainable, the year to-date growth in these mature procedures will be in future periods.","In urology trends observed during the first half of the year continued through the third quarter. Growth in da Vinci prostatectomy and kidney cancer procedures continued at similar rate as the first half of 2015 with da Vinci prostatectomy again exceeding our expectation. We continue to believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market.","In gynecology, third quarter procedures grew modestly year-over-year with growth in malignant and complex hysterectomy partially offset by declines in benign procedures. Similar to the first half of the year, increased proportion of total hysterectomy procedures have been performed by gynecologic oncologists.","Third quarter growth in general surgery increased compared to the first half of the year with robust growth in hernia repair and an uptick in colorectal procedures, being partially offset by continued declines in cholecystectomies. Hernia repair continued to drive the majority of growth in general surgery procedures during the quarter.","Earlier this month at the American College of Surgeons meeting several presentations highlighted the emerging role of da Vinci surgery in ventral and inguinal hernia repair. Surgeons commented on the advantages of da Vinci surgery which include precise dissection, improved visualization, secure closure of the primary defect, application casing of the abdominal wall, suture fixation of mesh and a reduction in postoperative pain for patients.","Specific ventral hernia repair Doctor Ballacer from the Banner Health Network compared 180 da Vinci hernia repairs to over 60,000 lap and open hernia repairs from the ACS National Surgery Quality Improvement Program database and found that reduction in hospital length of stay and complication saved approximately $550 per case compared laparoscopy and over $700 per case compared to open surgery.","We are encouraged by these early clinical and economic validations around the use of da Vinci surgery in hernia repair. Regarding our Single-Site cholecystectomy business as we've stated over the past four quarters, our total cholecystectomy procedures decline through the rate -- though the rate of decline moderated in the third quarter.","As growth in multiport cholecystectomies offset much of the decline in Single-Site cholecystectomy, as our belief that customer are finding added value in a more complex patient population, therefore gravitating to the traditional da Vinci multiport approach. Firefly technology was used in approximately 40% of da Vinci cholecystectomies in the quarter.","Looking abroad during the third quarter, the approximate 28% international procedure growth was led by global adoption of da Vinic prostatectomy, with solid contributions from kidney procedures, malignant hysterectomies, colorectal resections.","Procedure growth in Europe remains steady through the first nine months of the year, while the acceleration in procedure growth in Asia that began during the first half of the year continued into the third quarter.","During the quarter the global evidence supporting the cost effectiveness of da Vinic prostatectomy in international markets continue to build. Our recent economic analysis from the Peter Maccullum Cancer Centre in Australia published in BJU International reviewed nearly 6,000 Prostatectomies from the Victorian Admitted Episode Dataset.","Their analysis found da Vinci Prostatectomy to be cost equivalent open Prostatectomy where 140 da Vinic procedures per year were performed on the system well below the global third quarter annualized average of approximately 190 procedures per system.","During the study period from 2010 to 2013, the rate of open Prostatectomies decline from approximately 73% to 47% among publish hospital in Victoria due to an increase in the adoption of da Vinci Prostatectomy.","This concludes my remarks and I thank you for your time. I will now turn the call over to Calvin.","Calvin Darling","Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2015. Starting with procedures, on our last call we estimated full year 2015 procedure growth between 11% and 13% above the approximately 570,000 procedures performed in 2014.","We are now increasing our procedure estimate for 2015. We now anticipate full year 2015 procedure growth of between 13% and 14%.","Turning to gross profit, our outlook for gross profit margin has again modestly improved compared to last quarter. We expect our fourth quarter 2015 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of 67.5% to 68.5 % of revenue.","Note that this range is a bit lower than our third quarter gross margin as Q3 benefited from favorable product mix and other factors which we expect to return to more typical patterns in Q4. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product and regional mix, system's production volume and foreign exchange rates.","Turning to operating expenses, consistent with our last call, we continue to expect to grow pro forma 2015 operating expenses towards the lower end of a range of between 7% and 10% above 2014 levels.","Also consistent with our last call we expect our 2015 non-cash stock compensation expense to come in towards the lower end of 170 million to 180 million range, roughly flat compared to 169 million in 2014. We continue to expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $16 million and $18 million in 2015.","With regard to income tax, for Q4 we expect our pro forma income tax rate to be between 28% and 30% of pre-tax income consistent with our previous estimate. This forecast does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2015.","That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Ben Andrew","Good afternoon, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. I guess two things for us. If you look at the legacy U.S. procedures, Gary, we talked in August about some of the hospital systems looking more carefully at cost benefit analysis. Do you think that's supporting the complex dVH and dVP and are you getting more evidence that that's the case?","Gary Guthart","Yes. We've seen, I can speak to anecdotes. Anecdotally, the dVPs and some of the more complex procedures we've seen have been well supported by analysis done at the IDN level. They are getting more sophisticated in those analyses and I think they are getting more confident in them.","Ben Andrew","Okay. And then, as far as the kind of international procedure growth, that was an exceptional acceleration. How durable is that as we look at 2016 with Europe kind of steady growth, U.S. obviously a little bit above plan, but that Asian piece, it really sort of sticks out?","Gary Guthart","Yes. It depends on the country. So, if you go country by country in Asia I think Korea has been building nicely. I don't see radical changes one way or the other. Japan we've talked about, I think that there's a lot of interest and a lot of organic activity, but major penetration is going to require reimbursement. China, we saw a lot of acceleration. And the pacing there will be in part driven by capital placements and as you know well, there's a quota system in China, so there are some systems remaining on the quota that can be placed. There's a point at which you need a new quota to keep going. So we can get some growth in the existing installed base, although to really accelerate quickly you need additional systems and that something that Calvin can take you through little later in the Q&A.","Ben Andrew","Sure. And just last thing is the China zero last quarter, zero this quarter, anything to read there as it kind of a bolus effect in the year end? And obviously the quota being the quota, but how do we think about that from a consistency perspective over time? Thanks.","Marshall Mohr","Yes. This is Marshall. There's a process behind it. The quota was provided year and a half ago, two years ago. There are 18 systems that remained on the quota, but there's a tender process that each of the hospitals have to undertake and the tender process is unpredictable in terms of when it will complete. It turns out that they've been completing in boluses, as you suggested. But the fact that none were completed in the last \u2013 no systems were shipped in the last two quarters, I don't necessarily believe is indicative of whether we'll ship more or less in the next couple of quarters. So, we'll see how the tenders play out and we'll see what we wind up with.","Ben Andrew","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Roman","Thank you and good afternoon everybody. I wanted just to start with the overall procedure volume environment, and understandably some of your comments, Patrick regarding the sustainability of some of the mature procedures may make sense. But if I look at the overall procedure volumes in the quarter, they were flat sequentially. I can't remember when in the third quarter you did not see a sequential decline, whether that was related to seasonality or some of the other factors that were influencing your business. So could you maybe just talk about what's going on in the overall environment and whether what we are seeing now is the impact of sun-setting some of the concerns that surfaced to couple of years ago, and maybe what maybe materialized in the third quarter that might have made for the outsized performance?","Gary Guthart","I'll speak to a couple of things, and Patrick, you can jump in. At the dVP level in the U.S. we really think that's the flow back into treatment of some folks who had set out in watchful waiting and then had disease progression. How long that persist is a little bit hard to predict based on some of the changes in PSA diagnostics. On the hysterectomy market we're seeing rotation of patients away from some of the lower volume surgeons in general and into higher volume and dedicated surgeons, so, GYN oncologists. That appears to be particular durable. I think that that trend makes sense and I think the activity is likely to continue. We're a large part of the dVH market and so I think the macro trend will go as the macro dVH market grows in the United States.","Patrick Clingan","The one thing to bear in mind is that for the past handful of years the number of benign hysterectomy in total has been declining, and so that will continue to counter balance the hysterectomy market.","Gary Guthart","On the upside I think we're in the beginnings of our experience in a lot of our markets. In Europe we're still in the meaty part of adoption, in many of the countries that were in. We're really excited about what can happen in Asia and the various markets that we talked about. And general surgery I think we're more at the beginning of some of the adoption that we see in colon, rectal, and hernia. So I think as you think about the future it\u2019s a little bit of the puts and takes there of how fast do mature markets moderate and how quickly do our emerging markets grow.","David Roman","Okay. That's helpful. And then I just want to make sure I understand what you're saying explicitly about Japan for next year, obviously you have the dVP reimbursing. You talked about the society submitting on partial nephrectomy. What are the next steps in gaining additional reimbursement in Japan and how will we \u2013 how will that be disseminated?","Gary Guthart","Yes. There are multiple conversations from multiple stakeholders in Japan. Surgical societies play a role as well as government societies, in deciding what data is required and kind of in what sequence they want to address those different procedures, so from thoracic surgery to general surgery, things in the colon and others are - and gynecology, are of interest to Japanese surgeons and are in active discussion.","To get into the national reimbursement, there are a couple of different pathways, wherein one of them called Senshin Iryo B for the process that we're in for partial nephrectomy. The government has asked to see that data and is going to review it. So we're not guaranteed what and when, but it\u2019s part of the formal process. Other ones are not yet in that formal process. The government can choose to send it down a different reimbursement process. If that happens and we have some assurance that that is likely then we'll report that out to you.","So, I think in terms of the near term and national coverage partial nephrectomy is the one to keep your eye on. I am not generally upset about progress. I think that there is a fair amount of interest. I think the conversations are active and it just continuing to push forward.","David Roman","And then maybe lastly Gary, as you kind of reflect on the business and look at the progress that you've made over the past call it, 18 months, you kind of put all the moving parts together with macro and one thing you\u2019re designated as the \u201cunintended consequence\u201d of the Affordable Care Act or economic pressures in Europe or the state of your business. How would you just compare your view of the forward outlook today versus how you might have felt a year ago and your level of confidence?","Gary Guthart","I think that we're seeing a lot of validation for our products in the hands of our customers. I am pleased with the response from general surgeons, the level of engagement they have with the company, the interest and satisfaction they have with the products and their interest in demand for new and different things that I think we can provide.","In European markets we've been investing in both capability of our own organization and getting closer to those customers. Again, I think customer demand is really strong and that looks -- that bodes really well for us. I think we can do better in terms of some of our own team and processes and we're working on it. I think that the company is growing and is focused on those efforts and I expect to see greater capability in the next several quarters.","David Roman","Okay. Thank you for all the detail.","Gary Guthart","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in queue will come from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Robert Hopkins","Hi. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a really good quarter. Two things, first I just wanted to start out for Marshall on the OpEx growth in the quarter. It was one thing that kind of surprised us. It looks like the operating expense growth in Q3 was a lot lower than we would have thought. So I was just wondering if you could kind of highlight that and it sounds like things will kind of pick back up in Q4. But is 7% to 8% still the right way to think about OpEx growth longer term and just again what happened in Q3 with the lower growth in OpEx?","Marshall Mohr","Well, certainly for rest of this year, Calvin given you guidance in the lower end of the 7% to 110% range and more like to 7%, but I think that we're focused on controlling cost and watching it carefully. There are some costs that kind of happen \u2013 when they happened and that includes a prototypes in the engineering group and some of those didn't happened this quarter and will happen next quarter and so that's why you get some of the fluctuation between quarters, but overall I think we're managing to the bottom line.","Robert Hopkins","Okay. And then just back on, Gary, back on Japan. I just want to be clear on the message there, because on the Q2 call you talked about partial nephrectomy, but then also four additional procedures. And it sounds like you're not as optimistic on those four additional procedures. So, I was wondering if you give some color on what's happened there and kind of we look to Japan as a source of real incremental procedure volume growth in 2016 or is that not the case given what you're articulating here?","Gary Guthart","Yes. I think in terms of partial nephrectomy, that's moving forward with a formal process into review for the national coverage. The conversations and the work being done on other procedures is on going, but its not yet at that level of rigor for the 2016 review and as a result I don't think its likely that they will be included in the 2016 book.","We're not ready yet to give you the 2016 procedure guidance and we're working through that and rolling that up and that something we'll talk about in general in the next call. And you can anticipate that additional reimbursements accelerate in Japan and lack of it will put more pressure on procedures and they'll be part of the conversation as we go through our forecasting.","Robert Hopkins","And then any quick update on Sp in terms of timing, I heard the comments you may have a call here, but just what is the year where you think you could start to generate revenues from Sp?","Gary Guthart","Yes. We're making good progress in terms of our technology and customer valuations of the product in lab are encouraging, quite exciting. In terms of when we expect real revenue? We're not ready to tell you exactly where the revenue launch will be. We're definitely looking forward to human clinical interactions in 2016 and we'll color that up more as we go forward in future calls.","Robert Hopkins","Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Rick Wise","Thank you. Good afternoon everybody. Let me start with hernia. Gary, anecdotally talking to general surgeons about Xi adoption, it sounds like a lot of the folks we have talked to start with a ventral procedure because of the suturing benefits and then seem to move quickly to inguinal as they get comfortable. Are you seeing that kind of progression, maybe to what extent, and is this process what's driving the solid hernia adoption?","Gary Guthart","We see different pathways actually, as you know as you talk to different general surgeons, I wouldn't characterize the one that you've described as the most common or the only path that folks take. It's certainly a path. No doubt that's ventral hernia is something that benefits from precise control, great visualization suturing, the ability to close the primary defect directly with suture as well as supporting [Indiscernible]. So there are some advantages there.","As general surgeons get comfortable then they start to explore other things that they can do with the tool and sometimes it goes ventral, then inguinal, sometime the reverse and from there it can take them into more complex cases or cases where there is an acute called cholecystectomy that they might want to try. So there are different pathways that can happen. I wouldn't characterize one as the only.","Rick Wise","Okay. And coming back to procedures one more time, I feel like I have to ask. If I am looking at the numbers correctly, procedures, you've had a really strong year, procedure growth through the nine months, up 14%, in the third quarter, up 15%. And yet, Marshall, you're guiding us to -- if I'm understanding all these numbers correctly, 13% to 14% for the year, which suggests a softer fourth quarter against a similar comp to the third quarter. I think you grew 10% or so in both the third and fourth quarters last year. Can you help us just understand your thinking? And just given the mature procedures seem to be stable to improving and the growing stuff is still growing, what do we need to understand about the fourth quarter?","Calvin Darling","Yes, Rick. This is Calvin. And absolutely overall we're pleased with our procedure growth trends and this is actually the third quarter in a row that we've increased our guidance for procedures and the revise procedure growth assumptions generally reflect the continuation of the trends that we've seen through three quarters with growth coming from U.S general surgery and international procedures as I described. In our updated view 13% to 14%, it's lower than 15% in Q3, we're certainly at 14% on a year to-date basis. And the fact is in Q4, the comps get more difficult for those mature categories the dVPs in the United States and other mature categories whereas as Patrick described, I think maintaining the rate that you saw in the first nine months will become more challenging in the fourth quarter.","Rick Wise","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Tycho Peterson","Thanks. First one, maybe a bit of a subtlety, but Gary, in your comments you talked more about the network effect and then in the press you commented on the technology ecosystem, can you maybe just elaborate on that a little bit. Are you directing additional resources to software and informatics, you need a customer is asking for more?","Gary Guthart","We have over the last few years increased our capabilities in real time software and kind of guidance tools for the surgeon as well as kind of offline Informatics. So that's not an immediate thing, it's actually been a rising trend. When you think about the ecosystems sort of stepping back as a whole, one of these products is the robot itself, the imaging system, sometimes with molecules like Firefly, instrumentation everything from needle drivers to staplers and vessel sealers, training technologies like stimulators and dual console. And then there is another piece which is Informatics. Informatics has been power force. At the surgeon level what data can you give me in real time that helps surgeon make a decision, at the institutional level it comes down to what kind of instruments you're using, how long are you on the system, what is that look like relative to national norms. And they've been interested in that data and we've been supplying that data now for over a year and those conversations been really healthy and I think it will only grow.","Tycho Peterson","And then I guess that's helping them to figure out the cost side of the equation as well?","Gary Guthart","It let them understand the couple of things, it let's than model their cost really carefully and really get the value right. The big thing in any of these conversations is total cost to treat, not price and so that helps them really understand total cost to treat. And its -- we found it to be an extremely productive and rich conversation with customer base. So, they like that. And it also gives them some sense of variation amongst different procedures and different surgeons, so they get a sense of how much variability they see within their institutions.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then on margins, you talked about reengineering some of the newer products, I know last quarter you talk little bit about longer term gross margins. Should we expect to see an impact from some of the reengineering programs in next couple of quarters, how do we think about the potential there?","Gary Guthart","So, yes, we've talked about the facts, when we introduced new products the margins are lower than mature products and lower than they'll be ultimately once that products been around for while both because we are able to drag down the cost of venders through volume as well as be able to redesign the products and we've undertaken some redesigns as well as increasing volume. I think what we've said before is that those efforts are well underway. We're happy with where they are going. They won't drive a lot of benefit this quarter, more of the benefit will be in 2016 and even more in 2017.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then you had more operating leases this quarter, can you maybe just talk about that and your willingness to use that as a lever to place more system placements in particular maybe outside U.S.?","Gary Guthart","Yes. I think what we are trying to do is to be flexible with our customers and our customers they are looking for flexibility and once we get a system installed obviously it drive procedures and instrument and accessory volumes. So, it\u2019s a win, win, win all the way around. We did 13 this quarter. We have 36 outstanding operating leases outstanding. We're also doing capital leases. We have a number of capital leases out there. I think on the operating lease side, some of these have turned into purchases where the customers ultimately bought the product and so it again it feels like a real win situation for us to leverage our balance sheet and provide our customer flexibility to get into robotics.","Gary Guthart","They have been generally satisfied with it and we have, too.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Great. And then just lastly on hernia, are you comfortable with kind of the sustainability of the trends here for both ventral and inguinal?","Gary Guthart","I think on both sides there are sub-segments in those markets and so getting to total available market and those is little bit hard to forecast. There are definitely segments in both where we think there is good long term sustainable value. How big those segments become, I think its going to be hard to predict, we just going to have to work through it.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Thank you.","Gary Guthart","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in queue will come from Tao Levy with Wedbush. Please go ahead.","Tao Levy","Great. Thanks. So first question, I was wondering if maybe you can explain if there is any difference between the Xi Single-Site instruments and what\u2019s available with the Si? And I guess, again, I scratched my head as to why someone would want to use a Xi Single-Site and just -- for chole.","Gary Guthart","Yes. Fair question. So, in terms of functionally they are functionally equivalent. So there are some small technical differences, but from in terms of what our surgeon can do, they are pretty similar. Xi has opposite couple of advantages having to do with the way the arms work. But I think for the most part you can think of them as equivalent. The reason people have a interest in them or certain number of hospitals have really room in their program for a single robotic system, if they want that mix to include Single-Site and they want to be able to operate the Xi technology, this gives them that option. So for those one system sites that let them do the full portfolio of the things they want to do.","Tao Levy","In terms of utilization of Firefly in chole, I think you mentioned about 40%. What about in other areas, like colorectal surgeries? Are you seeing any adoption of Firefly in those areas?","Gary Guthart","I will look to Patrick. I don't have the numbers at my finger tips in terms of colorectal perfusion.","Patrick Clingan","Yes. We have been seeing just use of the technology across the broad section of procedures and it\u2019s ramped nicely over time.","Tao Levy","So just following up on that in my last question, at the ACS conference the company talked a lot about imaging being one of the biggest areas of investment for the company. So maybe if you could expand on that a little bit. What areas are you guys working on that is going to really improve patient outcomes specifically around imaging and the benefits that bring either the patients or surgeon comfort?","Gary Guthart","As we spoken before there are few things that I think are coming together that can really benefit surgeons. One of them is that sensor technology has been advancing rapidly around the world having to do with technology development for other things like cell phones. We can take advantage of that for application in surgical applications by developing sensors and products that are specific to what surgeons want to do and see, that's one dimension. The other dimension is to use other types of imaging modality, sometimes other frequency bands, sometimes molecules to allow surgeons to see things that are not visible with the naked eye. So highlight structures or highlight anatomical organisms that a surgeon wants to see during the surgery. And that since Firefly is really a platform idea not just a single molecule. And so overtime we think there are things that we can bring to market that will allow surgeons to see more and to customize their vision for the typical A procedure they want to be in.","Tao Levy","Is this five years out or two years over\u2026","Gary Guthart","Some of them are long conference and some of them are a little thinner, so it\u2019s really a mixture there and now ready to go into detail with you on this call is to each of the sequences but the investments we\u2019ve made in this distal chip imaging, the step into Xi is a set of investments that we think gives us a long runway in terms of the variety of endoscopes we can deliver and the kinds of technologies we can deliver on that platform.","Tao Levy","All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in queue that will come from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Lewis","Good afternoon. Gary, just two quick questions, I guess the first is we think it\u2019s pretty early to be getting excited about the competitive systems that no one on earth has seen it to put it mildly. But if you were to comment on one element of the high level I wonder and that\u2019s the theme emerging from some of these your competitors one day is that they are talking about a smaller capital footprint which seems to be lower priced systems and I guess, do you see lower priced capital systems be more important going forward or can you continue to price the value and keep system ASPs high and a quick follow up.","Gary Guthart","I think on that first one really that\u2019s a question that\u2019s going to be determined by the customer and we understand that technology pretty well and have been thoughtful about it in terms of what we\u2019ve developed. As you refer to in your question and I completely agree it\u2019s about value not price and the question is what are the outcomes that are going to be derived by these kinds of systems and what\u2019s the price point at which you can offer them. We have a wide range from Xi down to Si-es and Si research and that range is very large and what we find is that the majority of our customers buy capability. I think in this last quarter you can look at what the Xi to Si exchange, what that mix flows. We explore and we think about where there are other positions and price points that make sense. Certainly we hear the same kinds of customer commentary that you hear and others hear. And I think the real question is not which is shown on the shop floor, it\u2019s what do these systems do in surgery, and that\u2019s going to come down to what can they deliver, what kind of outcome can they deliver and that\u2019s how we think about it.","David Lewis","Okay. Very helpful and then just a follow up on Tycho\u2019s questions on margins. So if I take commentary from you and Marshall last couple of quarters and there is two data points that come out, it feels like gross margins above 68% and EBIT margins about 40% are going to be challenging, but then based on this quarter, it\u2019s very clear you certainly have the ability to surpass into those two margin objectives. So Gary I think about 68% growth and 40% margin, I mean do these goal post reflect the reality and investments you are going to have to make the next several years or things about product mix or any system to reflect conservative outlook.","Gary Guthart","Yes I\u2019m not quite sure I understood the question. I think just stepping in, I\u2019ll tell you what we care about and where we are heading. I think that in these technologies there as we said before, there are complex mixtures of robotics and imaging and instrumentation and there is a certain amount of investment that\u2019s required to put them in position that they are cost effective for the company and that gives us the opportunity to have them be cost effective for the customer. Those are good things to invest in.","There is a point at which we believe we are early in the adoption of robotic surgery globally. And so, some of that gross margin is around the cost and some of it is around price. And what we want to be able to do is lower the price -- the cost point to us and that gives us flexibility with regard to the price point and so that\u2019s what -- and that\u2019s what we are focused on.","Where we\u2019ll go long term will depend a lot on we think both what we can do in terms of our supply chain and our design and where we think the customer value inflation is.","But in the quarter the two points that you are referencing were more a result of product mix and alignment of positives that as I said in my script we don\u2019t expect to recur.","David Lewis","Okay. Thank you very much.","Gary Guthart","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in queue that will come from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Richard Newitter","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Marshall, maybe just a continuation of the last question on margins. Can you give us just broad strokes kind of view the puts and the takes that we should be thinking of going forward even into next year on the margin side and then also the gross margin that is and then if you could just tell us or remind us how you guys view operating leverage materializing in the business model going forward?","Marshall Mohr","From a margin perspective there are a number of different influences. One is a product mix and the products the margins on I&A are greater than they are on systems. So to the extent that we have systems doing well or not doing well the network swing in the margin and also a geographic mix where we sell in the United States and dollars obviously we sell to our distributors at a discount to that we sell to in certain markets in foreign currencies and depending on foreign exchange that can have some impact on the amount of revenue that have. And then we have expanding opportunities at in our newer product, and those newer products happen to have lower margins.","And so to the extent that we are successful in let\u2019s say stapling and vessel sealing, it\u2019s a positives for the company because you are taking greater share of wallet, but in terms of the gross margin percentage it will push down the gross margin percentage because the margins on those products are not as high as our mature products.","So there is a number of different things that can affect gross margin. As far as leverage, we manage the company wisely. We try to improve margin, we have a number of programs like we said in place to reduce the cost of products, but we are also as Gary said, we are new in a lot of markets and we will expand, we will sacrifice a point of margin for expansion of market.","The way we think about it is you have opportunities for scale and leverage in things like instruments and accessories to some degree and imaging and then mature procedures, the commercial part. But you have opportunities for investment and that\u2019s in new products, cost reductions and new geographies. And we are balancing those two. So we think about both.","Richard Newitter","Great, and then just one last one. Si-e sales looked like they were zero this quarter, first time since, I think, you launched that product. Gary, can you just comment on what you are seeing in the marketplace as far as demand goes for the lower price point in the context of more complex and the systems like the Xi that you're launching and the steam that might be building behind that? What does this mean, if anything, for demand trends for Si-e or the lower -- the low end of the spectrum?","Gary Guthart","We are happy to provide the customer a system that meets their needs as to where they want to go and partly due to robotics programs. And I think the results speak for themselves. I think that Xi is being well adopted I think as we finish the product set and complete the product set that has made it more attractive to those who may be waiting for that completion. We still sell Si refurbs and Si-e and I think the difference between an Si-e and a four [ph] arm is value people I see -- I think that while there are a lot of procedures you can do through arm people really enjoy that or value that fourth arm and so you see fewer Si-es I think it\u2019s simple as that.","Richard Newitter","Thank you.","Gary Guthart","Operator, we have time for just one more question here, please.","Operator","Thank you sir and that will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Vijay Kumar","Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in and congrats on a nice quarter. Maybe one on the margins here. I know that you sort of mentioned mix right and when you think about mix you had a higher proportion of Xi and if I remember correctly on the last call you said Xi you are still scaling up margins was lower but Xi was higher, but then offsetting that you had a higher proportion of system sales coming in from the U.S. I\u2019m just trying to think how those two trade off and how they benefit your gross margins?","Gary Guthart","Yes I think this quarter specifically we benefitted from the product mix and that there was a high proportion of the dual console Xi and when you look at the product cost side the extra surgeon console us the mature technology with the lower cost on that and then you get the extra price to run through margin. So that helped us out as Marshall said there were negligible inventory charges in the quarter and other costs, other charges to cost of sales were pretty minor. So lot of things lined up pretty well for us in the fourth quarter -- in the third quarter, in the fourth quarter we think it was probably a more typical pattern in terms of the product mix and some of the other costs and a seasonally stronger capital quarter we have more system sales those that carry a little margins than the recurring revenue side and we\u2019ll have more definite comments about 16 on the next call.","Vijay Kumar","Great. And one follow up. Marshall, on that cap allocation sort of just wondering sort of what your priorities are and buyback was a little anaemic in the quarter. I was just wondering sort of what the moving parts were?","Marshall Mohr","Yes there is no change in our philosophy. We will continue to purchase shares when at the right opportunity. Keep in mind that the stock has been depressed over the last 30, 40 days and yet that\u2019s a period in which we cannot be in the market because it\u2019s a blackout period for the company. And so anyway we\u2019ll continue that philosophy and you\u2019ve seen us purchase, repurchase over $2.5 billion worth of stock over the last couple of years and we think at rare prices.","Vijay Kumar","That was helpful. Thanks guys.","Gary Guthart","Thanks, Vijay. That was our last question. As we\u2019ve said previously while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on helping surgeons increase patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. The following quote by Dr. Parekh, an experienced neurologist at the University of Miami sheds light on how our customers view our systems. The latest version of the da Vinci system Xi allows us to offer more minimally invasive surgical options to more patients. Hard-to-reach tumors or those encompassing more than one organ can potentially now be approached with this more agile and visually enhanced device. We\u2019ve built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the volatility of things that truly make a difference.","This concludes today\u2019s call. We thank you for your participation and support on the zest for ordinary journey to improve surgery and we look forward to talking with you again in three months.","Operator","Thank you.

(Operator Instructions) And also as a reminder, today\u2019s teleconference is being recorded.","And at this time, I will turn the conference call over to your host, Senior Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Calvin Darling. Please go ahead Sir.","Calvin Darling","Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive Surgical\u2019s second quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Patrick Clingan, Director of Finance.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today\u2019s call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the Company\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 3, 2014 and 10-Q filed on April 25, 2014. These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC\u2019s EDGAR database. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.","Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today\u2019s press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today\u2019s format will consist of providing you with highlights of our second quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session.","Gary will present the quarter\u2019s business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our second quarter financial results. Patrick will discuss procedures and clinical highlights, then I\u2019ll provide our updated financial outlook for 2014. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.","With that, I will turn it over to Gary.","Gary Guthart","Thank you for joining us on the call today. I\u2019m encouraged by several trends relative to the first quarter of the year. First, global procedures grew 8% on a sequential basis and 9% year-over-year. Our newest platform, the da Vinci Xi surgical system was launched in the quarter, and our customers\u2019 reception for it has been very positive. Also during the quarter, we strengthened our direct presence in both Japan and Europe.","Turning to the United States, procedure growth improved over the first quarter led by growth in colorectal procedures, single-site, and early growth in hernia repair. Hernia repair is a broad category consisting of several procedure types and techniques for multiple underlying conditions. For some of these repairs, the da Vinci systems provide enhanced visualization and dexterity during the dissection and reconstruction phases of the procedure. We are very encouraged by this growth and we\u2019ll pursue those opportunity in coming quarters.","Within our gynecology segment, negative trends in da Vinci use in US hysterectomy in the first quarter moderated in the second. That said, the macro environment around US hysterectomy appears unchanged and overall performance in hysterectomy is likely better understood by viewing the first half of 2014 as a whole versus a quarterly breakout. Overall, general surgery interest and utilization in United States is positive. Patrick will provide further procedure detail later in the call.","Capital placements in the United States grew sequentially from 45 in the first quarter to 61 in the second driven by the introduction of our da Vinci Xi system. Surgeon and institutional interest in da Vinci Xi has been strong with positive feedback from experienced users within many different specialties, as well as those new to da Vinci systems. The capital environment for robotic surgery remains constrained in the United States with customers evaluating their capital priorities broadly. With regard to our Xi system specifically, we anticipate increasing interest as additional clearances are obtained in experience with the product growth.","In Europe, procedure growth moderated relative to the first quarter. Growth rates in the quarter were balanced between urology, gynecology and general surgery. Some of the slowing growth may be attributed to fewer working days in the quarter compared with prior year. As expected, capital sales in Europe have been impacted in the near term by the introduction of da Vinci Xi. Capital sales cycles are typically longer in Europe, and the introduction of the new systems creates some delay as customers evaluate our new offering. Longer term we expect growing interest in our Xi system in Europe. We also expect continued interest in our Xi system for price sensitive customers. We continue to invest in our sales organization as well as scientific affairs to deepen our European capabilities.","Turning to Asia, procedure trends have been healthy with growth centered on cancer surgeries and urology, and general surgery. We are pleased to have completed a transaction with our Japanese distribution partner to enable Intuitive to interact more closely with customers in Japan and we welcome members of the adopted team to Intuitive. Direct interactions with customers, surgical societies and government agencies in Japan are essential to long-term growth of robotic surgery. And we look forward to serving the Japanese market meaningfully in coming years. As you know, we continue to work with multiple parties in pursuit of additional procedure reimbursement for da Vinci in Japan.","Capital sales in Asia were lower than prior quarters impacted by the introduction of da Vinci Xi in the U.S., as well as constrained procedural reimbursement in Japan. We have submitted applications for Xi clearance in Japan and Korea, and we\u2019ll work with government bodies in subsequent quarters during the review process. As we have described in our earnings release, several non-cash charges make it valuable to understand our financial performance on a pro forma basis.","Taken together our operating performance in the quarter is as follows. Worldwide procedures grew 9% of the prior year. We sold 96 systems in the quarter, down from 143 in Q2 of 2013 and up from 87 in Q1. Total non-GAAP revenue in the quarter was $507 million, down from $579 million in Q2 of 2013 and up from $490 million in Q1 of 2014. Non-GAAP operating profit in the quarter was $196 million comprising 39% of non-GAAP revenue. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.70 compared with $4.60 in Q2 of 2013, and $3.50 in Q1.","Speaking of product contribution margins, we expect capital pressures on hospitals in most regions to continue. Given our new product introduction cycle for systems and broader market conditions, we expect capital margins to remain below prior year levels. However, overtime we expect recurring revenue margins to improve as new product volumes increase and we benefit from efficiencies in our supply chain services and product architectures.","Turning to new products, we\u2019ve received FDA clearance for our Xi Vessel Sealer and are working through the clearance process with Xi Stapler and Xi Firefly in United States and other countries. These advanced technologies are an important step in filling in the Xi offering. Our Xi architecture simplifies implementation and improves performance for our advanced instruments, and we look forward to their introduction around the world. We have submitted our five 10-K application for our single-site wrist needle drivers, and are working through the clearance process. Pilot product performance for the wrist needle driver for single-site is compelling. We expect it will add significant capability and efficiencies for single-site surgeons.","Lastly, we continue to make progress in refining our SP platform. I\u2019m excited and encouraged by the progress the technical teams are making. This will be a multi-core development that will be paced by technical and regulatory milestones. In summary, we are passionately pursuing the long-term opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and are focused on the following. First, extending the benefits of minimally invasive surgery using da Vinci worldwide. Second, building da Vinci capability and supporting its use in general surgery. Third, disciplined execution in our new product launches. And finally continuing to invest in our capabilities in key international markets.","Now I\u2019ll pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer.","Marshall Mohr","Thank you, Gary. I\u2019ll be describing our results on a pro forma basis which excludes the impact of our Xi trade-in programs, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation and intangible assets amortizations, and invested impairments. We\u2019re providing pro forma information because we believe the business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my statements. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma on GAAP results on our website so that there is no confusion.","Pro forma second quarter revenue was $507 million, down 12% compared with $579 million in the second quarter of 2013 and up 3% from last quarter. Procedures for the second quarter grew approximately 9% compared with second quarter of 2013, and were up approximately 8% compared with last quarter. Procedure highlights will be discussed by Patrick. Pro forma revenue excludes the impact of offers made to customers to trade-in their recently purchased Si products to newly introduced Xi products. At the time of announcing the da Vinci Xi surgical system, we offered our first grade of customers in the U.S. the ability to trade their recently purchased da Vinci Si surgical systems for da Vinci Xi surgical systems.","In the second quarter we obtained CE Mark in Europe in the similar trade-in offers to certain European customers that had recently purchased da Vinci Si systems. These trade-in programs often provide our customers with the opportunity to exchange certain recently purchased da Vinci Si instruments and accessories for da Vinci Xi instruments and accessories. As a result of these offers, we reserved $26 million of U.S. revenue in the first quarter, and reserved $6 million of European revenue in the second quarter. And these customers accept or decline their trade-in offers, we refine our estimates of the revenue reserves.","In the second quarter we reversed $10 million of the first quarter system revenue reserve, approximately reflecting more trade-outs completed and partially reflecting refinement of the number of customers that we expect to accept our offerings. As I\u2019ve stated, pro forma results exclude the impact of these revenue reserves. Revenue highlights are as follows.","Pro forma instrument and accessory revenue of $262 million was down 1% compared with the second quarter of 2013, and was up 2% compared with the first quarter of 2014. The decrease relative to the second quarter of 2013 reflected lower stocking orders associated with newer system sales. The increase relative to the first quarter reflects increased procedures and number of stocking orders associated with higher systems partially offset by customer buying patterns and fewer sales of energy generator units in single-site starter kits. Keep in mind that the Xi incorporates are energy generator units.","Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including initial stocking orders was approximately $1,830 per procedure compared with $2,020 in the second quarter of 2013 and $1,930 last quarter. The decrease relative to the prior year primarily reflects lower stocking order revenue, the decrease relative to the prior quarter reflects customer buying patterns and fewer energy units and single-sit starter kit sales.","Pro forma results or pro forma systems revenue of $138 million decreased 36% compared with the second quarter of 2013 and increased 6% compared with the first quarter of 2014. 96 systems were placed in the second quarter excluding the four Xi\u2019s trade-in for Si\u2019s. We saw more hospitals finance their da Vinci systems in the second quarter with 37% being financed compared to 11% in the first quarter, and 20% for all of 2013. We are participating in that trend financing 10 systems of which 3 were structured as operating leases. Enabling system placements will drive greater procedures of recurring revenue.","Globally, our systems ASP for the second quarter was $1.5 million, roughly equal to last year, and slightly higher than the $1.48 million last quarter. The increase compared to the last quarter was driven by product mix partially offset by geographic mix. 50 of the 96 systems placed during the second quarter were da Vinci Xi models. We sold 5 Si\u2019s in the quarter compared with 13 last quarter. In U.S. we placed 61 systems in the first quarter compared with 90 systems in the second quarter of 2013, and 45 systems in the first quarter of 2014. The decline in U.S. system placements relative to last year reflects the impact of lower procedure growth, and ongoing macro factors that are impacting hospital capital decisions. The increase relative to the first quarter reflects seasonality and acceptance of our Xi system.","Outside the U.S., we sold 35 systems in the second quarter, including 19 into Europe and 5 into Japan, compared with 53 into international markets in the second quarter of 2013, which included 21 into Europe and 20 into Japan, and 42 systems into international markets last quarter which included 14 into Europe and 19 into Japan. Second quarter system sales also included five into France and three into Germany. Lower second quarter 2014 systems sales relative to last year and last quarter primarily reflect lower system unit sales in Japan but also reflect delays in purchasing as customers await local market approval of Xi. The decrease in system sales in Japan reflect the high installed base relative to only having one national reimbursement prostatectomy. The Xi product not yet being available as we work through regulatory approval process.","In June, we entered into new agreement to transition direct sales and marketing responsibilities in Japan from our distributor to our wholly owned subsidiary. The total transaction cost was expected to be approximately $70 million of which $50 million is a sign to goodwill and the remainder is a sign to intangibles that will amortize over varying periods. We expect that overtime the total cost associated with managing this direct channel and the costs of intangible amortization will be absorbed without a material impact in net income. As Gary indicated, the completion of the agreement enables direct interaction with our customers, surgical societies and government agencies.","Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Pro forma gross margins was 69.2% in the second quarter of 2014 compared with 71.8% for the second quarter of 2013 and 70.2% for the first quarter of 2014. Our lower margin percentage reflects a higher mix of new product sales including the da Vinci Xi systems, and relative for last year, costs spread over lower production levels. Margins on newly launched products would typically be lower than our mature products reflecting vendor pricing on low volumes, temporary tooling costs and other start-up costs. However, overtime as volumes increase and we refine the manufacturing process and the product, we would expect to see improvement in the margins of these newer products although they may not ultimately reach the level of our matured products.","In the first quarter we recorded a pretax charge of $67 million to reflect the estimated costs of settling a number of product liability legal claims against the company. During the second quarter, we recorded an additional $10 million charge reflecting additional claims. These claims relate to alleged complications from surgeries performed with certain versions of monopolar cautery scissor or MCS instruments that included an MCS tip cover accessory that was the subject of a market withdrawal in 2012, and surgeries that were performed with MCS instruments that were the subject of a recall in 2013. Our estimate of the anticipated cost of settling these claims is based on negotiations with attorneys for patients who have participated in the mediation process that the company established in conjunction with the polling agreement. Our estimates will be refined as we proceed through the negotiation process.","Pro forma operating expenses which exclude reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expenses and amortization of intangibles were $155 million for the second quarter of 2014 compared with $152 million for the second quarter of 2013, and $155 million for the first quarter of 2014. The increase in pro forma operating expense in the second quarter relative to the first quarter reflects increased commissions associated with higher revenue and costs associated with new product launches. We expect the operating expenses to continue to ramp in the back half of the year primarily associated with international expansion, particularly in Japan and Europe, and new product launches.","In the quarter we recorded a $4 million charge to other income to write down an investment in early stage company. The investment originally enabled a license for technology, otherwise other income reflects interest on our cash and investments, our pro forma results exclude this charge. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 27.1% compared with 28.6% for the second quarter of 2013 and 26.8% last quarter. Our pro forma net income was $140 million or $3.73 per share, compared with $189 million or $4.63 per share for the second quarter of 2013, and $139 million or $3.54 per share for the first quarter of 2014. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easy comparison of our financial results in business trends. I will now summarize our GAAP results.","GAAP revenue was $512 million for the second quarter of 2014 compared with $579 million for the second quarter of 2013, and $465 million for the first quarter of 2014. GAAP net income was $104 million or $2.77 per share for the second quarter of 2014, compared with $159 million or $3.90 per share for the second quarter of 2013, and $44 million or $1.13 per share for the first quarter of 2014.","At the end of the quarter with cash and investments of $2 billion, down from $3 billion as of March 31, 2014, the decrease was primarily driven by $1 billion used during the second quarter for repurchase company stock on an accelerated basis and our acquisition of distribution rights in Japan, partially offset by cash generated from operations. The majority of the shares repurchased under our ASR program which amounts to approximately 2.5 million shares have been received and retired, the remaining shares if any under the program will be received and retired in early November although they could be received earlier if the ASR program is ended sooner. We do not plan to repurchase any additional shares until this ASR program is closed out.","And with that I\u2019d like to turn it over to Patrick who will go over procedure and clinical highlights.","Patrick Clingan","Thanks, Marshall. Q2 year-over-year procedure growth was approximately 9%, with U.S. procedures growing 7% and international procedures growing 17%.","Stepping back and looking at the first half of 2014, U.S. procedures grew 5%. The softness in Q1 and the improvement in Q2 were impacted by a changing macro environment, including the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. We believe our U.S. procedure growth is best viewed by looking at the first half in aggregate. Q2 GYN procedure growth improved compared Q1 though we believe the low single-digit decline in procedure growth we experienced during the first half is likely representative of an overall rate of decline in benign gynecologic surgical volumes.","Since we do not sell power morcellators and they do not attach to our systems, we are unable to precisely measure the impact April\u2019s FDA advisory specific to power morcellators may have had on our Q2 procedures. However, the advisory appears to be meaningfully impacting myomectomies while the effect on hysterectomies appear to have been muted. We believe that for many patients surgeons will not have to choose between minimally invasive surgery and morcellation. Alternatives for tissue extraction, including the use of da Vinci surgery exist. Similar to last quarter, single-site hysterectomy continues to be a source of growth in U.S. GYN procedures, though offer small base.","As we highlighted in a press release yesterday, a web-based patient satisfaction survey of over 6,000 hysterectomy patients sponsored by Intuitive in the Hyster Sisters patient support group recently published in the Interactive Journal of Medical Research found that robotic hysterectomy when compared to a abdominal, laparoscopic and vaginal hysterectomy was the only surgical modality that was an independent predictor of better patient experience, greater satisfaction, and willingness to recommended have the same procedure again.","Moving onto U.S. general surgery. Adoption continues to be strong across a broad number of procedures. Colorectal procedure adoption remains solid following the broad launch of our Xi Stapler earlier this year. In addition to driving procedure growth, with customers adoption Stapler and Vessel Sealer, I&A for colorectal procedure has been increasing over the past few quarters. Single-site cholecystectomy continues to grow with adoption being driven by cosmetically sensitive commercially insured patients. As people look at I&A for procedure among a large number of high volume customers suggests that achieving little to no difference in material operating costs compared to laparoscopic instruments is reproducible and sustainable.","Although there are additional general surgery procedures showing early signs of adoption, I want to take a moment to expand upon Gary\u2019s comment about what we are seeing in hernia repair. Hernias occur in the abdomen pelvis, sometimes as a result of prior open surgical incisions. Open surgery remains the most common form of surgery for hernia repair. Looking specifically at ventral hernia\u2019s that occur in the abdomen, [indiscernible] pain scores and difficulties associated with performing a laparoscopic repair has caused many surgeons to rely upon open surgery.","To perform minimally invasive ventral hernia repair, instruments much reach back towards the abdominal wall to repair the defect which can present a challenge even for professional laparoscopists. Early surgeon feedback on the use of da Vinci for ventral hernia repair has been encouraging. These surgeons find ease of suturing and enhanced vision enables a minimally invasive repair that is similar to open surgery. It is worth noting that some surgeons reduced or eliminate fixation instruments with robotic surgery resulting in material operating costs that are similar between robotic and laparoscopic ventral hernia repair.","International procedure growth of 17% continues to be lead by global adoption of DDP and other urologic procedures with solid early contributions from GYN, oncology and general surgery. Compared to Q1 procedure growth of 24%, a number of small factors impacted the growth rate during the quarter. Relative to Q1, Q2 international procedure growth compares to a more difficult prior year competitor as international procedures grew 23% in Q2 of 2013 compared to 14% in Q1 2013. International procedure growth was also impacted by the mixed polled days in Europe.","As we look forward, we expect an international procedure that maybe a bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter as adoption is not uniform across all procedures and geographies. We continue to expect international procedure adoption to be a driver or procedure growth as the opportunity for da Vinci surgery and cancer and complex open urologic, gynecology and colorectal procedures is substantial.","At the American Urological Association meeting in May, Dr. Murphy from Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, Australia presented the results of an economic evaluation of robotic surgery sponsored by the Victorian Government. His evaluation included more than 5,000 patients from the state live database comparing outcomes and costs associated with open lap and robotic surgeries for prostate cancer. The analysis included direct costs associated with the surgery and post-operative care and concluded robotic assisted prostatectomy reduces heart stay [ph], blood transfusions and positive surgical margins in a public health system in Australia. In a case mix activity based funding model, the incremental cost of robotic assisted prostatectomy maybe offsets by reduced length of stay and blood transfusions when greater than 140 cases per year are performed.","Just finding it similar to the U.K. nice recommendation to consider robotic surgery in the treatment of localized prostate cancer they found robotic prostatectomy cost effective in centers performing at least 150 procedures per year.","In the debate over health spending, analysis of economic impacts of new technologies on specific procedures are an important tool. However, meaningful analysis requires a detailed understanding of clinical outcomes, patient populations, surgeon experience and skill variation, and actual costs to care for a patient across several alternative treatments. Studies that satisfy these criteria\u2019s such as Dr. Murphy\u2019s have been layered and those that overlook one or more of these elements do a dis-service to the healthcare community as a whole.","Recently we had seen an increase in both careful economic studies by investigators who understand the need to take a population based in direct cost approach to assessment, as well as those that inappropriately select subset in analysis as the basis to draw broad conclusions. We encourage the healthcare community to demand rigor in these analysis. Those that do derive the clearest picture of how new technologies impact lives and the economics of those who use them.","This concludes my remarks and I thank you for your time. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Calvin.","Calvin Darling","Thank you, Patrick. As Marshall describes, we are focusing our commentary towards non-GAAP pro forma results which exclude the impacts of significant non-cash expenses and certain non-recurring items. We believe that this enhances investor\u2019s ability to asses our financial results. In order to provide historical context, we have posted summary leveled quarterly pro forma P&L metrics with GAAP reconciliation to the Investor Relations page of our website. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2014 in pro forma terms.","Starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full year 2014 procedure growth of between 2% and 8% above the approximately 523,000 procedures performed in 2013. Now based upon trends described earlier on the call, we are adjusting our 2014 procedure growth guidance to the higher end of this range, between 5% and 8%.","Moving to revenues. Several factors continue to make it difficult in the near term for us to predict systems sales volumes. And as a consequence total revenue, specifically. We are currently in the process of obtaining US FDA, an international regulatory clearances for the excise versions of our Stapler and Firefly products, and the Xi system is not available in Japan, Korea, and other international markets. Customers evaluation of the da Vinci Xi and the timing of their system purchasing decisions maybe impacted as we work to expand the product and geographic clearances for the platform.","Macro environmental issues impacting hospital, capital purchasing decision, the breadth and evolving nature of our procedure growth. Procedures are our primary driver, capital sales and the relationship between procedure growth rates and capital sales is highly sensitive, and likely variability in the timing of Japan system sails, given the timeline for obtaining other procedure reimbursement, beyond DPP, anticipated no sooner than 2016. Due to these factors affecting the capital side of our business, we will not be providing at this time.","Our Q2 2014 pro forma gross margin was roughly 69%, having declined about 100 basis points compared to last year, largely reflecting lower gross profit margins under da Vinci Xi systems launched in Q2. As we move forward in 2014, we expect our gross profit margin to move differentially lower based upon the impact of new products, product mix and market conditions. Our actual gross profit will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely upon people mix and systems production volume.","We believe deeply in our ability to fundamentally improve surgery and are continuing to pursue plans to increase the use of da Vinci enabled MIS around the globe. As stated previously, 2014 will be a year of increased investment for Intuitive Surgical. Even during this period of capital sales uncertainty, we remain focused on building our international capabilities, investing in new product development and pursuing growth in multiple areas of our procedure business.","Last quarter we forecast full year operating expenses to grow between 12% and 15% above 2013 levels. We now expect to grow our operating expenses roughly 10% to 13% above the 2013 levels. We expect the 2014 non-cash stock compensation to be between $170 million and $180 million as compared to the $180 million to $190 million forecast on the previous call. We expect other income excluding the impact of the Q2 impairment charge to total between $13 million and $15 million.","With regard to income tax, on our last call we forecast our income tax rate to be between 25% and 28% of pretax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. We are now refining this forecast to a range of between 26% and 28% of pretax income. This forecast does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2014. Our share count for calculating diluted EPS in Q2 2014 was approximately 37.6 million shares. Going forward, based upon the full quarter impact of our Q2 buyback, we expect our Q3 shares count to be between 36.7 million and 36.9 million shares. We do not plan to repurchase any of our common stock in Q3.","That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair","Gary, given the \u2013 thank you for the comments by the way. Given the view on sort of the international investments that you\u2019re making in the refinement of the expense structure this year, can you give us some sense of what else you have to do as you look into 2015 and what we might think about as a longer term kind of margin trajectory for the company?","Gary Guthart","As we\u2019ve said in the opening remarks, at the product side I think we\u2019ll see capital margins come down a little bit relative to where we were in prior years but instruments and return revenue being strong. As we look at the spend profile, I think the next couple of years will be a set of investments, some of them around products, some of them around international expansion as we\u2019ve been telling you as we go through. And I think it will take a couple of years for those investments to play out.","Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair","Okay. And then as we look at kind of hernia opportunity that you\u2019re highlighting here, can you size that for us a bit relative to maybe the colorectal \u2013 prostatectomy opportunity or general surgery, broadly. And how bigger contributor is that to the kind of the revision in the guidance and procedures that you gave today?","Gary Guthart","I think we\u2019re too soon yet to break out all the segments in hernia. I guess I\u2019d start by saying that hernia does have a fair number of segments, both in terms of where they are in the body and techniques that people use to approach them. We\u2019re just working through now, what that looks like in terms of the value we bring to each one, so it\u2019s a broad category, not a single procedure. We\u2019re encouraged by it, I think that it\u2019s growth rate has been real, it looks like there are real opportunities for us to bring value relative to alternative approaches, both clinical value and economic value, and that\u2019s a good and powerful combination. So we\u2019re not ready yet to break out the segment and size them for you, it looks to be a real opportunity, how big it ultimately will be, we\u2019re going to have to work through the next couple of quarters before we publish that.","Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair","Okay. And I guess, one another quick question for us [ph]. If you think about kind of the distribution, who is buying Xi\u2019s very Si\u2019s this quarter, particularly in the U.S., what might that help you understand in terms of people\u2019s willingness to buy in advance of the additional instruments that are being reviewed by FDA and would that track with your expectations where people are moving more quickly, just maybe a little bit more flavor on what was going on in the quarter. Thank you.","Gary Guthart","Just in terms of basic response, we were pleased with the response of Xi. I think that surgeons in the markets that we had targeted for it, I think really appreciated it, understood the capabilities that were brought forward. Things like colorectal surgery and thoracic surgery, a lot of the kinds of features that we brought with things that they have been asking for or anticipating. I think I was positive surprised by some of the response of gynecologic oncology, some things that some features being brought forward that I think they\u2019ll appreciate likewise in urology. So I think there was a broader positive reception than we had anticipated a surgical side. In terms of the splits of who is interested and who is buying from a commercial point of view. In the U.S. I\u2019ll turn that to Marshall and just give a little color on, existing customers versus retails and so on.","Marshall Mohr","So within U.S. we saw [indiscernible] second systems \u2013 I think briefly I\u2019ve just taken a little bit of longer that we\u2019ll \u2013 resulting \u2013","Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question in queue will come from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you, and good evening. I wanted to maybe just start with a follow-up to Gary, your answer to the prior question regarding the next couple of years being a period of investment. As you kind of look forward in the evolution here of robotic surgery, globally why you want to visit to look like when you come at the other of that investment cycle. What would sort of be in your mind considered a successful trajectory for the company as we move beyond that investment period?","Gary Guthart","I think you\u2019re asking around what is the financial profile or you\u2019re asking around what is the ultimate like surgical vision?","David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Well, if you like to put it into growth rate terms, I \u2013 we generally take that but what operationally is actually going on in the business, and maybe anything you do to help frame it for us as this becomes standard of care across multiple category, do we see an inflection point in Europe, do we see multiple categories in Japan. Like what would you operationally want to see, come out of that.","Gary Guthart","Yes, so as we think about the opportunity looking forward I think there are a couple of big buckets. One of them in areas treating cancer and complex disease which are largely open surgical procedures, we see opportunity globally. In the U.S., we\u2019re early in our experience in colorectal and thoracic; in Europe, we see opportunities in urology and gynecology for malignant conditions in colorectal and thoracic as well, likewise in Asia. So that sort of opportunities is one that we have been investing in, both on the product side as you know, things like Xi and stapling, and expanding and filling out the stapling line, as well as increasing our capabilities in terms of direct markets. And so, I think that opportunity is substantial, I think we\u2019re still in the early innings of that \u2013 of exploring that opportunity and delivering those products and the consequences of those to those markets. So that\u2019s one set that continues. A large part of our business is for gland [ph] surgery as well and you see things like the hernia opportunity we just discussed evolving pretty nicely. And as that happens, we will also look for products that optimize that opportunity, both clinically and economically. And I think those things are also translated cross borders. So we\u2019re really working on both sets, we\u2019re further ahead in adoption on the complex and cancer side, and so that\u2019s where we\u2019re starting in our U.S. markets for the most part. And that really informs the product pipeline in the go-to-market strategies that you\u2019ve heard us talk about.","David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And then maybe just my follow-up on Japan, if you could go into perhaps a little bit more detail on the acquisition. I know in your prepared remarks you referenced a potentially closer to some of the medial societies, and my understanding in Japan is that the approval of indication does stem more for the medical society, that\u2019s a little bit different from what we see in the rest of the world. Do you anticipate that this cultural relationship will provide you with access to helping \u2013 influence the adoption procedure rates, provide more clinical data. How can we see that play out in terms of gaining new applications in that country.","Gary Guthart","I think in general being closer to the user groups in the country helps us a lot in a bunch of different directions. One of them has made me sure we understand their needs and understand it in a very deep way. And in a broad setting so we are speaking to multi-specialties, that helps a lot. Number two is, as we say in Japan, the government interacts very closely with surgical societies to set guidance to understand data requirements and to help review issues and activities. And so having close relations with surgical societies, with keeping your leaders, and with our customers directly, those who already own our products. It help speed up the communication. It gets us more careful and deeper look into opportunities and issues to be resolved. And so we were pleased to do, it\u2019s absolutely aligned with what we want to get done.","David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue that will come from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Robert Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America","Thank you, and good afternoon. So, the first question is on the procedure volume growth guidance that you provided. You grew 8% in the first half, you got easier comparisons in the back. And I just wanted to understand the 5% to 8%. Is there something specific that you guys are anticipating that would cause a lot bit of weakness despite the softer comps in the back half? And maybe specifically referring to hysterectomy there or is it just \u2013 it\u2019s been kind of an interesting last year, and you want to remain conservative in your projections?","Gary Guthart","Looking at it there is not a specific thing that we think is looming and as we\u2019ve said in the prepared remarks, I think there was some choppiness between Q1 and Q2 that had to do with quarter boundaries and some other things that may have been unique to Q1. And so if you look at the first half together rather than separating it on quarter boundaries, I think it gives a better picture of where we are. Going forward I think the determining factors will be continued strength in general surgery which we\u2019ve been pleased with in the first half of the year. Offset by what happens next in gynecology in terms of stabilization, those are really underlying dynamics in the back half and that\u2019s what Calvin has used to think through the back half range.","Calvin Darling","And there is other thing I\u2019d point out Bob is, you talked about comparisons and when you get into the fourth quarter and seasonality of procedures complex benign procedures or simpler benign procedures, less complex, are more seasonal where you\u2019d expect higher fourth quarter volumes. Now in the affordable care environment, you just don\u2019t have a precedent for this with more people on high deductible plans and I think we\u2019re learning as we go on that front and could some of these be deferred beyond a year, we\u2019re just not sure. So it\u2019s just another factor that we\u2019ve considered.","Robert Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America","And then Gary, specifically on U.S. gain. I just wanted to kind of gauge your confidence that the trends we\u2019re seeing in Q2 can remain at this type of level instead of getting worse. I noticed another article in JAM of today talking about morcellation. And I just wanted to kind of gauge your confidence specifically in U.S. gain and the stability of that kind of growth rate you\u2019re experiencing today for the rest of the year?","Gary Guthart","Yes, I think that\u2019s really interesting. On the clinical side and what da Vinci surgeons have been telling us, I think how the system works, what it can do for gynecology, it\u2019s pretty stable and really won\u2019t know. What\u2019s hard to predict are any of the consequences of FDA guidance that \u2013 on tissue traction and things like that and part of that consequences that\u2019s the range that Calvin has described to you. So I think as we look at that kind of the underlying dynamics of how our products are used, we feel like those are stable. I think as you look out what the environmental factors might do, that\u2019s harder to predict and that accounts for the range [ph].","Robert Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America","Great. And just real quickly ask you why the expense guidance changed this quarter relative to what you gave at the beginning of the year?","Marshall Mohr","For half of the year we\u2019ve obviously spent less than what we\u2019ve have originally provided guidance for the year which was 12% to 15%, and so some of that had to deal with \u2013 I don\u2019t think there is big difference but that had to do with the hiring patterns in \u2013 they will need to hire people quickly in Japan and places like that. So we\u2019re little bit of to the favorable side but again, as I said earlier, we expect to ramp expenses as we do continue our international expansion in product development.","Gary Guthart","Yes, there is not a change there in our \u2013 what we believe is fundamentally important from an investment point of view. There are some things in the front half that are in a sense volume related cost that we didn\u2019t have to incur and there are some things that are timing issues.","Robert Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America","Great, and congrats on the progress.","Marshall Mohr","Thank you.","Gary Guthart","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Good afternoon. Marshall, just a quick question on stock comp. It appears you want the street to value the company now excluding your stock compensation, just a couple of questions on that. I mean, I appreciate the non-cash charges but options are dilution for shareholders, so how does excluding that and still discipline how the company is going to issue equity awards [ph] and given it\u2019s a form of compensation, why is it appropriate for us to evaluate Intuitive relative to peers who none of which back out stock comp?","Marshall Mohr","Sure, this isn\u2019t a new thing, we always wanted to look at it without stock comp, we\u2019ve previously provided you with a cash flow information that does include the impact of stock comp. I think in our particular stock \u2013 we\u2019re pretty disciplined about how we issue equity. We maintain specific guidelines and I think are well within the industry parameters, 30% dilution on an annual basis. What [ph] is the valuation \u2013 I think Blackstone\u2019s [ph] valuation has issues with it and one of those would be that it\u2019s heavily reliant on volatility and other factors that go into the consultation. With our stock being a little bit more volatile, we unfavorably compare it to \u2013 with some of the peers like Johnson & Johnson, and so we think it\u2019s better to look at us without it.","Gary Guthart","David, I think if you look broadly across larger cap, med-tech stock you\u2019ll see that we range in stock based comp as a percent of revenue around 7% to 8% whereas most of the other companies range around 1%.","David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley","But that\u2019s just my point, it\u2019s a form of compensation. So you need to be competitive against your peer group who are spending that compensation, you\u2019re trying not to. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking relative to your peer group call it sensible [ph]?","Gary Guthart","Short answer is we value equity, we understand completely dilution and we respect shareholders view of dilution. In terms of how our comp plans are absolutely built, we are building them so that we can be effectively for the talent that\u2019s required to build this company and that\u2019s relative to \u2013 sometimes med-tech but often our peer group is \u2013 in terms of talent is tech companies that share our location here in headquarters. And so, we\u2019re careful about dilution, we don\u2019t give it away without deep thought. It\u2019s not in terms of what the expenses are, they are not in any way hidden, they are absolutely available, and when Marshall talks about pro forma he is really pointing out the economic engine of the company. So we understand and appreciate your remarks, we absolutely understand and respect to need to treat equity carefully.","David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Let me just get a quick follow-up there, maybe to shift on the procedures because we\u2019re probably going to agree or disagree on the prior topic but as you move over to main procedures, you gave us some nice color, Patrick did on DDH, just as you think relatively \u2013 can you give us any sense sequentially \u2013 it sounds like hernia did obviously much better but specifically as raised quality \u2013 whether quality [ph] progress sequentially low that was faster growth, slower growth or relatively the same quarter-on-quarter? Thank you.","Gary Guthart","Generally the dynamics we described last quarter in quality really stated about the same in terms of \u2013 it continues to grow, we see a segment of the market that values it, both in terms of patients and in terms of the surgeons and institutions that are providing it. Directionally I think in terms of rates, it was more or less in line with where we were before, perhaps a slight slow in volume as growth.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take your next question in queue that will come from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan","Thanks. Given the strong placement number this quarter, I am just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how that flows through the revenues, particularly around the trade-in\u2019s, I had a number of people asked why it didn\u2019t show more revenue upside, given both strong procedures and the trade-in. So maybe just talk a little bit about that and how you think about trade-in to long two and the back half of the year? And then to follow-on, can you talk about the leasing option, you talked about the current percentage but what percentage of the potential systems are potentially open to operating leases?","Gary Guthart","With regards to the systems Tycho, the ASPs we report, the $1.5 million, they do reflect the contractual revenue related to the sales agreement. This quarter we did happen to have three systems that were shipped under operating lease arrangements where the system revenues will be recognized over future periods and there were also other sales involving financing terms where revenue will be deferred over future periods which again is offset by the upgrade portion within the system category. So I think it\u2019s \u2013 with this additional complexity it\u2019s not as simple as it was, just multiply the ASP, times of number of units and get the systems revenue but we are absolutely focused on finding the customer solutions and adding to the installed base.","Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan","And then on the clinical data site, can you talk \u2013 it seems like the clinical data might be little bit higher in Europe. Can you talk about whether you have the appropriate dataset today as you go out to further penetrate that market? And then is there any data on clinical efficacy or cost to support hernia at this point?","Gary Guthart","On the first question of what are the data requirements in Europe, in general I think they tend to ask for data in local countries and particularly around local economics and so on. And so, a lot of what the emphasis has been there has been making sure the datasets make sense in the country. We have good indications and good capability studies and lot of work from around the world so that can help guide us. But ultimately it requires engaging those markets directly and the surgical societies directly. So that\u2019s kind of \u2013 what the European picture looks like. One hernia, it\u2019s always in the experience, our hernia data will start to be collected and analyzed more broadly but as usual, in these kind of procedures the early upticks proceed the large studies.","Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan","Now lastly on SP, can you just give us a sense as to whether you finalized self standalone versus the caught on to Xi and any chance if the port size may come down from 25 millimeters initially?","Gary Guthart","Let\u2019s see, on the first one we are designing the product such that it can link up an existing Xi or you can configure it as a standalone, so it will be able to sell either as a standalone or as an option of into an Xi, that\u2019s our product plan. There is nothing fundamental in SP long-term that keeps us from changing port size. The initial design and the initial instrumentation are of particular size, the architecture is actually quite flexible.","Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question in queue will come from Tao Levy with Wedbush. Please go ahead.","Tao Levy \u2013 Wedbush","Hey, good afternoon.","Gary Guthart","Good afternoon.","Tao Levy \u2013 Wedbush","I wanted to ask about the U.S. procedure growth which you touched on and I\u2019m trying to figure out you don\u2019t work with the areas that kind of improved off in the quarter. I\u2019m surprised to hear you answer to one of the prior questions that coli [ph] rates maybe were a little bit lower than in the Q1. So I\u2019m just wondering where did the incremental improvement in the rates specifically come from.","Gary Guthart","Tao I think if you look through the comments we\u2019ve made, the stabilization in GYN and the improvement in Q2 is the largest factor between Q1 and Q2. But we think you should increasingly look at \u2013 particularly with all this being going on and the volatility around the elective benign procedures, look at the first half of the year in aggregate, when you think about those procedures, given everything has been going on around the macro landscape.","Tao Levy \u2013 Wedbush","Okay. And also the deferred revenue for the systems in the quarter \u2013 I think Marshall talked about how you were going to make some changes to that, maybe I missed it but what are some of the changes that you expect on that and why weren\u2019t sort of more systems that were deferred turned into revenue in the quarter?","Marshall Mohr","Effectively we deferred revenue associated with the number of systems we expected that would be traded back in, so there was an estimate involved there. So when I say that we would modify \u2013 I said we would modify that estimate as we go through time and in fact at the end of Q1 we\u2019ll get there, certain customers that we understand will not trade-in, so we reversed that the accrual for that. As far as why didn\u2019t more take us up on our own \u2013 remember right now the Xi isn\u2019t fully featured and there are other products that will go with it, that we\u2019re still working on getting ready to floor with [ph]. And we think that some customers may have hesitated for that reason but we\u2019ve extended these offers until September 30, so they have till September 30 for Xi.","Tao Levy \u2013 Wedbush","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And just lastly, any progress on ready update on the single-site, the articulated needle driver, if that\u2019s still kind of year-end potential approval?","Gary Guthart","So \u2013 a couple of things, I think from a product design and usability point of view in terms of internal testing, that\u2019s very, very good, so I\u2019m quite encouraged there. We\u2019re in the process with FDA, I think the process is following a routine kind of exchange and so it\u2019s always hard to predict what the final endpoint will be there but I don\u2019t see big barriers to completing that work.","Tao Levy \u2013 Wedbush","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Gary Guthart","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from Richard Newitter with Leerink. Please go ahead.","Richard Newitter \u2013 Leerink","Hi, thanks for taking the questions guys. I just \u2013 I wanted to ask a question, thanks for the color on some of the clinical advancements that you guys saw, you\u2019ve published or talked about this quarter. But I just was hoping to get a better idea of what and when we can expect perhaps a more definitive, either company sponsored or industry \u2013 not industry but surge and multi-center kind of definitive study analyzing things like colorectal experience using the robot versus the traditional laparoscopic surgery. I know there is a study ongoing called Roller [ph], is this something that should be viewed as a proxy and saying that could be more kind of catalytic for your adoption rates in colorectal? And if not, is there something else and is there anything that is Intuitive can do to help kind of create or generate this type of data?","Gary Guthart","Yes, a couple of things. I think it\u2019s really important to start with \u2013 understanding the concept that both clinical efficacy and value, economic value, have to be evaluated procedure-by-procedure across both, the population of patients and a population of surgeons. And so what that means is that looking for the one definitive study on dementia\u2019s [ph] is unlikely, you\u2019re going to have to take it, it\u2019s just not possible, you\u2019re going to have to take it case-by-case. As you look at case-by-case, there was actually quite a bit that has been done already and quite a bit that is in process, both company sponsored and sponsored by others. We pay attention to it, it\u2019s important, really the strong elements that must be present for us to tell anything. Take colorectal as an example. The majority of colorectal surgeries done are open, some are done lap, and now robotics is coming in. And so a good study, one that\u2019s going to look at that looks at all of the patient population that\u2019s being done open, the patient population that\u2019s minimal lap, patient population that can be done robotically, as well as the variance in certain skill from those who are skilled laparoscopically and those who are not. So those are broad suites. Some of the studies going on approach that but a lot of them look at subsets. And so the kinds of things that we\u2019re interested in making sure happen and support and ones that were broadly enough. I think it\u2019s a huge mistake as Patrick said in his remarks, to go look at it. Some population that is lap, some population of patients that [ph] and ignore a majority of population which is open. So the short answer to your question is, those things were developed in time, they go procedure-by-procedure, we ask our folks who are investigating to look broadly and compare against the majority modalities, some of which are sponsored by us, some of which are sponsored by government sponsorship or other approaches and they will develop in time and we\u2019ll share them with you as they come up.","Richard Newitter \u2013 Leerink","Great, thanks. And then maybe if I could just ask one other one \u2013 you called our hernia this quarter as obviously as a general surgery procedure category that\u2019s \u2013 maybe gaining accelerated attention and adoption. Can you give a little color on the types of hernia surgeons that are performing these procedures, mostly around the experience level? And then \u2013 are you getting kind of the sought leaders in the space who are kind of taking us on and we should potentially see kind of more talk at the podium from high level thought leaders about this procedure or is this kind of more \u2013 kind of \u2013 I don\u2019t know the right terminology but everyday surgeons, so to speak, in the hernia category.","Gary Guthart","Yes Rich, I think it\u2019s early and we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing. You\u2019re seeing about the mixed bag of procedures that are being done as well as the types of surgeons and who is adopting. So it\u2019s early for us to try to pitching it into any given sub-segment yet but we plan to look closely at it and report on it moving forward. Thanks.","Richard Newitter \u2013 Leerink","Thanks.","Gary Guthart","Thank you very much. That was our last question. As we have said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits, and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. The following are two responses to our new Xi surgical system from experienced customers.","From one of the most experienced robotic urologist, these are the best robot today, vision is nicer and clear, I can see structures very, very nicely. And from the patient side surgical assistant, docking process is easier and more efficient. Our second case was doc faster than our typical Si dockings, and we have done hundreds of those. We did not have a single external collision and there were almost no adjustments necessary. Usually on a bariatric procedure I\u2019m adjusting the camera and instrument times frequently, but with the Xi it was not necessary.","We believe we have a unique opportunity to improve surgery. The quotes above speak to the care and diligence of our design, operations, training and field teams in meeting our customers\u2019 needs. This concludes today\u2019s call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery. And we look forward to talking with you again in three months.","Operator","Thank you very much.

And as a reminder today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Senior Director of Finance and Investor Relations, Calvin Darling. Please go ahead.","Calvin Darling","Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's first quarter earnings conference call. With me today we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO, and Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer.

Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.","Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website.","Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Marshall will provide a review of first quarter financial results, and I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2018; and finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.","With that, I'll turn it over to Gary.","Gary Guthart","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on the call today. Intuitive is dedicated to the mission of improving the availability and quality of minimally invasive surgery. We had a strong first quarter in pursuit of our mission with customer use of our systems at the top of our growth range, continued momentum in new system placements, and stepwise progress in the development of markets outside the United States. While we're pleased with our performance in the quarter the opportunity for improvement in surgery is substantial and much work remains to be done. ","Global procedure growth was approximately 15% in the first quarter of 2018. Underpinning this growth was increased use of da Vinci in general surgery in the United States, continued growth in urology in Europe and Asia, and multispecialty growth in China. General surgery growth was led by hernia repair and colon resection. Mature procedures in the United States including prostatectomy and hysterectomy for malignant conditions grew above expected rates again in the quarter. European procedure growth was mixed by country partially as a result of headwinds in the number of business days relative to Q1, 2017. ","Lastly, additional procedures were granted reimbursement by the Ministry of Health in Japan effective April 1, 2018 at reimbursement rates equivalent to laparoscopy. Calvin will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. ","Our capital placement performance in the first quarter of 2018 accelerated relative to 2017 with growth in total placements rising 39% from 133 to 185. Net of trade-ins and retirements our da Vinci installed base grew by 13% over Q1 2017 from approximately 4,023 to approximately 4,528. Placement performance was strong globally particularly in the United States. Capital placements have been lumpy and we anticipate volatility in placements for the remainder of 2018. ","Turning to operations. Our performance in the first quarter met our expectations with good performance in product quality and cost reductions while average selling prices were stable. Investments to deepen our regional capabilities and to develop new technologies and services continued to be important in the first quarter. They will be so for the next several quarters as we progress through the launch of several products and build the capability country-by-country. We are also investing to strengthen our corporate infrastructure and position us to benefit from increased scale. ","Highlights of our first quarter operating results are as follows. Procedures grew approximately 15% over the first quarter of last year, replaced 185 da Vinci surgical systems, up from a 133 in the first quarter of 2017. Our installed base grew 13% from a year ago. Revenue for the quarter was $848 million up 25%. Pro forma gross profit margin was 71.6% compared to 72% in the first quarter of last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $460 million, up 21%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $623 million, representing 73% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $346 million in the quarter, up 30% from the first quarter of last year and pro forma net income was $288 million up 46%. Marshall will take you through our finances in greater detail shortly. ","Our da Vinci Xi surgical system is our most capable multiport platform. We added our da Vinci X surgical system in 2017 which offers fourth generation imaging, robotics, and instrumentation for focused quadrant surgeries at an attractive value. The da Vinci X surgical systems received regulatory clearance by PMDA in Japan this month and was showcased at a large surgical society meeting JSS shortly thereafter. Combined with reimbursement approvals mentioned above, we're pleased with recent progress in Japan. As we've discussed on prior calls, we plan to expand our Gen 4 family with a new capability in the form of da Vinci SP. We submitted our 510 (k) for current SP design in Q4 of '17 and have received questions back from FDA. We're preparing our response and overall SP is progressing to plan with a phased launch anticipated in 2018. ","Also, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we submitted our 510 (k) application for our 60-millimeter surgical stapler for Gen 4 systems. We've received the first round of questions from FDA and are in the process of responding to their requests. Our Gen 4 systems have received growing use by surgeons globally and by general surgeons in particular. Including the 60-millimeter stapler, we're hard at work completing our advanced instrument offerings. We continue to make progress on our flexible robotics platform first targeted to address the acute need in diagnosis of lung cancer, one of the most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer in the world and for which early detection is important. Feedback from physicians evaluating our technology relative to existing and recently announced alternatives has been strongly supportive of our efforts. Our design and operations teams are working to incorporate their feedback, complete its production design and supply chain optimization, and complete validations for regulatory submissions. We anticipate our 510 (k) submission in 2018 and we have initiated the build of our commercial team, an outstanding and focused team of professionals. I believe the opportunity for innovation in support of physicians in the flexible interventional space is substantial. That said, adoption will require clinical and economic validation given the availability of multiple competing approaches in the market. ","Lastly, our imaging teams continue to develop new ways to identify tissue including progress in our molecular imaging program as well as improvements for our endoscopes and image processing algorithms. We have been introducing improvements in our imaging hardware routinely and expect to continue to do so in the remainder of 2018. We expect our lead molecular agent to enter phase 2 trials in the second half of the year. ","Stepping back and looking at the broader marketplace, our team\u2019s experience in robot-assisted surgery started decades ago at research groups predating the formation of the company. Over this period, the rise of mechatronics, powerful computing, improved sensing, microfabrication and molecular imaging has enabled new approaches to old problems. Intuitive has been investing in innovation both incremental and revolutionary with this in mind since our inception and with increased intensity for the past several years. This opportunity to improve surgery using advanced technologies is now being recognized broadly particularly in the past several years and we anticipate the entry of additional systems by competitors into some regions of the world over the next several quarters. ","To help our customers, Intuitive products and services are organized in generational families. Shared design principles, operating methods, user interfaces and product training allow surgical teams and hospitals to more quickly integrate new technologies and can deliver a significantly improved framework to training environments. ","As consolidation has progressed in health systems, standardization across surgical platforms can decrease variability and inefficiency from residency and fellowship programs to academic and community settings. Our fourth generation of surgical platforms offer our customers a fully enabled ecosystem of products and services in support of their programs.","In closing, during 2018, our focus remains in completing the task we\u2019ve set for ourselves. First, continued adoption of da Vinci in general surgery. Second, continued development of European markets and access to customers in Asia. Third, advancing our new platforms, imaging, advanced instruments, da Vinci SP and our flexible catheter platform. And finally, support for additional clinical and economic validation by global region.","I will now turn the call over to Marshall, who will review financial highlights.","Marshall Mohr","Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a GAAP and non-GAAP or pro forma basis. Our results are also posted on our website.","First quarter 2018 revenue of $848 million grew 25% compared with first quarter 2017 revenue of $680 million and decreased 5% compared with seasonally stronger fourth quarter revenue of $892 million. ","In the first quarter of 2017 we deferred approximately $23 million of revenue associated with the da Vinci X tradeoff program that we offered certain first quarter customers. This revenue and related costs are recognized in the third and fourth quarters of 2017. Our comparison to 2017 results reflects a deferral as recorded. ","We also have adopted the new revenue standard as required under GAAP and retroactively restated prior period results. We have updated the supplementary financial tables posted on our website to reflect this restatement. ","The adoption of the revenue standard had the effective increasing first quarter 2017 total revenue by approximately $5 million and net income by approximately $1 million. The impact on the annual results for 2017 was insignificant increasing total 2017 revenue by approximately $9 million and increasing net income by $11 million. ","Revenue also benefited by approximately 2.5 percentage points from a weaker dollar. Excluding the impact of the revenue deferral and currency changes, revenue grew 18% relative to the restated 2017 first quarter.","First quarter 2018 procedures increased approximately 15% compared with first quarter of 2017 in reflect with last quarter. Procedure growth continues to be driven by general surgery in the US and neurology worldwide. Calvin will review details of procedure growth later in this call.","Instrument and accessory revenue of $460 million increased 21% compared with last year which is higher than procedure growth primarily reflecting increased usage of our advanced instruments and customer buying patterns. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure was approximately $1,930, an increase of 5% compared with last year primarily reflecting advanced instrument usage, customer buying patterns and the impact of a weaker US dollar.","Systems revenue of $235 million increased 46% compared with the first quarter of 2017 primarily reflecting higher system placements, the revenue deferral of $23 million in the first quarter of 2017 and a weaker US dollar particularly offset -- partially offset by an increase in the number of operating leases. We placed 185 systems in the first quarter of 2018 compared with 133 systems in the first quarter of 2017 in 216 systems last quarter. ","43 operating lease transactions representing 23% of total placements were completed in the current quarter, compared with 16% of total placements in the first quarter of 2017, and 19% last quarter. While the number of leases is difficult to predict in the short term we expect the proportion of these types of arrangements to increase long-term. 31% of the current quarter system placements involve trade-ins reflecting customer desire to access or standardize on our four-generation technology. This is an increase in the proportion of trade-ins compared to 21% in the first quarter 2017 and 26% last quarter. However, trade-in activity is lumpy and difficult to predict. 76% of systems placed in the quarter were da Vinci Xi\u2019s, and 16% were da Vinci X systems, compared with 67% da Vinci Xis and 24% da Vinci Xs last quarter.","Our install base of da Vinci systems ended the quarter at 4,528 systems up 13% year-over-year and average system utilization grew in the low single digit range. Globally, our average selling price, which excludes the impact of operating leases, lease buyouts and revenue deferrals was approximately 1.49 million which is slightly higher than the 1.47 million in the fourth quarter. The increase reflects a higher mix of Xi systems, a weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by geographic mix. ","Outside of the U.S. results were as follows. First quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of 275 million increase 49% compared with the first quarter of 2017 and increased 11% compared with last quarter. The increase compared to the prior year reflects increased systems revenue of 55 million or nearly 100% growth and increased instruments and accessories revenue of 30 million or 32% growth. Systems revenue was driven by an increase in the number of systems placed, a lower number of operating leases, favorable product and geography mix and a weaker dollar. Instrument and accessory revenue was primarily driven by procedure growth, a weaker dollar and customer buying patterns.","OUS procedures grew approximately 18% compared with the first quarter of 2017, OUS procedures were somewhat negatively impacted by the timing of holidays in 2018 compared to 2017. Outside of U.S. we placed 73 systems in the first quarter, compared with 56 in the first quarter of 2017 and 86 in a seasonally strong fourth quarter. Current quarter system placements included 45 in the Europe, nine in Japan, 63% of the systems placed for da Vinci Xi\u2019s compared with 54% in the first quarter of 2017 and 48% last quarter. Placements outside the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of the OUS markets are in early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles and vacation patterns and sales in some markets are constrained by government regulations. ","Moving onto the remainder of the P&L, the pro forma gross margin for the first quarter was 71.6% compared with 72% for the first quarter of 2017 and 72.4% last quarter. The decrease relative to the fourth quarter primarily reflects higher fixed cost over the lower volumes. The decrease compared with the prior year primarily reflects product mix. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products mix of systems and accessory revenue. System ASPs and our ability to further reduce product and improved manufacturing efficiency. ","Pro forma operating expenses increased 17% compared with the first quarter of 2017 and reflect compared to the last quarter. Our spending is consistent with our plan reflecting investments in da Vinci SP, catheter-based robotics, image and advanced instrumentation and expansion of our OUS markets. These investments involved multi-year commitments. ","Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 20.1% compared with our expectations of 20% to 22%. Our tax rates will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of onetime items. ","Our first quarter 2018, pro forma net income was $288 million or $2.44 per share compared with $197 million or $1.71 per share for the first quarter of 2017 and $305 million or $2.60 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017. First quarter 2017 GAAP to pro forma net income per diluted share excluding $0.09 per share from the deferral of $23 million of revenue net of cost and income tax. ","I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $288 million or $2.44 per share for the first quarter of 2018 compared with GAAP net income of $181 million or $1.57 per share for the first quarter of 2017 and a GAAP net loss of $32 million or $0.28 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified in our website. It includes fourth quarter charges related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee equity and IT charges and legal settlements. Note that the IRS has not issued final regulations associated with the recent U.S. Tax Legislation. Therefore, impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reflected in our fourth and first quarter results and our projection of future tax rates represent our best estimates of the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and could change as the tax regulations are finalized and further interpreted. ","We ended the quarter with cash in investments of $4.1 billion compared with $3.8 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase reflects cash generated from operations of $280 million. We have not repurchased any shares in the quarter and have approximately $718 million remaining under board buyback authorization. ","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Calvin who will go over procedure performance and our outlook for 2018. ","Calvin Darling","Thank you, Marshall. Our overall first quarter procedure growth was 15% compared to 18% during the first quarter of 2017 and 17% last quarter. Our year-over-year Q1 procedure growth was driven by 14% growth in U.S. procedures and 18% growth in OUS markets. In the U.S., overall, Q1 procedure performance by specialty closely aligned with patterns present in 2017. ","In U.S. general surgery, first quarter 2018 growth was consistent with 2017. Q1 growth was again driven by hernia repair which continues to provide the most incremental cases and continued da Vinci adoption in colorectal procedures. Early stage adoption in bariatric procedures and growth across the breadth of the general surgery category also contributed to growth. ","In U.S. gynecology, first quarter 2018 growth was consistent with 2017 trends as procedures grew modestly year-over-year with growth led by hysterectomy. We believe gynecologic procedure consolidation continues to drive modest growth as an increasing proportion of US gynecology procedures are being performed by physicians that specialize in complex, benign and cancer surgery who tend to be uses of da Vinci systems. ","Q1 US urology procedures had growth rates consistent with 2017 driven by prostatectomy volumes. As a mature procedure category, we believe that our US prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market, which has benefited from recent macro trends. ","In other US procedures, adoption of lobectomies and other thoracic procedures was again solid during the first quarter. Utilization of our da Vinci XI systems and surgical staplers which helped to optimize robotics thoracic procedures has been increasing.","First quarter OUS procedure volume grew approximately 18% compared with 23% for the full year of 2017. First quarter 2018 OUS procedure growth was driven by continued growth in DVP procedures and earlier stage growth in kidney cancer procedures, general surgery and gynecology.","The Q1 2018 OUS procedure growth rate was lower than the previous year, in part due to fewer operating days in Q1 2018 from the timing of holidays including Easter. ","Procedure growth in China moderated meaningfully in the quarter in part because of da Vinci system capacity expansion is constrained by the system quota requirements, the most recent of which expired at the end of 2015. We believe core demand for robotic surgery in China is meaningful. ","In Japan, Q1 procedure growth and prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy moderated as these procedures have achieved high levels of adoption. As Gary indicated, effective April 1, 2018 12 additional procedures have been approved for reimbursement in Japan with reimbursements equivalent to laparoscopic surgery.","The applicable opportunity for da Vinci adoption within the set of procedures is difficult to estimate at this time due to the uncertainty of the perceived value of da Vinci relative to alternative surgical approaches. ","With nearly 300 systems installed in Japan, the level and pace of system expansion in Japan over the year is difficult to predict but it will likely be modest. ","Last week, we participated in the Annual Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons or SAGES Meeting in Seattle. General surgery is our largest and fastest growing specialty surgical specialty in the US and this event represents one of the largest gatherings of general surgery practitioners and thought leaders. ","As more general surgeons adopt robotics in their practices, at this year\u2019s conference we continue to see increased numbers of robotic surgery presentations, clinical papers and podium speakers. Included in the clinical data presented at SAGES, the results of a study recently accepted for publication in their Hernia Journal titled Open Versus Robotic-Assisted Transabdominal Preperitoneal Inguinal Hernia Repair, a multi-centered match analysis of clinical outcomes. Data from this study was presented by lead author, Dr. Reza Gamagami from New Lenox, Illinois. This study is one of the largest multi-centered valuations of outcomes associated with robotic assisted inguinal hernia repair cases compared to more experienced open cases from the same surgeons. ","In the MAST analysis of 444 subjects in each cohort, robotic assisted inguinal hernia repair cases demonstrated statistically significant lower post discharge complication rates through 30 days with no re-operations related to the inguinal repair. ","A multi-varied analysis showed the open repair approach as a risk factor for complications within 30 days of the inguinal repair procedure. This study confirmed a robotic assisted approach to inguinal hernia repair may provide patients with the benefits of minimally invasive surgery with the authors who had variable laparoscopic experience among them, concluding that the robotic assisted repair approach is a promising and reproducible approach which may facilitate the adoption of MIS repairs of inguinal hernia. The study adds to the growing body of evidence demonstrating comparable or improved outcomes for subjects undergoing a robotic assisted inguinal hernia repair, independent of a surgeon\u2019s laparoscopic experience.","I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2018. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecast full year 2018 procedure growth within a range of 11% to 15%. We are now refining the range and estimate full year 2018 procedure growth of 12% to 15%. With respect to revenue as we have mentioned previously capital placements are ultimately driven by procedure growth catalyzing hospitals to establish or expand robotic system capacity. Capital placements can vary substantially from period to period based upon many factors, including U.S. healthcare policy, hospital capital spending cycles, reimbursement and government quotas, product cycles and competitive factors. We had strong first-quarter capital placements driven by customer capacity expansion and bolstered by a higher volume of capital upgrade transactions involving trade-ins of older da Vinci models in the recent quarters. In addition, as anticipated a higher proportion of Q1 system placements were under operating lease terms, 23%. This proportion may fluctuate some in the near term but may trend further upwards in the long-term.","Turning to gross profit. We continue to expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71.5% of net revenue. This is modestly lower than our Q1 result of 71.6%, primarily reflecting higher costs associated with new products we expect to introduce later in the year. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on products and regional mix. ","Turning to operating expenses. We continue to expect to grow pro forma 2018 operating expenses between 16% and 18% above 2017 levels, as we follow through on investments in several strategic areas intended to benefit the company over the long-term. We expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between 245 million and 255 million in 2018 compared to 225 million to 235 million forecasts on our last call. We expect other income which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between 55 million and 60 million in 2018, up from 45 million to 55 million forecasts on our last call.","With regard to income tax, on our last call we forecast our 2018 pro forma income tax rate to be between 20% and 22% of pretax income. We are now refining our estimates to the lower half of the range between 20% and 21% of pretax income. Note that in the future if the IRS issues additional guidance and interpretations of the new tax law our estimated rate may be impacted. That concludes our prepared comments, we\u2019ll now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Lewis","Gary a couple strategic questions for you. The first is on leasing. So, there is more operating leases in the last two quarters than the prior four quarters. And it feels like the 23% number is frankly going higher. So, it's starting to feel this is much more company driven than customer driven, and so the question is really to what extent does leases make a lot more sense as competitors are coming to market sort of in what way can leasing be very powerful defense?","Gary Guthart","Yeah, well first thank you. I think to the extent that we can help customers access robotics for their programs and do it in a way that fits their needs, we're happy to do it with leasing. I don't think it's a massive strategic change one way or another, viz-a-vis competition. From our point of view, we're confident in our products, we understand and are confident in the value they bring. If we can be flexible with customers and allow them to get access to the products they need when they need it, we can make it a little easier for them to do it sooner rather than later in terms of their finances, that helps us and we're willing. ","I think over time; our customers are going to evaluate competitive systems. They're going to go look at them. And if somebody brings out a product that meets their needs better, I don't know that leasing one way or the other is going to make a difference. For us, it really is kind of a first principles thing. Do you believe in robotic surgery as a way to increase the availability and quality of minimally invasive surgery if you do and you're committed to it and we can find the way that help you get a system, and then we're happy to do it? ","David Lewis","Okay. And then curious, a question on flexible catheter system as well. So, based on your timeline, I'm kind of assuming you're 9 months behind a recent competitive launch. So, I just wonder how concerned you about this window are, and you talked a lot about the ecosystem both at SAGES and again in this call. In what ways can sort of the multi-system ecosystem approach be sort of a barrier to entry for new robotic entrants in this segment?","Gary Guthart","Yeah, I think in terms of any of the systems that we're going to place or somebody else places, I think the robot itself or the product itself is just the first step. You have to provide the robot, but you also need the instruments and accessories. You need to be able to help do product training, you need to build proctoring networks. You want to be able to help your customer do benchmarking and analytic analysis of usage patterns relative to what the rest of the world is doing. ","And so, I think they expect support beyond the dropping off of a system at the backdoor. And we have built that over years, we have come to understand it deeply and I think it is valuable to our customer. And I think that helps us, I think other companies have various degrees of enablement in that space. ","With regard to flex catheter in particular, we have been investing in it as you know for years and years. This has been a long-term investment. We have built technologies and made decisions about our architectures based on first principles not by looking over our shoulder at what other people are doing, but by really engaging customers deeply and understanding their clinical needs. That has driven us, continues to drive us. We have connections into the customer base because of those first principle investigations, and those folks visit us. They look at our technologies, they visit others and look at technologies on the market or soon to be on the market and they make decisions. We're going to make decisions based on clinical value and demonstrable outcomes. You\u2019ve seen the early parts of that with regard to the publications at CHEST. I think there are advantages for people who are first movers, but I think they're short lived, I think that in this space because there are a lot of alternatives in the marketplace and because it\u2019s going to be a market that\u2019s driven by clinical data over time, the best solutions are going to win and I am confident in our technology and even more confident in our team.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bob Hopkins","Great. Thanks for taking the question and good afternoon. So, as I looked at your print, obviously there\u2019s lots of big impressive numbers in this first quarter report, but one that really caught my eye was the system sales number. And I know historically that\u2019s primarily driven by procedure volumes and procedure volumes have been very strong. But I was wondering given this was really the best growth I think you\u2019ve seen in system placements since 2010, was there anything in particular that drove the strength this quarter. Just wondering if you could sort of tease that a little bit more what happened in systems placements this quarter. Thank you. ","Gary Guthart","Bob, you are absolutely right, systems placements are driven primarily by procedure growth and you have to look at it over a period of time because systems can be lumpy in any particular quarter. So, if you look at 2017, the installed base grew 13% and procedures grew 16%. So those procedures that were really driving that installed base growth. This quarter we had a little bit higher proportion of trade outs. That reflects I think as I said in my script, customers wanting to avail themselves to fourth generation capabilities. And we also saw high sales of Xi validating that that system has features that really are driving adoption. So, I think it\u2019s lumpy. I think it\u2019s hard to make conclusions based on one quarter of increased trade-in volume and I just would be cautious there and we expect to see some volatility. But overall over a longer period time of time systems will follow procedure growth.","Bob Hopkins","Great. Thank you for that. And then I want to follow up also on one more question on flex catheter, just curious what\u2019s left to do before you file with the FDA? And just maybe thinking a little bit longer term, but when do you think we might start to hear a little bit more about other potential indications for flex catheter beyond lung?","Gary Guthart","Sure. For now, as we said in earlier in the script the teams are doing the product validations, they are doing the testing that supports our submissions. And we are stabilizing the supply chain and that\u2019s important when we launch we want to feel good about our ability to make the products, and our sub suppliers\u2019 ability to make their parts. We are progressing. I think the team is doing a very good job. So, there we are progressing against our plan. ","For starters, as I said I think in the past, I am excited the flex catheter technology because I think it\u2019s a platform and we will have other opportunities outside of the lung. Where we are today is focused on bringing this first product to market and satisfying the needs of the interventional pulmonologists and thoracic surgeons. I think that is a major opportunity. I think perfecting the clinical pathways, the use of the product and data generation is important for us to focus on. And so, our organization is tightly focused on that mission now.","Bob Hopkins","Perfect. And then is there any update on China at all or?","Gary Guthart","Marshall might speak to kind of where -- I think you\u2019re implying the quota but Marsh you speak to that.","Marshall Mohr","We really don\u2019t have much of an update on the quota, we still sit here awaiting the finalization of that quota, again just to give you the background of the quota, really applies to the years 2016 through 2020, its part of the five year planning budgeting process that the Chinese government goes through, Central government has finalized the budget but has not yet done its -- completed its negotiations with provinces, and hospitals about who will get how many systems and so we wait.","Gary Guthart","I think in general what's going on there doesn't appear to be Intuitive specific, I think it\u2019s more rolling through the centralized government processes, we think that the core interest by Chinese customers in our products and the company and robotic surgery more broadly is strong and we feel slight forward progress in terms of the way the process has been moving. We just can't call what the timelines are, and so we\u2019re at the limits of our ability to influence that outcome.","Operator","Next question will come from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Larry Biegelsen","It looks like you guys had 99%, almost 100% increase in the international system revenue but about a 30% increase in the year-over-year system shipped, Marshal what drove the difference in those growth rates?","Gary Guthart","So, a couple of things that I pointed out, one was that in 2017 we had six leases, in 2018 we have one, obviously when you have an operating -- and these operating leases, operating leases you don't have revenue, so, some of that is attributable to it. Also had a foreign exchange or currency exchange that was a -- when they're back here as the U.S. dollar has weakened over the year, and we also had a favorable mix of product. As I said, in my script, we had a high mix of Xi around the world that also included OUS, and we also had a favorable geographic mix. If you noticed there was substantive sales in to Europe and again these are lumpy so you can\u2019t take one geography and extrapolate that forward, but in Europe we did well. We did a little bit lower sales relative to the prior year and some of our distribution markets where we sell at a lower price. So, you just put all those factors together and it adds up to increasing revenue to the extent that it did. ","Larry Biegelsen","And then for my follow-up we've been increasingly hearing that India did present itself as a large opportunity, potentially even becoming the number one international market. Could you talk a little bit about how you see that market developing this year and over the next few years?","Gary Guthart","We\u2019re optimistic that India will represent a good market long term but I think in the short term to think that it\u2019s going to snap to our second largest market, our first largest market is not happen. We have a distributor there, we've been working with for years, we've made -- I think we have around 40, 50 systems installed in India, the total -- but the total number of procedures that they generate is maybe 1% of our total revenue -- of our total procedures. So, it is not consequential yet. We are making investments in it, we do think it\u2019s -- again long-term that it\u2019s a viable market and a good one for us, but we\u2019re at the very, very, very early stages.","Marshall Mohr","We\u2019re are actually at 68 systems in India currently.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tycho Peterson","Maybe first question on emerging procedures. Bariatric got a little bit more attention at stages this year and Calvin you called that out in your comments. I know you're in the process of getting back to FDA with the questions on the Stapler. But Gary, can you maybe just talk a little bit how you think about this market evolving and how much market development you guys need to put behind once you get Stapler out?","Gary Guthart","It's going to be an interesting one to see evolve. I think it's early for us to put much commentary on it. We see interest by surgeons, having said that, it's a highly penetrated procedure with laparoscopy. And there are a lot of highly skilled laparoscopists in that market. And in that sense, it's stands in contrast to prostatectomy or hysterectomy for malonic conditions which were predominantly open procedures. So, we see some core demand and interest. Certainly, we want to complete the product offering in the Stapler. I think the real question there of where it could go overtime, I'd like to answer in future calls as we get a few quarters underneath the belt. ","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then thinking a little bit about Japan with reimbursement coming out at peri and lap. Does that change your view on the adoption curve at all? And are there steps you can take to try to increase these codes [ph] overtime and presumably that will require additional studies?","Gary Guthart","Yeah, I think that in general I think reimbursement decision is a positive for us. It's not an alloyed [ph] positive. I think that it will concentrate adoption into the bigger centers, that's okay. I think we're in a position to support that and we will do so. We all make investments for data collection in Japan. And the use of that data collection will be certainly something we can have to share with surgical societies and with the government as time goes on and to the extent that we show additional value and I think it's something that the government will consider for future reimbursements. I wouldn't ink anything on your calendars yet as to changes in reimbursement from this space. Although I think that there is some water to go under the bridge here. I think the interest -- having just been in Japan I think the interest is high. I think surgical society is seeing it as a positive step and endorsement by the government. I think that the economics in the right centers will work well for them. And it's an exciting for us and our team in Japan. And I'm looking forward to seeing them have a chance to broaden their base of business and get to know more customers. ","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then lastly on SP. Are you willing to comment, were there any surprises with FDA questions from your perspective? And then as we think about the rollout obviously you've talked about the three initial application areas. It seems like there is already some interest in other use cases. So, I'm just curious about how much pent up demand do you think there is out there today?","Gary Guthart","Yeah in terms of the nature of the questions that came back, I think it's within the kinds of conversations we've had with FDA over the years. And so, I think our teams are working on it. I don't see commentary that I would signal to you one way or another either particularly small questions or particularly big ones, I think it's right down the middle. ","With regard to potential applications overtime. I think general interest in SP is high, which is exciting to me. And I think one of things that made us excited to invest in the first place is that it allows an approach to entry into the body that's little more flexible than multi-port approaches. And I think that will open some opportunities in the future for surgeons who are looking for alternatives. ","Of course, that takes time. I will have to do protocol developments and data collection to get additional clearances as needed. But it was not unanticipated, that was part of what we had thought in terms of investing in the platform. This year will be a limited launch as we build volume and as we start to do things like enabling the proctor network and pursuing the sequential indications that we\u2019ve talked about. So far so good, I think the team is on plan. I think the clinical response we\u2019ve been getting from surgeons who are evaluating the data and looking at that base that looks really good.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Hazan with Citi. Please go ahead.","Amit Hazan","Good afternoon, guys. I just had a couple of guidance questions and then one other for Gary. First on the procedure guidance. Just trying to understand the changes that you moved the numbers modestly but not too much that it was the toughest comp you had all year but at the nice 15% right at the top of your prior guide. Your installed base growth is still at 13% year holding really nicely. Just trying to understand what you are thinking about at the midpoint and low end of guidance now, it is OUS returning to 20% that growth or what else should we be thinking about both the low to mid-end procedure guidance?","Marshall Mohr","Yes, the elimination of the low end of the range or flex our Q1 performance including the continued growth in general surgery, colorectal US kind of on pace with the trends we saw in 2017. We also benefited from growth in -- and again mature gynecology, urology procedures. Our current guidance assumption is at the low end on the US side, probably in gynecology shifting over to low single-digit decline which we think is aligned with the overall benign hysterectomy market moving to low single-digit, neurology growth and then some moderation within general surgery mostly reflecting lot of big numbers with some modest contributions in thoracic, pediatrics and other earlier safe procedures. ","We -- OUS no system quota in China to the extent it\u2019s going to add capacity and it\u2019s kind of a slower ramp in Japan with the new procedure set. On the high end they are still maintaining the trends in gynecology with low single-digit growth. Urology maybe some just minor moderation there to mid-single-digits growth and very slight moderation in US general surgery and continued nice trends in pediatrics and the emerging procedures. We do expect some moderation in China but probably less so at the high end of the range. ","Amit Hazan","And then kind of burning a question here that in a while for Gary, I just wanted to ask, give the success you\u2019ve been experiencing, what\u2019s the biggest risk you see for the Intuitive story today?","Gary Guthart","I guess I will start with -- I think the opportunity for the use of advanced technologies to help surgery is really substantial and there are both a lot of interesting scientific advances in the space we are in and there is a lot of need. I think there\u2019s always there\u2019s kind of two or three risks for an organization like ours I think has to manage. One of them is I think the day-to-day operations that are required to supply your customers can keep you from making the launch of investments to need to keep advancing the yard. And so, we manage that firmly. But I think that you need to do both and I think we\u2019ll have missed a serious opportunity if the systems that are enrolled, a decade from now look like today, so I think that there\u2019s real opportunity for advancement, so that\u2019s one. ","I think the second thing that\u2019s just vital is that these things are complex technologies, they absolutely require outstanding human beings, and human capital and they need to be brought into a company that has a culture of satisfying the customer and performance and so I think washing out a culture with growth can be something that is a problem and we need to attend to it. ","And I think the last thing is that healthcare is local, I think that when we want to make progress outside of the United States, it takes a deep understanding of the countries that we\u2019re working in and real skill and capability there. The metal may look the same but the healthcare system in the way it values products differs and I think that being too shallow in those assessments can meet risk in underperformance and if we underperform than others will satisfy the need. So those are kind of the victory for me.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Richard Newitter","I just wanted to clarify, on the comments with respect to guidance, and how China fits in, I think Calvin you said China utilization or growth slowed in 1Q as you had called out previously, if that -- if the current level of China growth would hold or persist for the rest of the year, is there still a way for you to get to the upper end of your guidance assuming no quota, in other words, how dependent on China with where your run rate is now with your latest data point to hit the upper end of your guidance?","Gary Guthart","No, I think it\u2019d be possible, again I think we are calling for some moderation in China and just order of magnitude right, the U.S. business, general surgeries are largest category in the U.S. gynecology is the large set of procedures and that mature category is urology, so I think those just have larger basis of business that kind of things impact and then we\u2019re going to have a bigger impact at least on this year in terms of the growth rates.","Richard Newitter","And maybe just one follow-up on an earlier question on bariatric, one of the things that we continue to see in this market is the adoption of Sleeve gastrectomy, at the expense of gastric bypass, and I was just wondering are you guys feeling like the application of robot has a bigger appeal or a bigger unmet need in either one of those two and can succeed if the world goes the way of sleeve gastrectomy?","Gary Guthart","I understand the question right the difference in suturing is a lot in terms of the amount of suturing between those two. I think it\u2019s too soon to tell right now what kind of the value statements are going to be in bariatric surgery over time, so like I said I think there\u2019s some core interest here, the procedures are taxing on surgeons, they\u2019re demanding procedure, and there are differences between those two techniques, I think stay tuned is really the short answer here, we will let it play out over the next few quarters and report back. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead. ","Rick Wise","Good afternoon, Gary. And thanks for the awesome quarter. Just two questions from me. Maybe just a little more color for hernia adoption, for hernia outlook. Obviously continues to go great. Just curious from your perspective, what aiming do you think we are in terms of robotic adoption. How sustainable is this kind of growth you're seeing over the next few years? And maybe a little color on, I assume largely driven by incisional at this point, or is the inguinal catching up. Can you just help us reflect on the drivers as you looked out over the next few years?","Gary Guthart","Sure. This is Gary. I think we're still in the early part of the game, I don't know exactly what inning and whether there'll be extra innings or not. But it we're not in the first innings, it's now becoming evaluated fairly broadly. Inguinal has been the primary driver in the hernia space to date. We think incisional hernias are also an opportunity and that may rise in the future relative to inguinal. So far so good. We look at of course clinical publications and presentations and value statements as reported by clinicians. We also look at reorder patterns and use, are they trialing or are they sticking with it. And so far, the performance in terms of ongoing use and sticking, stickiness, sticking with the procedure once they've tried it is quite good in inguinal hernia repair and that's a good sign for us. So, we think we bring real value here. And customers came to report back as much. We look forward to the next several quarters. ","Rick Wise","Yeah. And just last for me Gary, you have been kind enough in the past to be I think very frank and direct about the looming competition. And just I'll be curious to hear your latest thoughts. The two larger companies since we last spoke in this kind of context. One of the competitors seems to be delayed. You now have a smaller competitor approved in U.S. and in Europe. Just curious how all this is changing reflecting the market or selling discussions. Is it slowing down or it is a positive they're slow down. Again, any updated perspective will be very welcome. Thanks again. ","Gary Guthart","Yeah, as we said before, I think that need is clear. And I think that the opportunity afforded by the kind of the core technologies that are available are also clear now have become clear. I think customers are always interested in choice. We can provide them choice within our ecosystem, but they'll look for choice outside that ecosystem also. And I anticipate it, in my response customers when they ask is they should evaluate the alternatives. I guess what I would say is the hardest thing to compete with is the power points that don't yet exist in a product and the concepts that can't really be evaluated. ","I think in general, the existence of competition validates the space. I think that it signals to surgical societies the broader acceptance of the concept itself I think that's generally positive. I think these organizations out there that are large and small all of that staffed by capable people. And I think that they're going to work hard and look at alternatives. And to the extent that they come up with some really strong ones. I think that will change what\u2019s happening at our customer base but so far so good. ","I haven\u2019t seen product concepts so far that Intuitive hasn\u2019t either considered and built or considered and consciously passed on. It doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not wrong, we could be. But I feel like we have a good team. I think our team thinks about the problems holistically and from the customers\u2019 perspective. And if we continue to do that, I think we will be well positioned vis-\u00e0-vis competition. ","Operator","And last question will come from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Isaac Ro","Thanks. Good afternoon. I appreciate that. So quick follow up on the outlook in Asia specifically Japan and China. So, in Japan, are you expecting any meaningfully uptick in systems placements with a new reimbursement in place? And the reason for asking is it seems that you had a fair amount of what I would call idle capacity for existing placements prior to the updated reimbursement. So, I am wondering if you'd help us map back what the new reimbursement means to incremental system demand.","Gary Guthart","Yes, I mean, we mentioned in our comments, Isaac. We are expecting it will probably modest. We have got nearly 300 systems in Japan currently. And so, I think there\u2019s a lot of capacity that can be applied to this new set of procedures. These set of procedures can involve a process here of bringing up the teams and going through training and they are gradually building as we gain experience and confidence. So, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a tremendous need to expand capacity here in the early days. ","It is true that some of these new procedures and they in the general surgery and thoracic categories can definitely benefit from our fourth-generation technology, Xi technology, there will be some interest on the part of some folks to upgrade to the newer models. But for us right now I think it\u2019s really about building a foundation clinically in the market and like we always say, eventually the capital will follow but we are not predicting anything too dramatic this year. ","Isaac Ro","Okay, thank you. And then I am trying to follow up there. It sounds to us like that there will be hopefully some kind of update at the federal or national level with essentially a number if you will for new quota. But can you help us think through your understanding of how that number will then disseminate to the prudential [ph] level and eventually convert to origin revenue, whether it be the order process, how it varies, timeline, anything to help us understand the translation of the quota to actual action. ","Gary Guthart","It\u2019s a negotiation that occurs between Central Government and the provinces, so we are not permitted that negotiation and I don\u2019t really understand or know what the time table is. I can tell you that last time the quota was approved that it took several quarters for it to translate into any kind of sale to us. So, if you recall the quote last quarter we got was around 2013 and yet we saw most of systems at the end of 2015. So, you go through that negotiation between Central Government and provinces and then you also then have a tender process with each hospital at the end of it and that takes time.","Gary Guthart","Alright. Well that was our last question. As we have said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing value by enabling surgeons to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma. ","We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure that we remain committed to driving the lot of few things that should make a difference. ","This concludes today\u2019s call. I thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improved surgery and we look forward to talking to you again in three months.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference.

(Operator Instructions) And as a reminder today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Senior Director of Finance, Mr. Calvin Darling. Please go ahead.","Calvin Darling","Thank you, good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive Surgical\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Aleks Cukic, our Vice President of Strategic Planning.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today\u2019s call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the Company\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission filings.","Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today\u2019s press release has been posted to our website. Today\u2019s format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter results, as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session.","Gary will present the quarter\u2019s business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our first quarter financial results. Aleks will discuss marketing and clinical highlights. Then I will provide an update to our financial forecast for 2013, and finally we will host a question-and-answer session.","With that, I will turn it over to Gary.","Gary S. Guthart","Thank you for joining us today. Before we get started describing our quarterly performance, I\u2019d like to make a few comments regarding current events. As you know, we are in the midst of a concerted effort by critics of robotic surgery, to challenge the benefited range of patients, the value it brings to the medical community and the quality of our organization.","While taking these allegations very seriously, we remain deeply committed to developing and providing products that are in the surgeons hands, ease the burden of surgery for patients who can benefit from them. We take pride in the benefits provided by our systems, demonstrated a numerous large scale population studies comparing da Vinci surgery to open surgery for several different procedures. We are confident that those who invest their time in a serious review of the clinical literature on da Vinci will find ample evidence, and the benefit it brings to patients, surgeons, hospitals, and the medical community of ours.","Today, over 1 million patients chose the da Vinci minimally invasive surgery, surgery that would have otherwise been performed through an open incision.","Turning to our performance in the quarter, we experienced strong growth in general surgery, slower growth in gynecology and return to stability in urology. This resulted in an 18% procedure growth over 2012. The first quarter of 2013 had one fewer surgery day than 2012, taking this into account normalized procedure growth improves to approximately 20%.","General surgery growth was led by Single-Site Cholecystectomy and colorectal procedures. Gynecologic procedures for benign indications are typically seasonally slow in the first quarter. However, we\u2019ve experienced slower than expected growth into benign Hysterectomy in this first quarter of 2013.","Worldwide urology procedures experienced solid growth aided by the stabilizing of prostatectomy procedures in the United States. Considering the above procedure growth for the quarter came in it at the lower range of our expectations. Aleks will provide additional procedure commentary later in the call.","Turning to markets outside of the United States, our first quarter of Si system sales to Japan went well with encouraging early customer demand for the system. We are supporting surgical societies in Japan in their efforts to obtain national reimbursement for procedures beyond prostatectomy. In Europe, procedures and system sales follow the seasonal trends and showed modest growth. We continue to build our team in Europe and I am pleased with our organizational development over the past few quarters.","Overall, operating highlights for the first quarter are as follows. Procedures grew 18% over the first quarter of 2012. Adjusting for the number of procedure days in the quarter, normalized growth was approximately 20%. We sold 164 da Vinci Surgical Systems up from 140 during the first quarter of last year. Total revenue was $611 million, up 23% over last year. Instruments and accessories revenue increased to $261 million, up 26% over Q1 of 2012. Total recurring revenue grew to $356 million, up 23% from prior year and comprising 58% of total revenue.","We generated an operating profit of $285 million before non-cash stock option expense, up 27% from the first quarter of last year. Net income was $189 million, up 32% over last year. Earnings per share for the quarter were $4.56 compared to $3.50 in the first quarter of 2012. We ended the quarter with $3.116 billion in cash and investments, up $196 million from last quarter.","Significant cash outlays in the quarter included $17 million invested in fixed assets and intellectual property. We repurchased $146 million worth of our shares in the quarter. Our product development teams continued to make good progress.","This quarter, we initiated our controlled rollout for Single-Site hysterectomy and oophorectomy. Leading surgeons are optimizing their procedure choreography, and we plan to expand our installations, had a measured pace through the year. Early surgeon and patient interest in Single-Site for Hysterectomy is high. We have also initiated our first clinical cases with our da Vinci Stapler.","As we have mentioned previously, our first stapling product is focused on colorectal surgery. Earlier clinical results and surgeon feedback on use of the Stapler are very encouraging. Given the subtleties involved in the use and manufacture of surgical Staplers, our rollout plan for the Stapler will be conservative for the year.","Turning to system and imaging developments, we continue to invest in expanding indications for Firefly Fluorescence Imaging and in deepening our product offerings in support of system training. We are currently answering FDA questions regarding expanding Firefly indications to include biliary imaging. The intent of this is this indication is to allow surgeons to image the common bile duct in real time during cholecystectomy. On the simulation front, we have added new surgical skill modules to our simulator through our development partnerships. Our medical research team is working with academic centers world wide of face, content, and construct validity stays of the da Vinci Skills Simulator. Early publications of these validations are positive.","Lastly, we are initiating our first clinical sites configured with da Vinci Connect over the next few months. da Vinci Connect is our system for remote proctoring. Remote proctoring uses Internet-based conferencing technology to allow a distant surgeon to participate in the da Vinci case with a surgeon on an SI console through video, voice, and illustration. It is intended to augment surgical proctoring by lowering the time, distance, and cost barriers to expert participation during the surgeon\u2019s learning period.","We are also investing in the construction of two new training centers that are expected to become operational this year; one increasing the capacity of our training center at our California headquarters and the second new facility in Atlanta to serve our customers in the East. As we enter new surgical markets and drive into new product arenas, we continue to invest in building our team and expanding partnerships and acquiring those technologies that can make a difference to robotic surgery. This quarter we added 118 people to our team, predominantly in sales, manufacturing, and R&D, bringing our total team to 2,480 employees.","I\u2019ll now pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer.","Marshall L. Mohr","Thank you, Gary. Our first quarter revenue was $611 million, up 23% compared with $495 million for the first quarter of 2012 and roughly equal to the $609 million last quarter. First quarter revenues by product category were as follows. First  quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $261 million, up 26% compared with $208 million for the first quarter of 2012 and up 3% compared with $254 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. The year-over-year increase in instrument and accessory revenue was driven by procedure growth of 18%. Sales of new products including Single Site, Vessel Sealer, and Firefly, and higher stocking orders associated with higher system unit sales.","The 18% procedure growth was impacted by one additional operating day in the first quarter of 2012 reflecting leap year. Excluding the impact of leap year, procedure growth would have been approximately 20%. Procedure growth also reflects seasonality associated with the benign hysterectomies, which was more pronounced in 2013 compared with 2012 as we achieve deeper penetration in this market.","The year-over-year procedure growth was led by U.S. general surgery and gynecology procedures, partially offset by lower U.S. dVPs of approximately a 11%. U.S. dVP procedures are approximately 4% higher than the fourth quarter of 2012. The sequential increase in instrument and accessory revenue compared with the last quarter was driven by the timing of customer orders and new product revenue associated with the increased usage from Firefly, Vessel Sealer, and Single Site.","Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including initial stocking orders was approximately $2,110 per procedure, which is higher than the $1,990 realized in the first quarter of last year, and the $2,050 realized in the fourth quarter. The sequential increase from the fourth quarter of 2012 to the first quarter of 2013 was driven primarily by the timing of customer orders. First quarter 2013 systems revenue of $256 million increased 24% compared with $207 million for the first quarter of 2012 and decreased 3% compared with $265 million for the fourth quarter of 2012. Our higher systems revenue compared to the first quarter of last year was driven by higher unit sales and a higher average selling price.","We sold 164 systems in the first quarter of 2013 compared with 140 systems in the first quarter of last year, and 175 systems in the seasonally stronger fourth quarter of 2012. Our first quarter 2013 system sales included 25 systems into Japan, where we launched the da Vinci SI that started this year. We sold seven systems into Japan during the first quarter of 2012 and 10 last quarter.","Our first quarter average selling price per system was $1.55 million compared with $1.47 million realized in the first quarter of 2012 and $1.49 million realized last quarter. ASPs include all da Vinci models, all simulators, and Firefly when configured with the system and exclude upgrades. Our higher first quarter 2013 ASP was driven by a higher proportion of dual console configuration in a favorable geographic mix.","48 of the 164 first quarter sales were dual console model compared with 25 of 140 last year and 32 of 175 last quarter. 15 of the 25 units sold in Japan during the first quarter were dual console models. We sold 97 simulators during the quarter, mostly in conjunction with new systems sales compared with 102 last year and 115 last quarter. 39 of our first quarter 2013 system sales involve trade-ins comprised of 30 da Vinci Ss and nine standard models. 46 of our first quarter 2012 sales involve trade-ins and 52 of our fourth quarter 2012 sales involve trade-ins.","Service revenue increased to $94 million, up 17% compared with $81 million last year and up 4% compared with $91 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was primarily driven by a larger system installed base. Total first quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessories, and service revenues, increased to $356 million, up 23% compared with the first quarter of last year and up 3% compared with the fourth quarter of 2012. Recurring revenue represented 58% of total first quarter revenue compared with 58% in the first quarter of last year and 57% last quarter.","International results were as follows. First quarter revenue outside of the United States was $153 million, up 47% compared with revenue of $105 million in the first quarter of last year and up 17% compared with revenue of $131 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Our year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter international revenue growth was driven by higher da Vinci system sales into the Japanese market.","First quarter 2013 international procedure volume was approximately 14% higher than the first quarter of 2012, and 10% higher than the fourth quarter of 2012. During the first quarter of 2013, we sold 49 systems outside of the U.S. compared with 35 in the first quarter of 2012 and 42 last quarter. We sold 16 systems in Europe this quarter compared with 14 in the first quarter of 2012 and 24 last quarter.","Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the first quarter of 2013 was 71% compared with 71.9% during both the first and fourth quarter of 2012. Our lower first quarter 2013 gross margin percentage resulted primarily from the impact of the medical device excise tax partially offset by the favorable impact of higher system ASPs and higher service margin. Our first quarter 2013 cost of sales including $6.5 million related to the medical device exercise tax.","First quarter 2013 operating expenses of $183 million were up 13%, compared with the first quarter of 2012 and down 4% compared with the fourth quarter of 2012. Our higher year-over-year operating expenses were primarily driven by headcount addition. The sequential decrease in operating expenses was driven by lower variable compensation expense and the timing of engineering projects in other expenses.","First quarter 2013 operating income was $251 million, or 41% of sales compared with $193 million, or 39% of sales last year, and $248 million, or 41% of sales for the fourth quarter of 2012. First quarter 2013 operating income reflected $38 million of non-cash stock compensation expense compared with $34 million last year and $38 million last quarter. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 26%, compared with 27% for the first quarter of 2012 and 31% last quarter.","As anticipated our first quarter 2013 income tax expense included the discrete benefit of approximately $7.5 million for the reinstatement of the 2012 R&D tax credit, which become effective January 1st of this year, otherwise our tax rate would have been 29%. Our tax provision for the first quarter of 2012 included a one-time benefit associated with domestic manufacturing tax credit and otherwise our tax rate in that quarter would have been 32%. Our net income was $189 million or $4.56 per share, compared with $144 million or $3.50 per share last year and $175 million or $4.25 per share for the fourth quarter of 2012.","Now, moving to cash flow, we ended the first quarter with cash and investments of $3.1 billion, up $196 million compared with December 31, 2012. The increase was driven by $258 million of cash flows from operation plus $89 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $146 million in stock buybacks and $17 million of capital and IP purchases.","During the first quarter we bought back 299,000 shares at an average price of $487 per share. As recently announced, our Board of Directors has increased our share buyback authorization by $1 billion including this latest authorization, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion of authorized share buyback.","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks to go over our sales, marketing, and clinical highlights.","Aleks Cukic","Thank you, Marshall. During the first quarter, we sold 164 da Vinci systems; 115 in the United States, 16 into Europe, and 33 into rest of world markets. As part of the 164 system sales, 9 standard da Vinci systems and 30 da Vinci S systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si systems.","We finished the quarter with a net 125 system additions to the installed base bringing to 2,710, the cumulative number of da Vinci systems worldwide; 1,957 in the United States, 430 in Europe, and 323 in rest of world markets. 75 of the 164 systems installed during the quarters represented repeat system sales to existing customers. In total 162 of the 164 systems sold represented da Vinci Si or SIE systems, which included 48 dual console systems. The 49 systems, systems sales internationally included 25 into Japan, 4 into France, and 3 into Turkey.","Clinically, Q1 year-over-year procedure growth was approximately 18%, led by the category of general surgery, followed by GYN. General surgery growth was paced by cholecystectomy, followed by colon and rectal resections. As Gary stated, procedure growth reflected seasonality, the reduction of selling days and a slower quarter for benign dVH. dVP more specifically the rate of decline for U.S. dVP, a topic extensively discussed, appears to be flattening out. U.S. dVP was once again up on a sequential basis with a reduced rate of decline as compared to last year. Overall, other urology, as well as international dVP showed solid growth both on a sequential and on a year-over-year basis.","Recently released new products continue to perform well, notably Single-Site where customer feedback has been positive and sales have remained strong. Through Q1 2013, we have sold Single-Site instrument and accessory kits to approximately 630 U.S. customers. Our recently launched Vessel Sealer product has picked up clinical momentum with most of the interest coming from the specialties of colorectal, advanced general surgery and GYN.","The customer adoption for both da Vinci Simulator and Firefly continues to expand with 97 customers purchasing da Vinci Simulator and 69 customers purchasing Firefly systems as part of their initial system purchase this quarter. In addition, we have begun a phased rollout of the da Vinci surgical stapling system as well as our Single-Site Hysterectomy products. These rollouts will be expanded in a measured fashion, so we do not expect them to contribute materially to 2013 revenue.","During the quarter several hundred robotic abstracts and papers representing a variety of surgical specialties were published within various peer-reviewed journals, while quarterly clinical conferences produced several live da Vinci procedure transmissions, postgraduate robotic courses, podium presentations and clinical poster sessions.","As many of you know, we are currently participating at the Annual SAGES Conference which is taking place in Baltimore, the surgeon support we received at this conference thus far has been positive.","Much of the critical press we received has been directed toward the cost efficacy of da Vinci within the specialty of GYN and more specifically within its use to treat benign conditions. To be clear, we believe strongly that one of our greatest growth opportunities consist of converting open hysterectomy to dVH, da Vinci has showed itself as a very capable and cost effective tool in expanding minimally invasive surgery to a far greater number of patients, who would otherwise have undergone an open surgical procedure. Open hysterectomy is where we focus. Open hysterectomy represents the largest component of our target market growth. Open hysterectomy convergence is where we deliver high patient value.","Unfortunately, most of the media as well as the ACOG commentary were focused on da Vinci\u2019s economic profile versus either vaginal surgery or simple laparoscopy. For decades the popularity of vaginal and laparoscopy approaches the hysterectomy paled in comparison to the number of open hysterectomies being performed within the United States which clearly explains the motivation driving our dVH opportunity.","In a recent edition of the Journal, Gynecologic Surgery, a European study discussed this very issue, the study emanated out of Cork University Maternity Hospital in Cork, Ireland, an extremely cost sensitive market with national austerity measures in place.","In the analysis, Cork U computed and compared hysterectomy specific hospitalization cost between their hospital and the similarly-sized reference hospital, with a similar hysterectomy treatment mix. The hysterectomy treatment mix in these hospitals included open midline incision, lower transverse incision, LADH and vaginal hysterectomy. They determined that on average an open hysterectomy performed through a midline incision required an eight-day hospitalization, six days for a hysterectomy performed through a lower transverse incision, three days for an LADH, and three days for vaginal hysterectomy. They computed cost per day of hospitalization to be approximately \u20ac534. Cork University acquired their da Vinci system in 2008, whereas the reference hospital did not.","Following the inclusion of da Vinci, Cork University discovered that their dVH patients were spending only two days in the hospital, and GYN beds were being consumed for fewer days. They also reported that the rate of open surgery has been reducing by 10% per year at Cork, following the introduction of dVH, and is projected to represent only 5% of the total hysterectomies performed during the final year of the study, as compared to 35% open hysterectomy rate in the non-da Vinci reference hospital.","When comparing to current mix and extrapolating over and annual basis, 280 hysterectomies, the bed day rate has reduced from 1,134 days to 756 days when incorporating da Vinci, which represents a potential annual savings of over \u20ac2,000. In the others comments, they stated, and I quote, in 2009 the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released the statement recommending vaginal hysterectomy as the approach of choice for benign hysterectomies due to reduced operating times when compared to the laparoscopic approach.","However, they note that laparoscopic surgery is an alternative to vaginal hysterectomy is not when vaginal hysterectomy is not feasible or indicated. Increasing the rate of vaginal surgery decreases the cost of surgery compared to the open approach due to reduced length of stay. Consideration must be given to the fact that not all surgeries are amendable to the vaginal approach.\u201d","One could argue that the same commentary would pertain to let the laparoscopic approach, in that if two has remained in the minority due to clinical and\/or technical challenges. The authors concluded their paper by stating \u201cRobotic surgery is associated with reduced hospital stay compared with open surgery, while the initial outlay is expensive, the increased number of patients amendable to this minimally access approach compared with conventional keyhole surgery has the potential for financial savings.\u201d","Da Vinci colorectal resections have been expanding rapidly over the past several quarters. The uptake has been driven by surgeons seeking to offer patients in less invasive alternative to open colorectal surgery. While Laparoscopic colorectal surgery has been proven to be safe and defective and has for years been available within several leading institutions throughout the world. It has nonetheless remained largely underpenetrated within the United States.","In a recent edition of the journal, Surgical Endoscopy, a study entitled total Mesorectal Excision, a comparison of oncologic and functional results between robotic and laparoscopic rectal surgery was published. The study conducted in Rome was based on 100 patients who had undergone minimally invasive anterior rectal resections with total Mesorectal Excision or TME. 50 consecutive robotic rectal anterior resections with TME were compared to the first 50 consecutive laparoscopic rectal resections with TME.","The authors made several comparisons which included operating time, conversion rate, lymph node yields, circumferential margins, length of stay, and sexual functions scores. They reported that the operative times were similar between the two groups with da Vinci holding only a slight advantage. Lymph node yields were greater using da Vinci, 16.5 versus 13.8. Conversions to open surgery were zero within the da Vinci cohort as compared to 12% for the laparoscopic cohort. The circumferential margins less than 2 millimeters were zero using da Vinci as compared to 12% for the lap group.","In the authors\u2019 conclusion, they wrote and I quote, robotic TME is oncologically safe and adequate for rectal cancer treatment, showing better results than laparoscopic TME in terms of circumferential margins, conversions, and hospital length of stay. Better recovery in voiding and sexual function is achieved with the robotic technique, close quote. In the early days of an emerging procedure, single-center comparative analysis with strong findings laid the foundation for larger and more comprehensive comparative studies. We would expect this trend to continue within the field of colorectal surgery.","This concludes my remarks, and now I\u2019ll turn the time over to Calvin.","Calvin Darling","Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing you with an update to our financial forecast for 2013, including procedures, revenues, and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates of significant non-cash expenses to provide you with visibility into our expected future cash flows.","Starting with procedures; on our last call, we projected our full-year 2013 procedures to growth approximately 20% to 23% from the base of approximately 450,000 procedures performed in 2012. Now based upon first quarter procedure trends, we expect our full-year 2013 procedure growth to be in the lower-end of that range.","Moving on to revenues. Last quarter, we forecasted full-year 2013 revenue growth of between 16% and 19%. Based upon favorable new instrument and accessory product sales and utilization, we now expect full-year 2013 revenue growth at the higher end of that range. Our first quarter system ASP of $1.55 million was higher than we expected, reflecting a high proportion of dual console configurations in the system mix. Going forward in 2013, we would expect our systems product mix and overall systems ASP to return towards historical 2012 levels.","Now turning to operating income. We continue to expect full-year operating income to fall within a range of between 38% and 39% of net revenue. Our first quarter operating margin of 41% reflected favorable system pricing and timing of operating expenses. In Q2, we would expect operating expenses to increase at least $15 million, reflecting higher variable compensation, prototype, headcount, stock compensation and legal expenses.","We continue to expect 2013 stock compensation to total between $184 million and $192 million for the year. Timing of recognition should follow-up quarterly pattern similar to 2012. Amortization of purchased intellectual property which is mostly reported as R&D expense is still expected to come in between $28 million and $30 million in 2013. We continue to expect to other income to total between $18 million and $22 million in 2013. With regard to income tax, as Marshall described, our Q1 tax rate reflected the benefit related to the reinstatement of the 2012 R&D tax credit. For the rest of this year, we continue to anticipate our tax rate to fall within a range of between 28% and 30% of pre-tax income. Our share account for calculating EPS in Q1 2013 was approximately 41.4 million shares. Going forward our share account will depend upon the magnitude and timing of share buybacks. We will continue to be thoughtful in our execution of the 1.2 billion authorized by the Board for that purpose.","That concludes our prepared remarks, we will now open the call to your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","(Operator Instructions). Our first question today comes from the line of Tycho Peterson representing JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Evan Lodes \u2013 JP Morgan","Hi, guys. This is Evan Lodes in for Tycho. I guess first question was for Gary, can you disaggregate the slowdown in benign dVH between the seasonal effects that you mentioned such as deductibles and then also the more coordinated efforts that you talked about with regards to the roll-off specifically?","Gary S. Guthart","I think I heard the question, although there is a little bit of background noise on the call. I think the question was can we disaggregate the benign hysterectomy slowdown. No, I think there are a few things going on there. As we look at multi port benign hysterectomy in total, we think our market opportunity is really the open surgical market share. There is still more than 100,000 open benign hysterectomies being done in the U.S. We see three issues impacting benign hysterectomy. First, as we become a larger part of the market, the impact of seasonality plays a proportionally bigger role in our performance. So, it\u2019s simply when a new technique is for a small part of the market the number of unserved patients is sufficiently large that changes in the total number of patient admissions do not materially impact growth. However, as penetration increases the sensitivity to total admissions increases with it.","Second, several large healthcare organizations are reporting a greater than expected decline in patient admissions in the first quarter. Given that benign hysterectomy is a large part of our procedure base, that will impact us as well. Third, negative press has some hard to measure impact on benign hysterectomy, although it doesn\u2019t appear to be large, it\u2019s also probably not zero.","Evan Lodes \u2013 JP Morgan","Thank you very much. And then the second question, you mentioned the international procedure growth was about 14%, could you help us think about what the growth is in Europe and trends there that you\u2019ve seen recently? Thank you.","Calvin Darling","Yeah, I mean just numerically, the 14% would be higher on the Asia and rest of world markets and a bit lower on the European side.","Evan Lodes \u2013 JP Morgan","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair, please go ahead.","Benjamin Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Company","Hi, good afternoon. Can you hear me?","Marshall L. Mohr","Hi, Ben.","Gary S. Guthart","Yes, we can.","Benjamin Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Company","Okay. Gary, talk a little bit about the guidance of 20% to 23% and targeting kind of the low end of that range, what does it take for you to hit that 20%, does it require a stabilization in benign dVH and again continued stabilization of prostatectomy, and just maybe walk through how you get to that 20%, because we\u2019re struggling a little bit as we try to plug-in the number for Q1 to get there?","Gary S. Guthart","A couple of things and then Calvin may help you a little bit with that as well. But as we look out, we\u2019ve seen three quarters in a row with prostatectomy where it\u2019s sort of finding its footing  with regard to the U.S. So we are assuming that that remains -- that trend stays about the same as we go through. General surgery has shown real strength. On benign gynecology, I want to make sure, we\u2019re separating out gynecologic procedures from just hysterectomy. There is more in benign gynecology to just hysterectomy; there is myomectomy, sacrocolpopexy both of which were meeting our expectations in this quarter.","The quarter is a little bit hard to interpret just because of the number of operating days and there is little bit of ambiguity as to how many there were in terms of how the holidays played, and we\u2019ll have to see a little bit and impossible to predict the future perfectly. We look out and think that our guidance at the low end makes sense given those, kind of three factors together.","Calvin Darling","Yeah, and you know as we look at our guidance, there are a lot of moving parts more and more as you realize, but, the key areas of growth are the same as they were entering the year, specifically the number of new procedures coming from U.S. general surgery, U.S. gynecology, and international dVP are going to be still the largest areas of growth. As Gary said, based upon customer and surgeon feedback, we have not seen a major impact on the benign  dVH procedure demand, although we can\u2019t really predict where that may head in the future. We expect seasonality to play through and we\u2019ll benefit later in the year on some of these things as well, and we do forecast that dVP has bottomed out.","So, I think that\u2019s -- having said that, nobody has a crystal ball and we\u2019ll take it one quarter at a time.","Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And two more quick questions, Gary. Are you hearing additional chatter or kind of disturbing chatter from either surgeons or hospitals questioning the safety and obviously efficacy of the system, and I know that may be hard to quantify, but does it feel different now then it did a month ago, and were there trends in the quarter or something that got your attention?","Gary S. Guthart","With regard to --  it\u2019s interesting, with regard to surgeon feedback on the use of our device the safety and stability of it, but surgeons are the ones who are absolutely closest to it. They work with it everyday. We have seen very little change in their view point in terms of people who actually know the device. And likewise that\u2019s true with hospitals who are our customers. These kinds of questions do come up in conversation, they come up in conversation, with sales teams, but we haven\u2019t seen a substantial change in the nature of that conversation, say over the last few weeks of the quarter as we go through it.","Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then finally, you mentioned something intriguing  about SG&A spending, popping up in the second quarter. I thought I heard prototyping in the middle of that list. Can you describe that at all?","Gary S. Guthart","Yeah and we always said prototypes are going to be lumpy right. And I think if you looked sequentially at operating expenses, they declined from Q4 to Q1 and there was relatively light in the areas that Marshall mentioned in his script then I think you\u2019re going to see a pick up in the items that I mentioned including prototypes.","Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Gary S. Guthart","Ben, you had asked a question, just a follow-up on kind of a surgeon\u2019s view or surgeon\u2019s commentary on it, and I\u2019ll tell you one surgeon\u2019s comment to me with regard to some of the criticism that\u2019s been out there. He came back and said, hey, open surgery hasn\u2019t gotten any better for patients and laparoscopy hasn\u2019t gotten any easier for surgeons, and I think that\u2019s true.","Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC","We definitely heard the same thing. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question today comes from the line of Lennox Ketner representing Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Lennox Ketner \u2013 Bank of America","Hi. Can you hear me okay?","Gary S. Guthart","Yes","Marshall L. Mohr","Yes","Lennox Ketner - Bank of America","Great, just a few questions. First, I\u2019m sorry if I missed this, but I think you said that the dVP was down about 11% year-over-year. But last quarter you had provided, I think the overall growth rates for both general surgery and gynecology as well. Is that something you would be willing to breakout at this time?","Gary S. Guthart","We do that on an annual basis and not quarterly.","Lennox Ketner - Bank of America","Okay, had to try. And then on the Stapler, I was a little surprised to hear that people shouldn\u2019t be expecting any meaningful contribution from that product this year, just given that it\u2019s been on the market for six months or so now \u2013 been approved at least for six months or so now. Could you maybe just give us a little more color in terms of why the launch of that product is expected to be so measured? Are there additional features that need to be added to the stapler to make it more effective or is it really just wanting to make sure the initial customer experiences are good, but if you could maybe just give us a little bit of more of an explanation as to why that launch is expected to take so long or why is it expected to take so long assuming meaningful contribution?","Gary S. Guthart","Yeah. So, for starters, while we had the approval last year, the first clinical cases happened in this quarter, and really the reason of it is two-fold. One is, we want to have outstanding first customer experiences with it, so far we have. The second thing is the supply chain for the surgical stapler is a long one, it\u2019s a full system that has electronics in it, software in it, motor packs, and single use sterilizable  products. So we want to make sure that that supply chain is exceptionally stable and ready as we move to scale. And it\u2019s really working, those two things in parallel to make sure we get a great result. Stapling is a subtle product. There are a lot of things about it in terms of both its manufacturing and its use that you want to make sure you get right, and so we\u2019ll be doing that. And as we start to see that stability, then we\u2019ll start to ramp the release.","Lennox Ketner - Bank of America","Okay. Just on a feature standpoint, you feel confident that the version that you have now has all the features that it needs to ultimately be successful?","Gary S. Guthart","It does. Remember, we\u2019ve talked in the past that we are focusing this first stapler on the colorectal market and so the size of the staple loads , both in term of the length and the size of the staples that go into these little cartridges are optimized for colorectal. In time, we\u2019ll start to add different size cartridges and different leg length staples to allow us to do other things. So, this is really just the first step in a multi-step process. But it\u2019s not the lack of a particular feature for colorectal that has us moving at the pace we are moving.","Lennox Ketner - Bank of America","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, last one just on the buyback authorization. I mean, I think there is obviously a much larger authorization that you guys have done in the past. I think people are happy to see that. How should we think about the timing of that going forward, but, you know, in the past you guys have done pretty measured buybacks over time? Should we expect this one to occur anymore quickly than the others or is it going to kind of picking you to be at the same pace as the others described larger overall authorization?","Gary S. Guthart","I think you\u2019ve somewhat characterized how we have pushed it. We\u2019ve not been mechanical. We\u2019ve been very thoughtful about what we\u2019ve done and we\u2019ll continue to be thoughtful. So, you shouldn\u2019t look for any particular standard pattern, if you will. We\u2019ll look for the right opportunity to buyback over time.","Lennox Ketner - Bank of America","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Okay. Next, we will go to the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about any efforts you are undertaking or look to undertake to address the weakness in the dVH? I mean obviously, the seasonal piece and macro dynamics are what they are, but maybe any sort of impact you\u2019ve had from the recent noise in the marketplace? What is your plan to sort of start to stem that? And then how long do you think it might take before we start to see some positive return from those efforts?","Gary S. Guthart","On the first comment of what do we think there is in terms of an opportunity in our dVH? First of all, we look out and say often procedures that are still being done through a laparotomy are great opportunity for us. We look around the country to see where those are and our ability to serve those patients. That\u2019s our primary opportunity. You implied in your discussion that the negative press is having a fair impact in this. It\u2019s not clear but that\u2019s true. Right now separating out how much of this is seasonality. How much is just a total inpatient admission, and how much is specific going to it\u2019s actually a hard think to piece apart. Having said that, I think the strength of da Vinci Surgery has been in its clinical outcomes and so that\u2019s where we start relative to open surgery both in the publications and in the education of our sales team and the interaction with hospitals it\u2019s that sort of data, and so we\u2019ve done that and we\u2019ll continue to do that in terms of supplying them the data and the resources they need to approach those patients.","Over time as we go through the year, we have Single-Site Hysterectomy which is really a little bit different marketplace and that\u2019s again not looking so much at open procedures, but looking at those patients who would rather have a single incision than multi-port and that\u2019s as we get to the close of the year might to start give us an opportunity to access the different good patients","David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s helpful. And then I know a lot of the questions on this call regarding the market recent noise and marketplace concerns have been focused on gynecology, but it is fair to say that hasn\u2019t sort of trickled into the other parts you\u2019ve been in some of the newer categories like general surgery that continued to be fairly robust and your ability to attract new users, train new users, I mean any change in sort of your size of your training classes interest level I mean any other metrics that you could help us to gauge this sort of looming question around noise versus reality?","Gary S. Guthart","We have not seen a change in that is our for people be trained and we haven\u2019t seen anything that I can point to in the general surgery marketplace that would indicate a real impact?","Marshall L. Mohr","Yeah, and again I think evidence of that that we have that helps us make that statement or the actual procedure numbers, the number of people who are accessing proctors and training. And just as a level set, GYN if you look at things like Sacrocolpopexy and Myomectomy and Endometriosis Resection. If GYN is end hysterectomy for malignant conditions, this is a very robust category and while dVH Benign is certainly the largest individual segment of that category, as we look out overall at GYN, we\u2019ve remain very encouraged.","David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, and maybe the last question just a follow-up on the share repurchase authorization. You\u2019ve in the past I think you\u2019ve got to use share repurchase to kind of offset the impact of options being exercised and that sort of been not a top use of cash, but sort of something that you\u2019ve done to manage options, dilution. Is there anything different are there prioritization to think about this $1 billion authorization or it\u2019s just the cash balance has got into where it is the stock price is where it is that you need more to offset the impact of options exercised?","Gary S. Guthart","I think number one is in the authorization reflected confidence in the business, but I think that it\u2019s also intended to be a return to shareholders. We\u2019re talking about a $1 billion set more than offset any stock option dilution that we create during the year.","David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question today comes from the line of Larry Keusch. Please go ahead.","Lawrence Keusch \u2013 Raymond James Financial","Gary, there has been obviously a lot of discussion focused on procedures and the impact from the predicts over last several months, but I\u2019m wondering if we can perhaps shift towards system sales obviously quite strong this quarter, but I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re seeing anything change in the selling cycle or there has been some speculation that hospitals may holdback on purchasing while there is all those noise out there, so any color would be helpful?","Gary S. Guthart","All I can speak to is the first quarter and looking at the first quarter we haven\u2019t seen any meaningful impact of negative press on capital sales. In fact, the capital side was pretty strong as you mentioned not only in systems as a whole, but and the attachment of some of the products we\u2019ve added to assign. So, dual console sale, simulator sales, Firefly demand have continued to be strong, again don\u2019t have a crystal ball is to what happens in the future, but so far the conversations have been pretty straightforward.","Lawrence Keusch \u2013 Raymond James Financial","Okay, great. And then this is also come up over the last several calls, you\u2019ve expressed some need to work on the European organization, so I\u2019m just curious kind of take your temperature little bit on where we are in that process?","Gary S. Guthart","I think that we\u2019ve been making on a good progress, I think that it\u2019s been measured, but we\u2019ve been adding resources in a few places, some of that has been leadership resources, some of that has been people in the sales force experienced, people into the sales force and some of it is in areas such as regulatory and reimbursement, we\u2019ve made some great hires there they are integrating well and as we\u2019ve said in the past this is something that will happen over quarters not over days, but we are pleased with our partners.","Lawrence Keusch \u2013 Raymond James Financial","Okay. And then lastly, just on the usage of cash obviously, share repurchase remains out there, but what are the latest thoughts around potentially using cash for some M&A opportunities?","Marshall L. Mohr","Go ahead.","Gary S. Guthart","So, I think there is, our eyes are always open for opportunities for a few things and some of it has been as you know on the past looking for technologies that we think did really well with robotic surgery and advancing the ability of surgeons and the systems to do more. We continue to be looking forward and able to acquire those things, we think make a difference. We also think that investments in markets not in the United States are really important. You\u2019ve seen this through that in the past. And we continue to do so in terms of investing into existing organizational frameworks in Japan and in Korea and also positioning ourselves for success in other markets or U.S. having cash help us to do that as well.","Lawrence Keusch \u2013 Raymond James Financial","Okay, terrific. Thank you.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Demchick \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hello, this is actually Jon in for David. So, we had a few questions. One just while procedures were a bit slower than expected, instrument revenue is still strong and I guess that was more related to the revenue per procedure being higher. And I\u2019m just wondering if you could maybe break that out and how much of that was related to stocking whereas how much of that was some of the more advanced tools? You mentioned thoughts on the system ASP is to normalize down a bit, any thoughts to where revenue procedure should go throughout the year?","Gary S. Guthart","We\u2019ve actually seen a bit of an uptick in the base, what we call the base. And so if you parse out the stocking orders associated with new system purchases, we see a little uptick in the base and that reflects the new products. So that reflects usage of Firefly, usage of vessel sealing. And so, I think it was also benefited, the quarter was also benefited by the timing of purchases of buying through distributors and other customers where they\u2019re entering their new fiscal year and so they may have bought more. And so I think there is a little bit higher than maybe we would expect going forward, but it\u2019s definitely being benefited by the new products.","Aleks Cukic","And we\u2019ve always talked there is a lot of moving parts in this overall instrument and accessory per procedure. We have talked in the past about a natural trend downward as the impact of stocking orders becomes less on our larger installed base and procedure mix moving towards the simpler mix maybe moving downwards but now, what we\u2019re seeing, the impact of the new products, even beyond the initial stocking of the new products which we\u2019ve talked before. We\u2019re talking about utilization of products like the Vessel Sealer and the Firefly in procedures, which getting those procedures utilized and those products used in procedures. It\u2019s allowing us to really to capture larger portion of the hospitals procedure spend through the da Vinci platform. And so directionally, we probably see that winning the day at least for the balance of this year.","Jonathan Demchick \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. And then a quick follow-up on Single-Site chole. First, I was more curious to, if you could break out how much Single-Site chole is out of our chole is? And then also it just seen kept increased each year on the Single-Site side, and I was wondering if you can maybe discuss how much of those are VP buyers, how much of those are new adaptors and just what you\u2019ve seen there?","Marshall L. Mohr","Yeah. At this point in time, the Single-Site chole, it\u2019s really moving from an initial introduction into more key element of our business here, a lot more matured status. We\u2019ve talked about the number of customers who bought Single-Site products. We may move away from that. I think as it becomes part of the norm, the portion that\u2019s Single-Site versus multi-port that\u2019s always transitioning as most people are aware the multi-port side is generally part of the training pathway to move towards single port, but I think the multi-port side is really the stat as an avenue to move towards the ultimate destination of the single port. So it\u2019s probably not as important at that point, at any of time of how many of those are.","Gary S. Guthart","Just a qualitative remark on the reorder rate. We have been watching and we\u2019ve been pleased so far. Reorder rate has been positive for us.","Jonathan Demchick \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Okay. Next from the line of (inaudible) with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks very much. I thought maybe I would first ask about Single-Site for dVH. I think I was a little bit surprised in kind of thinking back in your traction with Single-Site for chole and what that did in 2012, essentially its first year. In your comments that you thought it might not have much of an impact this year. So I thought maybe you could explain the differences between the rollout here versus the rollout for chole\u2019s and why it\u2019s going to take a little bit longer?","Gary S. Guthart","Well, again, as you know, I mean, we\u2019re pretty measured in our approach with all of these various procedures. And I think when you look at Single incision hysterectomy, you\u2019re looking at products that are required to be made which we\u2019re doing and then we know how to do that. And then you\u2019re looking at really understanding, the physicians are looking at really understanding procedure choreography, how do I do this, how do I do that, how do I close the cup, how do I take the next et cetera. And so, it\u2019s difficult to try to assign a reasonable timeline to how the choreography will go, in addition to the general issues of manufacturing new products getting new supply chain down et cetera. So we\u2019re being pretty cautious about that.","Now, if it turns out that that changes in time will certainly let you know. But I think there is a, I think there are number of surveys that people have done and we\u2019ve done ourselves, where there is a real excitement for from the customer. And so we just want to make sure, do you take this into consideration and that work that into your expectations because it\u2019s really too early to call.","Unidentified Analyst","All right, okay. And then on the system side, just the comment you made about system mix in ASPs maybe not holding through the whole year. I\u2019m just wondering, if that\u2019s more product mix related or is that geography related? And if it\u2019s on a product side just specifically what you\u2019re thinking in terms of the products that might not be relating the year that you\u2019ve been selling.","Marshall L. Mohr","Yeah, it\u2019s primarily product mix and we had 48 of the 164 units were dual console systems in the first quarter and that\u2019s by far in a way the highest proportion that we\u2019ve had. We\u2019d see that attach rate returning to more historical levels and as such the ASP. It\u2019d be less than we saw here in the first quarter, maybe more in line with what we saw throughout 2012.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then last one from me, I realized that with regard to the FDA MedSun survey, I guess there was only nine people or so may be it\u2019s not even a survey or definitely not a government probe, it\u2019s may be some would call it. But have you guys had talked to any of the doctors involved in that kind of inquiry or do you know anything about the reports that might be coming out or what you might be anticipating?","Gary S. Guthart","As far as we know it was a confidentially run survey and so we have no, nothing to share on that front.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks very much guys.","Gary S. Guthart","All right, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our final question today will come from the line of Rick [Wise] with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Miroslava Minkova \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Hi, it\u2019s actually Miroslava for Rick today. Let me start with asking a question on Japan could not [help] but note of the significant number of systems you played there this quarter and it was coincided with the Si approval in Japan. Was the Si what you needed to help unlock this market to some extent? And related to that should we expect this kind of rate to continue or was this, do you view this is as an anomaly as you launch the Si?","Gary S. Guthart","I think that they were happy to get a Si approval and I think it\u2019s been well received. I think that there is some amount of early excitement having to do with Si long-term as you look at that market. Procedure reimbursement is going to be the thing that is the long and sustained growth path. And so I think system sales in Japan are going to be lumpy, until additional procedures are reimbursed. And that\u2019s something that we\u2019re working with the surgical societies on supporting and helping them to complete that activity.","Miroslava Minkova \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay, and\u2026","Gary S. Guthart","One last question please.","Miroslava Minkova \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","And going back to just the both concerted effort by the critics of surgery. I was wondering if you have any plans to highlight some of your data on the outcomes and perhaps the economics of your procedures. And it goes back to what was asked earlier, but maybe if I could ask it a little bit differently has your conversation with your customers changed in any way as a result of the negative press?","Gary S. Guthart","It was two questions. On the first one, do we have plans to share our data? Yes, we do. And we have been and we will continue to do so. In terms of the conversations that occur with customers over this and in essence the conversations with customers are amongst the most straightforward because they understand the issues on all sides. The conversations really come down to their own experiences and the data and we\u2019re happy to and well, condition well positioned to have those conversations. We\u2019ll continue to do so. And as additional data comes out, we were happy to share with.","Miroslava Minkova \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay, thank you.","Gary S. Guthart","That was our last question. In closing, da Vinci Surgery has proven safety, efficacy, economic and ergonomic benefits when compared to the open surgical procedures, it is replacing. We are steadfast in our conviction in the value that da Vinci has and will bring to medicine. And we thank you for your support and helping Intuitive expand the benefits of minimally invasive surgery. We\u2019ll look forward to speaking to you again in three months.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only. Later there will be an opportunity for questions. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Calvin Darling, Senior Director of Finance, Investor Relations of Intuitive Surgical. Please go ahead, sir.","Calvin Darling - Senior Director-Finance, Investor Relations","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's second quarter earnings conference call. With me today we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Patrick Clingan, Vice President of Finance and Sales Operations.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 2, 2016, and 10-Q filed on April 19, 2016. These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's EDGAR database. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.","Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website.","Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our second quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Marshall will provide a review of our second quarter financial results, Patrick will discuss marketing and clinical highlights, then I will provide our updated financial outlook for 2016. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.","With that, I'll turn it over to Gary.","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on the call today. In the second quarter our company performance was strong, highlighted by sustained procedure growth across multiple geographies, improved margins and continued customer preference for our new products.","Turning first to procedures, global procedure growth for the quarter was nearly 16% with prior quarter trends continuing. Drivers of growth included U.S. general surgery, growth in the use of da Vinci surgical systems outside the United States and modest growth in U.S. urology and gynecology. Inguinal hernia repair and ventral hernia repair growth remains strong, and growth in colorectal surgery was solid.","Procedure growth was variable by country in Europe, with accelerating growth in Germany. Both the Nordics and France experienced modest improvement relative to Q1 growth rates. In the U.K., growth decelerated slightly from Q1. In Asia, procedure growth in Japan was solid again in the quarter while growth in Korea was robust and accelerated over Q1 growth rate. Growth in procedures in China was also strong. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call.","We placed 130 da Vinci systems in the quarter, up from 118 in Q2 of 2015. Our most capable model, da Vinci Xi, represented roughly three quarters of new capital placements. System placement orders included an increase in dual consoles and the addition of integrated Table Motion, leading to higher feature content on average than Q1. Placements in Europe and Asia increased over Q1, while U.S. placements were up slightly up relative to last quarter. Marshall will take you through our finances in more detail later in the call.","Our operations teams have performed well over the past several quarters and remain focused on optimizing our manufacturing design and supply chains. Q2 was another strong quarter of operations efficiency and cost reduction performance. We plan to continue these optimization efforts as they provide significant financial flexibility for us in coming years.","Turning to highlights of our second quarter operating results, procedures grew nearly 16% over the second quarter of last year. We shipped 130 da Vinci surgical systems, up from 118 in the second quarter of 2015. Revenue for the quarter was $670 million, up 14% from the prior year. Pro forma gross profit margin was 71.9% compared to 68% in the second quarter of last year.","Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $339 million, up 14%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $467 million, representing 70% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $297 million in the quarter, up 30% from the second quarter of last year, and pro forma net income was $220 million, up 28% from Q2 of 2015.","Recent launches of Xi products, including Xi intraoperative Table Motion, have been well received, as has expansion of advanced instrument lines, including our stapling products. We are continuing to invest in these line extensions to increase the value and utility of our Xi offering. We have also increased investment in advanced imaging, including significant refinements in our intraoperative 3D endoscopes, image processing for real-time and preoperative images and near infrared fluorescence imaging.","Our single port, or Sp, program is progressing to plan. As Sp approaches clinical readiness, we are conducting in-house validations and initiating work with clinical trial sites and regulatory agencies. We expect first markets to include head and neck surgery, urology and colorectal surgery. Over time, I expect this list of applications to evolve.","As our business has strengthened, we have increased our mid and long-term investments in research and development. We have been increasing our investments in imaging, analytics and new product architectures based on our belief that a substantial opportunity exists to enable better outcomes and to expand access to our technologies globally. We expect quarter-to-quarter variation in spending and increased fixed expenses in the back half of this year. Calvin will take you through our projected spending later in the call.","As we move forward in 2016, we remain focused on the following. First, expanding the use of da Vinci in general surgery and thoracic surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair. Second, advancing our ecosystem, including expanding our Xi line and taking our Sp product into initial clinical use. Third, driving our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia. And finally, assisting our customers in their efforts to maximize the comprehensive value of their programs.","I'll now turn the call over to Marshall who will review financial highlights.","Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Gary. I'll be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis which excludes specified legal settlements and claim accruals, stock-based compensation and amortization of purchased IP. We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there is no confusion.","Second quarter 2016 revenue was $670 million, an increase of 14% compared with $586 million for the second quarter of 2015 and an increase of 13% compared with first quarter revenue of $595 million. Second quarter of 2016 procedures increased nearly 16% compared with the second quarter of 2015, and increased 7% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth has been driven by general surgery in the U.S. and urology worldwide.","Revenue highlights are as follows. Instrument and accessory revenue of $339 million increased 14% compared with the last year, and increased 5% compared with the first quarter of 2016. Growth in instruments and accessory revenue generally reflect procedure growth. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including stocking orders, was approximately $1,810 per procedure. This metric has fluctuated in a tight range over the past couple of years.","The slight decrease in the second quarter relative to the second quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 primarily reflects the impact of customer buying patterns, partially offset by increased usage of our stapling and vessel sealer products. While instrument and accessory usage per procedure has been relatively constant, customer buying patterns fluctuate in the short term.","System revenue of $203 million increased 15% compared with the second quarter of 2015, and increased 37% compared with last quarter. These increases primarily reflect higher average system selling prices, higher system placements, and revenue associated with lease buyout transactions.","130 systems were placed in the second quarter compared with 118 systems in the second quarter of 2015 and 110 systems last quarter. 15 systems were placed under operating lease transactions in the current quarter, compared with 19 last quarter, and 5 systems in the second quarter of 2015. As a reminder, revenue on operating lease transactions is recognized ratably over the life of the lease.","As of the end of the second quarter, there were 66 systems out in the field under operating leases. We generated approximately $4 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter, compared with $1 million in second quarter of 2015, and $4 million in the last quarter. We also generated approximately $13 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with $6 million in the first quarter, and $4 million in the second quarter of last year. We exclude the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts from our system ASP calculations.","Globally, our average system selling price of $1.56 million was approximately $60,000 higher than both the second quarter of 2015 and last quarter. The increase compared with prior quarters reflect a higher mix of dual console systems and sales of Table Motion. We introduced intraoperative Table Motion in Europe in the third quarter of 2015, and early this year in the U.S. During the first and second quarters, we recognize $1 million and $6 million of Table Motion software, respectively. Both the mix of dual consoles and number of Table Motion placements will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.","Service revenue of $128 million increased 13% year-over-year, and increased approximately 3% compared with the first quarter of 2016. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect growth in our installed base of da Vinci systems.","Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. Second quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $185 million increased 10% compared with $168 million for the second quarter of 2015, and increased 13% compared with the first quarter of $164 million. The increase compared with the previous year is comprised of 16% growth in recurring revenue, which is driven by procedure growth of 25%, and increased systems revenue of 2%. The increase compared to the first quarter reflects systems revenue growth of 30% and recurring revenue growth of 4%.","Outside the U.S., we placed 51 systems in the second quarter, compared with 46 systems in the second quarter of 2015, and 36 systems last quarter. Current quarter systems sales included 22 into Europe, 4 into China, and 13 into Japan. System placements outside the U.S. will continue to be lumpy, as some of these markets are in the early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations.","Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. The pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of 2016 was 71.9%, compared with 68% for the second quarter of 2015, and 70% for the first quarter of 2016. Compared with the first quarter of 2016, the higher gross margin reflects reduction in product costs, favorable costs associated with our scope exchange program, manufacturing efficiencies, and higher dual console mix, lease buyouts and Table Motion sales.","Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of systems and instrument accessory revenue, costs associated with our scope exchange program, our ability to further reduce product costs, improve manufacturing efficiency and, in the long term, the potential reinstatement of the medical device tax.","Pro forma operating expenses increased 9% compared with the second quarter of 2015, and decreased nearly $2 million compared with last quarter. The increase over the second quarter of 2015 reflects increased investments in advanced imaging, advanced instrumentation, and next-generation robotics, and increased head count. The decrease compared with the prior quarter reflects lower payroll taxes, partially offset by increased head count \u2013 head count costs particularly in our product operations areas.","Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 27.8%, compared with an effective tax rate of 25.6% for the second quarter of 2015, and 27.4% last quarter. The increase in the tax rate compared with 2015 reflects one-time benefits reflected in 2015. Our second quarter 2016 pro forma net income was $220 million or $5.62 per share compared with $173 million or $4.57 per share for the second quarter of 2015, and $170 million or $4.42 per share for the first quarter of 2016. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends.","I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $185 million or $4.71 per share for the second quarter of 2016, compared with $135 million or $3.56 per share for the second quarter of 2015, and $136 million or $3.54 per share for the first quarter of 2016. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $4.2 billion, up from $3.8 billion as of March 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises. As our cash builds, we'll continue to evaluate our approach to capital allocation.","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights.","Patrick Clingan - Finance Director","Thanks, Marshall. Of our second quarter procedure growth of nearly 16%, U.S. procedures grew approximately 13% and OUS procedures grew approximately 25%. During the first half of 2016, global procedure growth increased to approximately 16%, compared to approximately 15% in the second half of 2015, and approximately 13% in the first half of 2015. We expect our procedure growth rate to moderate in the second half of 2016.","In the United States, second quarter procedure growth continued to outpace our expectations. Second quarter growth in our mature procedures slowed modestly compared to the first quarter. General and thoracic procedure growth remained robust.","In U.S. urology, second quarter growth in da Vinci prostatectomy and kidney procedures slowed modestly compared to the first quarter of 2016. We continue to believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market and we expect prostatectomy growth to return to levels similar to prostate cancer diagnoses over time.","In U.S. gynecology, second quarter procedures grew modestly year-over-year, growth led by malignant and complex benign hysterectomy. Continuing the recent trend, we estimate a larger proportion of da Vinci hysterectomy procedures were performed by gynecologic oncologists during the second quarter. Similar to the first quarter, U.S. single-site gynecology procedures declined compared to the second quarter of 2015. In the U.S., procedures for benign gynecologic conditions slightly grew during the first half of 2016, exceeding our expectations.","Second quarter U.S. general surgery procedure adoption remained strong, led by robust growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures. Hernia repair continues to contribute the largest volume of new procedures in general surgery, and surgeon retention and expansion remains encouraging. Cholecystectomy procedures slightly declined in the quarter, with growth in multi-port procedures nearly offsetting declines in single-site procedures.","Second quarter was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications and presentations evaluating da Vinci surgery. Of these, I have selected a few studies that you may find interesting. Intuitive is among the founding partners for the American Hernia Society Quality Collaborative initiative, or the AHSQC, and this quarter, two preliminary analyses comparing da Vinci to open or laparoscopic complex ventral hernia repair were brought forward.","The first was a podium presentation at the American Hernia Society annual meeting by Dr. Poulose from Vanderbilt, comparing da Vinci to open retromuscular hernia repair. This patient matched analysis involving data from multiple institutions found that da Vinci reduced hospital length of stay by three days without significant differences in surgical site infections, readmissions, or reoperations.","In addition, a paper was published in Surgical Endoscopy by Dr. Warren and colleagues from the University of South Carolina. The authors used their institution's submissions to AHSQC to compare da Vinci to laparoscopic retromuscular hernia repair. Their study found that with a longer operative time, da Vinci reduced the hospital length of stay by one day and also enabled a greater percentage of patients to receive fascial closure and extraperitoneal placement of mesh, to which the authors attribute a reduced likelihood of hernia recurrence or bowel adhesions","Next, as Marshall mentioned earlier, sales of our intraoperative Table Motion technology were strong in the quarter. During the quarter, the first clinical publication reviewing this technology was published in the international journal of colorectal disease by Dr. Morelli and colleagues from the University of Pisa. In a small case series of colorectal resections, surgeons used Table Motion to reposition the patient in an average of three to four times per procedure.","The authors suggested that the technology may improve patient safety by reducing the amount of time in extreme patient positions and stated, \"the da Vinci Xi plus the new operating table gives the potential to optimize gravity exposure, and provides a quick access to different surgical objectives that is important in colorectal surgery.\"","Turning abroad, procedure growth outside of the United States was approximately 25% in the second quarter, led by the global adoption of da Vinci prostatectomy, with solid contributions from kidney procedures and colorectal resections. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, second quarter procedure growth improved in Europe and was similar to the first quarter in Asia. Outside of the U.S., second quarter procedure performance varied by country, with strong growth in Germany, China and South Korea.","In certain countries where our urology business has become more mature, such as the United Kingdom and Nordic countries, procedures continue to grow at a slower rate. Emerging procedures are in an early stage in these markets, and we are engaged with a broad range of stakeholders working to enable procedure adoption into gynecologic and general surgery. In Japan, partial Nephrectomy growth accelerated in the first quarter following approval of national reimbursement.","During the quarter, a meta-analysis sponsored by the South Korean National Evidence-based healthcare Collaborating Agency, or NECA, was published in The Annals of Surgical Treatment and Research. It reviewed da Vinci and laparoscopic colon cancer resection. The meta-analysis included nearly 700 patients and found that with a longer operative time, da Vinci surgery resulted in a more rapid return of normal diet and bowel function, lower blood loss, and a shorter hospital stay. This government-sponsored health technology assessment adds to the number of HCAs has have evaluated da Vinci surgery and a broad range of procedures over the years.","I will conclude my remarks by highlighting one of the largest population base studies on the impact of da Vinci prostatectomy published in the Journal of Urology by Dr. Pearson and colleagues from the University of Chicago. Using data from the national cancer database, this study includes nearly 100,000 prostatectomy patients treated with either da Vinci or open surgery. After matching the patient populations for risk factors, da Vinci surgery was shown to reduce positive surgical margins across low, medium, and high risk cohorts, as well as reduce use of radiation therapy, 30-day readmissions and 30-day mortality compared to open surgery.","Dr. Koch from Indiana University published a letter alongside the study titled Robotic versus Open Prostatectomy, End of Controversy, in which he stated that any debate over robotic prostatectomy should be put to rest.","This concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call over to Calvin.","Calvin Darling - Senior Director-Finance, Investor Relations","Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2016. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full-year 2016 procedure growth of 12% to 14% above the approximately 652,000 procedures performed in 2015. We are increasing our estimate for 2016. We now anticipate full year 2016 procedure growth within a range of 14% to 15%.","In regards to certain forward-looking metrics, we have the following expectations. We anticipate fewer lease buyouts and lower upgrade and other system revenue in Q3 and Q4 than we saw in Q2. Second half 2016 system ASPs will likely be lower than Q2 driven by product and channel mix. We expect a directionally higher proportion of our system placements in Q3 and Q4 to come from operating leases than we saw in Q2.","Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 69% and 70% of net revenue. We are now increasing our estimate. We now expect full year 2016 pro forma gross profit to be within a range of between 70% and 71% of net revenue.","Turning to operating expenses. Based upon investments we are making in key areas of the business, we expect expense growth will accelerate in the second half of 2016. We continue to forecast pro forma 2016 operating expenses to grow between 12% and 15% above 2015 levels.","Consistent with our last call, we expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2016, compared to $168 million in 2015. We expect other income to total approximately $30 million in 2016, higher than the $20 million to $25 million forecast on our last call, due primarily to higher interest income.","With regard to income tax, we continue to expect our 2016 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5% and 28.5% of pre-tax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits.","That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operation Instructions] One moment, please. Okay. And our first question comes from the line of Ben Andrew of William Blair. Please go ahead.","Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Gary, maybe just start out by talking about the increased investments in OpEx in the back half. Obviously, you guys have always been looking for opportunities there, but talk a bit more granularly about where those investments are coming and when we may see some payoffs. I recall it took about a year for the European investments to kick in.","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. As we've said before, I think the messaging here has been pretty consistent. Some of the investments are in technology, things like Sp starting to move into field-based investment and scale rather than just the upfront D. So you're seeing some growth in that. We have some other technology investments that are a little broader. We've talked about imaging, and that's kind of a multistep process. Some of it is on the acquisition side, new kinds of endoscopes, some of it's on the software side, and some of it is in the ability to enhance our florescence imaging portfolio. Some of those things will become commercial in future quarters. Some of them are a little longer, multiyear types of investments.","With regard to investments outside of R&D, you know we've been growing our investments in regions around the world where we think there's real opportunity from Japan to Germany and France and others. That'll continue. I think that be some of those investments are doing well for us. We have opportunity to perform better than we have thus far. And so the right kinds of investments there are sometimes in clinical data and clinical trials, sometimes in other market development efforts, sometimes in our resources and head count. And, again, those things can be effective from a couple of quarters out to multiyears out, depending on what the activity is.","Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then two more quick ones for me, please. In Europe, you talked about some of the investments in emerging procedures. Is that a protracted multiyear process to move beyond urology and the initial GYN procedures that you've kind of started to mature in certain geographies?","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think that you can see early success sooner than years, but I think broad adoption in many of these places is a multiyear process. It starts with leading surgeons and key opinion leaders and surgical society endorsement and goes from there. In some cases, we need interactions with payers and reimbursement. So I don't think have you to wait years to see the early indicators but full penetration is often more than a year process.","Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. And then finally, in the Sp, you did say head and neck. Can you be more precise? Would that be sleep apnea or is this more thyroidectomy? Do you have some initial thoughts on where specifically, please? Thank you.","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so I think in the beginning it's really starting in the markets we're already participating in, so transoral more than, for example, thyroidectomy. I think this is more around surgery in the throat. And for sure there's cancer indications for that. There may be benign indications. Part of what we're talking to regulatory bodies about are clinical requirements for them to make some of those assessments and varies from what happens in Europe to what happens in the U.S. to what happens in Asia. So that will play out in time. But think of head and neck starting point as TORS. It may have other applications in neck surgery over time. I think that Sp is a pretty powerful platform, and where we start and where it evolves to will differ as surgeons get a chance to experience it for themselves.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And the next question is from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please go ahead","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. First question, Gary, can you maybe just provide a little bit more clarity on Sp timelines? I understand you're lining up the initial sites now. It sounds like from some of the discussions, you're really not expecting that to be much of a revenue contributor in 2017. So can you maybe just talk a little bit about how we should think about the rollout next year?","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. So, first step here is clearances and some clinical data to support that clearance. 2017 will be really focused on data generation. While I expect some revenue, I don't think it will be a material revenue contributor in 2017. A lot of that will be building the foundation, the evidence foundation, some of the clinical work, and then I think 2018, it starts to become more of a material contributor for us. And as we get our clearances and start to solidify that timeline, we'll color that (30:45) up more for you.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then switching over to hernia, I think you talked in the past about doing some initial trial work. Can you maybe talk a little bit about where that stands in terms of any patient enrollment and how we should think about timelines around the trial for 30-day, one-year, and two-year follow-up?","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll turn that to Patrick.","Patrick Clingan - Finance Director","Yeah. So, we have a number of different initiatives ongoing as it relates to sponsoring evidence development in hernia repair. The two presentation and publication that I mentioned on the call from the AHSQC is among the investments we've made in helping support surgeons bring forward the outcomes that they're getting with da Vinci compared to the alternatives.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just last one. You had noted some delays in Europe around tenders from competitive bake off (31:38). Just anything changed from your perspective this quarter?","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, nothing new to note. I think that tender offers in competitive interaction is the new normal. I think our teams are doing great. I think their performance has been effective. I think we're communicating well. We have a broad portfolio that allows us to engage the customer at different levels depending on what their needs are. So nothing new to report.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question from the line of David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Just a couple of quick questions from me. Gary, one for you and then kind of a clarifying financial question. So, Gary, I appreciate the incrementally more detail you gave us in the pipeline this quarter. So two pieces. First is analytics. Can you just give us a broader sense of what the word analytics means to you in Intuitive? And then on imaging, is the next disclosure we're likely to see in advanced imaging an approval or simply an announcement of an imaging clinical study? And then I had a quick financial follow-up.","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think analytics has multiple components in it. As you may know, the majority of our systems are real-time connected to the Internet today. I think over 90% of systems are online. They report back information to us mostly around the system performance itself, what it is itself is doing, rather than, say, patient information. That data can be turned into insights for the company and for our customers and we have been doing that for some time now. So there's that type of analytics.","Going forward, I think that as our computational structures get more powerful, we can bring some of that intelligence more real-time. So rather than offline insights, you can start generating real-time insights. That's a multi-year pathway. I think it's interesting and challenging. I think there's long-term potential in it. But we're moving down that pathway, making sure that we have good access and fast access and low latency access to our devices in the field, and then bringing to bear information that can help surgeons as they're performing the procedure. And you'll see from us in future years a series of products that come out using that set of kind of digital pipeline.","Turning to imaging, there are a couple of different things. We are releasing endoscopes at a fairly regular clip and improving that set of technologies. We made a technology change in the type of imaging we use when we switched to Xi that has allowed for faster iteration for us in the kinds of imaging we do. So there's that kind of thing that's going on at kind of a regular heartbeat. Our customers are pretty well aware of where those things are. There are other things that we've talked about, other indications for fluorescence. We're more likely to talk to you about what's happening clinically there than to announce a launch, so you'll have some warning prior to launch.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just, Calvin or Marshall, just thinking about the systems guidance into the back half of the year, a couple of components. I note this quarter that operating leases were down for the first time in several quarters, yet I think you said operating leases will pick back up in the back half of the year, so sort of what's the driver there? And then just on mix or ASPs going lower for systems in the back half, I'm assuming that's tied to your view of different geographies, less Xis or less consoles, dual consoles. Just give us some flavor on sort of those two dynamics, why you're so confident operating leases tick back up and ASPs tick down? Thank you.","Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. So philosophically, first of all, we provide our customers leases to provide some flexibility in how they get into robotics, and it's proven out to be \u2013 to work out pretty well for both them and us. This last quarter, we just saw a fewer number than the previous quarter. The previous quarter, if you recall, was 19 (35:40). We would expect it to be more like Q1 than it was Q2, so that's the increase that Calvin was referring to.","As far as ASPs go, seasonally, systems revenue is stronger in Q4. Systems drive a slightly lower gross margin than do instruments and accessories, so that mix alone will cause margins to go down. We also would expect a little bit better performance, again, due to seasonal factors in the non-U.S. markets, or the outside of the U.S., and so that mix also will drive revenues down a little. And then we expect to continue to see growth in stapling and vessel sealing in our newer technology products and those also drive slightly lower margins. So a lot of the mix will cause margins to go down in the next couple of quarters.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Marshall, none of these things seem to me to be new dynamics. These seem to be ordinary operating dynamics for Intuitive. Is that sort of how you see it?","Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","For the most part, the seasonal things are. I think the new thing is as we drive the new product revenue, that's increases over previous quarters.","Calvin Darling - Senior Director-Finance, Investor Relations","And, David, if we're talking about margins, the one thing that was kind of different in the second quarter was on the service side. You saw a pretty marked increase in the service gross profit in the second quarter. And during the quarter we were able to utilize more refurbished scopes for our scope replacement program with customers. We're going to be expanding the program as the base builds out in the second half and it's going to require a much higher proportion of new scopes at higher cost and lower margin to replenish, so that's something that will be a headwind in the second half.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Can you hear me okay?","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We can.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Good afternoon. So, Marshall, just to continue on this conversation around margins, you know, because last quarter you commented on mix on how you didn't think you'd be able to sustain 70% and now the guidance is going up on gross margin. And I understand there's a lot of moving pieces here. So just from a top-down perspective, from where you sit today, when you look forward at the business, should we be thinking about low 70%s gross margin as something that can be sustained over time? Just give us a sense of what you've just been learning here in the first half of this year as it relates to a more sustainable outlook for gross margins longer term.","Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I think we've given you the guidance for the remainder of the year. We think that that's the best crystal ball that we have at this point. There are a lot of moving parts and it's hard to predict exactly where each one will come out. And so I'll leave it at that. I don't want to get into where we think it will go long term. Long term, those same moving parts will cause us to not have high confidence in exactly where they'll come out, although know that we'll manage things very diligently. As you know, last year we put in some programs to reduce the costs of Xi and Xi related product, and those have been successful, and that's part of what we're seeing here in the year to year improvement.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But I mean, in terms of thinking about the biggest moving pieces, what are the things that you have us focus on as we think a little bit longer term when we try to consider what a sustainable gross margin would look like for the rest of the company?","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I don't think we've put a stake in the ground and I don't think that I'm prepared to do that right now.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Well, no, anyway, we could take it offline. But thank you for that. And then, Gary, one other thing I wanted to ask about \u2013 two quick things. One, on just the eye-popping number of $4.2 billion now in cash on the balance sheet, and you get the question quite frequently, but I'm just curious now with this almost 20% of the market cap in cash, are there sizable M&A targets out there that you're considering and that's why there hasn't been anything incremental done with the cash? Just would love to get be an updated view there.","And then you mentioned on the topic of advanced imaging and timelines for future products, you said some of these approvals could come in future quarters. I was just curious. When you made that comment, were you talking about advanced imaging specifically?","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, let's speak to cash and then we'll go to the organic side. We look at the cash and think we're at an interesting point in the company's evolution here. On the one hand, I think that customer acceptance of our products has been really high. We're seeing, I think, great momentum on the clinical side in terms of clinical acceptance. We have a couple of things going on. We have some new platforms we want to bring to the market that, I think, are outstanding, are very well done and well-conceived. That will take some investment for us to do.","The other thing is that we see proliferation of folks who want to enter the market with competitive offerings. And that's both an opportunity for us and a requirement for some diligence. And the opportunity is some of those technologies are interesting and may be interesting to us. Other ones are things where we may want to speed up or adjust our strategy as the market evolves.","As we think about the cash broadly, our first thought is can we use the cash productively to drive future growth organically? Our second thought is are there M&A opportunities that for the long term are good for the company? The answer to both of those are there opportunities? The third are, are there other ways we can deploy capital with a long-term view for the benefit of shareholders? And that might be in buybacks or dividends or other things.","So we're disciplined about thinking about capital allocation. I think this is a special time in the company's history and we're walking through how we think about cash with a fair amount of discipline and diligence. You had asked a question on product releases. Why don't you ask it again just to make sure I hit it.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sure. You made a comment about the timing of new product releases and you said some will take many of these years and some of those approvals could come in future quarters. And I was just curious as to whether that was a broad comment or whether you were specifically speaking to advanced imaging.","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","A broad comment. There are some imaging things that are kind of nearer product things that look a lot like what we have today and there are some long-term imaging investments. And so the submission pipeline and our regulatory interactions are a pretty full pipeline.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Larry Keusch of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you. Gary, just wanted to pick up on your last answer on the imaging. If you were to sort of think about all the efforts in analytics and imaging that the company is working on and you were to take this out several years, what would be the benefits to the surgeon at that time with these technologies embedded versus what's available today in Xi?","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yep. It's a good question. There's a couple of things that I think drive some of the variability that you see in surgery. So it's really interesting. If you ask the question and there's some research out there \u2013 surgery, in general, not just Intuitive, how much better in terms of outcomes and lower complications is the top 10th percentile surgeon versus the average surgery surgeon? And the spread is quite big as you look at that. There's a lot of variability in surgical performance.","And so you ask the question, what drives that variability? Why? And some of it, not all of it, but some of it is that what you're looking for in visual images is subtle. Where are nerves? Where are cancer boundaries? Where are ureters? What's the right tissue to section plane? Those things are subtle and take a long time for people to internalize, and the best do it better.","And so what we're trying to do here is find technologies that make it easier for other surgeons to be as good as the best. And we think that matters. Imaging will play a large role in it. So going forward a decade, what you'd really like to be able to do is mark tissues of interest in real time. Paint for the surgeon what the elements and boundaries are that allow for a good dissection or the proper resection or the best margin performance. And that's what's really directing our investments.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. That's really helpful. And then for Marshall, I guess, two quick ones. The per procedure revenue certainly was at a lower level than we've seen in some time. You definitely mentioned some customer buying patterns in there. So if you could just help us understand what that means. And then on China you did a number of systems in the quarter. Just wanted to figure out where we were with the quota. Are those kind of one-offs now in any given quarter?","Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So as it relates to my comments on customer buying patterns, we're able to measure or look at what happens with instrument accessory usage. And from that, what we've determined is that the usage really hasn't changed a lot surgery by surgery. And so when we see fluctuations and what they're buying versus what they're using, there are times when they use more than they buy and times when they buy more than they use. And it just happens that \u2013 and it's going to fluctuate quarter to quarter, and that was my comment on the short term. And so what we saw this quarter was they used more than they purchased. And so I don't have a great explanation for it beyond that. That's just what we see.","On the other hand, we have do have distributors that buy in bulk because they're holding inventory to sell to their end customers, and we do see fluctuations in those numbers as well. So the combination of the two, direct hospitals that we sell to as well as distributors, we can actually measure or identify what is customer buying pattern. I don't think \u2013 we don't see anything there that alarms us in one way or another.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And China?","Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","China, China we sold four systems this quarter. Those systems were sold to military hospitals. The quota that we were selling to and couple of past years expired at the end of December. And we're awaiting for the government to approve a new quota. We don't have great information as to when that will occur.","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Might describe the differences between military hospitals and non-military hospitals and vis-\u00e0-vis quotas.","Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. The quota system that we had was for public hospitals, and there is a process by which we're classified as high technology and there's a quota established by the government. It's in conjunction with their normal budget process. Their normal budget process this year has been delayed, so that's why we're not sure exactly when they'll approve that and then when we'll get a quota for it. Military hospitals buy independent of those public hospitals, and we've been selling to military hospitals all along, frankly, and have a number of placements at them.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. Very helpful. Thank you.","Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yep.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. Next question from the line of Brandon Henry of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Obviously, Intuitive has posted better than expected gross margins in the first half of the year. And I think we're all trying to figure out how sustainable that is. So could you help us try to quantify or maybe bucket into several categories, what were the drivers of the year-over-year increase in gross margins in the first half of the year for 2016 versus the first half of the year in 2015?","Calvin Darling - Senior Director-Finance, Investor Relations","Yeah. I'm not sure we can list out item by item a specific contribution, but we have been focusing obviously on reducing costs for quite some time and managing our fixed costs, and we're really pleased with the progress. We look at where we sit, six months into the year we're at 71% on a year-to-date basis, and that coincides with the upper end of the 70% to 71% guidance range. But Q2 was an exceptionally strong quarter for gross margin. And I think we wanted to leave some specific comments there.","Specifically on the product side, we would expect a higher proportion of sales of newer products, as was described in lower proportion of dual console sales, and probably more sales through distributors at lower pricing and lower margins. And I think I already mentioned previously, on the service side, we had some real benefits on the scope exchange in the second quarter, which are unlikely to continue in the second half.","Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then separately \u2013 I think you guys mentioned some slight slowing in prostatectomy growth in 2Q. Can you give us some more details on this comment and kind of discuss what's implied for prostatectomy growth in the updated guidance range? Are we now through the bolus of patients that previously deferred treatment? Thanks.","Patrick Clingan - Finance Director","Hey, Brandon. It's tough to know where exactly you are with the patient population that may have deferred treatment. What we saw in the quarter was just a slight slowing of growth from what we saw in the first quarter and the second half of 2015, or frankly all throughout 2015. How much of that is associated with having worked through any potential bolus that may be out there is difficult to predict, though, I think as you've heard us say a few times in the past, over time we do expect that prostatectomy volumes are likely to return towards the rate of diagnoses, and our recent history and the recent growth rates we've seen in 2015 or the first half of 2016, we believe, exceed that growth rate.","Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And the next question from the line of Rick Wise of Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon, everybody. Let me start off with procedures again. I just wanted to make sure I understood the comment about the second half procedure growth slowing. Yes, I see that comps are modestly tougher. Is it something about OUS? Is it the urology sort of recovery, if you will, slowing? Can you just help us better understand your thinking there?","Patrick Clingan - Finance Director","Hey, Rick. Yeah, you mentioned the growth rate comparisons get a little harder in the second half of the year. The mature procedure contributions that we saw in the first half of the year we don't think will be as strong in the second half of the year. We continue to expect and we'll continue to drive growth in U.S. general surgery and in our overseas markets in urology and early stage of urgent procedures.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Back on gross margin. Clearly, it sounds from your comments that Table Motion adoption, which has been, in your words, well received, has been one factor helping margins. Where are we in sort of the penetration of the installed base, I mean, 3% converted? 50%? And, is this a tailwind now \u2013 leaving aside all of the other moving factors, is this a positive tailwind now for a year or two or three?","Calvin Darling - Senior Director-Finance, Investor Relations","Yeah, I don't think I want to get into specific units on this. We're really pleased with the progress we're making and the strong market response from the customers. I think Marshall mentioned in his script we had $6 million of revenue attributable to Table Motion. It was roughly split 50\/50 between new installations and systems in the field. So, again, it was a strong quarter, but I think we'll see how it heads.","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The history of selling back into the installed base rather than new installs is that you have a few quarters of strong performance and then it tends to tail off. Folks who are going to be interested in it tend to move forward quickly. And then mostly it will be a go forward, so you can look at the history to sort of give you a guide as to how much that is.","Calvin Darling - Senior Director-Finance, Investor Relations","Yeah. And we do have roughly around 750 or so da Vinci Xis out in the world at this point in time, and we've made some progress on that. There's still some more out there.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got you. And just one last one for you, Gary, if I could. At SAGES this year, it was very clear that Intuitive's messaging around looking at total procedure cost in the hospital for robotics and how much economic sense it made \u2013 robotics makes, when I listen to the looming competition from Medtronic at their Analyst Day and your friends at Verb, they're very focused on lowering per procedure robotic costs to, it seems like, in their words, laparoscopic levels. How do you react, how do you deal, how do you compete with that approach given their entrenched instrument capabilities and will your new platforms address that per procedure cost aspect of positioning you to better address some of these factors? Thanks so much.","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. I think the first thing of some of the messaging coming out around opportunities on price, on per procedure price, I think there's a big challenge for new entrants there, which is what benefit do you bring at which price point? So I think you're going to have to show benefit over laparoscopy, what can be done that lap can't do? And that's going to require some innovation and some technology, and that technology is going to have to be paid for. So I think over time, folks are going to have to come out and show what it is that they plan to do to make that happen.","As we look at it, I do think there are opportunities for Intuitive to manage different price pints. We have already in terms of our capital line, and it's also true in our instrument line and we can continue to do that. So I think customers will have choice, and the choice will be at what price point do they want to enter and what benefit and value do they find at that price point. Intuitive will offer multiple price points. We will give them that opportunity. We have already and we will continue to. And what value they find at what price point will be their decision. And there's so far been really just one or two companies who have been out there having those conversations and driving it. I think we understand it reasonably well.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Appreciate the (54:51) perspective, Gary.","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question, please.","Operator","One moment. And the next question is from the line of Tao Levy of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Your utilization per system in the U.S. keeps on hitting new highs. And so I'm just wondering, where is the increase in capacity that the hospitals are finding? Where is that coming from? Are they utilizing the workweek schedules a little bit more effectively versus in prior years?","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Tao.","Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hey.","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think it's more than one thing for me. One is we're seeing health systems, integrated delivery networks, optimizing the placement of their products and optimizing the flow of patients and surgeons around that product. And so that's kind of an operational efficiency at the hospital level or health system level that has been driving it, and I think it's great. It's been great for our customers and we support it. I think that the second thing is that some of the new procedure categories we're coming into allow for higher volume of procedures and sign up single sites, so more repeatable, shorter durations give you higher utilization, just kind of the nature of the mix of product that's coming in.","And lastly, I think in some of the markets we're seeing referral consolidations. So low-volume surgeons are referring to higher-volume surgeons, essentially passing patients to those who do more, and that also drives up utilization. So there are kind of multiple factors there that have supported the growth. I don't know that it goes on forever. I don't think there's infinite growth in utilization possible, but so far, so good.","Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Got you. And then just lastly, the percent of your applicable procedures that are currently using the robotic vessel sealer or stapler, do you have sort of a rough metric of where that stands today that you can share?","Calvin Darling - Senior Director-Finance, Investor Relations","Yeah. Hey, Tao. Certainly, we have seen growth in our vessel sealer and stapler adoption each quarter over the past few years and particularly in procedures where there's a high value associated with using those, whether it be in colorectal resections, even in some gynecologic procedures with vessel sealers. There's still a lot of runway left. And in particular, as you think about the wide reloads that are only available on our Xi, and as the Xi installed base becomes larger, opening up more opportunities for those to be used in thoracic procedures, there's going to be plenty of runway ahead as the installed base continues to move towards our newest technology.","Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","You don't have like a procedure \u2013 I'm sorry, a percent that you can share just to get a sense of how long that runway is?","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Not at this time.","Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Operator, we'll take one more question from one more questioner and...","Operator","Okay. Thank you. Okay. And the next question is from the line of Richard Newitter of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Rich S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just had a quick one, a follow-up on your Table Motion. It sounds like that product is certainly graining traction, and I was just curious to know, is this feature being used in the way that you would have expected it to? And what I'd really like to know is do you think, or can you tell us what procedures or new incremental procedures does this potentially open for you or could you begin to see it open up where you aren't already being used today? Thank you.","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think that early experience has been that it's well received, particularly by multi-quadrant general surgeons, which is really where Xi was positioned and one of the big motivations for Table Motion. As frequently happens in this space, something that's a fundamental capability that's good in one place tends to have application in others, and I suspect we'll see that. And as we get more data on it, we're happy to share it with you.","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That was our last question. As we said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flows during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing value by enabling surgeons to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and","I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference.

Intuitive was founded on the mission to expand the availability of minimally invasive surgery, increase its efficacy and decrease its invasiveness, and the fourth quarter capped a strong year in pursuit of this mission led by continued growth in da Vinci procedures and expansion of our installed base. Annualized global procedure growth was approximately 15% in the fourth quarter and 15% for the full year. Trends and procedures were consistent through the year with increased use of da Vinci in general surgery in the United States, continued growth in neurology in Japan and Europe, and multi-specialty growth in Korea and China. Mature procedures in the United States including prostatectomy and hysterectomy outperformed our initial expectations, largely due to macro trends and diagnosis of prostate cancer and treatment patterns for hysterectomy. Procedure growth in Europe, Korea, and China were healthy through the year. Procedure adoption in Japan was solid for those procedures that have been reimbursed. Calvin will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call.","Our capital placement performance in 2016 strengthened over 2015 resulting in a growth of total placements from 492 in 2015 to 537 this year. Net of trade-ins and retirements, our clinical install base grew from 3597 to 3919 in the year. Our range of capabilities and price points, and our ability to be flexible with acquisition methods has allowed us to meet varying customer needs in a competitive capital environment. Customers have chosen our most capable system to da Vinci Xi and roughly three quarters of new capital placements for the full year. da Vinci Xi is well matched with procedure opportunities in thoracic and general surgical procedures such as colon and rectal surgeries. US capital placement stood out in the year, while capital placements in Asia were consistent with prior trends. As we've said in prior calls, system quotas in China and reimbursements in Japan temper placement growth and make it hard to predict.","Turning to Europe, while procedure growth was solid in 2016, system placements declined versus 2015 for reasons that vary by country. And our largest European markets we believe the long-term procedure and system opportunity is significant, with further adoption benefiting from additional economic validation in mature procedures like prostatectomy and from country-specific clinical and economic data for emerging procedures like colorectal surgery. Overall, despite the slowdown in capital in 2016, we are positive about our long-term prospects in Europe and continue to develop our organization and invest in European clinical and economic data to support our customers.","Turning to highlights of our fourth quarter operating results. Procedures grew approximately 15% over the fourth quarter of last year. We shipped 163 da Vinci surgical systems, up from 158 in the fourth quarter of 2015. Revenue for the quarter was 757 million, up 12% from prior year. Pro forma gross profit was 71.1% compared to 69.9% in the fourth quarter of last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to 386 million, up 19%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was 521 million, representing 69% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of 320 million in the quarter, up 9% from the fourth quarter of last year and pro forma net income was 242 million. up 8% from Q4 of 2015. Highlights of the full-year of 2016 are as follows. Procedures grew approximately 15% over a full-year 2015. We shipped 537 systems in 2016, up from 492 in the prior year. Revenue for the year was $2.7 billion, up 13%. Pro forma gross margin was 71.6% for the full year compared to 68.2% in 2015. Total recurring revenue for the year was $1.9 billion dollars and represented 71% of total revenue. Pro-forma operating profit for the year was $1.2 billion, up 22% from 2015 and pro forma net income was $879 million, up 20%.","As we mentioned in mid-December, our Board of Directors increased our stock buyback authorization to $3 billion and we announced today an accelerated repurchase program in the amount of $2 billion. We retain the flexibility to act on the remaining $1 billion in authorization in parallel with the ASR. Overall, we are committed to the thoughtful return of excess capital to shareholders and believe our buyback program will serve shareholders well. Marshall will take you through our finances in greater detail shortly. As our business is strengthened, we have increased our mid and long term investments in creating our next generation of products and services. These investments are based on our belief that substantial opportunity exists to enable more minimally invasive surgery, better outcomes and to expand access to our technologies globally. Our current da Vinci Sp system met its development goals in the fourth quarter and we initiated its first clinical feasibility study. As we've discussed on prior calls, we plan first markets to include head and neck surgery, urology and colorectal surgery. Sp is a platform technology that allows high dexterity access with great 3D vision to confine surgical spaces. Early surgeon response to Sp in the trials has been very positive. We anticipate initiating a Sp IDE trial in the United States for Transoral Robotic Surgery as well as submitting a 510-K for urologic applications both in the first half of 2017.","We're also making good progress on our flexible robotics platform. First targeted to address the acute need and diagnosis of lung cancer, one of the most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer in the world and for which early detection is important. The technology underpinning the system is based on computer controlled catheters, advanced image processing and sophisticated sensing. As we mentioned previously, this system is in its early stages of our human clinical experience. This experience has been compelling and our design and operations teams are working hard to incorporate feedback and complete its production design and supply chain optimization. Given the long-term opportunity for this system in lung cancer detection and other potential applications, we've been growing our team in this space. We do not anticipate revenue from this product in 2017. Imaging and intelligent algorithms offer significant opportunities to enhance surgeon capabilities. Our investments include hardware and image processing updates to our Xi platform to enhance imaging performance and reduce costs. We're also investing in contrast agents for specific anatomical structures recently announcing our plan to commence Phase 1 trials for the ureter imaging agent compatible with our Firefly imaging hardware and software. ","Imaging and intelligent algorithms work also includes processing and presentation of pre-operative imaging and other offline data for use during surgery, sometimes called augmented reality or mixed reality technology. We've been working on these technologies for several years and more recently with our partner InTouch Health. Our next step in mixed reality technology is working in prototype form in laboratory settings today and will move towards first human use in 2018. Bringing new platforms to the market represents a significant investment and we expect to invest up to $80 million more in 2017 than our typical operating expense run rate growth. These investments are focused on clinical and economic data, particularly in Europe and Asia expansion of our operations capability to include da Vinci Sp, investments in our diagnostics platform and continued investments in imaging. Calvin will take you through the spending implications later in the call. In closing, entering 2017, we are focused on the following. First, continued adoption of da Vinci in general surgery. Second, continued development of European markets and access to customers in Asia. Third, advancing our new platforms; imaging, advanced instruments, da Vinci Sp and diagnostic platform progress. And finally support for additional clinical and economic validation by global region.","I'll turn the call over to Marshall who will review financial highlights.","Marshall Mohr","Thank you, Gary. I would describe our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis which excludes specified legal settlements and claim accruals, stock-based compensation and amortization of purchased IP. We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro-forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results in our website so that there is no confusion. Consistent with our preliminary press release on January 11, fourth quarter 2016 revenue of 757 million, an increase of 12% compared with 677 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 and an increase of 11% compared with the third quarter revenue of 683 million. Fourth quarter 2016 procedures increased 15% compared with fourth quarter of 2015 and increased 9% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth relative to last year and the third quarter has been driven by general surgery in US and urology worldwide. The increase relative to the prior quarter also reflects procedure seasonality.","Revenue highlights are a follows. Instrument and accessory revenue of 386 million increased 19% compared with last year and increased 11% compared with the third quarter of 2016. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including initial stocking orders was approximately 1,900 per procedure compared with $1,840 last year and $1,870 last quarter. The increase relative to the fourth quarter of 2015 primarily reflects increased sales of our stapling and vessel sealing products. The increase compared with the third quarter of 2016 primarily reflects the impact of customer buying patterns. System revenue of 236 million increased 2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2015 and increased 15% compared with last quarter. The year-over-year increase reflects higher system placements and higher revenue associated with lease buyouts and operating leases, partially offset by lower average selling prices. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects higher system placements partially offset by lower lease buyout revenue and lower average selling prices. 163 systems replaced in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with 158 systems in the fourth quarter of 2015 and 134 systems last quarter. 13 systems were placed under operating lease transactions in the quarter, including our first two into Germany compared with 16 in the fourth quarter of 2015 and 15 last quarter.","As a reminder, revenue on operating lease transactions is recognized ratably over the life of the lease. As of the end of the fourth quarter, there were 79 systems out in the field under operating leases, we generated approximately 5 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter compared with 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and approximately 4 million last quarter. We generated approximately 7 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and 13 million last quarter. We exclude the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts from our system ASP calculation. Globally, our ASP was 1.48 million compared with 1.55 million last year and 1.53 million last quarter. We sold a higher proportion of Si refurbished systems in India and Europe in the quarter as we see cost sensitivities in certain segments of these markets.","Service revenue of 135 increased 12% year-over-year and increased approximately 4% compared with the third quarter of 2016. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflected growth in our installed base of da Vinci systems. Outside of the US, results were as follows. Fourth quarter revenue outside of the US of 212 million decreased 4% compared with 219 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 and increased 12% compared with 189 million for the third quarter. Recurring revenue increased 24% compared with the previous year and 10% compared with the third quarter reflecting procedure growth and distributor buying patterns. Systems revenue decreased 27% compared with the fourth quarter of 2015 and increased 14% compared with the previous quarter. Outside of the US, we placed 63 systems in the fourth quarter compared with 75 systems in the fourth quarter of 2015 and 49 systems last quarter. The increase in system placements relative to the prior quarter reflects seasonality. The decrease in system placements relative to the prior year reflected ten fewer systems into China where we await a new quota and four fewer systems into Brazil where we are in the early stages of market adoption. Current quarter system sales included 26 into Europe, three into China, 15 into Japan and 19 into rest of world market.","System placements outside of the US will continue to be lumpy as some of the OUS markets are in early stages of adoption, some markets are highly seasonal reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations. Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Total pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter was 71.1% compared with 69.6% for the fourth quarter of 2015 and 73.1% for the third quarter of 2016. The pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2016 included 7.1 million of medical device tax refunds which benefited the third quarter gross margin by approximately 100 basis points. Excluding this impact, the decrease in gross margin relative to the third quarter reflects a higher mix of systems revenue and higher scope repair costs. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2015, the higher gross margin reflects reduced product costs and manufacturing efficiencies. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of systems and instrument in accessory revenue, costs associated with our scope exchange program, our ability to further reduce product costs and improve manufacturing efficiency, and in the long term the potential reinstatement of the medical device tax.","Pro forma operating expenses increased 23% compared with the fourth quarter of 2015 and increased 14% compared with last quarter. The increases primarily reflect increased headcount, increased product development activities and investments in our OUS commercial organization. We accelerated some operating expenses into the fourth quarter in anticipation of spending growth in 2017. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 26.9% compared with an effective tax rate of 24.9% for the fourth quarter of 2015 and 22.7% last quarter. The pro forma third quarter 2016 tax rate reflected 16 million of tax benefits or $0.40 per share realized as a result of the statute of limitation expirations in various jurisdictions. The fourth quarter of 2015 tax rate reflected a full-year benefit associated with the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, whereas R&D credit has been recognized ratably during 2016. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of US and OUS income and with the impact of one-time items. Our fourth quarter 2016 pro forma net income was $242 million or $6.09 per share compared with $224 million or $5.89 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015 and $246 or $6.19 per share for the third quarter of 2016. Excluding the one-time income tax and medical device tax benefits, pro forma net income for the third quarter of 2016 would have been $225 or $5.65 per share.","As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $204 million or $5.13 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with $190 million or $4.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015 and $211 million or $5.31 per share for the third quarter of 2016. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of 4.8 billion, up from 4.6 billion as of September 30, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises. During the quarter, we repurchased 55,000 shares for $34 million. In mid-December, the Board of Directors increased the amount authorized for stock buybacks to 3 billion. Today, we entered into a $2 billion accelerated stock buyback program with Goldman Sachs. The total number of shares repurchased will be based on a negotiated discount to the volume weighted average price of the stock over the contract period which is expected to end in the fourth quarter unless terminated earlier by Goldman Sachs. Goldman is expected to deliver approximately 2.4 million shares representing the initial delivery within the next week. We will retire these shares as soon as practical thereafter. A final delivery of shares under the program if any will be delivered at the end of the contract period. Under our agreement with Goldman Sachs, we have reserved the ability to repurchase additional shares in the open market up to the Board's authorization during the accelerated stock buyback period.","And with that I'd like to turn it over to Calvin who will go over procedure and clinical highlights.","Calvin Darling","Thank you, Marshall. Our overall fourth quarter procedure growth was approximately 15% as US procedures grew approximate 13% and outside the US procedures grew approximately 23%. For the full-year 2016, global procedure growth was also 15% overall, 13% US and 24% OUS. In the United States, fourth quarter procedure trends were similar to the third quarter characterized by strong general surgery growth, continued relative strength in gynecology and modest EVP growth. Full-year 2016 US procedures totaled approximately 563,000 growing approximately 13% compared to 11% in 2015. Fourth quarter US general surgery procedure adoption remain strong led by solid growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures. Hernia repair continues to contribute the largest volume of new procedures in general surgery as surgery retention and expansion remains encouraging. Full-year 2016 US general surgery procedures totaled approximately 186,000 reflecting growth of approximately 33% compared to 31% in 2015. In US gynecology, fourth quarter procedures again grew modestly year-over-year with growth led by malignant and complex benign hysterectomy. Procedures for other benign gynecologic conditions also grew modestly. Full-year 2016 US gynecology procedures totaled about 246,000, up approximately 3% compared to growth of approximately 1% in 2015.","In US urology, fourth quarter da Vinci prostatectomy procedures grew at low-single digit rate consistent with third quarter. We believe that our US prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market. Approximately 70,000 dVPs were performed in the US in 2016, up approximately 5% compared to 11% growth in 2015. Full-year 2016 US urology procedure volume of approximately 109,000 grew approximately 7% compared to approximately 12% in 2015. In other US procedures, early stage lobectomies and other thoracic procedures was strong during the quarter and year. These set of procedures are particularly well served by our da Vinci Xi product and 30-millimeter stapler products.","Turning abroad, procedure growth outside of the United States was approximately 23% in the fourth quarter and approximately 24% for the full year 2016. Growth was driven by the continued adoption of da Vinci prostatectomy, with solid contributions from kidney procedures. Total procedure growth in Asia overall was strong, notably so in key strategic markets of China, Japan and Korea. In Europe, procedure performance varied by country. Approximately 190,000 procedures were performed outside of the US in 2016. As Marshall mentioned earlier, our average instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure increased on a year-over-year basis largely attributable to the adoption of our stapling and vessel sealing technologies. During the fourth quarter, one of the first studies on our EndoWrist stapler was published in the Journal of Laparoendoscopic & Advanced Surgical Techniques by Dr. Holzmacher and colleagues from the George Washington University School of Medicine. In their small case series comparing an EndoWrist to a laparoscopic 45-millimeter stapler for colorectal procedures. The authors found that the EndoWrist stapler was safe and effective while using fewer stapler fires reducing the cost per procedure by approximately $150. The author stated advantages of the robotic stapler include large range of motion and 90 degree articulation. The robotic stapler has a comparable level of safety as a 45-millimeter laparoscopic stapler and is more cost effective.","Beyond the stapler study, Q4 was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications evaluating da Vinci surgery. Dr. Cigdem Benlice and colleagues from the Cleveland Clinic of Colorectal Surgery Digestive Disease Institute recently published a study titled Robotic Laparoscopic and Open Colectomy, a case matched comparison from the ACS NSQIP. The study aimed to compare perioperative outcomes of patients undergoing robotic, laparoscopic and open colectomy using the procedure targeted database of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, ACS NSQIP. Robotic laparoscopic and open groups were matched one to one to one based on age, gender, body mass index, surgical procedure, diagnosis and ASA classification. Out of the 12,790 patients, 387 fulfilled criteria per group after matching. Univariate comparison showed operating time was longer and hospital stay was shorter in the robotic group. Important complication rates including morbidity, superficial SSI, bleeding requiring transfusion, ventilator dependency and ileus rates were demonstrably lower in the robotic group. The authors concluded that the ACS NSQIP data demonstrated several short-term advantages of robotic surgery compared with laparoscopic and open surgery.","I will now be providing you with our financial outlook for 2017. Starting with procedures. As described in our announcement last week, 2016 total da Vinci procedures grew approximately 15% to roughly 753,000 procedures performed worldwide. During 2017, we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 9% to 12%. We expect 2017 procedure growth to continue to be driven by US general surgery and procedures outside of the United States where we are still in early stages of adoption. Our 2017 procedure growth expectations are directionally lower than the 2016 results based upon the following assumptions for 2017. Moderating growth in our mature US dVP and gynecology procedures that benefited from favorable macro trends in 2016, moderating international procedure growth as we await additional da Vinci procedure reimbursement in Japan and additional system sales quota in China, and lower percentage growth in US general surgery of a larger base of procedures. We expect similar seasonal timing of procedures in 2016 as we have experienced in previous years, with Q1 being the seasonally weakest quarter as patient deductibles are reset.","With respect to revenue, as we have mentioned previously, capital sales by their nature can vary from period to period based upon many factors including hospital response to the evolving health care environment under the new US administration, hospital capital spending cycles, reimbursement and government quotas and competitive factors. Within this construct, we'd expect 2017 capital sales to follow historical seasonal patterns. Turning to gross profit, as Marshall described our full-year 2016 pro forma gross profit margin was 71.6% as we ended the year at 71.1% in Q4. In 2017, we expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 69% and 71% of net revenue. We are projecting a modestly lower gross profit margin in 2017 reflecting the unfavorable impact of the stronger US dollar on OUS revenue and margin, non-recurrence of the medical device tax refund recognized in 2016, higher costs associated with new products and directionally lower system ASPs as we see incremental market interest in our lower priced offerings in certain geographic markets. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter to quarter depending largely upon product and regional mix.","Turning to operating expenses, as Gary and Marshall described, we are accelerating up to $80 million in investment in several strategic areas that will benefit the company over the long term. Consistent with that direction, we expect to grow pro forma 2017 operating expenses between 15% and 18% above 2016 levels. We expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between 190 and 200 million in 2017 compared to 178 million in 2016. We expect other income which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $25 and $30 million in 2017. With regard to income tax, consistent with our 2016 guidance, we expect our 2017 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5 and 28.5 of pretax income depending primarily on the mix of US and international profits.","That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Margaret Kaczor","Good afternoon, everyone. The first question for me is you guys have been pretty busy announcing, obviously, the R&D spend. You\u2019ve got the ASR, so clearly you guys are seeing a ton of opportunity. And so to that end, how should we think about the composition of the business three years from now, five years from now, whether it\u2019s based on disease state or sales channels, ASCs versus hospitals, or even product categories, so diagnostics, surgery, or even postop?","Gary Guthart","This is Gary. I think in the next few years, I would expect the business categories to be more or less as we describe them now. I think over time as Sp comes into the market, it will feel like surgical device in the kind of settings that you're used to, we do see increasing use of our products in ASCs, it\u2019s not a dominant part of the business at this time. I do think it will grow over time. And then on the diagnostics segment, too early to tell what those segments will break out into. I think it's a platform. I think over time, it will broaden. In the early stages, we'll be talking to you about lung cancer diagnosis as it comes out.","Margaret Kaczor","Great. And then on the imaging side, there is a few angles to come at it. And so, I think, Gary, you have talked about delivering therapy through energy, potentially, so I guess what would that mean to you? And then, has anything changed on your view of your willingness to bring in house either radio or chemiluminescent agents or do you prefer partnerships, and that would include the [indiscernible] agent that you talked about earlier?","Gary Guthart","Yes. So, there were kind of two different concepts in the question, so I\u2019ll just tease them apart a little bit. On the imaging side of showing surgeons more of what's going on during surgery, we really view that in kind of three different buckets. There's better hardware, better imaging sensors and endoscopes, we've been working on that diligently and releasing updates to that product line on a pretty regular cadence. There's analytics and image processing that is more software based. We've also been working hard on that and have been increasing our investments. And then the last one are kind of better sensors, better contrast agents like the [indiscernible] agent. In some of them, we do the primary part of the design in house. In other places, for example on agents we have an active licensing and co-development effort going on. So we really partner that activity with others and a little bit of everything in between. So that was the imaging side.","On the therapeutic side, pretty early to tell. I do think the flexible robotics platform; the computer controlled catheters have the ability to ultimately deliver therapy. What exactly that looks like will be disease state dependent and is likely to involve different kinds of technology over time. Too early for us yet to call where that ends up.","Margaret Kaczor","Great. And then one more, maybe for Marshall. How should we think about the cadence of the $80 million in spending? And why shouldn't we continue to expect it to go up in 18 and beyond, given the opportunities in this long-term horizon that we've been talking about? Thank you.","Marshall Mohr","Yes. So to be clear, what we said was we would accelerate spending of $80 million. We would expect to more normalize our margins in future years. As far as the cadence within the year, spending particularly as it relates to engineering and prototypes and so forth can be pretty lumpy. So we haven't given you specific guidance, but I think you should expect it will go up as we go through the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tycho Peterson","Hey, thanks. A question on expectations around Xi for the year. For starters, you mentioned historical seasonal patterns. It sounds like you are not factoring any ACA-associated slowdown in the first half of the year. And then in the back half of the year, how should we think about maybe incremental placements ahead of the Sp rollout?","Gary Guthart","For starters, the first question on ACA, our sense here is that utilization probably won't change very much. We don't have a crystal ball, but so far the early indications are that will be stable. On the capital placement side, highly uncertain for us. We don't know. Early indications are that it's pretty stable, but depending on how policy ultimately is implemented, that uncertainty may roll through some capital planning processes for some of our customers. I wouldn't call it out yet. Not clear that that's happening, but it's a potential. ","With regard to kind of timing in the year and Sp, I\u2019ll let Marshall answer the question.","Marshall Mohr","From an Sp perspective, what we've been communicating is consistent with what I'll say now, which is that Sp will contribute very little in terms of revenue in 2017 and will be more of a factor in 2018.","Tycho Peterson","But in terms of driving incremental upgrades to Xi ahead of the rollout, should we think about any dynamic there?","Marshall Mohr","Not really. No.","Tycho Peterson","And will we get Sp data at SAGES? When can we start to think about some early user feedback?","Gary Guthart","We should have the opportunity to close this clinical feasibility trial and then initiate the IDE head and neck trial in the first half the year. And as the one closes and the other opens, we\u2019ll be in a better position to share with you that feedback.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then last one on hernia. Can you just give us an update of where we are from a penetration standpoint in terms of both inguinal and ventral and how you think about the relative growth rates this year?","Calvin Darling","Yeah. Generally speaking, we think we're still in fairly early stages on both the ventral and the inguinal opportunity. You saw, we talked about the results in general, surgery again up over 30% this year. Obviously, we had a lot of new procedures and we gained confidence as the year went on I think regarding our opportunity on the inguinal side with demonstrated stickiness on surgeons and growth in that category. But it's still difficult for us to assess how many, let's call it the close to 300,000 ventral hernias and 700,000 inguinals will ultimately be robotic candidates, but we feel pretty confident that it's going to be driving growth for us into 2017 and beyond.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bob Hopkins","Great. Thanks. So Gary, I have a question for you. From a signaling perspective, this quarter is very interesting because you are accelerating $80 million expend and you are announcing a $2 billion ASR, so those are two very positive signaling events, in my view. I was just wondering, can you just help us understand why now is the time to be doing these things? What are the things you are seeing to give you confidence in the business, or am I not phrasing it correctly, that the $2 billion ASR is really just to offset the spending?","Gary Guthart","I think our process to get to both of these, I just described how did we get to accelerating investment and how do we get to the ASR. With regard to accelerated investment, I think we are feeling good and increasing confidence in the use of our products in general surgery. I think that while we're still in early innings, I think the early results have been really strong, so that has been positive for us. As we look at where we sit on kind of the competitive landscape with regard to technologies and opportunities both here at home and abroad, we also are feeling confident that we have a very good technology pipeline and our positioning is quite good. And so as we look at then the opportunity to invest, our first priority is to fund the existing business. The second priority is look for organic growth opportunities that can drive profitable growth in the future. ","That's where that 80 million is going and we evaluate platforms and we look at total available market for those platforms, estimate what the probability might be and stack rank them and then invest. We look for acquisitions as a third priority or a thing that can add to our company. And if we have excess capital, then opportunities to return it to shareholders. And so we walk through that process this year carefully and robustly and that led to both the pull forward of investment because we think there's opportunity and momentum and the opportunity to return some cash to the buybacks. And so those time together more by process than by some algorithm.","Bob Hopkins","Great, that's very helpful. And then, just the one thing I wanted to follow up on is -- not asking you to commit here, but at least is there the potential for 2018 to be a year where you have three new product platforms, Sp, potentially biopsy, and then on the new imaging agent side? Does that potential at least exist?","Gary Guthart","I think Sp is the furthest along of the new platforms and I think that Sp in \u201818 has the opportunity to do some interesting things should we execute well on our regulatory pathway. Molecules, the molecule side of imaging is further out than \u201818. There are some interesting things in imaging that are in \u201918 that are more software and hardware related as opposed to molecular component. On the diagnostic platform, we're not ready yet to kind of anchor revenue expectations. I would not expect much in the \u201918 timeframe, although I think we're going to make great progress on the technology and the learning on it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Lewis","Good afternoon. Gary, I am just trying to put the spending into perspective here. It seems hard to us that on individual trials, you could pull forward the magnitude of spending you are pulling forward. So is it safe to assume that at least some significant component of this pull forward does relate to a new platform that you are working on? That is number one. And then not just the R&D spending, Gary, the other piece was there is commercial spending. Can you help us understand the areas that you are spending on commercially that are different than the true R&D investment?","Gary Guthart","Yeah. Fair questions. On the first one, absolutely the incremental spend relates to building out second platforms. Sp has a lot of shared components with XI, but not entirely shared components. And so bringing that out has a new supply chain and a new set of testing and manufacturing resources that have to get invested in and in addition to some of the trial work. So that's a platform. The diagnostic side, we're really excited about and we think there's a great opportunity at home and abroad and so we're earlier in that platform but we're doing what amounts to the design and early trial investments there. And then there are clinical and economic data investments on our existing platforms, particularly in Europe and in Asia where we think reimbursement or access, other kinds of access, payer access are important and that's been a data that we're happy to go, invest and collect So it really is a mix of those elements as you called out in the question. ","Moving on to your second piece, remind me the second half of your question.","David Lewis","Just commercial and the non-developmental piece.","Gary Guthart","Yeah. Yeah. Commercial investment. A good example of that is, we think there's real opportunity for us in the major markets in Europe if we can increase our total business footprint. It's not just commercialized and sales folks, but some of it is sales staff. We have added a seasoned executive in Germany as a German general manager. We're adding some clinical resources into Germany as well to kind of round out the team there. I think it makes a lot of sense, early returns on that are strong in terms of just their ability to get things done and so those kinds of investments have been going on. Likewise in places like Japan where we\u2019ve been investing in reimbursements, anticipating additional reimbursement in \u201918, there is some prep work to get done in terms of both the customer base in commercial as well as the government side.","David Lewis","And Gary, just a quick second question. On Sp, just to be clear, there are three approvals you talked about in this call, head and neck, urological, as well as TORS. Is it safe to assume those are the three clinical opportunities here near term? What I'm trying to get at is can you not launch Sp in more of a full commercial way until you have one of those three approvals, or that's not necessarily true?","Gary Guthart","So those are the first ideas. Which one comes first will depend on how regulatory bodies view it. I suspect urology will actually be earlier than the other ones just based on existing data and past history. We think those are good opportunities for the platform. They are not the only opportunities for the platform. So we are pursuing those to work up to those in parallel because we think it gives our customers the best financial flexibility to take advantage of the capital investment they make in the platform. Does that make sense?","David Lewis","Makes perfect sense. Thank you so much.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Amit Hazan with Citi. Please go ahead.","Amit Hazan","Thanks. Hey, good afternoon. I want to just come back to the R&D spend, the increased investment spend, for one second, just to clarify 2018 in particular. And this goes off, Gary, what I think you talked about earlier this month at the investor conference, that tailing off in 2018. And I think about that as I think about Sp, maybe that launch coming out so you get some savings there, but diagnostics, certainly imaging, seems like new and ongoing spend. So I wanted to maybe try to get you to clarify why that increased spending is just one year and not more than that. And in terms of just the R&D as a percent of sales, why wouldn't that just continue into next year? It seems like a lot of your spending is actually going to be ongoing.","Gary Guthart","Yes. So what we're describing is that we're growing R&D spend and it's really operations not just R&D. So operating expenses unusually in\u201917 is a run rate and we think it will return to more normal growth rates in \u201918. There's a couple of reasons that we think that\u2019s so. One of them is, the biggest spend on a platform launch is actually the year before launch. That's where both you're building a lot of products, you're doing a lot of elevations. You're getting ready, you're doing a lot of the staging. So that bolus will go through. We have been investing sequentially over time a fair amount more in imaging. ","So imaging in \u201917 isn't a huge bolus. It's kind of a ratable growth. And you're right, we expect revenue growth \u201917 to \u201818. So we expect growth in total OpEx expense in \u201918, it\u2019s just that the growth rate will modulate relative to \u201917. So what we're trying to communicate to everybody here is that the growth rate in \u201917 is unusual. We\u2019d expect revenue growth in \u201918, we'd expect op expense growth rate in \u201918 as well, but more aligned with historical norms, in other words, the growth rate in \u201917 is not the new normal.","Amit Hazan","That's helpful. And then, gynecology would be my second question. The 3.5% growth for the year, that is better than we expected, too. I think that is another year of improving growth for your second year in a row. And you seem to be cautioning a little bit that some of this is not sustainable, that something like migration of procedures to GYN oncologists might run in due course. And it strikes me as just a little bit too early or a little bit early to be concerned about that trend. And so, it seems like a newer trend to me. I am wanting to get you a little bit to comment on whether that is a real concern for \u201817 or whether you are just putting out potential risk factors for the year.","Calvin Darling","The gynecology is one of those matured procedure categories in the United States. If you look at benign hysterectomy, the largest procedure in the category, over 80% of those procedures are performed in some minimally invasive fashion, whether it be with laparoscopy, vaginal techniques or robotic and it's kind of been that way in the last two or three years. So in that sense, we would expect, our starting thought would be, we\u2019re likely to move with the market in that scenario. So if you look back a couple of years ago, at 2014, that's what happened. We declined low single digits. We think the total number of benign hysterectomies being performed is probably gradually declining in response to pay or pushbacks on that procedure, encouraging other treatment modalities. So \u201915 that kind of kind of moved to the other side is 1% growth like I said in the comments. ","This year, it ramped up to about 3% growth. And you\u2019re right. I think it's largely reflecting a trend towards a higher proportion of the cases being performed by the gynecologic oncologists, the set of surgeons that are more aligned with robotics. So that's been a benefit. So our guidance would suggest, we'd expect this to moderate a little bit in 2017. We don't have a perfect crystal ball in this area, but at some point, we think the more complex cases are the ones being referred and you hit a certain level where that you're getting very adequate clinical outcomes with the other minimally invasive approaches. So we'll see how it plays out.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Tao Levy with Wedbush. Please go ahead.","Tao Levy","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just maybe you could update us on the status of China and the quota, next steps there, as well as what is needed to get the Xi approved in China.","Marshall Mohr","Yes. So two part of the question. On the quota side, the quota is dependent upon the approval of their budget and the Chinese government budget and then allocations are then done down through MOH and then to the hospitals and so on and so forth until they get to which hospitals can buy specifically da Vinci product. They've taken the first step. They have approved, they did approve the budget at the end of 2016, so in December. However, they did not take it further to the allocations to specifics as to who gets to buy a da Vinci or how many will be bought. That process is still in motion. ","It's not something we can control and frankly we don't have great visibility as to what's going on behind the curtains to get there. And so at this point, we sit and wait for the next quota to be approved. I think what we've also told people is, if you look at the last time quota was approved, it still takes some time for the hospitals to actually complete the tender process and buy product. So if you're putting together a model, looking at the last time a quota was approved in 2013, most of the systems were bought near the end of 2015. So the likelihood that there's going to be a lot of revenue coming out of a quota in 2017 is not very high. ","Tao Levy","And on Xi?","Marshall Mohr","Xi is in process. It is a long approval process. We'll tell you when we get it, which is our typical pattern of disclosure. We don't know where it is in the process.","Gary Guthart","We're encouraged. I don't see a major impediment to Xi clearance in China. And in general, we're encouraged by the response of the market to robotic surgery and to Intuitive in China. So I think in general, with the caveat that Marshall has outlined, as a whole, we look positively on the opportunity there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Larry Keusch","Thanks. Good afternoon. Marshall, in your -- excuse me, Gary, in your prepared comments, I think I heard this correctly, but you were referencing long-term investments and you were talking about investments for products and services. And I just want to make sure I heard that correctly, and if that is correct, what were you thinking about when you were talking about services?","Gary Guthart","Yeah. We provide a series of things now to the customer that are kind of an ecosystem around the product itself. So the simple things you think about are things like maintenance services, but we increasingly have access to interesting data on the use of devices, our devices benchmarking that are international and things like efficiency metrics with the use of robotic systems and in the last couple of years, we have partnered with hospitals to provide that set of data to them and to help them improve their systems and that's been a real positive for them and for us. And so that's what I meant when I said services. I think those data opportunities and benchmarking opportunities increase in the future.","Larry Keusch","Okay, great. And then, I just want to pick up on some comments that you made earlier in the month and specifically get your thoughts on as you talk about, again, some of this imaging technology and the ability to perhaps be involved in pre-procedure planning. Is the way to think about that, that would really be done with the surgeon interfacing with the imaging capabilities and the machine itself, or is there an element there where Intuitive can insert itself more from a service perspective in perhaps procedure planning? And then, the other question around that was just getting your thoughts on where you think machine learning goes as it relates to robotic surgery.","Marshall Mohr","Sure. I think to the first question of what, does it change or were we interact at the hospital, I think in the near term, the answer is yes but only a little bit. I think that there's an opportunity to look at things like preoperative images that patients are required to do as part of their diagnostic work up and to be able to use and do some post-processing and machine learning on those pre-operative images to improve surgeon\u2019s navigation or other capabilities during the case. That looks pretty interesting. That's some of the technology I showed you a few weeks ago at JPMorgan. I think in the near term, that's how we think about it. In the long term, I do think that there are interesting opportunities for analytics as it relates to the workings of a robotic surgery program or a minimally invasive surgery program that are a little bit outside of what's happening in a single case. And that may change and provide an opportunity for Intuitive to engage conversations with the hospital in a more broad manner, but I think those are -- we\u2019re at early days of those conversations.","Larry Keusch","Okay, great. And last quick one, just, Calvin, I know you made a mention on lobectomy, but again any color that you could provide as to the uptake and perhaps the opportunity around that.","Calvin Darling","Again like I said, I think Q4 and really throughout the year in 2016 was a positive period time for us, still fairly early in that category. We're focused in the field team more on the general surgery opportunity, but there's increasing sets of people engaging, some of the key thoracic getting some of the newer technology, I mentioned that Xi system and 30-millimeter staplers in those hands and gaining that experience and building volumes from there is something we're focused on, but I think the value is high in that procedure and the opportunity is significant in the US, but when you look outside the US to Europe and particularly Asia with higher lung cancer rates, it's pretty interesting.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Craig Bijou","Hi, guys. It's actually Craig Bijou on for Larry. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to start Calvin with your comments on as part of your procedure guidance, the moderating international growth. And I want to ask, what's the risk to procedure growth, given some of the slowdown in European system sales and kind of balancing that with the strong procedure growth that you guys have said that you're seeing in Asia? So I guess in the case where your European procedure -- or system sales don't pick up again and maybe the China tender or the China quota doesn't come on board as quickly as you expect, what is the risk to that international procedure growth of 20% plus?","Gary Guthart","Yeah. I mentioned it is one of the bullet points in there for the outlook for -- moderating outlook on overall procedure growth. Internationally, I think the areas I pointed out specifically were China. Marshall talked a little bit about the quarter there. The fact is that the systems we do have in China are some of the productive systems we have and our ability to continue to grow procedures now somewhat pays by our ability to get more capacity in the field. So that can be a factor in 2017. And then in Japan, we very successfully ramped up the procedures where we have reimbursement, the prostatectomy procedure and earlier stage of a smaller category in the partial nephrectomy. So I think as those procedures have ramped, you've got less room and we\u2019re waiting additional procedures in 2018, which will be required to sustain growth. Both those markets I\u2019d say are, we've got very positive long term use on, but some specific factors impacting 2017.","Calvin Darling","Operator, we have time for one last question.","Operator","Okay. And that comes from the line of Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Richard Newitter","Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. I had two. Just, Marshall, just on the gross margin factors in the guidance for 2017, I heard FX, I heard the med tech tax refund benefit not repeating. Could you just elaborate on the last two, and then I have one follow-up on thoracic?","Gary Guthart","I don't think we have a follow-up. So Marshall take that one and we'll go from there.","Marshall Mohr","Yeah. I think the things that can affect the gross margin are, like we said, we had some experience in the quarter with selling the lower cost systems in cost sensitive markets where we saw some success. So we'll see if that continues. It\u2019s an end of one, but we'll see what happens. Certainly, new product introductions and new products have lower margins than our older products and so that also has an impact as we increase the sales of the vessel sealing and stapling and even though we've cost reduced them somewhat, they\u2019re still higher, lower margin than our historical products. And so as we increase the sale of newer products, that will have a negative impact. Then the other item that we mentioned was repair costs associated with scopes and we continue to work as Gary said, iterate the imaging capability and the hardware and as we do, we\u2019ll reduce the cost as well as improve the repairability, but that's a little ways off. And so it will happen incrementally over time.","Gary Guthart","All right. Richard, Calvin said he\u2019ll take your follow up.","Richard Newitter","All right, appreciate that. Thank you. Just on thoracic, is there any -- can you just maybe talk about the type of surgeon that you need to target, the kind of -- and the phasing of it, because I know there are some general surgeons that perform the procedures and then you obviously have cardiothoracic surgeons and specialists? Can you just describe who you are targeting and when and can that potentially give us a sense as to when we might begin to see more of an inflection point in the thoracic lobectomy segment? Thanks.","Calvin Darling","Yeah. I\u2019ll answer that one. I think we're still in pretty early part of the market adoption for thoracic surgery. In general, it's been engaging, thought leaders in thoracic surgery, some of whom are minimally invasive surgeons today and some of whom are predominantly open surgeon. There's a mix. It tends less to be generalist here and more to be the thought leadership in thoracic as a whole. Part of I think what's been pacing growth here is just completing the product set for efficiency and speed of case. I think we're very close now to having complete product sets, things like 30-millimeter staplers and so on and that's helped. So I think as that product set completes as we proliferate Xis in the world, that has made adoption more likely and easier.","I\u2019ll turn to our close. That was our last question. As we've said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing value by enabling surgeons to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma. We've built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure you we remain committed to driving the vital few things that really make a difference. This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery and I look forward to speaking with you again on the next call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, as you just heard, today's conference has concluded.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Calvin Darling, Senior Director of Finance, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Calvin Darling","Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's third quarter earnings conference call. With me today we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO, Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer and Patrick Clingan, Vice President of Finance and Sales Operations.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 6, 2017 and 10-Q filed on July 21, 2017. These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's EDGAR database. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.","Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website.","Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our third quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Marshall will provide a review of our third quarter financial results, Patrick will discuss procedure and clinical highlights, then I will provide our updated financial outlook for 2017 and finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.","With that, I will turn it over to Gary.","Gary Guthart","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on the call today. As you know, Intuitive is focused on significantly improving surgery and enabling access to our products and services in pursuit of this mission globally.","Performance in the third quarter was strong with continued growth in customers' use of our systems and an increase in system placements. Worldwide growth in procedures for the quarter was 15% over the third quarter of 2016. As we have described on prior calls, we expect growth in general surgery and countries outside the United States to continue to lead performance while procedure growth in mature categories in the United States temper. In the quarter we saw this dynamic with strength in general surgery in the U.S. and in several countries outside the U.S. lifting growth while U.S. urologic and gynecologic growth moderated. Drivers of growth include U.S. inguinal and ventral hernia repair, colon and rectal surgery and thoracic surgery as well as urology and gynecology procedures outside the United States. Procedure performance in Asia showed continued strength with solid growth in China, Japan and Korea. Overall European procedure growth moderated slightly from its first half of 2017 performance with trends varying by country. Patrick will take you through these factors in more detail later in the call.","Turning to capital placement performance. The third quarter was a strong one with growth in total placements from 134 in Q3 of 169 this quarter. Customers in the United States again showed strong interest in our systems as capital placements grew quarter-over-quarter. Asia, Europe and other market system placements were roughly in line with prior quarter trends. Capital placements can be hard to forecast and we expect this lumpiness to continue given conditions in the market. Our fourth generation systems da Vinci X and da Vinci Xi continued to perform well and account for over 85% of systems placed in the quarter. Marshall and Patrick will take you through system dynamics in greater detail.","Turning to probability for the quarter. Our Q3, pro forma gross margins rose slightly relative to Q2 and are slightly above our expected range for the year. This is due to strengthened procedures and improvements in our operational efficiency. Our fixed cost growth met our plan year-to-date with increases in R&D expenses, growth in staff in European and Asian markets investments in clinical trials and growth in corporate competition capabilities. Our third quarter pro forma operating results are as follows. Procedures grew approximately 15% over the third quarter of last year. We shipped 169 da Vinci surgical systems, up from 134 in the third quarter of 2016. Revenue for the quarter was $806 million, up 18% from the prior year which included a release of reserves related to da Vinci X trade out offers of $21 million.","Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $401 million, up 15%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $548 million representing 68% of total revenue. Pro forma gross profit margin was 71.8% compared to 73.1% in the third quarter last year, the difference largely driven by a medical device tax refund in 2016. Pro forma operating profit was $347 million in the quarter, up 13% over Q3 of 2016. Pro forma net income was $324 million aided by one-time favorability and tax items. And lastly, we completed our three-to-one share exchange announced last quarter. Marshal will take you through our finances in greater detail shortly.","Turning to operations. We believe that substantial opportunity exists to enable more minimally invasive surgery, better outcomes and to expand access to our technologies globally. Our investments in new products and services are built on this belief. Starting with our multi-port product portfolio, recall that we have built a tiered product offering in our da Vinci systems that responds to our customers' desire of choice in content and price points while maintaining logical upgrade pathways to our leading ecosystem of robot assisted surgery products and services. We continue to bring our da Vinci X systems in new regions in the world. In the quarter, we enabled launch in nine additional countries for da Vinci X and anticipate adding four more in this fourth quarter. This set of options has been well received by our customers with da Vinci Xi making up roughly 75% of our new placements, da Vinci X making up approximately 10% of new placements in its limited early launch and with the balance made up by Si technology.","We are also advancing our imaging, instruments and accessories portfolios for our generation four systems, the da Vinci X, da Vinci Xi as well as da Vinci SP. While the robotic arms are the most visible part of the surgical system, it is the performance of the whole ecosystem of robot, software, imaging, instruments and accessories in conjunction with the OR team in their working environment that creates a high functioning program. Our team is committed to understanding the total surgical environment and its workflow and design products that work seamlessly for our customers. This has motivated our investment and partnerships in technologies for imaging, stapling and more recently in advanced energy working to develop highly effective and easy-to-use total products.","In the quarter, we expand the launch of two additional instruments and accessories for da Vinci X and Xi into seven different countries and initiated a limited launch of a refined vessel sealer in Europe. We anticipate that our da Vinci SP program will complete patient enrollment in surgery for its round of clinical trials this quarter. As we mentioned last call, four clinical trial sites participated, three in the United States and one in Asia. Cases in Asia included transoral, urologic and colorectal surgery, while those in the U.S. focused on transoral surgery. Our teams are finalizing product validations or working to establish manufacturing capability in support of regulatory submissions that enable launch. We plan to file our first 510(k) for the current SP designed by year-end with follow-on submissions for additional indications thereafter.","For our flexible robotics program, we continue to refine product designs, develop our supply chain, finalize our regulatory strategy and initiate testing. With our partner, we are progressing and building our joint venture in China with the hire of the first key staff including the joint venture CEO and CFO.","In closing, the third quarter of 2017 was a strong one and we remain focused on the following for the balance of the year. First continued adoption of da Vinci in general surgery. Second, continued development of European markets and access to customers in Asia. Third, advancing our new platforms imaging, advanced instruments, da Vinci SP and flexible robotics progress. And finally, support for additional clinical and economic validation by global region.","I will now turn the call over to Marshall who will review financial highlights.","Marshall Mohr","Thank you Gary. I will describe our results on a non-GAAP pro forma basis which excludes specified legal settlements and claim accrual, excess tax benefits related to employee stock awards and charges associated with stock based compensation and purchased IP. We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma result to our GAAP results on our website.","Third quarter 2017 revenue was $806 million, an increase of 18% compared with $683 million for the third quarter of 2016 and an increase of 7% compared with second quarter revenue of $756 million. Included in third quarter revenue was the recognition of $21 million of revenue deferred in conjunction with the da Vinci X tradeout program we offered certain first quarter customers. Excluding the $21 million, revenue would have increased 15% compared with 2016. We expect the remaining $2 million of deferred revenue under the first quarter tradeout program to be recognized by year-end.","Third quarter 2017 procedures increased approximately 15% compared with the third quarter of 2016 and decreased approximately 2% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth relative to last year was driven by general surgery in U.S. and urology worldwide. The decline in procedure relative to the second quarter primarily reflects seasonality. Patrick will provide more detail concerning procedure adoption.","Revenue highlights are as follows. Instrument and accessory revenue of $401 million increased 15% compared with last year and increased 1% compared with the second quarter of 2017 which closely reflects procedure growth. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure was approximately $1,880 per procedure compared with $1,870 last year and $1,830 last quarter. The increases reflect increased sales of our stapling and vessel sealing products and variations in customer buying patterns.","Excluding the recognition of deferred revenue, systems revenue of $237 million increased 15% compared with the third quarter of 2016 and increased 9% compared with last quarter. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher system placements, partially offset by a higher number of operating lease placements and lower average selling prices. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects higher average selling prices and fewer lease placements.","169 systems replaced in the third quarter of 2017 compared with 134 systems in the third quarter of 2016 and 166 systems last quarter. 20 systems were placed under operating lease transactions in the current quarter compared with 15 systems in the third quarter of 2016 and 27 last quarter. As of the ended the third quarter of 2017, there were 134 systems out in the field under operating leases. We generated approximately $7 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter compared with $4 million in the third quarter of 2016 and approximately $6 million last quarter.","We generated approximately $11 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with $13 million in the third quarter of 2016 and $5 million last quarter. Globally, our average selling price which excludes the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts and revenue deferral was $1.47 million compared with $1.53 million last year and $1.46 million last quarter. The decrease in ASP compared to the third quarter of 2016 primarily reflects a higher proportion of trade-in transactions, lower priced systems sold to cost sensitive market segments and lower pricing offered to customers purchasing multiple systems.","We believe the flexible financing programs like operating leases have positively impacted our ability to grow our installed base. While the number of leases is difficult to predict in the short-term, we expect a proportion of these types of the arrangements will increase over time. Service revenue of $147 million increased 13% year-over-year and increased approximately 3% compared with the second quarter of 2017. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect growth in our installed base of da Vinci systems.","Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. Third quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $213 million increased 13% compared with $189 million for the third quarter of 2016 and increased 4% compared with $205 million for the second quarter. Approximately $5 million of deferred revenue recognized in the quarter was outside the U.S. Excluding the deferred revenue recognition, the increase relative to the prior year primarily reflects increased system placements net of leases and increased instrument and accessory revenue.","Outside of the U.S., we placed 62 systems in the third quarter compared with 49 in the third quarter of 2016 and 63 systems last quarter. Four of the system placements in the current quarter were operating leases compared with one last year and five last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 25 into Europe, 14 into Japan, five into India, four into New Mexico and one into China. System placements outside the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of the OUS markets are in early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal reflecting budget cycles or vacation pattern and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations.","Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. The pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2017 was 71.8% compared with 73.1% for the third quarter of 2016 and 71.3% for the second quarter of 2017. The da Vinci X tradeout program had little impact on our margins. The decrease compared with the third quarter of 2016 primarily reflects a $7 million medical device tax refund received in 2016 and decreased service margins associated with higher scope repair cost. The increase compared with the second quarter primarily reflects leverage achieved with higher production level. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our new products, mix of systems in instrument and accessory revenue, our ability to further reduce product cost and improve manufacturing efficiency and the reinstatement of the medical device tax in 2018.","Pro forma operating expenses increased 21% compared with the third quarter of 2016 and increased 2% compared with last quarter. The increases reflect our planned investments in product development, specifically da Vinci SP, flexible robotics, imaging and advanced instrumentation and expansion of our OUS markets. Our operating expenses for 2017 may grow slightly greater than previous guidance reflecting higher revenue growth. As we have indicated, we are committed to reducing the growth rate of operating expenses in 2018 compared with 2007. However as 2017 revenue growth and in turn operating leverage have exceeded our expectations, it is likely we will not create operating leverage in 2018 over 2017 actual results.","Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 9.5% compared with an effective tax rate of 22.7% for the third quarter of 2016 and 29.2% last quarter. The third quarter of 2017 and 2016 included reductions of $68 million and $16 million of reserves related to the expiration of statutes of limitations on certain tax years. Without these reductions, our third quarter 2017 and 2016 pro forma tax rate would have been 28.6% and 27.7%. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income and with the impact of one-time items.","Our third quarter 2017 pro forma net income was $324 million or $2.77 per share, compared with $246 million or $2.06 per share for the third quarter 2016 and $228 million or $1.98 per share for the second quarter of 2017. All per share amounts reflect the three-for-one stock split affected in October. Recognition of the $21 million of deferred revenue net of cost and income tax increased GAAP and pro forma net income per diluted share by approximately $0.09. The income tax reserve reversal of $68 million increased GAAP and pro forma net income per diluted share by approximately $0.59. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends.","I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $298 million or $2.55 per share for the third quarter of 2017 compared with $211 million of $1.77 per share for the third quarter of 2016 and $222 million of $1.92 per share for the second quarter of 2017. GAAP net income included $10 million of net charges associated with legal settlements compared with no charges recorded in the third quarter of 2016 and $5 million of net benefit recorded last quarter. GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2017 also included a charge of $6 million associated with purchased IP. These costs are excluded from our pro forma result.","Beginning in 2017, we are required under GAAP to report the excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with employee stock awards in our tax provision rather than as an adjustment to paid in capital as in prior periods. The excess tax benefit included in our GAAP result for the third quarter was $20 million contributing $0.17 per share, compared with $31 million contributing $0.27 per share in the second quarter of 2017. We have excluded these benefits from our pro forma results. This amount will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on the volume of employee stock option exercises, number of RSUs vesting and the value of our stock.","We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $3.8 billion, up from $3.4 billion as of June 30, 2017. The increase generally reflects cash generated from operations. The accelerated stock buyback agreement we entered into in the first quarter will c lose in the fourth quarter. Based on our current stock price, we will be required either to deliver shares or pay cash to close out the arrangement.","And with that, I would like to turn it over to Patrick who will go over procedure and clinical highlights.","Patrick Clingan","Thanks Marshall. Of our third quarter procedure growth of 15%, U.S. procedures grew approximately 12% and outside of the United States procedures grew approximately 23%. Procedure trends were consistent with the first half of the year with growth led by U.S. general surgery and global urology. During the quarter, in the United States strength in general and thoracic surgery continued, growth in mature procedure categories moderated, there was one fewer weekday and we estimate that hurricanes impacted U.S. procedure growth rates by less than 1%. In U.S. urology, the third quarter growth rate for da Vinci prostatectomy was similar to the first half of 2017. We believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market. During the quarter, growth in kidney procedures moderated compared to the first half of the year. In U.S. gynecology, third quarter procedure growth was flat compared to the prior year. Compared to the first half of 2017, the moderation in third quarter procedure growth was due to benign procedures. Third quarter U.S. general and thoracic surgery procedure adoption remained strong led by growth in hernia repair. Hernia repair continues to contribute the largest volume of new procedures in the United States with solid contribution from colorectal and thoracic procedures.","Turning abroad. Procedure growth outside of the United States was approximately 23% in the third quarter led by the global adoption of da Vinci prostatectomy with solid contributions from kidney procedures, hysterectomies and colorectal resections. Procedure growth was strong in Asia and variable by country in Europe. The one fewer weekday compared to the third quarter of 2016 was partially offset by the timing of certain regional holidays. Outside of the United States, procedure growth was led by China, South Korea, Germany and Japan. Procedure growth rates in China moderated despite continued strong expansion in system utilization. System placements remained constrained pending the issuance of a new quota for civilian hospitals. We have no update regarding the status of the quota. In South Korea, growth was led by gynecology and urology, including contribution from single site use in gynecology. In Germany and Japan, procedure growth rates in the third quarter were similar to the first half of 2017 led by the adoption of urology procedures. During quarter, recently placed da Vinci X systems generated solid utilization. The systems were largely used in urology and gynecology procedures with general surgery procedures in the United States. Globally, evidence continues to build in the support of clinical and economic validation of da Vinci surgery.","During the quarter, an economic analysis studying the impact of da Vinci hysterectomy in Denmark was published in the Journal of Robotic Surgery. The work was completed by a team of researchers from Aarhus University and Odense University. Comparing more than 7,600 hysterectomy patients across open, laparoscopic and da Vinci surgery, the authors compared the comprehensive cost of care from the year preceding to the year following a hysterectomy for benign or malignant conditions. For benign procedures, the authors found that da Vinci hysterectomy was less expensive than either open or laparoscopic procedures. For less complex malignant procedures, da Vinci hysterectomy was more expensive than laparoscopic procedures and less expensive than open surgery. Within this population, the authors determined that the da Vinci patient cohort was more complex than the laparoscopic cohort and largely replaced open surgery at most institutions. In conclusion, the authors stated \"Our study demonstrates that the use of robotic technology for hysterectomy is potentially cost saving from a broad healthcare perspective.\"","This concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call over to Calvin.","Calvin Darling","Thank you Patrick. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2017. Starting with procedures, on our last call we estimated full year 2017 procedure growth of 14% to 15% above the approximately 753,000 procedures performed in 2016. We are now increasing our estimate for 2017. We now anticipate full year 2017 procedure growth within a range of 15% to 16%. In regards to system placements, although the proportion of Q3 systems placed under operating leases was slightly lower than Q2, we continue to expect that over time the proportion of systems we place under operating leases will generally trend upwards. With increasing placements in the cost sensitive market segments, we expect that our average system selling price will continue to trend gradually lower. As Marshall mentioned, $21 million of the $23 million deferred in Q1 related to our da Vinci X tradeout program was recognized in Q3. We expect to recognize the remaining $2 million in Q4 and closeout the program.","Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast 2017 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71.5% of net revenue. We now expect to come in at the top end of the range and anticipate pro forma gross profit margin to be between 71% and 71.5% of net revenue.","Turning to operating expenses. As we have described previously, we have accelerated our investments in several strategic areas that will benefit the company over the long term. Accordingly we have ramped our operating expenses as we focus on execution. On our last call, we forecast pro forma 2017 operating expenses to grow at the higher end of the range between 17% and 18% above 2016 levels. We now expect pro forma 2017 operating expenses to grow between 18% and 19%. We continue to forecast our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $200 million and $210 million in 2017 as communicated our last call. We expect 2017 other income to be at the top end of the $35 million to $40 million range forecast on our last call.","With regard to income tax, we now expect our Q4 2017 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5% and 28.5% of pretax income, compared to our previous guidance of 28% to 29.5%.","That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Amit Hazan with Citi. Please go ahead.","Amit Hazan","Thanks. Can you hear me okay, guys?","Calvin Darling","Yes.","Amit Hazan","Let me start with your new thoughts on 2018 actually and to hit that to make sure we had it clear. So I think in the past you were talking about higher OpEx spending this year and then normalizing in 2018. That's how we started the year. What are you thinking about OpEx spending for 2018? In the comments that you made and historically it would have been high single digits would have been normal? What do you consider to be the new target?","Calvin Darling","Yes. I think what we have said is that we would expect, as you said, return to normal spending next year, normal being defined as something that's more in line with revenue growth. I think that what we are seeing this year is, we are outperforming on the revenue line and we wind up with much higher leverage than we had expected and therefore higher profit margins. And so if we continue our spending, even if we decrease the rate of spending next year or the rate of increase next year, you still wind up with not achieving leverage as maybe we were indicating before. So it all has to do with where we are coming out this year relative to next year. In total, if you looked at plans on a two-year basis from last year to next year, it's really pretty consistent with that.","Amit Hazan","Okay. And then just on the installed base in the U.S., it's now three quarters in a row that you had really strong numbers, especially new additions to the installed base. I think it's almost doubled what we saw last year. So I think you guys will always point us to procedures as the key leading indicator. But I am wondering if there is any additional insight as to why it's been so strong so far this year and how much does that growth in the U.S. installed base improve your confidence for U.S. procedure growth over the next 12 months?","Calvin Darling","Yes. You took some of the words right out of our mouth. Procedure growth really does drive placement growth. So we kind of think of it in that order. And procedure growth, we have talked about what that's been. It's been strong over the last few quarters. And to-date, 85% of our system placements have been to existing hospitals with roughly two-thirds of that expanding the installed base. So what we are seeing is hospitals growing procedures, having a need for additional capacity and therefore buying systems. 90% of systems we have sold are fourth generation, as Gary indicated, so Xi and X. And what we see there is that people want to avail themselves of the latest capabilities including computer-aided setup, optimized advanced instruments and table motion and multi-quadrant access. So it's a number of factors that are driving it. It's hard to predict. We don't give you guidance on systems going forward. But that's what's driven it so far.","Amit Hazan","And I will squeeze in one quick one on physicians trained. I am just curious. So basically in general surgery specifically, if you have got a sense of roughly how much of your growth is being driven by new physicians being trained? And how much is just kind of an improvement in same-store sales, so to speak? And how much runway we might have left before kind of new surgeons trained in general surgery as a driver?","Patrick Clingan","Hi Amit. It's Patrick. We see a pretty balanced growth across both new surgeons who are starting da Vinci general surgery for the first time as well as those who continue to expand their practice by either doing more patients within the existing procedures that they have been performing as well as adding new procedures to the list that they have been performing over time.","Amit Hazan","All right. Thanks guys.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of David Lewis, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Lewis","Good afternoon. Gary, I had one quick question on some pipeline dynamics. I may come back to the cost after that, but just two things. You reiterated the SP regulatory timing end of this year. Is it a good estimate for us for commercial launch for SP first quarter 2018? And the second part of that question was just on flexible catheter. You talked about the regulatory pathway, but you give us any sense of 510(k) PMA? We have been assuming 510(k). And whether there is any commercial timeline that you could share?","Gary Guthart","Sure. So on SP, we don't know exactly the launch date, just given what questions we might get back from FDA. So we have that as well as finalizing some of the supply chain work we want to do. But we are working hard and solving the problems that we think we need. So I don't have any additional update for you on the SP commercialization ramp. We will report you when 510(k) goes in and what we think about it.","On the flex side, likewise what we described in the script. We are making good progress on developing the technologies and finalizing our regulatory approach. We believe it's a 510(k). We will find out. FDA has a say on all that. But our plans are such that it's 510(k). We have not set a launch date yet for public consumption.","David Lewis","Okay. And then just coming back to spending, either for Gary or Marshall. The thing about 2017 was, you wanted to invest at a greater level because you had a lot going on in the pipeline. By our math and your guidance for next year for flat margins is consistent with our model. But it basically implies about $1 billion in R&D and combined SG&A which is a nice big round number. Can you give us any sense of the spending involved? I think investors are totally comfortable with increased spending if they think that spending is going to generate a higher return. So the kind of things you are working on for next year and why that level of spending is necessary? Thanks so much.","Gary Guthart","Sure. It's a good question. As Marshall said, we haven't really changed our view of what kind of spending is required in 2018, just a little bit of a math of 2017 changes relative to what the total operating margin looks like. With regard to what we are investing in, we go from essentially a single platform in the field in multiport da Vinci to SP, which is a new patient side plus accessories and instrumentation as well as flex catheter which we think is really important. So on the R&D side, you have got broadening of platform lanes. And we think those are important because they don't get developed in a year. They take both technology development as well as technique development and all the commercialization steps that you all are well aware of. So that's kind of one side.","The flip side is, a set of investments are on making sure that we can support the scale of the business in the multiport space and that has to do with making sure your factories are right and you have invested in plants and equipment and you get the advantages of scale as you grow. And we have started to see that at the gross margin line, the improvements and the performance above some of our earlier expectations are the result of some hard work in manufacturing efficiencies which I think, I would be supportive of riding it shoulder side. I think it makes a lot of sense. Those are really the investment priorities. There is a little bit in there about data generation in local markets to support the needs of our customers in the markets in which they operate, be it clinical data or economic data. So that picks up, that rounds out kind of the investment profile. Probably not a surprise to you at all.","David Lewis","All right. Thanks Gary.","Operator","And our next question comes from one of Bob Hopkins, Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bob Hopkins","Great. Thank you very much for taking the question. So the first question I wanted to ask is for Gary. I noticed obviously that TransEnterix has got an FDA approval and what struck me as interesting is they got approval for 23 different indications, 23 different types of surgeries, some without data. And I was just curious, does this suggest that FDA might be willing to approve multiple indications? And could this potentially advance some of your timelines for the different indications that you are looking at for SP and some of your technologies?","Gary Guthart","Yes. It's a fair question. So the first thing is, the use of kind of one set of data to get additional procedures, that's something that was discussed with FDA in their workshop a couple of years ago and has been employed by us and by others. So the idea that there are some procedures that are kind of the key data generators that create an umbrella for other procedures is not a surprise to us. It is something that we have worked with FDA on and we are not surprised that others re likewise using it. I think with regard to what evidentiary requirements are, which is a little bit underneath your question, the issue there is that how FDA views this is what you ask for in terms of labeling and claims and the relative evidence to support that are linked and whether this signals a change in FDA's posture you really have to read the specifics of the labeling as well as what the submitted data was. We will do that carefully when it comes out and we will assess whether their posture has changed or not. But on its surface, just reading what you have seen so far, what we have seen so far, A, we are not surprised that there are a set of procedures and kind of the devil is in the details is to how they viewed it.","Bob Hopkins","Okay. Fair enough. So we will follow-up after we get more details there. And then I apologize, Marshall, just one more on the 2018 comment. I assume from the comments and some of the math that what you are implying here is a double digit level of increase in OpEx in 2018. Is that a fair assumption?","Marshall Mohr","Well, we will provide you guidance when we get to next quarter. We are ready to commit to what the increase would be. It's just that as we sit here today, we would imagine that we would not be adding leverage to the model. Our spend in 2017 to-date has been right where we thought it would be. Revenue has come in pretty well. And our margins and other cost have been where we have expected them. And so it just changes the profitability relative to what we were thinking nine months ago.","Bob Hopkins","I mean that's really the basis for the question. I am trying to get at what percentage of this is really could be associated with just increased confidence in the outlook for revenue growth next year?","Marshall Mohr","So we will get to the guidance for you in the next quarter.","Bob Hopkins","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tycho Peterson","Hi. Thanks. First question on dVP. I want to make sure I heard this right. I think you said 3Q volumes in the U.S. similar to the first half of the year. If that's right, that seems to be in contrast to what you talked about in terms of moderating to low single digit growth just a month ago. So can you clarify that?","Patrick Clingan","Yes. Tycho, to clarify, the comment on dVP was that growth rates were very consistent to first half the year, but the category of urology moderated compared to the first half of the year, so inclusive of other procedures like kidney procedures.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then thinking a little bit ahead on SP, as we think about the initial urology rollout, this is really about improved clinical outcomes maybe versus market expansion, I guess. Can you maybe just talk to how you think about that factoring into the adoption cycle since this is kind of a new approach in terms of getting FDA approval by procedure? How does that play into the mix in terms of how of this is going to be an upsell to the installed base versus potential market expansion, if you will, when you do roll it out for urology?","Patrick Clingan","Yes. In the early parts of rollout, we expect to do that in a measured way and the beginnings will be around clinical publications and evidentiary building, building of evidence. We think it has multispecialty implications and so part of this will be to follow through and get multispecialty indications with FDA and you see some of the trials they are doing that. I don't know that SP harkens a different regulatory pathway for FDA. You had implied that in your question and I am not sure that I agree with that implication. So far it doesn't look like a foundationally different way to communicate with FDA.","With regard to the question of how much of this is, we are kind of working backward into the existing procedure base we do in pursuit of better outcomes and how much would expanded opportunity. I think we are going to see some of both and it's a little bit early to size exactly which. I have been impressed by surgeons' interest in both categories, both improving what they do already as well as being able to approach technique and applications they have not yet done. So I think that's why we are excited about. It is the potential to do both. And I would just say, stay tuned there as we get more experience and put these in the field.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then just lastly, on thinking about clinical data readout, two weeks from now you have data coming out at CHEST. Any preview you can give us for those who don't want to go to Toronto.","Gary Guthart","No. I cannot.","Tycho Peterson","All right. Figured it was worth a shot. Thanks.","Gary Guthart","Yes. Thanks Tycho.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Larry Biegelsen","Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I will just start with the flex catheter and then I had one on the competition. So the data at CHEST, is that going to be enough for 510(k) clearance in the U.S.? Or you will have to do another trial for 510(k) clearance? And on the our last call, your estimate how your flex catheter system compares to Medtronic' superD. There is another robotic system being developed in the field that we hear is similar to yours. Is that a fair characterization? I would be curious if you had any comments on that. I had one follow-up.","Gary Guthart","Okay. So on the sufficiency of data, thus far, to-date, vis-\u00e0-vis 510(k) clearance, don't know yet. So we will see. I can't give you a positive or negative indication. With regards to other folks working on flex approaches that are robotic, we have heard likewise, indications that people are interested in pursuing that. Very little publicly available out there and we won't speculate as to what their plans are ahead of whatever their public relations are. But we remain vigilant and I guess my major point on this one is, the way you satisfy your customers best is by understanding their needs and being really conversant in what they want and what the technologies are. And so I worry a lot less about what others are doing and a lot more about what we are doing. And our team is highly focused in satisfying customer need in that space and we feel good about where we are.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks Gary. And then just for my follow-up on the competition. I guess I will only ask one broad question on the TransEnterix approval. Any just comments, Gary, you know from a technology or an IP standpoint and potential for this elongating the selling cycle in the U.S.? Thanks for taking the questions.","Gary Guthart","With regard to other systems that are coming or have come out, our experience goes back pretty far. So we have lived through the pathway of hybrid surgical approaches, some robotics, some manual, three-arm systems, some things integrated, some things not integrated. We have lived through that and its our customers who have really taken us to the position we are in with integrated systems, things that work very well together. Simple examples, if you have a manual stapler and you are using robotic system, the surgeon has to often almost always scrub in and scrub out because it's unusual for physician's assistant to fire a stapler. So the workflow of getting up and sitting down is really challenging. The challenge of integrating multiple different technologies from multiple different vendors at the Or is a headache and they tell us that. We like this all to work together as if it was designed with a whole thought.","We didn't chose those things out of the blue. And so with our own systems, with systems we competed against 20 years ago, we have kind of seen this. And so I think that customers will think that through and evaluate it. You would ask, could it delay sales cycles? And the answer to that is yes, it can in the near-term. Now we are facing some of these concepts and competitive system in Europe and customers are evaluating these things and making decisions. I think they make them based on a pretty good basis. And so it may cause some short-term ripples, but we will be ready to engage those conversations with hospitals. And again, I think we didn't end up where we are by accident. That's true in our IP portfolio as well and one of the things about being the market leader is you have to solve these problems first and you get to patent them and we have. So that's something that's an asset for the company as we go forward.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Isaac Ro","Good afternoon guys. Thank you. Just a quick question on China. You guys mentioned that procedure growth decelerated even though utilization per instrument or per system went up. Can you talk a little bit about whether or not we should be thinking about your existing installed base sort of hitting full capacity utilization until we get more of an update on the quota system?","Patrick Clingan","Yes. Isaac, I think we have been surprised by the levels of utilization that we see across many of the civilian hospitals within China and to-date this year they have surpassed levels we thought that we will start to see faster slowdown there. You are starting to see the law of large numbers catch up but still strong growth in utilization. So I think the short answer is, we are not sure exactly where the ceiling is because the demand for robotic surgery in China is large and they continue to find ways to efficiently maximize the time they have on robotics each week.","Isaac Ro","Okay. And then just to follow-up on the new areas of investment for 2018 as it relates to your comments on operating leverage. Can you comment maybe even just even just qualitatively on some of the biggest areas of new investment that are incremental to the underlying programs your already had planned? I am just trying to get a sense of where those resources are being deployed.","Gary Guthart","The way to think about it in terms of just staying on the R&D product pipeline side, the peak in platform investment is several quarters before launch those things peak. And then they stay at that peak for a couple of quarters as you process through all launch activities and then you start to come off that peak. And so you have two platform that are heavily in design and moving toward commercialization. And that's the bulk of the delta.","With regard to some of the other spending, that tends to be in little bit smaller increments. And it's around things that give us manufacturing optimization. As procedure growth has continued to grow and we get additional scale, a lot of the costs in production and handling of our systems comes down to manufacturing process and scale changes we have an opportunity to tweak what we do to get lower costs. And I think that helps everybody. I think it helps Intuitive. It helps our customers. And it allows us to take advantage of scale. That's a really good thing. And so where we see those opportunities, they are pretty easy to evaluate and we move forward on them.","Isaac Ro","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter, Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Richard Newitter","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two quick ones. Just you have mentioned in the past and you again, Gary, highlighted some of the imaging developments and advancements you have been working on. Can you give us a sense as to what the timing might be on the integration of some of those into your current platforms?","Gary Guthart","Sure. So you think of imaging as having three elements of it. There is the hardware part, the optics, the electronics, the physical stuff. We are consistently improving those things and launch them as either improvements or as upgrades periodically. And you can sort of think those as having life cycles of multiple quarters, six to eight quarters. There is software improvements, image processing, image integration, those kinds of things. We also launch those either as upgrades or in conjunction with other opportunities and those go out also on account of a yearly or every other year basis. And then there is molecules, targeting agents. The molecules are viewed by the world as drugs and those go on drug timelines which are long. So we are progressing but it doesn't look like stasis. It is continuously improving our Gen 4 imaging as we speak. The Gen 4 scopes of today are better than the scopes of two years ago. The Gen 4 software is better today than it was years ago. And we continue to progress on the molecular front.","Richard Newitter","Okay. And then on the molecular, there is no concrete timeline?","Gary Guthart","Well, no. Given some of the trial activity that it has to go on, we have not yet published what we think the long term timelines are, in part because we are in conversation with the agency about how they want to view these diagnostic markers in surgery and that creates a lot of uncertainty as to what the forecast models would be.","Richard Newitter","Got it. And then just one follow-up. You mentioned that the moderation in EU for your European procedures in the third quarter. Can you just elaborate on that a little bit?","Patrick Clingan","Yes. There was moderation in certain markets, not in all. We still had strong growth in some like Germany. It was in a handful of markets, some I would characterize as slowdowns in some of the benign procedures where reimbursements are tight and other markets where you have had high levels of penetration in urology, dVP and where the emerging procedures are still small and not able to influence growth rate.","Richard Newitter","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Tao Levy. Please go ahead.","Tao Levy","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe you can start with the impact from hurricanes and I guess the one less surgery day in the U.S. So theoretically, if you had all that back in the quarter, are we talking about another 2% potentially on that U.S. growth? And do you expect to capture some of that business, at least from the hurricane means as more of a delay that you can pick up in the in the fourth quarter?","Patrick Clingan","Yes. Tao, it's really hard to calculate these things because certainly there is some patients who need surgery right way who come back faster and others that can defer longer. What you can look at it is just what happens in those markets during those period of time and make your best estimate. Our best estimate in the U.S. is that the hurricanes caused somewhere less that 1% impact to the U.S. growth rate. The one fewer weekday had some effect as well as just because you have one less Monday through Friday. But it's really hard to be precise about exactly how much it impacted business. Overall the U.S. didn't feel dramatically different though compared to prior years, particularly in the areas of general surgery and thoracic surgery.","Tao Levy","Thank you. And then you mentioned you are going to have, if I heard you correctly, that about 13 sort of new countries starting to do da Vinci procedures here in the second half of the year. Are these countries being supported directly? Are you using distributors? Are there opportunities where these countries will start to buy multiple systems? Or are these kind of more one-offs?","Gary Guthart","Tao, it's Gary. Just a clarification from the script. They are not new countries to us and da Vinci. It is da Vinci X availability in those countries. So the ability for us to sell the X system there.","Tao Levy","Okay. Got you. Thanks for that. And then just one last one. As you look at the SP for next year, again in urology, do you have a sense of how many SP surgeries have been performed in this current clinical evaluation phase? And how long will it take before some of those surgeons really start using the SP in sort of a more consistent fashion once it gets approved?","Gary Guthart","We will put out first set of systems after clearance. We are selecting sites that we think have multispecialty potential. And that will be limited at our discretion in the beginning so that we get those sites up and running, help them to be highly efficient. So we won't have a huge number. I think the demand will oversubscribe the supply in those early launch quarters. I think that it's a highly capable system. I think once we have clearance, there will be a fair amount of use. But it's going to be sequential clearances that help us get there.","Tao Levy","Okay. Thank you.","Gary Guthart","Thanks Tao.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Matt Taylor","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me okay?","Gary Guthart","Yes.","Matt Taylor","Great. So you have touched on this before, but I guess I just wanted to ask a little bit more directly. If you could give us a flavor for anything that you are seeing broadly in the market with regards to utilization or appetite for capital purchases? I remember a couple of calls ago, you said, hey, we have some uncertainty around reform. Maybe we are going to see the gun shy buyers. But that clearly has not been the case this year on capital. So just any updates you can provide on the market and what your customers are saying?","Gary Guthart","Yes. You are right. We haven't seen a broad impact of potential reform or changes in ACA. The feel of the market is pretty similar over the last few quarters. And as I said earlier, really what we think is driving the strength of system placement has to do with procedure growth rate.","Matt Taylor","And in the U.S., clearly that's all about general surgery with some of the slowdowns that you are talking about in the mature procedures. And I was wondering if you could provide some more color on areas in general that have sprouted more recently? You talked about hernia for a while and ventral and colorectal. Are there any new areas that you are seeing start to grow as surgeon adapt and begin to use the next technology in new ways?","Gary Guthart","We do see new opportunities and surgeons interested in advancing. But before I get there, I think that just from our company's focus, we have not taken the ball off general surgery. I think that the ones we are in are still relatively early in their total adoption when you think about hernia repair and colon surgery and rectal surgery and thoracic surgery. These are major categories. We think that we can bring real value and our teams are really focused there. And I focus you there. I don't think we are past that and thinking there is the next thing. We do see surgeons asking for additional opportunities. They are not yet material. And so I think we have a long pipeline. I am not ready to describe them as opportunities for you yet, because I don't know that they will realize. But there is real desire. So we stay focused on finishing the opportunities that we have started and we are still on it.","Matt Taylor","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And the last question we have in queue comes from the line of Brandon Henry with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Brandon Henry","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about the trends you are seeing in the U.S. gynecology market? And then I think you mentioned there was a moderation in benign procedures. Can you just talk about what led to that? I have a couple of follow-ups.","Gary Guthart","Yes. Brandon, overall in U.S. GYN, we saw pretty flat growth year-to-year. The deceleration compared to the first half of the year was entirely attributed to benign procedures that declined moderately. Malignant procedures continued to grow in the quarter. The trend there is in part because A, it's a very low growth area in general. You see high penetration rates of minimally invasive surgery. In any given period, you are going to have little movements here and there. So nothing notable to call out specifically as it relates to a trend there in the market.","Patrick Clingan","Yes. I think we have talked in the past about consolidation trends, right. More cases being done by gynecologic oncologists or other surgical specialists. And that's been a positive trend for us and that's largely continued here in the third quarter.","Gary Guthart","Right. And then we will just give you one more follow-up.","Brandon Henry","Sure. And in terms of new instrumentation, I think you mentioned a refined vessel sealer launch in Europe. Can you talk a little bit about the refinements made there and when you expect to launch in the U.S.? And then also do you have any update on timeline for new stapling technology? I think you mentioned a 60 millimeters stapler in the past. Thanks.","Gary Guthart","Yes. The vessel sealer is really a refinement in geometry. It allows surgeons to get to spaces that were more difficult prior. It's kind of a family member of the technology we have today. I don't have the launch date for U.S. in front of me. But we continue to build out our stapling line. As we have talked about in the past, likewise we have not projected yet the launch timeline of additional staplers. But we think stapling is important. So that's kind of where we are there.","Let me go ahead and close. That was our last question. As we have said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organization remains focused on increasing value by enabling surgeons to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure you we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery and we look forward to talking with you again in three months","Operator","Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"12686":["Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

Welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Q4 2018 Earnings Release Call. Now at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Senior Director of Finance and Investor Relation, Calvin Darling. Please go ahead, sir.","Calvin Darling","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive Surgical\u2019s fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; and Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today\u2019s call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the Company\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 2, 2018 and 10-Q filed on October 22, 2018. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC\u2019s website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.","Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Latest Events section, under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today\u2019s press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website.","Today\u2019s format will consist of providing you with highlights of our fourth quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter\u2019s business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our fourth quarter financial results. Then I will discuss procedures and clinical highlights, and provide our updated financial outlook for 2019. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.","With that, I will turn it over to Gary.","Gary Guthart","Thank you, Calvin. Entering 2019, our business is showing strength. In 2018 over 1 million surgeries were performed using da Vinci systems accompanied by approximately 1,500 peer-reviewed clinical journal articles. The total number of procedures performed since first launch exceeded 6 million and the total peer-reviewed clinical database continues over 16,000 articles. While these milestones represent a step forward, I believe that outstanding product design, robotics, advanced imaging and informatics are just starting to take their place in surgery and in acute interventions more broadly.","Surgery and acute interventions are sophisticated interactions among highly trained professionals that have a common goal of delivering outstanding care to a patient in need, starting with a careful understanding of operating and interventional environments, engineers and interaction designers collaborate closely with physicians to develop smart connected devices with the goal of the Quadruple Aim. First decreasing complications, second, increasing patient satisfaction, third, increasing care team satisfaction and forth, improved efficiency and lowering of the total cost to treat.","Considering our current da Vinci systems and the procedures in countries that are our focus today, we believe applicable procedures exceed 5 million annually. As we consider our new concepts coming to market, including but not limited to our da Vinci single port system, our advanced imaging technologies and our Ion flexible catheter system. The long-term total opportunity for our products to make a positive difference in physicians and their patients lives is greater still.","Given the positive response of our customers and in pursuit of the substantial opportunity to improve surgery and intervention that lies ahead, we plan to accelerate some investments over the next several quarters. We\u2019ll review our guidance on spend later in the call. Given our prerelease this month, I\u2019ll be brief in summarizing our 2018 highlights.","Global procedure growth was strong with approximately 19% growth in the fourth quarter and 18% for the full year. Growth in procedures was largely consistent through the year with United States showing particular strength in hernia repair, colorectal procedures and practice related general surgery procedures including cholecystectomy.","Mature procedure growth in the United States including prostatectomy and hysterectomy was solid again in 2018, though we expect slowing in these mature procedures going forward in some countries. In Japan, procedures grew over 40% in the second half of 2018, in response to additional reimbursements granted in Q2. Aggregate European procedure performance was generally in line with our expectations again this quarter with particular strength in the UK and France. Calvin will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call.","Our capital placement performance in 2018 was also strong, with growth in total placements rising 35% from 684 in 2017 to 926 in 2018. Net of trade-ins and retirements, our da Vinci installed base grew 13% over 2017. The mix of system placements between our flagship Xi System and our value X System generally aligned with our strategy regionally. As we discussed on our last earnings call, customers are interested in leasing an alternative capital placement models. The proportion of the systems place under lease increased again in the quarter from 25% in Q3 of 2018 to 29% in Q4.","Financial highlights of our fourth quarter results are as follows; revenue for the quarter was over $1 billion, up 17%. Pro forma gross profit margin was 71.8% compared to 72.4% in the fourth quarter last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $539 million, up 18%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $722 million, representing 69% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $412 million in the quarter, up 7% from the fourth quarter of last year. And pro forma net income was $353 million, up 16%. We launched the Intuitive Foundation with an initial contribution of $25 million in the quarter. The Intuitive Foundation\u2019s mission is to support clinical and technology research and acute interventions as well as philanthropy in the communities which we serve and in which we live.","Financial highlights for the full year of 2018 results are as follows; revenue for the year was $3.7 billion, up 19%. Pro forma gross profit margin was 71.5% for the full year compared to 71.9% for 2017. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $2 billion, up 20%. Total recurring revenue in the year was $2.6 billion, representing 71% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $1.5 billion in the year, up 17% from 2017. And pro forma net income was $1.3 billion, up 23% with the difference in growth rate between operating profit and net income, largely driven by the 2017 Tax Act and interest income earned.","Looking ahead, a review of clinical outcomes for complex surgery and acute interventions across large population still highlights a substantial need for improvement. We measure our efforts by their ability to positively impact the Quadruple Aim. Real progress requires more than minimally invasive tools and more than digital technologies. These technologies are necessary but not sufficient. We believe intelligence surgery takes the integration of three elements.","First, a deep understanding of human interactions that informed holistic system design; second, the development of high quality smart and cloud connected robotic imaging and instrument systems; and lastly, informatics and AI to deliver relevant, validated insights. While we\u2019ve made significant progress over our history, we believe continuous improvement is required and we've deployed our investments toward these aims.","We\u2019re bringing together several efforts in pursuit of our mission. We are early in our Phase 1 launch of da Vinci SP. We installed 15 systems in 2018 and a few hundred procedures have been performed to-date. Surgeon and patient feedback have been positive for usability and patient experience in these early days of launch.","We submitted our 510(k) for our second indication, TransOral Robotic Surgery in Q4 of 2018 and are responding to FDA questions on this second indication. We're also working through supply chain optimization, as we begin to ramp up production for SP, in addition, in anticipation of additional clearances in broader launch.","Our first step into flexible diagnostics Ion is nearing Phase 1 launch. We submitted our 510(k) in 2018 and have responded to FDA questions this month. We anticipate Phase 1 limited launch of Ion in 2019. Focus on the need for definitive early diagnosis of suspicious lesions for lung cancer.","In instruments and accessories, we plan to broaden the launch of our SureForm 60-millimeter stapler for da Vinci in the first half of 2019. The 60-millimeter stapler is used primarily in abdominal surgeries including Bariatric surgery. Surgeon response has been encouraging and our team has performed well in establishing it supply chain.","Over the past several years, we've been increasing our cloud computing and informatics capabilities. Today, we routinely deliver programmatic insights to customers using our systems, which have been smart and connected for the past decade. We believe there are opportunities to further enhance these capabilities. Our advanced imaging programs and augmented reality programs are making progress. We anticipate first clinical use of our augmented reality program in 2019.","As described in our prerelease, we've also been increasing investments in building our business operations in countries important to our future. Our efforts in China will accelerate in 2019 with the da Vinci distribution arm of Fosun Pharma, Chindex joining our joint venture this quarter. Combined with the release of the next system quota and the clearance of da Vinci Xi in China, we will be accelerating investments to establish our base to serve China over the long term.","In 2018, we also acquired our da Vinci business in India and Taiwan and anticipate strengthening our investments and presence over the next several quarters. We described the multi-year nature of these investments in our JPMorgan talk using Intuitive Japan as an example. Market development in country is an arduous multi-year process. It involves building a strong management team and company culture, establishing strong working relationships with surgical societies, policymakers, regulators, and key customers, as well as building training in proctoring capability along with a local clinical evidence base.","As we bring these efforts together, we plan to accelerate our spend rate above our historical norms for the next several quarters. As described above, the increase in spend is driven primarily by funding and growth of our joint venture in China, the ramp of our informatics efforts, infrastructure to support our procedure growth, including manufacturing lines and facilities, and the launch of our new platforms. We pace the rate of investment not just by the opportunity for growth, which we believe is substantial, but by our ability to integrate talented staff and execute against our objectives.","In closing, as we start 2019, our focus will be on first supporting adoption of da Vinci in general surgery and in key procedures and global markets. Second, launching our SP and Ion platforms; third, driving intelligent surgery innovation, and finally, supporting additional clinical and economic validation in our focus procedures and countries.","I'll now turn the call over to Marshall to review financial highlights.","Marshall Mohr","Good afternoon. I'll describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP to (12:02) pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my script. Reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website.","Consistent with our preliminary press release on January 9, fourth quarter 2018 revenue was $1.047 billion, an increase of 17% compared with $892 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 14% compared with third quarter revenue of $921 million.","Fourth quarter 2018 procedures increased approximately 19% compared with the fourth quarter of 2017, and increased approximately 11% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth continues to be driven by general surgery in U.S. in neurology worldwide. Calvin will review details of procedure growth later in this call.","Instrument and accessory revenue of $539 million increased 18% with last year, which is lower than procedure growth, reflecting approximately $6 million of INA repurchase from distributors in China and Taiwan, in conjunction with transactions to go direct in both geographies and customer buying patterns, partially offset by increased usage of our advanced instruments.","Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure was approximately $1,890, a decrease of 1% compared with the fourth quarter of 2017, and relatively unchanged compared with last quarter. Excluding the buyback of inventory from China and Taiwan instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was similar to last year.","Systems revenue of $341 million increased 20% compared with the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily reflecting higher system placements and higher lease related revenue. We placed 290 systems in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with 216 systems in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 231 systems last quarter. 84 operating lease transactions representing 29% of total placements were completed in the current quarter, compared with 40 or 19% of total placements in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 58 or 25% of total placements last quarter.","Operating leases include some usage based financing that we provide certain large hospitals. We believe that these usage based financing alternatives align with customer objectives enabling faster market expansion. As of December 31, we have 350 operating leases outstanding. And we realized approximately $16 million of revenue related to these arrangements in the quarter. The proportion of these types of arrangements could increase in the long-term and will be lumpy quarter-to-quarter.","28% of the current system placements in bulk trade-ins, reflecting customer desire to access or standardized on our fourth-generation technology. This is approximately the same proportion as last quarter and last year. Trade-in activity can be lumpy and difficult to predict. 73% of the system placed in the quarter were da Vinci Xi\u2019s and 18% were da Vinci X system compared with 68% da Vinci Xi\u2019s and 28% da Vinci X's last quarter. 12 of the systems placed were SP systems.","Our install base of da Vinci systems increased 13% year-over-year and our average system utilization grew in the mid single-digit range. Globally, our average selling price, which excludes the impact of operating leases, lease buyouts and revenue deferrals, was approximately $1.46 million, compared with $1.47 million last year, and $1.45 million last quarter. The change is compared with prior periods primarily reflects the mix of systems.","Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. Fourth quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $307 million increased 24% compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased 25% compared with last quarter. OUS procedures grew approximately 24% compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased 10% compared with the third quarter.","Outside U.S, we placed 115 systems in the fourth quarter compared with 86 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 75 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 55 into Europe, 31 into Japan, and 9 into Brazil. 35 of the 115 systems placed in the fourth quarter were X systems and 15 were operating leases.","Placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of the OUS markets are in early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns, and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations.","Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. The pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 71.8% compared with 72.4% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 71.5% last quarter. The decrease compared with fourth quarter of 2017 primarily reflects product mix in costs associated with new products. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of systems and instrument and accessory revenue, system ASPs in our ability to further reduce costs and improve manufacturing efficiency.","Pro forma operating expenses increased 31% compared with the fourth quarter 2017 and increased 27% compared with last quarter. Fourth quarter 2018 operating expenses included a $25 million contribution to the newly formed Intuitive Foundation. The foundation is a charitable organization, aimed at improving patient outcome. It will donate to qualified non-profit academic organizations directed as surgeon training and education including fellowships, advanced clinical research and advanced robotics research. The $25 million will enable the foundation to make meaningful contributions over the next several years.","Our pattern or future contributions will vary based on various factors, including the financial performance of the company and opportunities for the foundation to make meaningful contributions within its mission. Excluding the contribution to the foundation, pro forma operating expenses increased 21% compared with the fourth quarter of 2017.","The increase in fourth quarter expenses reflect; one, increased costs that fluctuate directly with revenue, including sales and corporate incentive compensation; two, costs we elected to accelerate including spend on infrastructure in order to scale the business; and three, investments that drive our future opportunity including costs associated with going direct in China, Taiwan, India, and cost of prototypes.","We believed that we were early in our journey to expand minimally invasive surgery and feel the fundamentals in the businesses are strong. So, we\u2019re accelerating our investment in selected areas while continuing to invest in key product areas including SP, Ion, Vision and advanced instruments. We will accelerate spending on our informatics capabilities, expansion of our OUS markets, including China, India, and Taiwan, and investments that enable us to scale the business, including expansion of an automation of manufacturing.","We believe these are important investments. That said, we intend to control spending in headcount growth to that which we could manage well. This leads us to a broad estimate of operating expense increase of 20% to 28% in 2019. Some spending naturally fluctuates with revenue and procedures like sales, production expenses, in corporate incentive compensation, other spending is longer-term in nature and positions us for future growth; for example, SP, Ion and Imaging. We would target to spend the lower end of the 20% to 28% range at the bottom end of procedure growth guidance. We are investing with an eye towards long-term for the company and the market and as such don\u2019t intend to modulate long-term investments in response to transient conditions.","Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 20% compared with our expectations of 19% to 20%. Our tax rates will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of one-time items. Our fourth quarter 2018 pro forma net income was $353 million or $2.96 per share compared with $305 million or $2.60 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $337 million or $2.83 per share for the third quarter of 2018. Excluding the Intuitive Foundation contribution, pro forma net income was $373 million or $3.13 per share.","I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $293 million, or $2.45 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with GAAP net loss of $32 million, or $0.28 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 and GAAP net income of $293 million, or $2.45 per share for the third quarter of 2018.","The GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 reflects the impact of the Tax Act, while the fourth quarter of 2018 includes the $25 million contribution to the Intuitive Foundation. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee equity and IP charges and legal settlements. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $4.8 billion, compared with $4.6 billion at September 30, 2018. The increase generally reflects cash generated from operations partially offset by investments in working capital and infrastructure.","In the quarter, we grew inventory by approximately $40 million to $409 million, representing approximately four months of inventory. We continue to build inventory to address the growth in the business as well as mitigate risks of disruption that could arise from trade, supplier and other matters. With the growth in the business and our focus on efficiency and scale, we expect our capital expenditures. We increased over $250 million in 2019. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter and have approximately $718 million remaining under the board buyback authorization.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Calvin, who go over procedure performance and our outlook for 2019.","Calvin Darling","Thank you, Marshall. Our overall fourth quarter procedure growth was 19% compared to 17% during the fourth quarter of 2017 and 20% last quarter. Our Q4 procedure growth was driven by 18% growth in U.S. procedures and 24% growth in OUS markets. Overall procedure growth for the full year 2018 was approximately 18% compared to 16% in 2017 comprised of 17% growth in the U.S. and 22% growth in OUS markets.","In the U.S, Q4 and full-year procedure results were consistent with recent trends. Q4 growth was again driven by growth in U.S. general surgery and thoracic procedures augmented by continued contributions from growth and mature gynecologic and urologic procedures.","For the full year, approximately 753,000 procedures were performed in the U.S. for the full year, 2018 U.S. general surgery procedures increased approximately 32% to 325,000 procedures. Hernia repair, both ventral and inguinal continued to contribute the most incremental cases in the quarter and year with colorectal procedures continuing to show strong growth.","Growth and practice based procedures including cholecystectomy and bariatric surgery increased as the year progressed. In U.S. gynecology, full-year 2018 year-over-year growth increased to mid-single digits driven by higher benign hysterectomy volumes. Fourth quarter 2018 U.S. gynecology procedure growth was slightly above the full-year growth rate, likely reflecting increasing seasonality in these benign procedures, partially offset by modest headwinds and hysterectomy for cancer, a mature category, where da Vinci surgery is standard of care.","In the fourth quarter, we continued to see favorable surgical consolidation trends as our da Vinci surgery data indicate that practicing da Vinci surgeons performed more da Vinci hysterectomies and an increasing proportion of U.S. gynecology procedures are being performed by higher volume positions.","Full-year 2018 U.S. urology procedures grew approximately 8%. Q4 2018 growth was at a rate largely consistent with the full-year results driven by prostatectomy volumes. As a mature procedure category, we believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market, which has benefited from recent macro trends.","In other U.S. procedures, adoption of lobectomies and other thoracic procedures was again solid during the fourth quarter. Full-year 2018, OUS procedures grew 22%, consistent overall with 23% growth in 2017. Q4 OUS procedure growth trends were mostly in line with the full-year results.","Fourth quarter OUS procedure volume grew approximately 24% compared with 21% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 23% last quarter. Fourth quarter 2018 OUS procedure growth was driven by continued growth in dVP procedures and earlier stage growth in kidney cancer procedures, general surgery and gynecology.","Q4 procedure growth in Japan was consistent with Q3 at a rate over 40% as procedures were performed within the set of 12 additional procedures approved for reimbursement, effective April 1. Procedure growth in China again moderated in Q4 as da Vinci system capacity expansion was constrained by system quota requirements.","As Gary mentioned, over 1500 peer-reviewed clinical articles regarding da Vinci surgery were published in 2018 and over 16,000 have been published to-date. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deemed to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years.","In December 2018, a manuscript was published by the journal of gastric cancer, titled clinical advantages of robotic gastrectomy for clinical stage one and two gastric cancer, a multi-institutional prospective single-arm study. This study was one of the largest multicenter prospective studies for gastric cancer, which included 330 patients across 15 institutions in Japan. This study was designed to show the safety, effectiveness, and economic efficiency of da Vinci surgery for gastric cancer, and was in support of the MHLW Senshin Iryo B process, which led to the recent addition of gastrectomy to reimburse status in Japan.","The main hypothesis of the study was to demonstrate a reduction in morbidity associated with robotic surgery compared to laparoscopy. The hypothesis was confirmed as the results showed a reduction in the morbidity rate to 2.45% for robotic procedures compared to 6.4% for the historical lap control group, patient characteristics and surgical outcomes were compared between the prospective arm, the robotic group, and the historical control, the laparoscopic group.","Preoperative differences were noted in both groups as the robotic group contained more patients of younger age, but also contain more complex patients with higher comorbid conditions. The robotic arm had lower clinical staging while no differences were noted in pathological staging between the groups.","In the directional analysis, the robotic-assisted cohort was noted to have significantly lower interoperative blood loss, shorter duration of hospital stay, nine days versus 13 days with comparable operative time. The authors of the study concluded that the significant reduction and morbidity might help demonstrate reduced total cost of care of da Vinci surgery to be likely the same amount as for laparoscopy. In conclusion, the robotic group reduced the morbidity rate when compared to the findings of the lap group. Robotic surgery might be safe, feasible, and effective for gastric cancer.","I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2019. Starting with procedures, as described in our announcement earlier this month, 2018 total da Vinci procedures grew approximately 18% to roughly 1,037,000 procedures performed worldwide. As communicated previously during 2019, we anticipate full-year procedure growth within a range of 13% to 17%. We expect 2019 procedure growth to continue to be driven by U.S. general surgery and procedures outside of the United States, where we are still in the early stages of adoption.","We expect similar seasonal timing of procedures in 2019 as we have experienced in previous years with Q1 being the seasonally weakest quarter as patient deductibles are reset. With respect to revenue as we have mentioned previously, capital sales are ultimately driven by procedure growth, catalyzing hospitals to establish or expand robotic system capacity. Capital sales can vary substantially from period-to-period based upon many factors, including U.S. healthcare policy, hospital capital spending cycles, reimbursement and government quotas, product cycles, economic cycles, and competitive factors.","Within this framework, we\u2019d expect 2019 capital placement seasonality to generally follow historical patterns by quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2018, 84 of the 290 or 29% of the system shift were under operating leases. We expect that the proportion of systems placed via operating leases will vary from quarter-to-quarter and could trend up in the future.","Turning to gross profit. Our full-year 2018 pro forma gross profit margin was 71.5%. In 2019, we expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71% of net revenue. Our actual gross profit margin will very quarter-to-quarter depending largely upon product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions.","Turning to operating expenses. As Gary and Marshall outlined, we will be following through on in expanding our investments in 2019. We expect to grow pro forma 2019 operating expenses between 20% and 28% above 2018 levels. We expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $310 million and $340 million in 2019 compared to $261 million in 2018.","We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $120 million and $130 million in 2019. With regard to income tax consistent with our 2018 results, we estimate our 2019 pro forma income tax rate to be between 19% and 20% of pretax income.","That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will be from the line of David Lewis, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Lewis","Good morning. Maybe I\u2019ll start financial and then work to Gary for strategic. So, just Marshall and maybe a little bit for Gary as well, just sticky about the spending breakdown for 2019, two questions, then I\u2019ll just do one follow-up. on financial pieces, Marshall, any sense of R&D relative to SG&A, we\u2019re sort of assuming you continue to grow R&D at a similar rate of 2018 in the material step up and spending relative to my models more SG&A and maybe just sort of walk us through a couple of the components there in R&D and SG&A that are driving the majority of the spend. And then I had a quick follow-up for Gary.","Marshall Mohr","Yes. I think that the step up and spend is maybe slightly weighted towards SG&A, but pretty even across the categories, the elements of SG&A are as I discussed, the expansion OUS and the investments we\u2019re making in China, India and Taiwan those are commercial organizations and that appears in SG&A. Of course, SG&A will grow a lot of costs that fluctuate with revenue such as sales compensation and incentive compensations flow through SG&A. However, in the R&D area, we will continue to invest in SP, Ion and Vision and advanced instruments. And then as I said, will be accelerating some of our investments in digital capabilities or informatics.","David Lewis","Okay. Very helpful, Marshall. And then Gary, there\u2019s been some media reports about one of your competitors drawing insurance from a much larger company, and I\u2019d say barriers to entry is perhaps the most common incoming question we get from investors. So, I wonder, if you could help us articulate, what is the Intuitive mode as you see it or investors asking the wrong question and they should be more focused on TAM expansion. Thanks so much.","Gary Guthart","I think a little bit of both that are going on I think in the competitive world. On the first side of our customers going to choose, I think customers appreciate choice and will expect it from us and from others. And in all things they\u2019ll evaluate competitive offerings. For us, we focus a lot on understanding what the workflow environment is, understanding the total cost, not just the constituent cost of price of the system or price of the instruments and accessories is really total cost to use the product, stability, usability, supply chain stability all of those things I think are valued when people are putting a fair amount of their surgical volume onto a platform. And I think it\u2019ll take some time for folks to fully absorb and understand that. And I think also there\u2019s some nice effects about surgeons training surgeons. There\u2019s a large install base of surgeons, they interact with each others through surgical societies. They proctor each other. And I think that that allows our compound cycle of learning that\u2019s been effective.","To the question of what does it do, as some of the other larger competitors declared their desire of enter. I do think it validates for the broader market, the things we believed for many years and have been investing towards for many years. So, I think it\u2019s a signal to everybody that these technologies and approaches are going to be important to the future. That said, there are smart people in all these organizations and outside of our company and we\u2019ll see, we have evaluated many of the competitive concepts that we see out there, often making them for ourselves and evaluating them over the years. We really make our decisions based on what we think the customer needs and as a forward look and as a result, I think we may be wrong about some of our decisions, but we\u2019ve tried to be well informed about our decisions.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bob Hopkins, Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bob Hopkins","Thanks very much for taking the questions. And I have sort of two similar lines of questioning here. First, just to follow up a little bit on the comments on spend in 2019. For 2018, there was a 17% increase; for 2019, you\u2019re talking about at the midpoint of 24% increase. I mean that\u2019s roughly $75 million, I was wondering if you could kind of lay out how much of that is the investment in China and Taiwan and going direct.","And then also how would you just sort of characterize that incremental $75 million in the growth rate you\u2019re experiencing this year. Is this more of kind of one-time increase in the growth of expenses or could this be sort of a growth rate that we would experience for another couple of years? Thank you.","Marshall Mohr","Yes. So I think, Bob, these are multi-year investments and as Gary referred to it in his script, if you go back and you look at sort of what we said, we did in Japan, the investments were made early on in it, but you continue to make those investments overtime to get to a point of where you might see a real return from them. And in the case of Japan, we\u2019ve been investing in Japan for 10 years and we\u2019re now seeing the fruits of that investment in terms of a 12 procedure reimbursement.","So, I wouldn\u2019t characterize these as a one-time event. I think we\u2019ll continue to invest in some of those things for quite some time. As far as how this \u2013 you came up with $75 million, how the \u2013 how you would proportion the pieces, I think I pretty much laid it out for David, there\u2019s a chunk of spending associated with the expansion OUS in China, India and Taiwan, that will \u2013 you\u2019ll see that primarily in the SG&A line, but there\u2019s an equal set of investments being made in terms of informatics as well as investments to scale the business investments in expansion in automation of the manufacturing group, so\u2026","Bob Hopkins","Okay, I appreciate that. And then one for Gary. Just a question on competition, frame it just a little bit differently. J&J and Medtronic both continue to suggest that sometime late in 2020, they'll bring some sort of technology to the market in robotic form. That both suggest that they're going to have lower cost systems, they haven't given as much details. But in my view, both sort of implied that their systems will be geared towards converting lap focus surgeons to robotic platform. So my question to you is, I realize you don't comment much on your pipeline. But I was just curious if you could comment, do you see potential value in advancing lap through robotics? And is this a priority for Intuitive today?","Gary Guthart","I do believe that some advanced MIS surgeons are becoming increasingly open to the use of robotic surgery and intelligent surgery. And we see it today in the market. We see bariatric surgeons interested in our technologies, and that's a domain that is high laparoscopic penetration. So I believe there's an opportunity there. I would separate the idea of capital being the only thing to think about as an opportunity to pursue that that growing idea in advanced laparoscopy. And what I say is that I think physicians are going to balance multiple criteria.","They\u2019re going to look at total cost to treat. So the capital, the cost to service that capital, instruments and accessories, the outcomes that they get from it, efficiencies and human capital time or human labor time in the OR and they're going to balance that. And I think all of those are up for discussion when you think about trade-offs between advanced laparoscopy and intelligent surgery. We think there's an opportunity there. We will pursue that opportunity.","When I hear folks kind of over rotate to just capital cost on systems, I kind of think about how excited are people to jump aboard, just good enough commercial airliner. For sure, if you're flying commercial airline, you want the lowest total cost per passenger mile, but you can get that a lot of different ways and cheapening the capital, maybe not the best way. We evaluate all of those elements, we have thought about them deeply and we've made investments to pursue what we think is the right leadership position there.","Bob Hopkins","Terrific. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tyco Pete, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tyco Pete","Thanks. I want to maybe just pick up where you left off on some of these new initiatives. You talked about the first clinical use case for augmented reality this year. Can you talk a little bit about how you think about commercializing that, where you see the key application areas? And then similarly on the informatics investments, can you talk a little bit about what you're hoping to accomplish there?","Gary Guthart","Sure. Those two are related, but we'll start with augmented reality or mixed reality and that's something we have been working on for some time. And the world has been interested in. The idea here is to use multiple sources of information preoperative CT scans or MRI scans, intraoperative other imaging like ultrasound or florescence imaging, molecular imaging. And combine them in ways that allow the surgeon or physician to see things differently.","It is embedded in inherent in Ion already that some of that core capability is required. We're also bringing some of that core capability to our da Vinci systems. In the beginning it will be around preoperative imaging and some intraoperative imaging mixed together for the surgeon in real time. First, I'd expect first clinical uses this year and the beginnings of the study that go around that. I don't think it will be a meaningful revenue contributor in the near-term. But I think it's one of the things that can really change outcomes, efficiency and the procedure and outcomes now it remains to be proven.","But, we're excited about it. That's one leg of our thoughts around informatics and you've heard us talk about this over the years from strengthening our cloud computing capabilities. Internet connected our systems a decade ago to a partnership and then an increased and closer investment with InTouch Health around routing of data quickly and low latency in real time to internal capabilities around managing data legs and providing for customers, offline processing that allows them to compare their programs and take advantage of some advances in machine learning.","Those are the types of elements that we're bringing to bear. It's nice. We have a foothold, we have some brilliant scientists who are advancing and leading that cause. And we think we have discrete deliverable steps that we can do and then validate that will start bringing real value to the market.","Tyco Pete","And then I guess a follow-up on Ion, a couple of questions here. Any risk of timeline slipping with the government shutdown. I mean, now that you've submitted the 510(k)? And then should we expect additional clinical data to come out this year? And it sounds like for the gross margin commentary you're not expecting any real impact on negative impact on gross margins with the rollout. Can you confirm that?","Gary Guthart","Let me speak to the first two and I'll let Mark will speak to the last one on margins. There's always a risk that things slow down. We are in engaged contact with FDA and so far we're feeling pretty good about it. But I can't speak to what the long-term implications will be in terms of shutdown dynamics. In terms of clinical data, there'll be \u2013 if things proceed the way we hope, we\u2019ll start collecting additional data as it comes out. In terms of ones that gets published, I think it will depend on the timing of the clearance and the speed with which some of the installs happened.","We think that the demand pipeline for Ion looks really good. The scientific response to FDA's questions, we feel good about and the engineering team and supply chain team, bringing those early systems out looks really good too. So I'm really pleased with the internal teams\u2019 performance and the setup of activities. With regard to margin impact, Marshall.","Marshall Mohr","Yes. Ion will be rolled out in a measured fashion to create a good foundation. And so the consequences of both on the revenue and the gross margin line will be very small.","Tyco Pete","Okay. And If I could just ask one last one on the cadence of placements in China. You're expecting \u2013 now that you've had a little bit of time to digest the quota, anything to think about in the first half of the year here?","Marshall Mohr","Yes. So the quota, just to recap for everybody, 154 systems, keep in mind that 154 systems is for surgical robots. If there were to be competitors that got their product approved in China. They would share in that quota. So it's not just quota for us. The quota has been released. However, there are tendering processes that the hospitals have to go through. Let me remind you, the last time we got a quota in 2013. Most of the systems were shipped near the end of 2015. So it took awhile. When I would say \u2013 and then finally, the other implication is that there is a 25% tariff on the robots that the Chinese have imposed. We think that there's high interest in robotics in China, so I don't know, what that 25% \u2013 how that 25% will affect to their desire to buy. What I would say is that the pattern of placements will be few in the first half and more near the end of quarter period, which is 2020.","Tyco Pete","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Larry Biegelsen","Well, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. One on SP and one strategic question for you Gary, so on SP, I heard the commentary upfront about a few hundred procedures. Any themes you would highlight and remind us again of when we can expect the full launch?","Gary Guthart","With regard to early themes, the feedback has been that usability on the new platform is got a little \u2013 slightly different set of operating principles has been a positive surprise. Also the physician excitement about its ability to reach into small places and some of the flexibility at exhibits relative to setup and access has been a really positive surprise for us, which has been great. So that's been good. I think pacing demand looks really good. We are for sure supply constrained relative to demand and the pacing there will really be around a couple of things. One is we want to get our supply chain partners ready for real volumes. So we knocked down some of the issues that make it, take them awhile to produce things and we want to solve some of the manufacturing bottlenecks.","The second thing is we want some of the additional indications that give our customers a little more flexibility with how they can use the product. So that'll pace it. We don't have a timeline yet for you on those two things. Both of them have a little bit of uncertainty in them. The FDA review of submissions being one and working down some of the technical bottlenecks is the other. I don't see any insurmountable technical challenges. I think it's just work. But so far so good and we're feeling like they're meeting the plan, we said.","Larry Biegelsen","That\u2019s helpful. And Gary, as you know, we're seeing procedures in the U.S. moving to the outpatient in ASC settings. Do you believe your current Gen-4 offering and leasing option provide adequate terms for expansion into this environment? Thanks for taking the questions.","Gary Guthart","Yes. Thank you. You think about freestanding centers. There's kind of two dimensions on which you think about freestanding surgery centers. One of them are hospital owned outpatient departments. We are already well used and appreciated in those settings. So that's the physical structure is kind of the same and it's just how the ownership and operations are organized. Freestanding centers that are owned by group practices not hospital owned of a little bit different reimbursement in economics. We actually do see some of them starting to express interest and adopt robotics. I think that as we were saying earlier in the call, which procedures go there, depends both on the reimbursement of the procedure and the efficiencies with which products get used. And I think that for the right settings, Gen-4 can be quite strong.","Larry Biegelsen","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Amit Hazan, Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Amit Hazan","Well, thanks. Hey, good afternoon. Let me just start with a system or a unit growth question first, totally understanding the macro comments you made about that. But if I look at the data, look at the numbers, second year of accelerating growth, lots of drivers kind of seeming to be accelerating at the same time, trade-ins, operating leases, new products, procedure growth accelerating. So a lot's happening that's accelerating and have that very little, really nothing to tell me that growth trends are going to change that much. So help me out and tell me, outside of the macro issues, why would unit growth trends change much in 2019?","Calvin Darling","Yes, I mean regarding procedures, like we said in the prepared comments, it's really the procedure growth that drives demand for capital placement. So you mentioned a number of other factors, things like trade-ins, leasing programs, new product introductions. Things like that then can have an effect on the results either. But we talk about these things possibly fluctuating quarter-to-quarter and it comes down to just laying out your model and your frame of thought and working backwards from the install base and working at the installations. But there's a lot of the factors that you described are what's in the world.","And mature procedures will a moderate growth for sure. We also know that in some cases, for example, there was a publication of couple of articles about the cervical cancer in New England Journal, and that can change procedure growth rates too, so and create a headwind. So there's a little bit of puts and takes here. In general, we are feeling like the business is strong and there\u2019s strong momentum. But there are some things that will moderate as well.","Amit Hazan","And I have follow-up on the operating lease side and in the U.S. in particular, where obviously, I think it's up above 30% of units sold in 2018, I think it was 20% of unit sold for 2017. So we're starting to see kind of a trend line. And I do get what you're saying with volatility, but the question I think for us, especially, we start to model or try to model your system revenue number accurately for the year is how to think about that trend for 2019 and even 2020. It seems like you're focusing more on it, you're offering more programs and that trend line could continue. So we could kind of be towards the mid 30% to 40% range in the U.S in 2019. Are there other things that I should be considering for that why that wouldn't happen?","Calvin Darling","Well, it's been a successful program. I mean, it's been a way for us to offer hospitals an opportunity to expand their capacities without the initial capital investment. So it's been very successful. I'm not sure the numbers completely jive with what you said. We were 25% of placements in Q3 and 29% in Q4. We're under operating leases. So you saw that step-up quite a bit in the last couple of quarters. And so our comments are like, okay, we're here now, slightly to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter from where we ended the year. And then over the long-term, it could increase.","Gary Guthart","We believed that the operating leases are a good thing. We would, if having the choice place a system under an operating lease rather than sell the system, it reduces this fluctuation, like you said, it stabilizes sort of the revenue stream, if you will. It also in terms of if there were an upgrade cycle, what we've seen in studies is that the upgrade cycle is quicker when there's leases versus purchase product. So we think it's positive in a number of ways. However, it's up to customers. We really leave it to customers to decide what is best for them and we will fulfill that. And so it\u2019s hard for us to predict exactly, where the customer will go and to what level will wind up with leases versus purchase.","Amit Hazan","Fair enough, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rick Wise of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Rick Wise","Hi, good afternoon, Gary. Maybe turning back to the acquisition of your da Vinci business in India and Taiwan again. I heard you clearly; these are long-term investments that will take a long time to play out. I\u2019d be curious to hear more about your thoughts about the relative size of the opportunities in India and Taiwan. Is this sort of, you mentioned Japan as a proxy a little bit, but Indian and Taiwan match up with China and Japan is in terms of magnitude, I mean, I assume you must think the opportunity there is significant. Just maybe help us think about that and frame it for us?","Gary Guthart","Clearly, the strategic motivation behind India and Taiwan are a little bit different. With regard to Taiwan, in terms of actual size, not going to be a huge part of the business. However, it\u2019s an influential market, we \u2013 the distributor there that we were working with was, well built, and we think that it, it\u2019s a group that does good surgery and has a good influence in the region. I think it\u2019s important to serve that customer base well, but it\u2019s not a massive financial impact by any means nor do we expect it to be.","India has, I think, a fair amount of runway where it is today, and where it might be in a decade can be quite different. And so here, the idea is, it will take some time to build our capabilities in India, but we also think it\u2019s an economy that\u2019s been growing. There\u2019s a strength in the surgical community in India both there and globally. And so it\u2019s an important long-term market for us. We think that financially, of course, it can become a significant part of Intuitive\u2019s business over the years. And the point of illustrating some of the Japanese example is that building a real presence and building the organization and the trust within the healthcare community in those markets takes time. So, if you want to get there in a decade and you better start, and that\u2019s really what\u2019s driven us in those two markets.","Rick Wise","Okay. Just as a follow-up and a different topic. You\u2019ve highlighted, obviously some puts and takes in terms of growth, procedure growth, and you mentioned specifically slowing mature procedure growth in some countries. Maybe just expand on that is this just you\u2019ve penetrated the market, and its flowing or is this something else going on? Maybe just give us a little more color there. Thanks so much.","Gary Guthart","In several countries, we are a substantial share of the surgical market, think of the United States prostatectomy or partial nephrectomy in the United States or hysterectomies for certain conditions. And as a result, we see that part really growing at the demographic trends rather than changing share of approach trends. And that\u2019s true in the U.S., it\u2019s true in some countries in Europe with regard to prostatectomy and some of the urologic procedures. In Japan, we\u2019re already quite highly penetrated in prostatectomy and increasingly so in nephrectomy. So that that was the \u2013 what\u2019s some of the detail or examples of what underlies the more general comment.","Rick Wise","Thank you.","Gary Guthart","Just one more questioner please.","Operator","And that question is from the line of Richard Newitter [Leerink Partners]. Please go ahead sir.","Richard Newitter","Hi, thank you. Wanted to start off on the percentage of operating leases and flexible financing arrangements, that\u2019s clearly increasing as a percent of the total placements. Can you characterize for us what the utilization rate differences are on the systems that are getting placed into those types of contracts versus the rest of the installed base? I would imagine it\u2019s higher, but can you quantify it at all?","Gary Guthart","We do quantify it. We monitor it closely. And there is not a market difference between what the utilization rates are on leases versus purchased product.","Richard Newitter","Okay. Thanks. And then just on the follow-up to the last question, Rick\u2019s question. As we think about the low-end and the high-end of your 2019 procedure growth range, is there \u2013 is the slowing mature procedure growth commentary kind of meant to be throughout the entire range or is that contemplated at the low end instead of the high end?","Gary Guthart","Yes. Some level of moderation, particularly in the U.S. is a part of the trend and obviously, more moderation at the lower end and less moderation at the higher end. But the range will be largely, the range itself is largely effective. The biggest factor is going to be the breadth and pace of growth in U.S. general surgery, largest category now. Then the mature procedures and some other factors regarding growth in China, timing of placements of new systems and the pace of adoption of reimbursed procedures in Japan.","Richard Newitter","Thank you.","Gary Guthart","Well, thank you. Thank you for the questions. That was our last one. As we\u2019ve said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits, and cash flow during these conference calls. Our organizational focus remains on increasing value by enabling surgeons to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma. We\u2019ve built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference.","This concludes today\u2019s call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery and we look forward to talking to you again, in three months.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect. Have a good day."],"12687":["Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

Welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Q1 2019 Earnings Release Call. [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to Calvin Darling, Senior Director of Finance, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Calvin Darling","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive Surgical first quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; and Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call maybe deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 4, 2019. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.","Please note, that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Latest Events section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website.","Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session.","Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights; Marshall will provide a review of our first quarter financial results; then I will discuss procedures and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2019. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.","With that, I'll turn it over to Gary.","Gary Guthart","Let's first start -- this first quarter was a solid start to 2019 for Intuitive. Customer response to our products and services is healthy with continued growth in their use of da Vinci to deliver high-quality, minimally-invasive surgery to our broad base of patients.","As I've said in the past, I believe that outstanding product design, robotics, advanced imaging and informatics are just starting to take their place in surgery and in acute interventions more broadly. We have a substantial opportunity and there is significant work to be done.","Global procedure growth was strong at approximately 18% in the first quarter of 2019, progress of growth remained consistent with our trailing several quarters, with growth in general surgery accounting for strength in the United States. Growth in Japan continues to be healthy with strength in urology, gastrectomy and colorectal procedures. Growth in China met our expectations given constraints on capital placements.","Placements of new systems in the quarter was strong with growth in total placements rising 27% from Q1 of 2018. Net of trade exam retirements, our da Vinci installed base again grew 13% over Q1 2018 to approximately 5,110. The mix of systems placements between our flagship Xi System and our value X system generally aligned with our strategy regionally. Trade-ins of earlier generation systems increased this quarter as customers pursued the features of our generation four systems and some hospitals seek to standardize.","As we discussed on our previous earnings calls, customers aren't interested in leasing, including usage-based models. The proportion of systems placed under operating leases increased again from 29% in Q4 2018 to 33% in Q1 of this year. The increase in trade-ins, leasing and usage-based models aligns with our strategy in supporting customers. It allows them greater flexibility to have the right systems in the right care delivery environments. For the investor, it can make revenue modeling for systems harder to evaluate relative to prior quarters as trade-ins impact our reported ASP and leasing defers revenue to future quarters. Marshall will take you through greater detail later in the call.","Turning to expenses, we described our plans for increased investment in 2019 as we launched new platforms, strengthened our computational capabilities and invest in projects that support future scale and provide leverage opportunities as we grow. Over the past year, we've seen our increased flexibility with customers catalyze growth, which in turn enables us to invest in manufacturing efficiencies that lower our costs. Our spending fell near the top end of the range of projections we shared with you last quarter, supported by procedure growth above the top end of our procedure guidance range.","Financial highlights of our first quarter are as follows: procedures grew approximately 18% for the first quarter of last year; we placed 235 da Vinci surgical systems, up from 185 in the first quarter of 2018; our installed base again grew 13% from a year ago; revenue for the quarter was approximately $974 million, up 15%; pro forma gross profit margin was 71.2% compared to 71.6% in the first quarter last year.","Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $552 million, up 20%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $747 million, growing 20% over Q1 of 2018 and representing 77% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $362 million in the quarter, up 4% from the first quarter last year and pro forma net income was $312 million, up 9%. As you know, we measure our efforts by their ability to positively impact the quadruple aim: better outcomes, better patient experience, better care team experience, and lower total cost to treat per patient episode.","Real progress requires more than minimally invasive tools and more than digital technologies. These technologies are necessary, but not sufficient. We believe intelligent surgery takes the integration of three elements: first, a deep understanding of human interactions that inform holistic system design; second, the development of high-quality, smart and cloud-connected robotic imaging and instrument systems; and lastly, informatics and AI to deliver relevant validated insights. While we've made significant progress over our history, we believe continuous improvement is required, and we have deployed our investments toward these aims.","We design instruments and accessories to enable repeatable high-quality surgeries that are efficient and cost-effective relating to total cost to treat. Our team is in the process of launching several sophisticated products in pursuit of the same, and customers are now adopting them broadly.","Our 60-millimeter stapler is now in full launch and is used primarily in abdominal surgeries. Our second generation 45-millimeter stapler has recently received 510(k) clearance, incorporating several of the learnings from our 80-millimeter line. Surgeon response has been strong and adoption of our stapling line is encouraging. We also launched our third generation vessel sealer. It's adoption has likewise been strong.","Turning to the systems, we are in our first phase launch of da Vinci SP. We installed 6 systems in Q1, constrained in the quarter by manufacturing availability and bringing our clinical installed base of SP to 21. Roughly 800 procedures have been performed today. Recall, we have two cleared indications for SP: urologic and transoral surgery. Surgeon and patient feedback have been positive for usability and patient experience in these early days of launch. Going forward, we expect continued progress in strengthening our production performance to support SP launch at scale.","As we've described in the past, we are also pursuing additional clinical indications for SP and have engaged regulatory agencies regarding their requirements. The combination of additional indications for SP and production readiness at scale will pace the speed of SP commercial deployment.","In flexible diagnostics, our Ion platform is focused on the need for definitive early diagnosis of suspicious lesions for lung cancer. Ion received FDA clearance in the first quarter with 510(k) clearance, we have initiated our next phase focused on clinical use, customer feedback and production optimization. First cases on the cleared system were performed at the end of Q1, and we plan a measured rollout this year. We do not anticipate material revenues from Ion in 2019.","In our cloud computing and informatics efforts, we routinely deliver programmatic insights to customers using our systems, which have been smart and connected for the past decade. We received FDA clearance for our Auris augmented reality product in first quarter and anticipate first clinical use in 2019, focused on several high-volume da Vinci institutions that will lead clinical evaluation and analysis. We do not anticipate any revenue from Auris in 2019.","In closing, our business fundamentals are strong and for the balance of the year, our focus remains in completing the tasks we set for ourselves: first, supporting adoption of da Vinci in general surgery and in key procedures in global markets; second, launching our SP and ION platforms; third, driving intelligent surgery innovation; and finally, supporting additional clinical and economic validation in our focused procedures and countries.","I'll now turn the call over to Marshall who will review financial highlights.","Marshall Mohr","Good afternoon. I'll describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my remarks. Our reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Key business metrics for the first quarter were as follows: first quarter 2019 procedures increased approximately 18% compared with the first quarter 2018 and decreased approximately 1% compared with last quarter; procedure growth continues to be driven by general surgery in the U.S. and urology worldwide. Calvin will review details of procedure growth later in this call. First quarter system placements of 235 systems increased 27% compared with 185 systems last year and decreased from the 290 system placements in our seasonally stronger fourth quarter.","We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems by 13% to approximately 5,110 systems, which is consistent with the fourth quarter and slightly higher than the 12.6% increase last year. Utilization of current clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system grew in the mid-single-digits. Our revenue overview is as follows: first quarter 2019 revenue was $974 million, an increase of 15% compared with $848 million for the first quarter of 2018, and a decrease of 7% compared with the seasonally stronger fourth quarter revenue of $1.047 billion.","Instrument and accessory revenue of $552 million increased 20% compared with last year, which is higher than procedure growth, primarily reflecting increased use of our advanced instruments and customer buying patterns. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure was approximately $1,960, an increase of 2% compared with the first quarter of 2018 and an increase of 4% compared with last quarter. Systems revenue for the first quarter 2019 was $248 million, an increase of 6% compared with the first quarter of 2018 and a decrease of 27% compared with last quarter. The variation between 6% systems revenue growth and the 27% system placements growth reflects greater proportion of operating leases, a greater proportion of system trade-ins, a greater proportion of X systems, a higher mix of distributor placements and volume-based discounts provided to customers purchasing multiple systems.","We completed 78 operating lease transactions, representing 33% of total placements compared with 43 or 23% of total placements in the first quarter of 2018, and 84 or 29% of total placements last quarter. As of March 31, we have 423 operating leases outstanding and realized approximately $20 million of revenue related to these arrangements in the quarter compared with $10 million last year and $16 million last quarter. Operating leases create a future source of recurring revenue and reduce the volatility of system revenue. While the increased number of operating systems placed in the quarter dampens short-term revenue growth for the quarter in which they are placed.","Operating leases include usage-based financing that we provide to certain experienced hospitals. We believe that our leasing alternatives align with customer objectives and have enabled faster market adoption. Relative to systems purchased over the lease period, we earn a small premium, reflecting the time value of money and in the case of usage-based arrangements, the risk that those systems may not achieve anticipated usage levels. The proportion of these types of arrangements could increase long term and will be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. 36% of the current quarter system placements involved trade-ins, reflecting customer desire to access or standardize on our fourth-generation technology. This is an increase in the proportion of trade-ins compared to 31% in the first quarter of 2018 and 28% last quarter. Trade-in activity can be lumpy and difficult to predict.","67% of the systems placed in the quarter were da Vinci Xis. 25% were da Vinci X systems compared with 73% da Vinci Xis and 18% da Vinci Xs last quarter. Six of the systems placed were SP systems. Our rollout of the SP surgical system is measured, putting systems in the hands of experienced da Vinci users, while we optimize training pathways in our supply chain. As mentioned by Gary, SP production was constrained in the first quarter. Globally, our average selling price, which excludes the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts was approximately $1.31 million compared with $1.49 million last year and $1.46 million last quarter. The changes compared with prior periods primarily reflect a greater portion of trade-in transactions, volume-based incentives providing customers purchasing multiple systems, a greater proportion of x systems and higher proportion of distributor sales.","Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. OUS procedures grew approximately 21% compared with the first quarter of 2018 and increased 6% compared with last quarter. First quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $282 million increased 3% compared with the first quarter of 2018 and decreased 8% compared with last quarter. The 3% year-over-year revenue growth primarily reflects a greater proportion of X systems, a higher mix of distributor arrangements, and a greater proportion of operating leases. Outside the U.S., we placed 81 systems in the first quarter compared with 73 in the first quarter of 2018 and 115 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 49 into Europe, 13 into Japan, 8 into Brazil and 3 into China. 36 or 44% of the systems placed in the first quarter were X systems compared with 19% last year and 30% last quarter. 11 of the system placements were operating leases compared with one last year and 15 last quarter. Placements outside the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of the OUS markets are in early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns, and sales into some markets are constrained by government limitation.","Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the first quarter of 2019 was 71.2% compared with 71.6% for the first quarter of 2018 and 71.8% last quarter. The decrease compared with the first quarter of 2018 and last quarter primarily reflects lower system ASPs and a higher mix of advanced instruments, partially offset by improvements in manufacturing efficiency. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of systems and instrument and accessory revenue, system ASPs and our ability to further reduce product costs and improve manufacturing efficiency.","Pro forma operating expenses increased 27% compared with the first quarter of 2018 and decreased 2% compared with last quarter. Fourth quarter 2018 operating expenses included a $25 million contribution to the newly formed Intuitive Foundation. Excluding the contribution to the foundation, pro forma operating expenses increased 5% compared with last quarter. In order of magnitude of increase, first quarter expenses reflect costs associated with expansion of our OUS markets, spending on our informatics capabilities and investment in our infrastructure in order to scale the business.","Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 19.8% compared with our expectations of 19% to 20%. Our tax rates will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income and changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of one-time items.","Our first quarter 2019 pro forma net income was $312 million or $2.61 per share compared with $288 million or $2.44 per share for the first quarter of 2018 and $353 million or $2.96 per share for the fourth quarter 2018.","I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $307 million or $2.56 per share for the first quarter of 2019, compared with GAAP net income of $288 million or $2.44 per share for the first quarter of 2018, and GAAP net income of $293 million or $2.45 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website. It include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee equity and IP charges, and legal settlements.","We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $5.1 billion compared with $4.8 billion at December 31, 2018. The increase generally reflects cash generated from operations partially offset by investments in working capital and infrastructure.","In the quarter, we grew inventory by approximately $60 million to $468 million, representing approximately 140 days of inventory. We continue to build inventory to address the growth in the business as well as mitigate risks of disruption that could arise from trade, supplier or other matters. With the growth in the business and our focus on efficiency and scale, we expect capital expenditures will increase to over $250 million in 2019.","In January, our Board of Directors increased our stock buyback authorization to $2 billion. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter.","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Calvin who will go over procedure performance, and will update our outlook for 2019.","Calvin Darling","Thank you, Marshall. Our overall first quarter procedure growth was 18% compared to 15% during the first quarter of 2018 and 19% last quarter. Our Q1 procedure growth was driven by 17% growth in U.S. procedures and 21% growth in OUS markets. In the U.S., Q1 procedure results were generally consistent with recent trends. Q1 growth was again driven by growth in U.S. general surgery, thoracic and benign gynecology procedures. In general surgery, first quarter hernia repair and colorectal procedure growth remained strong, while growth in other general surgery procedures such as cholecystectomy, bariatric, and liver and pancreatic cases also contributed to growth.","First quarter U.S. gynecology continued to grow in the mid-single digits, driven by benign hysterectomy procedures. Our data continues to indicate an increasing proportion of overall gynecology procedures are being performed by gynecologic oncologist. In addition, our recently launched Vessel Sealer Extend instrument is increasingly being adopted by gynecologists. U.S. urology first quarter growth moderated a bit in Q1, driven by prostatectomy, which moved closer to the underlying incident rate for prostate cancer. As a mature procedure category, we believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market. In other U.S. procedures, adoption of lobectomies and other thoracic procedures was, again, solid in the first quarter.","First quarter OUS procedure volume grew approximately 21% compared with 18% for the first quarter 2018 and 24% last quarter. First quarter 2019 OUS procedure growth was driven by continued growth in dVP procedures and earlier stage growth in kidney cancer procedures, general surgery and gynecology. Two weeks ago, we attended the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons or SAGES conference in Baltimore. SAGES is one of the largest general surgery meetings each year, attended by many of the world's leading general surgeons. We were encouraged by the emerging consensus view regarding the value of robotic-assisted approaches in general surgery procedures.","Our booth was highly visited by surgeons interested in hands-on access to the full breadth of our generation four platform, including the da Vinci Xi, X and SP systems on the floor. And our advanced instrumentation, including the SureForm surgical stapler. The SAGES conference emphasizes clinical evidence, and I will share with you one of the e-posters presented at the event, analyzing real-world evidence. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years.","At this year's SAGES, Dr. Elizabeth Raskin from Loma Linda University, presented research titled: Reducing Variability and Outcomes, Conversion Rate Analysis of Minimally Invasive Sigmoidectomy. The study used the premier healthcare database, selecting data from institutions performing at least 100 laparoscopic-assisted or robotic-assisted sigmoidectomy cases between 2013 and 2015. Data for 8,821 patients from 75 hospitals were analyzed. The median conversion rate for minimally-invasive surgery to open surgery across the entire sample was 10.85%. The data was split between higher conversion rate hospitals above the median and lower conversion rate hospitals below the median. ","Among patients from the higher conversion rate hospitals, the conversion rate for lab procedures was 18.41% compared to 11.33% robotic assisted. Among patients from lower conversion rate hospitals, the conversion rate for lab-assisted cases was 7.33% compared to 2.89% for the robotic cases. After adjusting for variables, the lap patients in the higher conversion rate hospitals had 75% more risk of converting to open approach.","In the lower conversion group, laparoscopic approach was found to be 2.5x more likely to be converted to open compared to the robotic-assisted approach. While we are encouraged by the lower da Vinci conversion rates relative to laparoscopy, this study highlights that there is still significant remaining opportunity for surgeons to drive conversion rates meaningfully lower, which has the potential to improve outcomes and patient experience. Furthermore, as evidenced by the large gap between the higher and lower conversion rate hospitals, there remains significant opportunity to reduce the variability of outcomes across care teams.","I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2019, starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecast full year 2019 procedure growth within a range of 13% to 17%. We are now refining our estimate to the upper half of that range and estimate full year 2019 procedure growth of 15% to 17%.","With respect to revenue, as we have mentioned previously, in mature markets, capital sales are ultimately driven by procedure growth, catalyzing hospitals to establish or expand robotic system capacity. Capital sales revenue can vary substantially from period to period based upon many factors, including U.S. healthcare policy, hospital capital spending cycles, reimbursement and government quotas, product cycles, economic cycles and competitive factors. Indeed, the impact of leasing, trade-in and product mix are reflected in our systems revenue results for Q1. While these factors are aligned with our strategy and positive business levers, the revenue result was lower than historical norms relative to the number of systems placed.","Looking forward, we expect continued variation by quarter and we expect to continue to see meaningful proportions of capital placements involving trade-ins and\/or these structured as operating leases.","Turning to gross profit. We continue to expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71% of net revenue. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely upon product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions.","Turning to operating expenses. As Gary and Marshall outlined, we are expanding our investments in 2019. Given our results in the first quarter, we expect to grow pro forma 2019 operating expenses between 24% and 28% above 2018 levels compared to the 20% to 28% range forecast on our last call. We expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $320 million and $340 million in 2019 compared with $310 million to $340 million forecast on our last call.","We continue to expect other income, which was comprised mostly of interest income to total between $120 million and $130 million in 2019. With regard to income tax, we continue to estimate our 2019 pro forma income tax rate to be between 19% and 20% of pretax income.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Tycho Peterson at JPMorgan.","Tycho Peterson","Maybe I will start with bariatric. Obviously, a lot of excitement coming out of SAGES on the opportunity around bariatric. Gary, can you maybe just talk about the ramp and any infraction you're seeing between gastric bypass leads reviews? And if we think about the 180,000 niche procedures in the U.S., what do you think the adoption curve looks like over the next couple of years?","Gary Guthart","Well, thank you. For starters on bariatrics, we're excited about the long-term opportunity. And as you described, there's interest in all of the procedures' subcategories you've laid out. I'll, in a minute, turn it over to Calvin and speak a little bit about sizing. Where we are in terms of commercial focus, the commercial team is largely focused now on hernia and colorectal procedures. We see some early interest in bariatrics and we'll support that early interest, but we'll -- we'd like to make sure we satisfy the hernia markets and the colorectal markets we're in today, and then we'll pivot over time to support bariatrics more broadly. Calvin, you might speak to...","Calvin Darling","Yes. Tycho, you're right. I mean, the 180,000 is about right in aggregate, but there's a lot of different types of procedures within that category from sleeve gastrectomies, to the full bypasses, to the redo procedures you mentioned where I think there's and clear benefits to robotic approach for those complex surgeries. At this point in time, we've seen some very nice early-stage adoption. Obviously, based upon the patient benefits, but also, there's some pretty significant surgeon benefit as well from an ergonomic standpoint. So it's a nice foundation that's building and at this point, as Gary mentioned, we haven't focused the team entirely there.","Tycho Peterson","And then on China, Gary, you characterized the market as still being constrained. You only had kind of three systems this quarter. Can you talk about your latest thinking on the quota impact? And when you think things start to free up there a little bit?","Gary Guthart","Marshall, why don't you take us through that?","Marshall Mohr","Sure. So just to replay, the quota is 154 systems for robotic systems. That is a quota that is available to anybody that has approval to sell robotic systems. So if there were to be another company that came along that got approval through CFDA, they would also be able to share in that quota. The quota has been distributed to provinces. The provinces are responsible for identifying the specific hospitals. And then to the hospitals that have to launch a tendering process. All of that takes time and the tendering processes can take quite a bit of time. And in fact, if you replay back to when we got to 2015 -- or the 2013 quota, it took until near the end of 2015 when we saw majority of those systems get done. So what we had told you before was that you should plan on fewer systems early and more systems later. And in fact, the three systems that were done this quarter were not done within that quota. So we have not seen any systems from the quota yet.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then just last one on Ion. Now that you're out on the market, how do we think about the kind of data collection window here? And what time frame would we start to see some publications? Could we see some by the back half of the year? And then, can you maybe talk to your supply chain optimization efforts and where you are on that?","Gary Guthart","Sure. I think we'll be gathering two sets of data. Some are position preference and workflow data and the other is outcomes over time. I imagine you'll see various interim publications toward the end of the year. It will take some time to get the full set written and reviewed that may come after '19, but I think you'll see updates from key customers as we go through the year. In terms of manufacturing optimization, so far so good. A lot of this is really just starting to create the manufacturing process and lines to build things at a little bit bigger scale and incorporate learnings and update tolerances and other kinds of validation work. So far, so good. I think the team is doing a nice job there.","Operator","And next, we go to Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Robert Hopkins","Just two for me. First, Marshall, to start out, I just want to get your latest thinking on operating leases. Obviously, it's accelerated up to 33% replacements. I guess the way I'd ask the question is would you be surprised if that moved up to 50%? Or do you think we're kind of getting close to a top here with 1\/3 of the placements?","Marshall Mohr","Yes. We introduced leasing and other alternatives, financing alternatives, a few years ago. And we did that in the face of what we thought would be customer demand. And in fact, we think it's played out quite well. And that we have been able to allow customers to expand more quickly their install base. I think -- so it's really customer driven, the demand. And having said that, if it were my choice, I'd find that leases and the alternatives that we're providing customers are favorable to us and that it creates a recurring revenue stream, eliminate some of the volatility of system placement revenue. And I think, in the long term, it will enhance any type of upgrade cycle that might come along. So it's hard for me to predict exactly how far it will go, but again, if it were my choice, I'd like to see it go further.","Robert Hopkins","But it doesn't -- it seems like it's going to go higher from here. I mean, it clearly seems like there's no momentum in that, and I don't think it's that big of a deal. I'm just curious to hear your thoughts as to where we might be headed.","Marshall Mohr","Yes. I've given you my thoughts.","Gary Guthart","Well, it's hard to predict what the anchor point is. Likely, a little more from here.","Robert Hopkins","Okay. And then, one last question, Gary. You guys -- or for Marshall, you spent at the high end of the guidance this quarter. And it was particularly, the R&D spend I think, was up 38%, now annualizing at roughly $400 million. I was just wondering if you could just go into a little more detail on where that incremental spending is going? And I know we talked about the last quarter but any incremental details on where that big uptick in R&D spending is going would be helpful.","Gary Guthart","Yes. It's a fair question. So first, just total spending in context. The bigger component of the increase was actually expanding our field teams outside the U.S. So on a percentage basis, R&D grew. On an absolute basis, it was actually investments in commercial teams and field teams in Asia that drove the biggest side. With breaking down the R&D, to answer your question, in kind of priority order, computational capability and informatics, both in the product and back in the office is the largest uptick, followed by ION, followed by Advanced Instrument investments, followed by Imaging investments. Those are the ones that are responsible for growth down that pathway. And we think we're on a front foot there and making progress where we are and we're putting those investments out to support our future growth. That's the rough priority order.","Operator","And next, we have David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Just a couple of questions for me. And Marshall, I wanted to come back to this dynamic of systems mix more broadly. You gave a lot more detail on systems mix this quarter than we've heard in the last several quarters, Calvin highlighted this in guidance. So I think it's going to create this notion of something [indiscernible] cyclically, this is just a weird quarter or structurally, there is different dynamic we should be considering for 2019 and beyond. So can you just talk in more detail, you talked about trade-ins x distributors, volume based discounting. So it does seem like mix dynamics shifted more maturely this quarter than, perhaps, in the last 2 to 3 quarters. I wonder if you could just highlight what changed and what's driving some of those changes?","Marshall Mohr","Sure. So to be clear, there was a shift. You're right, that we've seen an increase in the trade-ins, the percentage of trade-ins. And as I said earlier, it was 36% compared to 28% a year ago. And what we're seeing is just customers wanting to avail themselves to the fourth-generation technology...","Gary Guthart","And standardize at multiple systems.","Marshall Mohr","And standardize portfolio. And then we've seen more multisystem deals, and some of that has to do with what Gary was just talking about, their desire to expand their base. And as they are doing that, they would rather deal with one set of I&A, one set of training protocol and so forth and so they standardize on the platform. So the two are somewhat intertwined. We also saw a greater proportion of X systems, and that's been kind of a volatile statistic, actually. If you go back in time since we introduced X, and it's jumped around a little bit. But indeed, we introduced X with the intention of being able to deliver a lower cost product to geographies where reimbursements are lower. And in fact, in Europe, we saw 45% of the systems sold were Xs, which is exactly the market we targeted for. So these are all things that we think are positive trends, and leasing as well as I spoke to earlier. But the confluence of them all this quarter did drive systems revenue to only grow 6% and also ASPs be a little lower.","If you were looking out into the future for the rest of this year, it's more likely, given the trend in trade-ins and the trend in the multisystem arrangements that will be closer to, let's say, the ASPs we saw this quarter than we saw for the whole of last year. If you go back to last year, we were pretty much around $1.45 million on a consistent basis last year. And so that's where I think we are and where we're going.","David Lewis","I don't want to put words in your mouth, Marshall, but it sounds like this trade-in dynamics has been going for 6 to 8 quarters. That's sort of been there. The x mix number can move around quarter-by-quarter. So it sounds like the only incremental new piece of information is some of these larger system orders. Is that a fair characterization of what's probably the incremental new piece of information?","Marshall Mohr","True. Yes.","David Lewis","Okay. Very helpful. Just two more for me, and I'll jump back in queue. One, Gary, you mentioned some SP manufacturing constraints here in the first quarter? Are those resolved? And sort of what's the pace to resolve them? And then, maybe for Calvin, just -- there's been a lot of -- your channel dynamics around women's health, more broadly women's health, general surgery breast in your gynecological FDA letters. Any impact on the impacting underlying base targeted on either those two letters or channel disruption? Those two questions.","Gary Guthart","Okay. On the SP side, the manufacturing constraint was a mechanical thing, having to do with frictions and rails and the way these things pull together. I think the team has got it. I think we'll meet our SP shipment client for the year. So I think they're knocking it down. It's just a timing issue there. With regard, I'll start on the broader one. With regard to FDA environment as it relates to medical devices and on women's health, clearly, they're signaling a more conservative approach and are speaking about it broadly across the industry. With regard to Intuitive, that may change some future data requirements and it may introduce some uncertainty and timelines for indications of kind of the things we're interested in over time. With regard to what it looks like in the installed base and things like cyclical perplexity, Calvin, I'll turn that back to you.","Calvin Darling","Yes. And as it relates to the -- there actually -- the FDA action relates to the use of mesh intended for transvaginal or pelvic organ prolapse. There are actually various methods of medical management for pelvic organ prolapse including observation, history management and surgery. da Vinci sacrocolpopexy is a minimally invasive method of abdominal surgery, so not transvaginal. And so since our procedure is abdominal, we don't think that this action is going to negatively impact our sacrocolpopexy volumes. Last year, we did something like 15,000 to 20,000 cases in that category, and we were about 40% of the market.","Operator","And our next question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen","One for Gary, one for Marshall. I'll start with the one for Gary. Intuitive has launched a new system every, call it, 6 to 7 years. Do you expect to maintain that cadence? I think it's been about five years since you launched Xi. And what can you tell us about how you're thinking about enhancing Xi? And should we expect a low cost system, perhaps for the ASE setting? And I have one follow-up.","Gary Guthart","With regard to innovation cadence, we continue to be committed to innovation. On exact cadences, we won't predict timelines because it's uncertain based on what kind of technologies we're developing and based on the regulatory environment. But you can be assured that we are committed to bringing the market, things that help our customers solve their problems. With regard to the specific question of economics and price points, you can see our history -- historically, X and Xi, and what we've done there, but just frankly, we routinely assess and balance customer needs, the features that they're interested in to achieve their aims and the price points, and we explore and invent broadly. We don't dispose what our specific plans are or timing for competitive reasons.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Understood. And Marshall, based on your guidance for procedure growth and OpEx growth in 2019, you're operating margin will likely decline. So how do you want investors to think about your operating margin beyond 2019, especially in 2020, when we could start to see new competition?","Marshall Mohr","Sure. We haven't provided guidance beyond this year. And I think what we said at the beginning of this year was you would see a decline in our operating margins, given the level of increased spending that we were going to embark on. Calvin gave you the guidance for increased operating spending. As you know, it did not change from our previous guidance. So I think that's all I really have to say about that.","Gary Guthart","Yes. I'd add something. I think as we look out, the opportunity for improvement in acute interventions in surgery with the kinds of things we do, robotics, informatics, imaging, advanced imaging, we think it's substantial. And as a result, we take a long-term view. We think these are multiyear developments, multiyear investments, but ultimately, the size of that opportunity is quite large. And as a result, we try not to tune it perfectly quarter by quarter or year by year, but really, look over the very long term.","Operator","Next, we will go to Amit Hazan with Citigroup.","Amit Hazan","Let me start with procedures for the quarter. Just big picture, it looked to us like a state of comp-adjusted slowdown in growth in the U.S. and OUS. And I'm just wondering, I want to make sure we're not missing anything, but is there anything to call out that was off trend? I heard you say prostate, we got that one, but if there's any other headwinds that you saw in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, that would have kind of driven a slight slowdown. Is there anything there at all?","Gary Guthart","No. I think the comment is pretty much reflective that we were on trend in most of the major growth drivers in general surgery and continuation of what we've seen before. And you can look at the Q1 comp, but then another thing to look at is workplace. So we had one fewer operating day in the first quarter, just due to timing of weekends is partially offset by Easter. So I think you overcame that a little bit too. So I don't think there's anything more to add to that.","Amit Hazan","Okay. Good. And then, secondly, I want to ask about the da Vinci Sis. So we spent some time with a few of your customers this quarter. And they basically told us that you guys are -- sent them a letter that you're sunsetting the da Vinci Si, and its instruments by 2024. And so I just want to see if we could, first of all, get a confirmation of that. And also, some context for how many Sis are still out there and how you'd expect it to play out in terms of the replacement cycle?","Gary Guthart","Yes. I'll let Calvin speak to the number of Sis that are out there. Indeed, we did put a letter out. The letter really talked about discontinuation of stapling in certain energy instruments, specifically. And that those would be coming to an end in 2020. We also indicated that we would discontinue annual service pricing in 2025. The -- having said that, we're committed to supporting Si. We'll continue to deliver instruments and accessories even beyond the end date of 2024. And we will even provide services beyond 2024, just not in the form of annual service, but rather, in the form of time and materials.","Calvin Darling","Yes. In terms of the installed base, we just turned the -- crossed the line here this quarter. The slight majority are now da Vinci Xi systems. But still, nearly half are Si and previous models. And we talked a lot about trade-in cycle and the impact in a number of trade-ins so there's still a significant number of Si and previous out there.","Operator","Next, we have JP McKim with Piper Jaffray.","Jonathan McKim","I wanted to ask one on SP. I think you said there was around 800 procedures performed in that platform to date. Maybe if you could just talk about whether those were procedures that would've been done robotically previously? Or if it is expanding the market a little bit? And then maybe your thought on other indications this year, and some rough timing around when those could happen.","Gary Guthart","Thanks for the question. The bulk of the procedures so far were in urology would likely have been done robotically anyway. Indication -- the additional indication we got in transoral robotic surgery was relatively recent. That will grow in time. That will likely be a small expansion relative to what's being done robotically. The next likely procedure for us to pursue is a colorectal indication. That will not occur in 2019. We will do a lot of the work, but I do not participate an additional clearance in '19 for colorectal, but it's likely next on deck that we expect to be more expansive than substituting.","Jonathan McKim","That's helpful. And there's clearly a push to get everything under the fourth generation, just in terms of the program you talked about earlier. But maybe, if you could talk about strategically, how important that is for you as a company either just to standardize manufacturing more? Or ahead of competition to get more and more customers standardized on this fourth-generation platform.","Gary Guthart","Our primary motivation is that the fourth gen is well optimized to the kinds of things our customers do. So our first motivation is we think it's beneficial for them, particularly things like advanced instruments and stapling and so on. We're at more mature products and those kind of advanced instruments. And in that sense, you see the trading numbers go up and some of the ASP conversations, we think we want to be aligned with our customers to both standardize and get the right access to the right technologies and the right place. We think that helps them. We think that helps us, and if we're helping both sides, we think that's good for our competitive position over time.","Operator","We go now to Larry Keusch with Raymond James.","Lawrence Keusch","Gary, just one relative to hernia. You obviously indicated that you still have the sales organization very much focused in the general surgical area on hernia and colorectal, and you're not ready yet to quite get going on bariatric yet with meaningful field support. So just on hernia itself since that remains a focal point, can you help us think a little bit sort of what inning we're in at this point as you look U.S.? And I guess the follow-on question is, what will it take to really start to drive general surgical procedures in Europe? Because again, still being dominated by urology.","Gary Guthart","Yes. I think in the hernia markets, I think we're in the end of the early innings is kind of where I'd put it. I think starting to enter more mainstream use. How far it goes, depends a little bit on clinical condition. As you know, not every hernia is the same, not every patient is the same in terms of comorbidities. So assessing total size of the market and applicability is always a bit of an estimate. But I don't think we're half-way done yet, and that's why we have our sales force focused the way it is. ","Second half of the question, I'm sorry? Europe and urology. So on European side, we're starting to see some early interest in general surgery and visceral surgery. Certainly, on the more complex procedure side, we see interest in procedures that are done where the underlying causes cancer also has interest. There maybe an opportunity in benign general surgery as well. The economics maybe slightly different and that may require a slightly different adjustment from the company that made sure we satisfy that market. Early on, we have work to do to finish urology. We're not done yet. And then, we're looking at the next indications in the more complex side as the next step.","Lawrence Keusch","Okay. Perfect. And then, one quick one for Marshall, just on the operating leases. I know it's still early in the experience in terms of ramping those up. They did ramp relatively consistently through to last year, I guess, the 2Q was down a little bit, but should we think about any seasonality just in the operating lease percentages given what you know today?","Marshall Mohr","No. I don't think we've seen enough of a pattern to know whether there's any kind of seasonality to it. I suppose that there's the possibility that there's some seasonality associated with hospital budgeting cycles and so forth. But again, we haven't seen any particular patterns we'd point out at this point.","Operator","And next in queue, we have Richard Newitter at SVB Leerink.","Richard Newitter","I have two. First one for you, Gary. Just on -- I appreciate that maybe you're not as focused with the commercial focus to move into bariatrics with hernia and colorectal priorities now. But with the introduction of the 60-millimeter stapler, have you noticed any kind of inflection in the demand curve, at least, with respect to interest in bariatrics? And are we nearing that point where you would start to allocate the resources there? And then I have a follow-up.","Gary Guthart","Remember, in terms of sequencing to activate a market, there is optimizing the product set to get them there, there's helping build the partnering networks and the capacity for training and team training. So there's some pre-work, and then there's the building of the sales force competencies and support, customer base. So we're engaged in the pre-work. First, from the products and now into building the pathways and engaging those who will lead. So we're excited about it. I think there's real interest and there's real long-term opportunity and it's really just a question of timing. In terms of results, I wouldn't call anything out. One way or another, showing strength or weakness. I think we're really in a building capacity phase before we expect more out of the commercial team.","Richard Newitter","Okay. And just as we think about a higher proportion of systems getting placed under these flexible financing arrangements, minimum volume committed -- commit arrangements, I'm just curious, a straight operating lease model, one would've thought, hey, some of these systems maybe are more susceptible or the customers are more susceptible to a trialing phenomenon as competitors come into the market. But the more I hear you talk about these and the multisystem sales in these volume commitments, I'm wondering, does that just raise the switching costs as we think of a higher percentage of systems getting placed in there?","Gary Guthart","Well, first of all, when you say volume commitments, they are not volume commitments. They are targets that we establish, but we don't have a volume commitment per se. Second, I think there are costs to switch, of course, that go beyond the system itself, training surgeons and staff as well as protocols on how you set up the -- how you set up the OR, how you manage the product and how use the product and so I think those are barriers as well. As far switching costs associated with the system itself, you do run a risk with the some of the variations we're putting out there in financing that it may be easier for our customer to switch out. But we think that broadening the base now and getting the commitment of the surgeons and getting them trained so that we increase the barrier on that front is a better route to go.","Operator","And next, we have Craig Bijou with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Craig Bijou","I wanted to ask on Japan. I appreciate the comment that procedural growth was still strong. But I wanted to see, is it -- are you still seeing some of the growth that you saw in the last couple of quarters? Just -- how should we think about where exactly or I guess, how strong that growth is with the new procedures?","Calvin Darling","Yes. We're full year now, right? We got clearance for those 12 new procedures April 1, 2018. And even after full year, it's still fairly early. And so we're focused on things like we were talking about, the training support, proctoring network, building a solid foundation of surgeons, the OR teams and really emphasizing the clinical outcomes. We talked about, back in Q3 of '18, procedure growth moving above the 40% line in Japan, that continued in Q4. And in fact, here in Q1 of 2019, it kind of held onto that kind of rate of growth.","Craig Bijou","And maybe just a follow-up on Japan, I know you added 13 systems in the quarter, but maybe just help us get a sense for what the demand -- or I guess, system demand is. I know that -- I believe that utilization of the Japan systems was one of your lower geographic regions. So just maybe a little color there.","Gary Guthart","Yes. I think what we've said before and we're still on that same page is that, the systems are utilized poorly at this point and there is the opportunity to increase the number of procedures that can be done on them. However, the 12 procedures that were improved last year are not necessarily all done at the same hospitals so you've seen us sell systems because there are hospitals that do those procedures that were not doing prostatectomies or nephrectomies and now want to do robotic surgery. So it's hard for us to gauge exactly how much more -- how many more systems we can sell given the opportunity in front of us. The number of procedures being performed that had previously been approved, which was prostatectomy and nephrectomy was around 25,000 to 30,000 and these additional 12 procedures was 200,000, although they were highly laparoscopically penetrated, and so it's also difficult to know how many of those will actually adopt or switch.","Operator","Our final question will come from Imron Zafar with Deutsche Bank.","Imron Zafar","First, on U.S. general surgery, I'm curious if you could give us some insight on how much of the growth you're seeing is coming from higher penetration within your existing users versus new general surgeons embracing robotics?","Calvin Darling","Yes. You just look at what we're selling. The large majority of capital is -- are going into existing customers. They were expanding their programs and we're working with them as thoughtfully as we can with analytics and insights and expanding programs to build them out in the hospitals. So a large part of the remaining opportunity and procedures that are currently adopting are in the hospitals or hospital networks that we have established relationships. Yes. We still have some greenfield opportunities to be sure, but in terms of proportion, it's heavy on existing.","Gary Guthart","Question may have been asked from the point of surgeon themselves. More from a surgeon or newly trained surgeons and it's clearly a balanced mix of both.","Imron Zafar","Okay. And then, can you just talk about the long-term opportunity for a mastectomy? I know you have a clinical study ongoing -- or is getting underway. And is it fair to assume that that's more of an SP opportunity rather than the multiport?","Gary Guthart","Not ready to characterize anything yet. We know that there are some folks who are interested in it who are starting to work through what studies might look like, but we are not yet prepared to talk about what the long-term looks like there.","Imron Zafar","Okay. And then one just -- one last quick one for Marshall. There's been a pretty sizable increase in your headcount since the third quarter. I think it's up like 800 something. I assume some of that is just headcount accretion from some of your distributor acquisitions late last year, but can you just talk about what geographies those hires are targeting?","Marshall Mohr","The two greatest increases, one is what you characterize, which is that we took on distributor headcounts. So specifically, over the last year, we've added over 300 heads associated with our growth in Asia-Pacific. And the second area is really manufacturing headcount, and we bring manufacturing headcount in to -- on a temporary basis at first, and then we hire them in boluses. And in fact, we hired a bolus of them in the last six months.","Gary Guthart","Well, thank you. That was our last question. In closing, we believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim: better, more predicable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for care teams, and ultimately, a lower total cost of care.","We believe that accomplishing the same takes the integration of three elements: first, a deep understanding of human interactions across the continuum of care; second, smart and connected systems imaging and instruments that augment care teams; and third, the ability to measure impact through analytical insights and translation of these insights into action that drives positive change.","We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months.","Operator","That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation, and for using AT&T TeleConference. You may now disconnect."],"12674":["Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I\u2019ll now turn the conference over to Senior Director of Finance, Investor Relations, Calvin Darling. Please go ahead, sir.","Calvin Darling","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive Surgical\u2019s second quarter earnings conference call. With me today we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Patrick Clingan, Vice President of Finance and Sales Operations.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today\u2019s call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 6, 2017 and 10-Q filed on April 19, 2017. These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC\u2019s EDGAR database. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.","Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today\u2019s press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website.","Today\u2019s format will consist of providing you with highlights of our second quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter\u2019s business and operational highlights; Marshall will provide a review of our second quarter financial results; Patrick will discuss procedure and clinical highlights; then I will provide our updated financial outlook for 2017; and finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Gary.","Gary Guthart","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on the call today. As you know, Intuitive is focused on significantly improving surgery and enabling access to our products and services in pursuit of this mission globally.","The momentum built over the past several quarters continued into the second quarter of 2017 with solid performance in procedures and strong growth in system placements.","Growth in procedures for the quarter was 16% over the second quarter of 2016. Overall trends in the first quarter remained stable into the second. Starting with United States, both the emerging category of general surgery and more mature categories in urology and gynecology performed well.","Hernia repair continues to stand out in the general surgery category with additional contributions coming from colon procedures. As we mentioned last quarter, European performance in Q1 of 2017 benefited from calendar tailwinds that we expected to balance out in the second quarter.","Indeed, this occurred with core growth staying roughly steady through the first half of 2017 and European second quarter growth moderating. Procedure performance in Asia was solid, with growth in China being a highlight from a constrained installed base. Patrick will take you through these factors in more detail later in the call.","Our capital placement performance in Q2 of 2017 strengthened with the growth in total placements from 130 in Q2 of 2016 to 166 this quarter. As we mentioned on these calls, capital placements can be lumpy as evidenced by our performance in the first half of the year.","In the United States, placements rebounded from a softer Q1 to a strong Q2, anchored in repeat purchases by existing customers and multi system placements.","System placements in Europe grew moderately, aided in part by the launch of da Vinci X. In Asia, the placements grew slightly over the prior year period and over last quarter, constrained for the time being by the lack of a new system quota in China and limited reimbursements in Japan. Marshall and Patrick will take you through system placement dynamics in greater detail.","Turning to profitability for the quarter, strong system placements led to gross margins that are lower than last quarter. These margins are at the top of our expected range because of the strength in procedures and improvements in our operating efficiencies.","Our fixed cost growth met our expectations with increases in R&D expenses, growth in staff in European and Asian markets, investment in clinical trials and growth in our corporate computational capabilities.","Our second quarter pro forma operating results were as follows, procedures grew approximately 16% over the second quarter of last year. We shipped 166 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 130 in the second quarter of 2016. Revenue for the quarter was $756 million, up 13% from the prior year, instrument and accessory revenue increased to $398 million, up 17%.","Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $540 million, representing 71% of total revenue. Pro forma gross profit margin was 71.3%, compared to 71.9% in the second quarter last year, we generated a pro forma operating profit of $313 million in the quarter, up 5% from the second quarter of last year, and pro forma net income was $228 million, up 4% from Q2 of 2016. Marshall will take you through our finances in greater detail shortly.","Turning to our product pipeline. As you know, in the back half of 2016 and the first half of 2017, we increased our mid term and long-term investments in creating our next generation of products and services. We anchored on our belief that substantial opportunity exists to enable a more minimally invasive surgery, better outcomes and to expand access to our technologies globally.","Starting with our multi-port portfolio. We developed a system pathway that responds to our customer\u2019s desire for choice in clinical capability and choice in total economics. In the quarter, we've received our CE Mark and 510(k) clearance for da Vinci X, a system that brings core Xi technology into a highly capable, lower entry price surgical system.","We're pleased with the early reception of X by our customers and the choice it brings to those around the world who seek to build robotic surgery programs with logical upgrade pathways and affordable access to our leading robot assisted surgery ecosystem.","Our SP program continues progress in its human clinical trial work and pilot production capability. We now have four clinical trial sites active, three in the United States and one in Asia. Cases in Asia have included transoral, urologic and colorectal surgery, while those in the US are focused on transoral robotic-assisted surgery.","As we mentioned in our last - in our call last quarter, we anticipate filing our 510(k) for SP in urology in the back half of 2017. Surgeon feedback from our trial sites is very encouraging. Our teams continue to work on product validations and manufacturing capability to support submission and launch.","Lastly, our flexible robotics program is meeting our expectations and making good progress in its product design phases and definition of regulatory pathways.","In closing, the second quarter of 2017 has carried forward momentum built in prior quarters and we remain focused on the following for the balance of the year. First, continued adoption of da Vinci in general surgery.","Second, continued development of European markets and access to customers in Asia; third, advancing our new platforms, imaging, advanced instruments, da Vinci SP and flexible robotics progress. And finally, support for additional clinical and economic validation by region.","I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will review financial highlights.","Marshall Mohr","Thank you, Gary. I will describe our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes specified legal settlements and claim accruals, excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards and charges associated with stock based compensation and purchase IP.","We provide pro forma information because we believe the business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I would also summarize our GAAP results later in my script.","We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there is no confusion. Second quarter 2017 revenue was $756 million, an increase of 13% compared with $670 million for the second quarter of 2016 and an increase of 12% compared with the first quarter revenue of $674 million.","We launched the da Vinci X system during the second quarter in the US and European countries covered by CE Mark. In conjunction with the launch, we offered certain customers who purchased systems in the first quarter, the opportunity to upgrade or trade out their systems for the X system.","As a result, we deferred 2$3 million of first quarter revenue, which we recognize when customers either trade out their systems or when the offers expire, whichever comes first.","None of the deferred revenue was recognized in the second quarter. We expect substantially all of the deferred revenue to be recognized by year end.","Second quarter 2017 procedures increased approximately 16% compared with the second quarter of 2016. It increased 5% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth relative to last year and the first quarter has been driven by general surgery in the US and urology worldwide. Patrick will provide more detail concerning procedure adoptions.","Revenue highlights are as follows, instrument and accessory revenue of $398 million increased 17% compared with last year and increased 4% compared with the first quarter of 2017, which closely reflects procedure growth. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure was approximately $1,830 per procedure compared with $1,810 last year and $1,840 last quarter.","The increase relative to the second quarter of 2016 primarily reflects increased sales of our stapling and vessel sealing products, partially offset by customer buying patterns. The decrease compared with the previous quarter primarily reflects customer buying patterns.","System revenue of $216 million increased 7% compared with the second quarter of 2016 and increased 41% compared with last quarter. The year-over-year increase reflects higher system placements and operating lease revenue, partially offset by lower average selling prices and lower lease buyout revenue.","System revenue for the first quarter of 2017 excluded the $23 million of deferred revenue. Had the first quarter included net revenue, quarter-over-quarter increase would have been 23%, reflecting a higher number of system placements, partially offset by lower lease buyout revenue.","166 systems were placed in the second quarter of 2017, compared with 130 systems in the second quarter of 2016 and 133 systems last quarter. 27 systems were placed under operating lease transactions in the current quarter, compared with 15 systems in the second quarter of 2016 and 21 last quarter. As a reminder, revenue on operating lease transactions is recognized ratably over the life of the lease.","Of the 166 second quarter systems, 11 were X systems. As of the end of the second quarter of 2017, there were 120 systems out in the field under operating leases. We generated approximately $6 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter, compared with 4 million in the second quarter of 2016 and approximately $5 million last quarter.","We generated approximately $5 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with $13 million in the second quarter of 2016 and $10 million last quarter.","Globally, our average selling price, which excludes the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts and revenue deferrals, was $1.46 million compared with $1.56 million last year and $1.46 million last quarter.","The decrease in ASP compared to the second quarter of 2016 primarily reflects lower priced system sold to cost sensitive market segments and lower pricing offered to customers purchasing multiple systems.","We believe the flexible financing programs, like operating leases have positively impacted our ability to grow our installed base. We expect a proportion of these types of arrangements would increase over time.","Service revenue of $142 million increased 11% year-over-year. It increased approximately 1% compared with the first quarter of 2017. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect growth in our installed base with da Vinci systems.","Outside of the US, results were as follows. Second quarter revenue outside of the US up $205 million increased 11% compared with $185 million for the second quarter of 2016. It increased 12% compared with $183 million for the first quarter.","The increase relative to the prior year primarily reflects increased system placements net of leases and increased instruments and accessories, reflecting procedure growth, partially offset by lower system ASPs. Patrick will provide procedure growth information.","The year-over-year decline in system ASPs reflects increased sales of lower cost systems to cost-sensitive markets. The increase in revenue relative to the last quarter reflects increased system placements and increased instrument and accessory growth.","Outside of the US, we placed 63 systems in the second quarter, compared with 51 in the second quarter of 2016 and 56 last quarter. 5 of the system placements in the current quarter were operating leases compared with two last quarter - last year and 6 last quarter.","Current quarter system placements, including 29 into Europe, 14 into Japan, 5 into India, 5 into Australia and 3 into China. System placements outside of the US will continue to be lumpy as some of the O-US markets are in early stages of adoption, some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations.","Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. The pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of 2017 was 71% compared with 72% for the second quarter of 2016 and 72% for the first quarter of 2017.","The decrease compared with the second quarter of 2016 primarily reflects decreased service margin associated with higher scope repair costs. The decrease compared with the first quarter reflects a higher proportion of system revenue relative to total revenue.","Since we deferred costs associated with the $23 million revenue deferral, the trade out program had little impact on our margin. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of systems and instrument and accessory revenue, our ability to further reduce product costs and improve manufacturing efficiency and in the long term, the potential reinstatement of the medical device tax.","Pro forma operating expenses increased 23% compared with the second quarter of 2016. It increased 2% compared with last quarter. The increases are consistent with our planned investments in product development, specifically da Vinci Sp, flexible robotics, imaging and advanced instrumentation and the expansion of our O-US markets. The year-over-year growth rates will subside over the remainder of the year with total year growth still expected to be around 18%.","Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 29.2%, compared with an effective tax rate of 27.8% for the second quarter of 2016 and 28.1% last quarter. The increase in our tax rate reflects an increased proportion of US income relative to total income. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of US and O-US income and with the impact of one-time item.","Our second quarter 2017 pro forma net income was $228 million or $5.95 per share, compared with $220 million or $5.62 per share for the second quarter of 2016 and $196 million or $5.09 per share for the first quarter of 2017.","The $23 million revenue deferral, including the associated deferral of cost of sales and the income tax effects, reduced GAAP and pro forma net income per share in the first quarter of 2017 by approximately $0.28 per share.","Earnings per share benefited from the full impact of our $2 billion stock buyback as we retired approximately 2.4 million shares on January 27, 2017. At this point, given the increase in the share price since the start of the ASR, the ultimate number of shares delivered under the ASR may not change materially from the initial delivery. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends.","I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $222 million or $5.77 per share for the second quarter of 2017, compared with $185 million or $4.71 per share for the second quarter of 2016 and $180 million or $4.67 per share for the first quarter of 2017.","GAAP net income for the second quarter included a net benefit of $5 million associated with litigation settlements, net of charges, compared with $4 million of charges in the second quarter of 2016 and $21 million of charges last quarter.","GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2017 also included a charge of approximately $6 million associated with purchased IP. Beginning in 2017, we are required under GAAP to report the excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with employee stock awards in our tax provision, rather than as an adjustment to be paid in capital as in prior periods.","The excess tax benefit included in our GAAP results for the second quarter was $31 million, contributing $0.80 per share compared with $33 million, contributing $0.85 per share in the first quarter of 2017. We have excluded these benefits from our pro forma results.","This amount will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on the volume of employee stock option exercises and the number of RSUs vesting and the value of our stock.","We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $3.4 billion, up from $3.1 billion as of March 31st, 2017. The increase reflects cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises.","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who'll go over our procedure and clinical highlights.","Patrick Clingan","Thanks, Marshall. Of our second quarter procedure growth of 16%, US procedures grew approximately 14%, and outside of the United States, procedures grew approximately 22%.","Procedure trends were consistent with the first quarter with growth led by US general surgery and global urology. In the United States, both mature and growth procedures, such as general and thoracic surgery, outperformed our plan. The majority of the out performance was driven by continued growth in our mature procedures.","In US urology, the second quarter growth rate for da Vinci Prostatectomy was modestly higher than the first quarter. We believe that our US prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market.","In US gynecology, second quarter procedure growth sustained trends observed during the first quarter. Procedure growth in US GYN appears to be driven by consolidation of surgeries towards physicians that specialize in complex and cancer surgery who tend to be users of the da Vinci system.","First quarter US general and thoracic surgery procedure adoption remains strong, led by solid growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures. Hernia repair continues to contribute the largest volume of new procedures in the United States, and existing surgeon retention and utilization remains strong sound.","Growth trends in lobectomy and other thoracic procedures continued to show strength off of a small base. Second quarter was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications evaluating da Vinci surgery.","One that we like to highlight is from Dr. Rashidi from the University of Texas and colleagues from Providence Health and Services who published a study of more than 3500 colorectal patients treated by 58 high volume surgeons within the Providence Health and Services network in the American Journal of Surgery.","The authors found that in exchange for a longer operating time, patients treated on the da Vinci system experienced a threefold reduction in conversion rate and nearly a day shorter length of hospital stay compared to laparoscopy. In addition, the authors found that there was no difference in total direct cost between the two cohorts.","Turning abroad, procedure growth outside of the United States was approximately 22% in the second quarter, led by the global adoption of da Vinci Prostatectomy, with solid contributions from kidney procedures, general surgery and gynecology.","As we discussed last quarter, the timing of the Easter holidays from Q1 into Q2, which provided a tailwind to our first quarter results, served as a headwind in the quarter, likely reducing our outside of the United States procedure growth by an estimated 3%. Taken together, first half procedure growth of 25% provides a better representation of procedure performance outside of the United States and either quarters result.","Procedure growth was led by China, Germany and Japan. Procedure growth in China was driven by strong expansion and system utilization, as system placements remained the same, pending issuance of new quota for civilian hospitals. Procedure growth in China is broad based with a number of specialties contributing to the strong performance.","In Germany, procedure growth is supported by installed base expansion that is driving strong adoption in urology with contributions from general surgery. In Japan, dVP and DVPN continued to grow, though year-to-year comparisons have begun to slow as dVP adoption has crossed 80%.","During the quarter, the first clinical experience on da Vinci X occurred in Germany. Initial procedures included urology and gynecology with strong utilization. Commenting on the experience, Dr. Vitt, from San Antonio's Hospital Genoa [ph] stated, da Vinci X is 'ideal' add on to our existing da Vinci Xi same feeling on the console.'","Globally, evidence continues to build in support of the clinical and economic validation of da Vinci surgery. During the quarter, an economic analysis studying the impact of da Vinci partial nephrectomy in England was published in European urology.","The work was completed by HCD Economics, an affiliate of the University of Chester. Comparing more than 4200 partial nephrectomy patients between open and da Vinci surgery, the authors found that da Vinci surgery lowered the total cost to treat during the first year after the procedure by an average of \u00a3900, primarily by reducing postoperative and patient utilization from length of stay, cancer and other readmissions and 90 day complications.","This concludes my remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Calvin. ","Calvin Darling","Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2017. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full year 2017 procedure growth of 12% to 14% above the approximately 752,000 procedures performed in 2016.","Now, based largely upon continued strong results in US growth and mature procedure categories in China, we are increasing our estimate for 2017. We now anticipate full year 2017 procedure growth within a range of 14% to 15%.","During the second half of the year, we expect our procedure growth rate to moderate, in part, due to one fewer operating day during the third quarter. As we move into the second half of the year, we also expect contributions from China and Japan to temper until we obtain a new quota and place additional systems in China and obtain additional procedural reimbursements in Japan.","With regards to system placements, a record high of 27 of the 166 second quarter system placements were structured as operating leases. In the second half of 2017, we expect the proportion of systems placed under operating leases will continue to increase.","The average selling price per system sold outright will vary quarter-to-quarter based upon factors, including product, regional and trading mix. With increasing placements into cost-sensitive markets, we expect that our average system selling price will continue to trend gradually lower in the back half of 2017.","As Marshall mentioned, no amounts were either deferred or released in Q2 related to our da Vinci X trade-in program. Going forward, we expect to defer no further revenue related to this program and expect to release and recognize substantially all of the $23 million accrued during the first quarter by the end of this year.","Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast 2017 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71% of net revenue. We are now modestly raising the top end of the range and expect pro forma gross profit margin to be between 70% and 71.5% of net revenue.","Turning to operating expenses. As we have described previously, we have accelerated our investments in several strategic areas that will benefit the company over the long-term. Accordingly, we have ramped our operating expenses as we focus on execution.","On our last call, we forecast pro forma 2017 operating expenses to grow at the higher end of a range between 15% and 18% above 2016 levels. We continue to expect results at the high end of the range between 17% and 18% for the year.","On our last call, we forecast our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $190 million and $200 million in 2017. Now based upon updated Black Scholes evaluation estimates, we expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $200 million and $210 million. We expect 2017 other income to be between $35 million and $40 million, compared to the $30 million to $35 million range forecast on our last call.","With regard to income tax, we now expect our 2017 pro forma income tax rate to be between 28% and 29.5% of pre-tax income, higher than our previous guidance of 26.5% to 28.5% based upon a higher anticipated mix of US pre-tax profits.","During Q2, we had 38.4 million diluted shares outstanding for EPS calculations, roughly equal to the first quarter as the share reduction related to the full quarter impact of the Q1 accelerated share buyback was mostly offset by the dilutive effects of our higher stock price.","As a result of our higher stock price, we don't expect the ultimate number of shares received and retired when the ASR closes later this year to vary significantly versus the 2.4 million shares already retired in January.","That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Go ahead please.","Tycho Peterson","Hey, thanks. First on X, I know its early days, obviously, but any color you can provide on the funnel in terms of diversity of existing customers and maybe the types of customers that are emerging?","Gary Guthart","I don't think we'd call out anything surprising here. We had indicated to you in prior quarters that we think cost sensitive customers, particularly in Europe are going to be interested and that remains so. It may have broader rebate than that over time.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then urology continue to do well here. That hasn't reverted to lower growth rates, you know, I think you\u2019d previously expected, can you talk about that sequential pick up? Can you maybe just talk to the sustainability of those trends in the US urology dVP market?","Marshall Mohr","Hey, Tycho, I think we continue to believe that our prostatectomy volumes are following broader prostate surgery trends. As you know, prostate surgery really only represents about third of all men diagnosed in the US with prostate cancer.","So time to time you\u2019ll see movements between watchful waiting, radiation and surgery. We think \u2013 mostly you've seen the procedures recover from the prior USPSTF decision in 2012, where we worked through patients who had the disease progress. We think at this stage you're just seeing general small movements between populations period-to-period.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. I\u2019ll leave at that. Thanks.","Gary Guthart","Thanks, Tycho.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Go ahead please.","Bob Hopkins","Hi. Thanks, good afternoon. Can you hear me okay?","Gary Guthart","Hi, Bob. Yes.","Bob Hopkins","Great. Good afternoon. So, the first thing I wanted to touch on, just kind of looking through the results, which were obviously strong and pretty much across the board. But the US capital number really stuck out as a strong number. And you mentioned more kind of multi-system sales and repeat customers. Is this really a function of the increase in procedure volume growth and higher utilization or was there something else going on this quarter?","Gary Guthart","I think it's the former. We're seeing \u2013 first of all, I think the consolidation of US customers into IDNs means that the negotiations are often happening when they are up. And I think they're looking across their portfolio of MIS opportunities and making decisions in broader settings. I think it's a continuation of a trend we've been seeing over the past several quarters.","Bob Hopkins","Great. And the other thing I just want to follow up is a couple of quick checks on the pipeline timelines. You mentioned China and Japan as constraining you in the back half. Is there any update at all on the China quota from a timing perspective or even your sense as to whether or not it could happen this year?","And also wanted to just get a quick update for timelines for SP beyond urology and the filings we could expect, either later this year or into 2018? Thank you.","Gary Guthart","Sure. I\u2019ll \u2013 Marshall, I'll let you take the China quota, and I'll take the SP. ","Marshall Mohr","Okay. China quota, there is no new news here. It is as we\u2019ve stated before, the quota system involves, first the government \u2013 is tied up in the overall government \u2013 the government's overall planning process. They did approve their budget in December. We \u2013 after that, it then rolls through a series of decisions about province spending, as well as hospital spending and then eventually we'll hear something about a quota.","We don't know when that will be and what we would caution is that you put anything in the models for this year, frankly, because last time, when the quota was approved, it took some time before the tender offers that the hospitals have to go through to get them done.","Gary Guthart","On the SP regulatory question, we are targeting 510(k) for urology in the back half of the year. There's a data collection going on at the IDE sites for transoral robotic surgery and some lab based clinical development for other procedures, as well as the trial site in Asia. We haven't yet publicly projected our timelines for submissions after the urology 510(k).","There will be a set that come. It will be months, not years after the 510(k) submission. What that looks like will depend on the speed of closure of the clinical trial data and some of the conversations with FDA about what kind of submissions they'd like and we're not ready yet to anchor down those dates.","Bob Hopkins","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please.","David Lewis","Good afternoon. Just maybe a few quick questions here. Gary, just for you. Just the SP timing, I know it came up in the pipeline. But on FC and I know it's pretty early. Can you give us any sense of the major markets, US, China, Europe, which one?","Our sense is US and China are kind of ahead of Europe, but that's not based on a whole bunch. Which region you think proceeds the other and is 2019 a reasonable estimate for a launch in some geographic locale?","Gary Guthart","So, first to the question of which regions matter, we think it will have a global appeal, but I think you're right that United States and China and then Europe will be interesting. In terms of timing, a lot of it will be predicated on regulatory pathways and what kind of data requirements there are.","We think there are real opportunities in China. We're going to make sure that we do that right with our joint venture partner. We likewise, think there is in the US and not ready yet to call when the launch dates are for both sets, because of negotiations with clinical trial results.","Europe likewise, I think there's a little bit of uncertainty right now as to what kind of submission package will be required and that's one of the things we're in the midst of working out both internally and we have conversations with regulatory authorities over time.","We will do a controlled launch when we're ready. So we've told you don't model any revenue into \u201818. We have not yet published and are not ready to publish when the final launch will be. We'll let you know as we get closer to some of the certainty on regulatory timelines.","David Lewis","Okay. Very helpful. And Marshall, just two quick kind of margin related questions for you. The first is, on gross margin. Given a greater systems mix, I guess, I was surprised to see gross margins as strong as they were.","And I wonder, who would've thought that X, which wasn't very material in the quarter, would have also pressured margins. So what's driving the margin strength? And as it relates to X, is that just because a lot of the components of X frankly are ready at scale in other places of the business?","And the second question related is, looking at hiring, we typically don\u2019t ask about hiring, but I think your hiring level this quarter is 25% above the next highest level. That's pretty remarkable. I wonder if you would just share with us where you're hiring and where those people are being deployed? Thank you.","Gary Guthart","Sure. On the X margins, X margins, we had communicated before, typically, when we introduce a new product you see a little bit of a decrease in the margin and then we work to improve it over time.","You should \u2013 we did not expect as much of a decrease in margins due to X. X, as we said really is a result of putting together the parts that are already manufactured for other system. And so, we have worked out most of the cost effectiveness with that.","As far as total margins, yeah, the total margin came down a little bit due to the mix of systems. I think it exceeded our expectations just because of the overall strength of procedures and the drive of - and it's driving instrument and accessory revenue above our original expectations.","Marshall Mohr","As far as headcount goes, David, we ended the quarter with 4,108 employees. That was up a little over 100 from the last quarter end, and it was 19% year-over-year and it really does vary up with the strategic investments that we're making in the business on that side. The majority of the investments were in our product operations group in the quarter.","David Lewis","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tao Levy with Wedbush. Go ahead please.","Tao Levy","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. May I could, I wanted to ask on the SP platform. So the pathway for I believe, filing later on, you know, towards the end of this year, and then assuming approval sometime next year.","How is the launch going to proceed? Is this a \u2013 well, is an experienced da Vinci surgeon going to be able to sit in front of the SP, you know, in front of a console and use the SP right off the bat or are they going to have to go through proctoring of different types of cases? Just any color there would be great.","Gary Guthart","Yeah. Just in broad brushes, it's a family member in the da Vinci family and a lot of \u2013 we believe a lot of the learning and skills will be portable from one of the family members to the other part. They're not identical. So, there'll be some learning that goes through that transition.","We think experienced da Vinci surgeons will find that transition to be pretty manageable. What that looks like and how it's finally framed will evolve as we finish our clinical trials and our validations. But I'd expect a lot of that to be portable.","I think in terms of rollouts, we'll be at a controlled rollout when we come out. And part of that controlled rollout will be for data generation at the first sites, and also we'll have some constraints due to what our labelling will be at the first launch given the regulatory sequence and pathway.","Feedback from the clinical trial sites has been really good about usability of the system and meeting the expectations they had for what they believe they could do with that clinically. So far, so good there, and we also get pretty good insight into the characteristics of the system vis-\u00e0 -vis what they're used to on Si and Xi and kind of the response to your initial question.","Tao Levy","Got you. Perfect. And then just lastly, anything special going on in Japan? They've got way more systems than they have \u2013 than they need it at this point and they keep on buying more. I don't know if there's \u2013 is there a government incentive or any credit there that they are using? Thanks.","Marshall Mohr","Hey, Tycho \u2013 sorry, Tao.","Tao Levy","That\u2019s close. Don\u2019t worry.","Marshall Mohr","Japan has a very diffused healthcare system and hospital network systems, so they're not very concentrated in terms of where the patients are. So \u2013 and while we are at a high level of penetration in dVP, we still have a lot of pockets of patients who are treated in fairly remote areas in local hospitals. So they continue to buy systems, even be able to access some of the mainly urology patients that are out there.","Gary Guthart","We\u2019ve also been in Japan for some number of years here and I think there's a little bit of building capacity in hopes of broader reimbursements over time.","Tao Levy","Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to Amit Hazan with Citi. Go ahead, please.","Amit Hazan","Thanks. Hey, good afternoon, guys. Just one on the quarter and then a couple longer term ones. So on the quarter, obviously going \u2013 just going back to the US system number, a really strong number. I wanted to ask about trade-ins though. They were weak again in the US, it's a second quarter in a row.","I'm just trying to kind of better understand why, on one hand you\u2019ve got this obvious growing pool of systems that need to be replaced, so you shouldn\u2019t be really replacing more systems every year.","On the other hand, there seems to be a relationship between quarters where you had really strong de novo units like this, this year so far, both quarters. And then trade-ins, kind of tend to be inversely recur [ph] in those quarters. What's kind of the correct way to be thinking about modeling trade-ins in the US?","Gary Guthart","Let me speak to our intent a little bit, and I'll ask Calvin to jump in on the modeling side. For us, our thought process really has been to enable accounts with technologies and support that help them get to their clinical goals and in support their MIS and MIS program goals.","And if they can do that effectively with Si, we're happy to support them in that regard. If they want to add capacity or grow the system capability in some way that is benefited by our advanced technologies that helps us and drives a new system placement or new system sales.","So our incentives aren't strongly built on trade-outs. Much more interested in aligning with how they want to build their programs and giving them access to technologies that make a difference in their procedures. That leaves the lumpiness and trade-outs and that's okay with us. Calvin, to the modeling, I just give a little time to think about it, go ahead. ","Calvin Darling","What I say, I mean, is that you have such strong procedure growth and such demand for access to systems among the surgeon population that in a lot of cases when hospitals are seeking to acquire new systems, they look at the procedures and the surgeons that they want to be able to do within their robotics program. And Si can still serve a broad range of patients and can help them facilitate that. So they tend to be buying more incremental systems than trading in.","Amit Hazan","Okay.","Gary Guthart","As X matures in the market, X maybe an opportunity for some folks who are happy with their capacity, but want to upgrade up to additional capabilities and that may provide an opportunity for us in future quarters.","Calvin Darling","And just quickly from the modeling perspective that you asked. Beware of using our past experience with our Xi and previous system launches as the model for what's going to happen now, because it's a different world where you have, again, consolidated hospital networks that can align certain procedure characteristics with sets of procedures with a lot more ability to do so now than in the past. So it could very well follow a different pattern this go around than it has in the past. ","Amit Hazan","Okay. So that could maybe possibly lead me into the next question, which is on reimbursement. It looks like prostate is getting a new Medicare outpatient reimbursement codes for the first time I believe, and I realize most of the dVP procedures can't really be done in one day just yet.","But it just got me thinking about the question of what the trigger might be for hospitals to start equipping their outpatient settings with da Vinci? I have to imagine that between hysterectomies moving that way and things like hernia now, there's already enough volume to justify it nowadays.","So is something like prostate reimbursement any kind of an incur that can maybe drive boxes into outpatient setting and if not, then what could be the trigger to do that?","Calvin Darling","Two important thoughts here. One is in order to be able to do a surgery like a dVP in an outpatient setting, first off, that has to be done in a minimally invasive fashion, so that you can have the patient be able to recover quick enough to get out of that setting.","The second thing is you \u2013 outpatient is really a billing setting, not necessarily a side of care differentiator. What we see over time is that as programs mature in the robotics capacity, they have array of systems that can both serve really complex inpatient surgeries, like thoracic or colorectal. And they have sufficient volume of outpatient procedures like the ones you mentioned in hernia and gynecology and you could potentially dVP where you have a technique and a surgeon capable of getting a result that can get the patient out in the same day.","You'll see them actually put systems in a multiple different types of settings. Typically, still under the hospitals umbrella because they're the ones who have the capability of treating the range of patients who come in with different complexities, they might be either inpatient or outpatient. But it's usually by product maturity of the program as opposed to a specific reimbursement event.","Amit Hazan","Okay. Thanks very much guys.","Calvin Darling","Thanks, Amit.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Isaac Ro","Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Question for you on the X, just trying to think through the gross margin implications of that product cycle as it plays out. Realize it's a little early, but just trying to think through some of the comments you made earlier around how purchasing is evolving for hospitals and so forth.","Is that product cycle plays out, could you give us some sense of what it means for your gross margin profile based on what you know now, that would be helpful?","Gary Guthart","Initially, the gross margin profile is not substantially different than our other products. So it kind of fits in nicely. I think what you are asking is, over time, could we see that there is pressure on the ultimate price that we charge for X?","I think we'll see. We don't know. It's only been out in the market for a quarter and - but what we've said in the past is that we're about the market expansion and if there's the opportunities to expand the market at the expense of a little bit of price, we do that.","Isaac Ro","That's helpful. And then just as a follow up on the expense side. As you move towards expanding the market, interested in sort of allocation of resources and the sales force, can you talk a little bit about just qualitatively how you're moving some of your top performers to help drive X conversion, and then at the same time maybe thinking about adding new heads, just interested in the interplay on investment in sales force? Thank you.","Gary Guthart","Yeah. How we think about sales force investments really varies by region and maturity of the market. So how we're building the sales team in Germany for example, will look kind of qualitatively different than what's happening in the United States.","In general, the United States, we've had a stable structure growth in our key accounts teams, no surprise, and a little bit better stratification of levels in the force itself that gives us the opportunity to provoke and engage high level salespeople, at the same time bring in people who can support high-volume accounts that are premature.","So the US is a well stratified sales force and Germany, in places like Japan, we're really at the basic building stages. And so the investments there are a little more filling empty slots and making sort of territory coverage\u2019s is right.","Isaac Ro","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We now have a question from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Richard Newitter","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. It seems like for the third quarter in a row, China, on the procedure growth side, is exceeding your expectations. And seemingly, you're at capacity or you thought you\u2019re at capacity in the fourth quarter. And yet, this is still kind of \u2013 your capacity utilization seems to be creeping higher, anything to explain that?","Are there certain types of procedures that are maybe just quicker? And that as a percent of the mix in China is different than the U.S.? Or can you explain what might be driving this?","Gary Guthart","I think, at the top line, what's going on here is, high belief in value of the procedures and the technology and a willingness to expand the number of hours that people are able to get procedures.","I think the biggest effect is that which is a willingness to work on weekends and for them to expand to after-hours use of devices. That will dwarf the underlying which procedures in the mix. But Marshall, you can clean up that answer, if you like. ","Marshall Mohr","It's absolutely right. I mean, this is all about \u2013 it's a theoretical capacity that you're quoting. And that capacity \u2013 that theoretical capacity is based on just averages that we see around the world. Be careful of averages, and in China, they are operating on Saturdays, Sundays and late at night in order to get things done. So I think Gary's answer is right.","Gary Guthart","I think there's also an opportunity for us to learn from their experiences, which is under capital constraint, what kinds of barriers can they remove to get both good outcomes and high volumes. And I think that's exciting for us. And we have an open mind toward how we're approaching it.","Richard Newitter","Great. And then maybe just one follow-up on Japan. That's the other area where you're kind of seeing capacity constraint. And so you get additional \u2013 on the procedure side, at least, until you get additional approvals. Can you maybe just remind us the key procedures that you're hoping are up for consideration next year?","And maybe \u2013 which ones represent the biggest market opportunities, and do you feel there's any that might be further along with the approval agencies over there?","Gary Guthart","In terms of maturity, there are some that have been going through clinical trials and have a lot of data behind them and others that are using kind of existing data sources. So the one that has the most structured data so far is gastrectomy, and that is going to be exciting for us over time.","It's a real market in Japan. The prevalence is quite high, and so we have good hopes and optimism that, that will go through the process. Other categories are things like GYN oncology, which is of interest, saw lobectomy, Calvin, there are some others that\u2026","Calvin Darling","Yeah. Lobectomy procedures and some of the lower colon LAR procedures are potential.","Gary Guthart","Yeah. So I think the interest in broad use of da Vinci in Japan is very high. We do not have assurance of that MHLW will accept it in the next insurance cycle. Although, so far, so good. And we don't have assurance that the reimbursement levels will be any particular level.","And again, so far, the indicators are pretty good for us, but that's still a work in process from the government's evaluation point of view. And we stand by to support the surgical societies to answer questions for them as they need it.","Richard Newitter","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Larry Biegelsen","Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. Let me just start with hernia. You received recently a specific inguinal hernia indication, which includes positive data in the label. Could you talk about implications of that label and data? And are you pursuing other specific indications for other procedures? And I have one follow-up.","Gary Guthart","Sure. On the first one, this really is something around what gives us a little bit of freedom of \u2013 a little more freedom about what we can claim in our materials. And so it allows us to be a little bit more specific versus the general. And so for us, we think that, that just clarifies what our teams can speak about.","And so we think it's an incremental positive, it's a small positive, I think the data underlying it is supportive, and the interactions with FDA, I think are ultimately helpful for the whole process.","This is one of a set of specific indications that we have pursued over the last couple of years. And we do have a pipeline of the next set of things we want to do and get aligned. And we have not publicly disclosed what those are and what the order is, but I guess what I'd tell you is I expect more to come.","And again, I think it's a healthy process between us and the agency to supply data as we get it and that allows us a little more specific capability in terms of what we talk about.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks. And then I think on the \u2013 you're planning to finally launch a 45 millimeter stapler, which should help with bariatric procedures. Is there any update on the timing there? Thanks for taking the questions.","Gary Guthart","Sure. Yeah, we are working on additional staplers besides the ones that are in the market. We have a 30 and a 45. Remember, staplers are characterized by not only their length but also the length of the staples that go into jaw. There are a set of things that we're working on beyond that.","We do think that there are opportunities to build staplers that can have broader use in general surgery. We have not yet predicted or publicly disclosed what the expected time lines are. We do have to take note of the enrolment and those things. Approach maturity will share with you where we are. ","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Brandon Henry with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Brandon Henry","Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Can you provide an update on the Australian clinical trial for the flexible catheter platform? And any lessons you've learned from that trial?","And then when and where do you think we can see the data from the trial being published or presented? And a couple of follow-ups.","Gary Guthart","Yes. Thanks, Brandon. I think the short answer is no. I can't provide an update. The data is being analyzed. The clinical teams that are there are preparing abstracts and they will decide, which meeting they want to show it. And once they made a decision, then we're happy to share it with you.","As we said last time, the results were very positive for us. We were really happy with what we saw. I think the scientific principal investigators need the chance to write their manuscripts and analyze the data and present it in a way that makes sense to them. So we will wait for that, and as we get clarity there, we're sure to share it with you.","Brandon Henry","Okay. And then just more broadly, can you help me understand some of the differences or the benefits for Intuitive's flexible catheter platform relative to some of the other platforms in the market, like Medtronic with its super dimension platform?","Gary Guthart","Sure. I think what we can bring in our concept and our technology here is a couple of things. One is we have novel sensing technologies that allow us to sense all the way along the catheter length with a high degree of certainty. That helps us in terms of understanding and navigating tortuous pathways. That's one.","The second thing is the use of robotic assistance gives you stability and navigation capabilities that are very hard to do manually, and so those are technical benefits. What could they result in, in terms of clinical benefits?","The hope there is that you can get to more distal locations that are otherwise hard to get to in tortuous pathways and that are more accurate in terms of tissue sampling because you have high degree of stability and better imaging and targeting now.","Those claims have to be backed up, and so that's the hypothesis. And that's the set of trials and data and analysis that we\u2019re going after. And I think people are excited about flexible technologies in general by some of the technologies that our competitors and other med companies have put out there.","I think the excitement is there. And the question is, can you go a little further and get a little more predictability. And we think we have technologies and capabilities that can do that.","Brandon Henry","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Travis Steed with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Travis Steed","Thanks for taking the question.","Calvin Darling","Travis, you'll be the last questioner, so make it a good one.","Travis Steed","Okay. So you placed a decent amount of Si systems in the quarter. Did those customers have an option to purchase X? And just any color on how customers are deciding between the two systems, recognizing we're still very early on?","Gary Guthart","So I think the question was, either there's a fair number of Sis in the system in the quarter despite the availability of X.","Travis Steed","Yes.","Gary Guthart","Right? I think, first, while we were pleased with approval timelines of X in the U.S. and Europe, there are still many markets that X is not yet approved in. So some of the Sis are just purchases by folks whose choices were Si or Xi.","In the case of China, it's \u2013 their choices Si right now, not Xi. So some of it is just that. In other cases, some of the negotiations are multi-quarter negotiations and are right at the endpoint.","And so they will finish the transaction based on where they started. Those are opportunities for us to go back to those customers over time. That's one of the reasons that we had the revenue deferral and the offers for people to evaluate whether they want to make a change. So that's mostly what the dynamics are.","Marshall Mohr","And then, Travis, the other point to think about is just \u2013 the lumpy of the accruals came mid quarter, so I think Europe was in the beginning of practical and the U.S. was the beginning of May, so you didn't really have a full quarter to get out, get the team in and communicate to all your customers what X is relative to other products that may have already been in a long sales cycle.","Travis Steed","Okay.","Gary Guthart","Just a little color commentary on X. I think the customer base and our field understood well what X is, what its benefits are, I think. The logic of X is well understood and where it fits in the line is well understood. And we're pleased with that.","Travis Steed","Okay. And just one quick follow-up, I think I know the answer to this, but is it still your view we should be modeling in 2018 expense growth below you revenue growth?","Marshall Mohr","Actually, what we\u2019ve said is that expense growth \u2013 operating expense growth will grow 18% for the year.","Travis Steed","I'm sorry, in 2018, kind of longer term?","Gary Guthart","Do we expect a while a back\u2026","Marshall Mohr","Sorry. And in 2018, what we\u2019ve said is, we expect to dial back so that we are adding leverage.","Travis Steed","Okay. All right. Thanks for taking the questions.","Gary Guthart","Thanks, Travis. Well, that was our last question. As we\u2019ve said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our colonization\u2019s focus remains an increasing value by enabling surges to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma.","We've built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference.","This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve the surgery, and we look forward to talking with you again in three months.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation, and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"12438":["Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

Marshall will provide a review of our second quarter financial results. Aleks will discuss marketing and clinical highlights. Then I will provide an update to our financial forecast for 2013. Finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.","With that, I will turn it over to Gary.","Gary Guthart","Thank you for joining us today. As we previously announced, our second quarter has been a challenging one. Capital sales fell 5% from the prior year with the shortfall concentrated in the United States. We attribute this primarily to slower than expected da Vinci benign gynecology procedure growth in the United States. Taken globally, overall procedure performance in the quarter was solid rising 18% over prior year in the face of several headwinds.","Summarizing procedures in the United States strong general surgery growth continued centered within single site cholecystectomy and colon and rectal resections. In gynecology, DVH for malignant conditions was solid, while DVH growth for benign indications grew more slowly than expected. Urologic procedures continued to be stable.","In Europe, procedures grew sequentially over Q1, led by urology and early growth in malignant dVH. Growth was strongest in the U.K. and Nordic countries, moderate in the core countries and weakest in the south. Procedure growth in Asia was strong off of a small base, led by growth in urology and general surgery with particular strength in Japan, Taiwan and China.","Turning to systems, we sold 143 systems, 7 fewer than Q2 of 2012, with sales of new systems in the United States totaling 90, down from 124 a year ago. We believe the slowing of our growth in benign gynecologic procedures in the United States to be a significant contributor to weaker than expected system sales.","There appear to be a couple of underlying causes for slower than expected U.S. benign dVH growth. Overall admissions for benign gynecology appear to be under pressure in the first half of 2013, since we are a significant share of hysterectomy, our growth rate in dVH is sensitive to these admissions.","Second, our MCS notification and negative press occurred in the quarter and may have pressured growth in utilization, although estimating their impact on procedure volume is difficult. Given that the average da Vinci system is used for hundreds of procedures per year, a change in da Vinci patient admissions can free capacity on existing systems and pressure new system sales. This appears to be the case this quarter. Looking towards the second half of the year, we see increasing pressure on U.S. system sales.","Globally, our business in Asia has continued to build. In Japan, system sales were strong in the quarter, showing continued interest in da Vinci surgery. Our work with surgical societies is ongoing and there are efforts to obtain national reimbursement for procedures beyond prostatectomy. Currently, it appears unlikely that additional procedures will receive national reimbursement in April 2014 insurance revision, given recent guidance from MHLW.","As we said in the past, we continue to expect Japan system sales to be highly variable from quarter-to-quarter. We are investing in building our team in Japan with a view towards long-term performance.","Capital sales in Europe have grown over the past few quarters in a difficult environment. As we have said on prior calls, sales force changes in Europe have made a positive difference. We are gathering European clinical and reimbursement data and expect these investments to increase in the future. Given macroeconomic stresses in Europe and government processes, we expect reimbursement efforts to be a long-term endeavor.","During the quarter, FDA conducted an on-site audit of ISI and issued a set of four observations in Form 483, previously reported in June. Yesterday, we received a warning letter from FDA as a follow-on for these audit inspection findings asking for additional steps to resolve two of the observation. These concerns are addressable and we are in the process of doing so.","Turning to operating performance for the second quarter, procedures grew approximately 18% over the second quarter of 2012. We sold 143 da Vinci surgical systems, down from 150 during the second quarter of last year. Total revenue was $579 million, up 8% over last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $265 million, up 18% over Q2 2012. Total recurring revenue grew to $363 million, up 18% from prior year and comprising 63% of total revenue.","Net income was $159 million, up 3% over last year and we generated an operating profit of $257 million before non-cash stock option expense, down 1% from the second quarter of last year and representing 45% of Q2 revenue. We ended the quarter with $3.270 billion in cash and investments, down $89 million from last quarter. In the quarter, we generated $189 million in gross cash flow from operations, which is 119% of our reported GAAP net income. And, finally, we repurchased $270 million of our stock.","Before turning the time over to Marshall, it is worth taking a step back and looking at a longer-term view of da Vinci technology in surgery. We remain deeply positive on the value da Vinci can bring to surgery now and in the future. The benefit da Vinci brings as an alternative to open surgery has been demonstrated in hundreds of peer-reviewed clinical papers and is widely accepted by our customers.","Though some da Vinci procedures mature in the United States, we are increasingly exposed to volatility in patient admissions for our core procedures and the consequent lumpiness in capital sales. Viewed over the long-term, da Vinci surgery contributes to a trend in surgery for consolidation of procedures into fewer surgeons with higher volume. We believe this consolidation is good for patients, surgeons, hospitals and Intuitive. We are still early in the global adoption of da Vinci enabled minimally invasive surgery as applied to complex conditions.","In recent quarters, we have seen building interest in the use of da Vinci in general surgery, stand-in procedures from the pelvis to the upper gastrointestinal intestinal tract. As we expand our offerings in technologies like vessel sealing, stapling and Firefly, we are seeing increased utilization and efficiency in general surgery procedures that are otherwise very difficult to perform.","Taking a recent example, EndoWrist vessel sealers are now installed in roughly half of our U.S. customers. These technologies also open the door to additional clinical applications such as thoracic surgery where long-term additions to stapling can bring benefits to procedures that are often difficult to perform through small incisions. Looking at single incision surgery, single site cholecystectomy chips have been purchased by approximately half of our U.S. customers 18 months after launch. This procedure is currently growing faster than any prior da Vinci procedure. Early adopting clinical sites have been progressing in refined procedure choreography with single site hysterectomy as well.","Furthermore we are investing in expanding single site technology and expect to bring to market additional single site instruments as well as integration with other da Vinci technologies including Firefly and simulation. As our product suite develops further, we anticipate pursuing additional clinical indications for single site. Considering trends in healthcare policy around the globe, a long-term intention to move away from fee-for-service and towards single payment per treatment event can advantage those approaches with fewer complications and fewer readmissions.","Also the trend towards public transparency of individual surgeon and hospital outcomes has the potential to shift patient dynamics toward those programs, showing the best outcomes. Again while we cannot predict future implementations of policy, we believe their direction made set up well for da Vinci surgeons, their patients and hospital programs.","In summary, we continue to see a long-term opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and are focused on the following. Extending the benefits of minimally invasive surgery using da Vinci in gynecology and urology worldwide, building da Vinci capability and supporting its use in general surgery, disciplined execution in our stapling and single site product launches and finally, continuing to invest in our capabilities in international markets, particularly Europe and Japan.","I will now pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer.","Marshall Mohr","Thank you, Gary. Our second quarter revenue was $579 million, up 8% compared with $537 million for the second quarter of 2012 and down 5% from last quarter. Second quarter revenues by product category were as follows. Second quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $265 million, up 18% compared with $224 million in the second quarter of 2012 and up 1% compared with the first quarter of 2013.","The year-over-year increase in instrument and accessory revenue was driven by procedure growth of 18%. Sales of new products including single site, vessel sealer and Firefly partially offset by lower instrument and accessory stocking orders associated with lower second quarter system sales. The 18% increase in da Vinci procedures for the quarter reflected strength in general surgery procedures and slower growth in benign gynecologic procedures.","As Gary indicated, the slowdown in benign gynecologic growth reflects a number of factors including, but not limited to, weaker hospital admissions for benign da Vinci procedures. Our second quarter 2013 U.S. dVP procedures were approximately 5% lower than the second quarter of 2012 and 2% lower than the first quarter of 2013. The sequential increase in instrument and accessory revenue compared with last quarter was driven by higher procedure volume partially offset by lower instrument and accessory stocking orders.","Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including initial stocking orders was approximately $2,020 per procedure, which was roughly equal to the second quarter of 2012 and lower than the approximately $2,110 last quarter. The decrease compared to the first quarter reflected lower stocking orders and the timing of orders.","Second quarter 2013 systems revenue of $216 million decreased 6% compared with $229 million for the second quarter of 2012 and decreased 16% compared with $256 million last quarter. Overall, we sold 143 systems in the second quarter of 2013, compared with 150 systems in the second quarter of last year and 164 systems last quarter.","We sold 90 systems into the U.S. market in the second quarter of 2013, compared with 124 systems last year and 115 systems last quarter. The lower second quarter 2013, U.S. system sales reflected among other things, the impacts of moderating growth U.S. benign gynecologic procedures and increased economic pressure on hospitals.","During the second quarter of 2013, we sold 53 systems into international markets, including 21 into Europe and 20 into Japan, compared with 26 in international markets in the second quarter 2012, which included 13 the Europe and 7 into Japan and 49 systems in international markets in the first quarter of 2013, which included 16 into Europe and 25 into Japan.","Our second quarter average sales price per system was $1.5 million, compared with 1.53 million realized in the second quarter of 2012 and the 1.55 million realized last quarter. ASPs include all da Vinci models, all simulators and Firefly when configured with the system and exclude upgrades.","Our second quarter 2013 ASPs were lower than the first quarter due to a lower proportion of dual console configuration and slightly higher proportion of sales involving trade-in. 43 of our second quarter 2013 system sales involved trade-in, comprised of 39 da Vinci Ss and four standard models. 35 of our second quarter 2012 sales involved trade-ins and 39 of our first quarter 2013 sales involved trade-in.","Service revenue increased to $98 million, up 18%, compared with $83 million last year and up 4% compared with $94 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was primarily driven by a larger system installed base.","International revenue results were as follows. Second quarter revenue outside the U.S. was $158 million, up 56% compared with revenue of $101 million in the second quarter last year and up 3% compared with $153 million last quarter. Our higher year-over-year international revenue growth was driven primarily by higher da Vinci system sales into the Japanese and European markets.","Our higher sequential international revenue was driven by higher European system sales, partially offset by lower system sales into Japan. Second quarter 2013, international procedure volume was approximately 23% higher than the second quarter of 2012 and 6% higher than the first quarter of this year.","Moving on to remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the second quarter 2013 was 70%, compared with 72% for the second quarter 2012 and 71% for the first quarter 2013. Our lower margin percentage compared to the second quarter of last year resulted primarily from the impact of the medical device excise tax enacted beginning in 2013 and product. Our lower gross margin percentage compared to last quarter was driven primarily by cost associated with the MTS recall, lower system ASPs and product mix.","Second quarter 2013 operating expenses of $187 million were up 16%, compared with the second quarter 2012 and up 2% compared with the first quarter this year. Our higher year-over-year operating expense increase was driven by headcount additions. Our increase compared to last quarter was driven by headcount additions and higher legal costs offset by lower incentive compensation.","Second quarter 2013 operating income was $219 million, or 38% of sales compared with $225 million or 42% of sales last year and $251 million or 41% of sales last quarter. Second quarter 2013 operating income included $39 million of non-cash stock compensation expense compared with $33 million last year and $38 million last quarter.","Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 28.6%, compared with 32.4% for the second quarter 2012 and 26.1% last quarter. Our second quarter rate was a bit lower than the midpoint of our 28% to 30% guidance range, primarily reflecting a higher proportion of international pre-tax income. Our net income was $159 million or $3.90 per share, compared with $155 million or $3.75 per share last year and $189 million or $4.56 per share last quarter.","Now, moving to cash flow. We ended the second quarter with cash and investments of $3 billion, down $89 million compared with March 31, 2013. The decrease was driven by $270 million used to repurchase our common stock and $25 million of capital and IP acquisition, partially offset by $189 million in cash flow generated from operation. During the second quarter, we bought back approximately 546,000 shares at an average price of $493 per share. We ended the quarter with approximately 900 million authorized by the board for share buyback.","And with that, I would like to turn it over to Aleks, who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights.","Aleks Cukic","Thank you, Marshall. During the second quarter, we sold 143 da Vinci systems. 90 in the United States, 21 into Europe and 32 in to the rest of world markets. As part of the 143 system sales, four standard da Vinci systems and 39 da Vinci S systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si systems. We finished the quarter with a net 89 system additions to the installed base, bringing to 2,799 accumulative number of da Vinci systems worldwide. 2,001 in the United States, 443 in Europe and 355 in rest of world markets. 61 of the 143 systems installed during the quarter represented repeat system sales to existing customers. In total, 140 of the 143 systems sold represented da Vinci Si or S-e systems which included 27 dual console systems. The 53 system sales internationally included 20 in Japan, four into Russia and three into the countries of France, Germany, the U.K., And Australia and Taiwan.","Clinically, Q2 year-over-year procedure growth was approximately 18%, led by the category of general surgery paced by cholecystectomy, followed by colon and rectal resections. Other general surgery procedures showing strong growth included gastric, pancreatic and achalasia procedures. Overall urology growth was solid and included strong OUS dVP growth with continued stability in U.S. dVP.","As Gary stated, our benign GYN procedure growth moderated for the second quarter in a row, which had an adverse effect on our U.S. system sales. We believe that our U.S. procedure opportunity within benign GYN remained solid though we do recognize that the procedures remaining on the back half of the adoption curve will be more difficult to consolidate. The slower adoption within the benign GYN segment will most likely lead to continued lumpiness in U.S. system placements.","Recently released new products continue to perform well. Through Q2, we sold single site instrument and accessory kits to approximately 740 U.S. customers. Our vessel sealer product sales were strong, with most of the interest coming from the specialties of colorectal, advanced general and GYN surgery. The customer adoption for both da Vinci simulator and Firefly continues to expand with 96 customers purchasing a da Vinci simulator and 76 customers purchasing Firefly systems as part of their initial system purchase this quarter.","In addition, we have expanded our phased rollout of both the da Vinci surgical stapling system and single site hysterectomy products to several new sites. These rollouts will be expanded in a measured fashion, so we do not expect them to contribute materially to 2013 revenue. During the quarter, several hundred robotic abstracts and papers representing a variety of surgical specialties were published within various peer-reviewed journals while quarterly clinical conferences produced several live da Vinci procedure transmissions, postgraduate robotic courses, podium presentations and clinical poster sessions. So, I will take a few moments to summarize a couple that provide interesting perspectives within the area of general surgery.","The rate of surgical conversions from a laparoscopic procedure to an open surgery is most often related to the complexity of the procedure. We describe this relationship within our urologic and gynecologic procedure businesses and believe it applies to all surgical specialties in which we participate. This past quarter, several peer-reviewed general surgery studies described da Vinci surgery within this very context.","A colorectal study colorectal study published in the Journal Surgical Endoscopy, compared 84 consecutive minimally invasive low anterior resection, 47 incorporating da Vinci and 37 employing traditional laparoscopy technique. The study emanated out of the division of colorectal surgery at Yonsei University Hospital completed in 2010, had a median follow-up of 31 and a half months. Within their review, the authors describe overall safety and efficacy as similar within the two cohorts. However, the differences in the conversion rate from MIS to open and overall hospital stay were considered significant.","Within the laparoscopic cohort 16.2% of the patients had required conversions to open surgical technique as compared to 2.1% within the da Vinci cohort. Though both techniques are minimally invasive, the requisite hospitalization for patients undergoing a da Vinci colorectal resection was reduced by two days.","The authors stated, and I quote, \"We compared the long and short-term results for patients who underwent robotic and laparoscopic low anterior resection and coloanal anastomosis. Robotic coloanal anastomosis had short and long-term outcomes comparable with those of laparoscopy. In particular, we found that patients in the robotic group demonstrated significantly lower rate of conversion to open surgery and had shorter hospital stay than the patients in the laparoscopic group. A lower rate of conversion to open surgery has a very important impact clinically, because the conversions often are associated with high complication rate and a poor prognosis.\"","In the Annals of Surgery, a study conducted at the University of Pittsburgh entitled robotic assisted, minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy is superior to laparoscopic technique compared to results of the department's first 30 da Vinci distal pancreatectomies to a historical cohort comprised of their last 94 laparoscopic distal pancreatectomies. The patients in the study demonstrated equivalent age, sex, race, ASA scores and tumor size.","Within their comments, the authors noted, to their surprise, that the operating time between the two cohorts showed a substantial reduction of over 75 minutes in favor of the da Vinci technique. In addition, they reported that the rate of conversion to open surgery was 16% for the laparoscopic patient versus zero among the da Vinci patients, this despite a greater probability for malignancy within the da Vinci group. Also noteworthy was more pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas were approached robotically. 43% than laparoscopically at 15%.","Oncologic outcomes in these cases were superior for the robotic-assisted group with higher rates of margin negative resection and improved lymph node yield for both, benign and malignant lesions. In their summary, the authors wrote and I quote \"Robotic distal Pancreatectomies were equivalent to lap distal Pancreatectomies in nearly all measures of outcomes and safety, but significantly reduced the risk of conversion to open resection despite a statistically greater probability of malignancy in the robotic cohort. We concluded that robotic assistance may broaden indications for minimally invasive pancreatectomy\".","This concludes my remarks and I will now pass the time over to Calvin.","Calvin Darling","Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing you with an update to our financial forecast for 2013 on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates of significant non-cash expenses starting with procedures. On our last call, we projected full year 2013 procedures to grow towards the lower end of a range of between 20% and 23% from the base of approximately 450,000 procedures performed in 2012. Now, based upon moderating growth rates for U.S. benign gynecologic procedures, we are adjusting our projection for full year 2013 procedure growth to a range of between 15% and 18%.","Moving to revenues. As has been discussed earlier on this call, capital sales of da Vinci systems are highly sensitive to changes in procedure growth patterns. Moderating procedure growth has led to increased capacity in our installed base. Given this sensitivity, it is challenging for us to forecast the number of systems we expect to sell in the second half of this year, so we have widened our guidance range. Given the significant portion of our revenue that is derived from system sales, we now expect total 2013 revenue to range from approximately flat to 7% growth compared to full year 2012.","Turning to operating income. On our last call, we forecast operating income to fall within a range of between 38% and 39% of net revenue. At this point, given our reduced revenue expectations, we are taking steps to scale back expenses. We do not intend to make short-term spending cuts in areas that would compromise our longer-term expansion strategies. As a result, we now anticipate full year 2013 operating income to fall within a range of between 37% and 38% of revenue.","Now with regard to non-cash stock compensation expenses. On our last call, we forecast 2013 total stock compensation to total between $184 million and $192 million for the year. Based upon our current stock price, we are reducing our forecast to a range of between $164 million and $172 million for the year. Timing of recognition should follow a quarterly pattern similar to 2012. We expect other income which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $17 million and $19 million in 2013. With regard to income tax, our Q2 tax rate was 28.6% of pretax income. Our rate for the remainder of the year will likely be close to that level.","Our share count for calculating EPS in Q2 2013 was approximately 40.8 million shares. Directionally, in Q3, our share count will likely modestly decline from the Q2 level. The actual share count will depend on several factors including the magnitude and timing of share buybacks.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair","Ben Andrew - William Blair","I wanted to follow up on a couple of points, I guess, to start. Gary, you talked about the fact that system growth would likely be lumpy over the course of the coming quarters. Can you give us some sense of what your inputs have been lately from the field and from customers relative to how lumpy and what that mix between new customers and existing customers is likely look like going forward?","Gary Guthart","I think the commentary is pretty much as we have outlined it for you. We see really an issue in the U.S., so the existing customers looking at capacity. We don\u2019t see existing customers walking away from the technology or the opportunity but more a question of timing for them. So it feels more like delay than otherwise. As we have said in the past, I think that capital sales are really driven by three underlying drivers. One of them is additional capacity and existing customers. One of them is technologies or new features that they would like to get. The third are customers that are not yet da Vinci owners who are interested in engaging.","We have had good success with the new technologies that we are bringing out. So we see that is as proceeding. I think the growth rate on benign gynecologic procedures has come in the second quarter grew, but grew at a slower rate than we were expecting. There is a multiplier effect there on capacity. So the capacity constraints in existing accounts will take some quarters to work out.","Ben Andrew - William Blair","Gary, can you may be give us comments or perhaps, Aleks, on this about any correlation between the volume of benign GYN cases and physician visits because we heard some noise back and forth about flattish or even sometimes declining patient volumes overall. Does that appear to be part of it as may this historically it was being utilized less frequently and other things like that around the procedure growth is obviously a big change in hysterectomy growth. Has this happened to you in the last couple of quarters?","Gary Guthart","Yes. I think in terms of total in-patient admissions as a whole, and then people coming and seeking, women coming and seeking hysterectomy. As you know in-patient admission data broadly lags for a while, so we get out that by more or less the same way you do by talk to our customers, by looking at survey data and trying to look at other analysis. It's clear that in the first quarter total in-patient admissions were lower than people had expected them and in some cases and some institutions negative as a total.","In Q2, we are hearing mixed feedback on total. For hysterectomy as a whole, our customers are seeing a pressure both, in Q1 and in Q2. Quantifying that in Q2 is tough just because the data likes and so qualitatively we have seen some pressure there and there are some things that are just hard for us to handicap in terms of intuitive specific events and their impact on benign test. Thing like the MCS notification are just harder for us to quantify what that impact was.","Ben Andrew - William Blair","Sure. Then Calvin, I guess, very briefly on the procedure guidance the 15% to 18%, does that assume that benign hysterectomy rose sequentially in the back half versus the first half. I know you've got some year-over-year comparisons there as well. So, I mean, maybe well a different versus year-on-year.","Calvin Darling","Yes. I think when you look at the overall guidance and the revised range, we are talking about general surgery performing well and in line with our earlier guidance. And similarly on urology side and international, so I think the change overall really is very much attributable to the benign gynecologic procedures in the U.S. And, so I think, we are still talking about growth. It's a moderating growth pattern and the trajectory for the quarters ought to follow a similar pattern to what we've seen historically.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tao Levy with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Tao Levy - Wedbush Securities","On the warning letter that you received, it seems rather fast for the FDA to come in June and then few weeks later give you guys a warning letter. Can you maybe go into little more details as to what they are looking for?","Calvin Darling","The consent of the letter is really a reflection of the concept that was in 43 Form that was issued in June. There were four observations. There are two mentions in warning letter become public, but two mentions of things that like additional insight into. One of them had to do with the procedure by which recall is classified and their participation in that classification that was kind of the first bullet in that.","And the other bullet, they want additional information on has to do with user input and design elements having to do a particular product. I think those are addressable. We are working on addressing them. I think we can address them quickly and move on.","Tao Levy - Wedbush Securities","Did the letter mention anything about having to come back and revisit the facility or audits?","Calvin Darling","There is a mention that they will come back and audit specifically around recall classifications.","Tao Levy - Wedbush Securities","And, you also mentioned about Japan and not expecting and any additional reimbursed procedures, so in the next cycle but the MHLW kind of mention to you guys about that?","Calvin Darling","They are. MHLW is working on guidance documentation for reimbursement, but more broadly than us for new technologies that's outline the data requirements for what that like to see in Japan, Japan specific data. For prostatectomy, we are able to use global data and had a good interaction with MHLW given current guidance, again, I think it is a class of products more broad than us. They are looking for additional data collection in Japan specifically. That's going to vary by procedure. The data requirements appear to vary by procedure having to do with maturity of clinical data and so it's not all locked down yet.","We are continuing to work with surgical societies who in turn work with MHLW but given the visibility we have on it now, it looks like there will be partial reimbursement followed by national reimbursement on a timeline that has to be decided based on their daily requirements. As we get additional insight and understand it deeper, we will share that with you.","Tao Levy - Wedbush Securities","Okay, lastly sort of a decadence on system sales throughout the rest of the year. Is the pressure that we should model that primarily just U.S. based. Is that right way to think about it or do you see anything else in sort of Europe, rest of the world, Japan as well?","Gary Guthart","I will start with a broad answer and let Marshall color it is as well. In the U.S., I think the dynamics that we saw in the second quarter may persist for the back half of the year. In terms of OUS, we are pleased with the progress we are making in Europe but as you know Europe can be really lumpy. Likewise in Japan. I think that that Japan has had some boluses of pent-up demand and what that looks like in future quarters is likely to not be stable. I don\u2019t think I would use past couple quarters to predict the future next quarters. Marshall?","Marshall Mohr","Specifically in Japan, we introduced type in the beginning of the year. I think that helped drive increased system sales and we don\u2019t see that level continuing and as Gary said, Europe will be lumpy, particularly Q3 is a vacation period for them, and so historically we have seen lower sales in Europe in Q3.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Thank you for taking the question. Gary, both in your and Aleks' prepared remarks you referenced the volume of data that continue to come out regarding the da Vinci system but as you think about some of the headlines out there that have materialized in the past six and half months and the rising concerns, potentially from payers as it relates to hysterectomy. To what extent have you started to rethink the need or potential need for a large-scale randomized clinical trial to really definitively put a line in the sand on the value proposition of da Vinci, that a multicenter multi-hundred patient clinical trial, even if it is sponsored by the company?","Gary Guthart","That\u2019s a good question. Going forward, I think clearly, large-scale studies are, or multi-institutional, multi-surgeons are powerful and are important. Speaking to the headlines a little bit, I think that headlines often confound the differences between complex procedures and simples ones and the use of da Vinci as an alternative to open versus the da Vinci as an alternative to laparoscopy. I think there is a lot of very strong data for the use of da Vinci as an alternative to open surgery.","That said, going back to your comment, we are investing in large-scale studies. They are not always prospective randomized trials. Sometimes, they are registries. Sometimes they are occupational trials. Sometimes they are prospective randomized. There is a lot on the institutions that are doing them and the nature of the data they already have and the data they are collecting. But we are believers in indicated tests. We think that matters and over time, we will see more of that come out, both in hysterectomy and in other procedures.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","And maybe just on the systems side, surely, I can appreciate that the slowing utilization or slowing procedure volumes will impact the rate at which you sell systems. But it seems like a pretty fast drop-off in system presence relative to what is, at least it looks to be in the quarter, a pretty modest slowing in procedure volumes. So am I reading that wrong if I say that there is already a lot of capacity out there as systems and a small tweak on the volume side is going to make a big impact on procedures or is it something that procedure worsen throughout the quarter so forward view is a little bit more cautious? Am I looking at that wrong?","Gary Guthart","I will separate it into two things. I think I am going to take the second part first. The idea of, did we see a softening at the back end of the quarter in terms of procedures and that driving additional conservativism or the back half the year. We did not see a strong fall off in procedures through the quarter. It wasn\u2019t that. We got to the end and procedures were really ramping down or anything like that in terms of rates.","In terms of sensitivity, we came out of a strong fourth quarter of '12 both in procedures and in systems saw some mixed dynamics in Q1 across the industry us included. In terms of procedure volumes in-patient admissions and that's the benign hysterectomy for da Vinci. Growth rate really struggled to gain traction again in Q2 and I think that that has, added up to the sensitivity you are seeing in systems. I do think because systems are used for hundreds of procedures a year and we are doing a fair number of procedures in the U.S. that are benign hysterectomy procedures. There's the sensitivity that gets you to the capital number.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Okay. That's helpful. Maybe lastly, the guide, the flattest of 7% total revenue guidance for the year just roughly looking and it seems that you've taken a pretty conservative approach with respect to systems and almost it's like you are extrapolating second quarter trend in and close to flat running them through the balance of the year, so is that guidance meant to reflect the degree of uncertainty that might exist in both, the capital markets as well as the timing of any more correlation to slowing procedure volumes and flowing and that that this is a view based on what you know today and then sort of taking that forward that sort of give you some room on the overall performance of the business.","Calvin Darling","Yes. David, our wider range in the revenue guidance does reflect the slower growth in da Vinci procedures and really the uncertainty and the trend in dVH. Our underlying assumptions, we have seen roughly flat system utilization the back half of the year with a reduced growth assumption on procedures and the rest basically falls through. Again as we discussed, the capital sales are highly sensitive to changes the procedure growth trends in our guidance for materially fewer system sales in the second half of 2013 that the first couple other points on guidance while we are on the topic and we talk a lot about system ASPs.","It's probably likely the second half system ASPs maybe modestly lower than the first half based on a higher proportion of the sales that may involved trade-ins with the low volumes. Then secondly the second half. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure will probably also directionally be a bit lower than we saw the first half just based upon fewer stocking orders associated with the lower system sales.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Hazan with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust","Thanks, guys. Just one question dVH side. One of the reasons you noted for weakness was the move of hysterectomy from the in-in patient to outpatient setting, but the data kind of shows pretty clearly kind of this has been an ongoing thing for years now, maybe about 5% or so a year consistently for a long time. So, I am wondering what has intuitive change now, particularly this quarter. (Inaudible) noted that kind of beyond that, already existing long-term trend.","Calvin Darling","Yes. I think there are a couple of underlying dynamics in the dVH space, and actually pulling them apart and putting numbers on them is very, very tough. One of them has been we have seen over recent quarters a pressure by payers on use of hysterectomy as a whole, and we are hearing that back through our surgeon channels. What it takes to authorized and hysterectomy and kind of conservative medical management before that we are also seeing their policies towards driving them into the regulatory setting versus in-patient settings.","After that the deductible dynamics and another macroeconomic trends and then some. Intuitive-specific dynamics around negative press and and\/or MCS notification and you've guys set of things that the contributors sorting exactly which is which in real-time is a very tough. It really is going to be survey data retrospective analysis to figure out which of those is dominant. Some of them are increasing trends. Some of them seem to be episodic trends.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust","Okay. Then back to the system side, I want to just kind of maybe touch on the deferral versus cancellation? Again, I think you guys were using the word deferral in your preannouncement, press release. Can you talk a little bit about the systems that maybe you are close to closing and didn\u2019t, that were deferred because of the lower trajectory as expected growth of procedures, and whether you are hearing in large part that was a deferral and not necessarily a cancellation and then move away from that technology and are we have talking virtually pretty much all of the units that sell into that bucket or where there is some that you feel where cancellation, not really moving away from your technology?","Gary Guthart","So the pipeline entering the quarter, as we commented three months ago was strong and that, as you know, capital sales tend to be back-ended. So it wasn\u2019t until the end of the quarter that thing started to drop off. The reasons that we were given for systems falling off included things like an inability to get financing, just additional levels of approval required within hospital systems. So it just felt like a harder environment, from an economic perspective. It did feel like a number of them were pushed off. Now, we see them being pushed off. Do they ultimately get done is really hard to predict. We don\u2019t know as someone has intent to buy because of hospital dynamics or concerns about the economy whether they will still have those concerns for a quarter or two out or whether those will go away and capacity will catch such that they buy. So its really hard for us to predict which ones will come back and which ones will not. But the initial commentary that you we are getting from hospitals was they are pushing them up.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust","Okay, and just one final one for me on utilization. I think you mentioned you are assuming flat utilization in the back half. I am just wondering as we start to think about general surgery and especially cholecystectomy in there being a shorter procedure whether we should be considering utilization per system starting to go up a little bit more than it has been in trend?","Gary Guthart","It\u2019s a very good point. As chole's and other simple procedures get done, they are faster. They also tend to be more schedulable. Benign disease patient can schedule into a slot often better or easier than in a case of a malignant disease. So as that becomes material and bigger, I think that utilization may well go up. I think ultimately that\u2019s a good thing for hospitals and a good thing for us but it can create some uncertainty in terms of predicting where utilization ought to settle. Now, things like, just to add a point, colorectal procedures are also growing, our complex longer general surgery procedures and cancer procedures. So, you have both of those dynamics going on at once and so the mix change is the thing you have to predict to get to utilization and that\u2019s how Calvin at his guidance on.","Calvin Darling","Yes, and I think as the trends have been, over the last few years, gradual growth. Low mid-single digit percentage growth in utilization per system. Now they are almost 2,800 systems out there now and they are all at the various stages of adoption. So my point is it\u2019s a large sample size and that metric historically has moved very gradually in direction.","Gary Guthart","And just speaking for the long-term, looking out multiple quarters, our utilization is ultimately great for hospitals. They get a good return on their investment and it is great for the company. So over time if it heads that way then we will adjust.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis - Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","John Demchak - Morgan Stanley","Hello, this is actually John Demchak in for David. Thanks for taking the question. So you gave some numbers on the magnitude of growth rate for dVP in the quarter, but I didn\u2019t really hear anything that\u2019s specific towards dVH? So I was wondering if you could give us maybe additional color on the magnitude for malignant or benign? If not, if you could also maybe discuss how you are thinking about some of those pressures? If they are maybe more temporary or if you think they are more permanent and structural and maybe the total addressable market that you have previously discussed maybe needs to come down a bit?","Gary Guthart","Yes, I don\u2019t think we are going to give specific percentage growth rates in the hysterectomy here but I think we are out of certain trajectory through 2012 and there was a noticeable change in the growth rate in Q1 that was continued out into Q2 and when we look at our guidance we are projecting out our growth rate at that lower trend.","Marshall Mohr","Yes, and as far as the addressable market, again what we have created is really a construct for the way we think about the procedures that we can access. We talk about, in the case of dVH, it started with that complex beginning with malignant endometrial cervical cancers, et cetera. Then into the complex benign and we ultimately are going after what is open surgery. There may be some intersection between laparoscopic and so on, but really the primary target. We still stand by that.","We believe that that is our target market, but what we have really realized is that as you get to the back half of these adoption curves, accessing those procedures with the same sort of approach as you did on the front half of it is difficult. In other words, they don't consolidate same way at same pace.","So, we feel strongly about the opportunity still being there and fruitful, but the timing of it in the backend is going to be difficult to predict and therein lies the challenge that you saw in the first couple of quarters and the effect it had on the systems.","John Demchak - Morgan Stanley","Thank you. Very helpful. Kind of speaking more on the dVH side also. Will the dVH outlook maybe impacts any hiring that's going on the procedure side for general surgery or maybe effect of balance or disrupts that you have gain access in both areas.","Calvin Darling","As we think about opportunity, we look at it in terms of procedure growth regionally, so we look at U.S. and various regions and see what opportunity and penetration levels look like and they are non-uniform. It's not that the whole country is all at the same level of adoption. And as adoption is deep in some areas for gynecology that resource is to pursue general surgery and other things, so that's really how we are directing on our sales force.","John Demchak - Morgan Stanley","Yes. Then just one quick follow-up on the buyback authorization for March, I was wondering if you could give any additional color on your thoughts towards the capital deployment and maybe timing?","Calvin Darling","It will be consistent with what we said in the past and we will look for the right opportunities to buy back shares, so looking this continuities and expect stock price from the market and we have authorized and we intend to use it appropriately.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Thanks for taking the question. I guess first one just on kind of a general roadmap here for general surgery. Can you talk a little bit about how sustainable do you think the demand you are seeing in chole is right now? Are you seeing centers trial and then other ramp up or what's the dynamic right there and then can you also talk on bariatric and maybe some of these other opportunities in general surgery beyond chole and LAR?","Calvin Darling","Okay. On single site cholecystectomy, we have seen a good stick rate and in some ways better stick rate than past procedures in terms of early experiences and we have seen great growth out of some centers. One of the exciting things about single site cholecystectomy is that, number one, it's a procedure where surgeons can see high volume. And so when they move, they get a lot of experience quickly. So, the early part of that experience has been good.","Having said that, there were absolutely some surgeons and there were absolutely some institutions who will not participate. There are some folks who believe in the value proposition and see the benefits it's bringing and bringing to them and it\u2019s patients. Some centers have great growth in their admissions, but there are some who are on the sidelines and may stay on the side line, so I think it's going to split the field for some time.","How far it penetrates and how long, I think that remains to be seen. I think, there is a segment of patients that value it. I think there is a segment of surgeons who value it and who are gaining experience rapidly, but trying to call where the end is something we can do.","Gary Guthart","With respect to the broader category that you outlined, I think there's really two things to think about or two ways to think about it. One is the absolute contribution of the individual procedure. So, for example, on a distal pancreatectomy or on a liver procedures, or spleen procedure esophageal. They are going to contribute the form of I&A, but really the hidden power there is the combination of strength from the surgeons that are performing a lot of the benign operations coupled with the strength of the surgeons who are seeing demand in things like colorectal distal pancreatectomy, collectively getting together into the system purchasing suite or decision. It is also pretty powerful. So we don\u2019t really, per se, value them as one-for-one. I think the broader you go between malignant and cancer, I should say, malignant and benign, the more strength you see in terms of placing systems out of that particular vertical which we saw in gynecology and we saw in urology as well.","Calvin Darling","Okay, Tycho, I will give you one last follow-up here.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Just on Japan, can you talk about how the growth trajectory is going to change in the absence of the new procedures. And you alluded to the fact that you are looking for Japan specific data. So you probably won't get the reimbursement code but is that a definitive decision at this point that you won't get it?","Gary Guthart","It is not definitive but the conversation is ongoing and per our statements we think that broad approvals across multiple procedures are unlikely. I can describe the process what the growth rate looks like, I think, is hard to predict. Process wise, we will submit data before the surgical societies. They will in turn work with MHLW. MHLW may require them to solicit and collect data in Japan. That may involve a partial reimbursement for certain number of centers. If so, then that will start the process of data collection for a group of hospitals in Japan. How many and how many procedures concurrently, we don\u2019t have a resolution on yet, but as I said before, as we get closer to it we will share it with you.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Okay, thank you.","Gary Guthart","Okay, that was our last question. I would like to close with a letter we received this week from a surgeon and medical director at one of the U.S. academic centers. We talked about our finances and cash flow and so on but this sort of takes it back to what the value of our products is and so this came from a surgeon and medical director.","\"What you are doing is touching patients' lives. It\u2019s healing them and getting them better. You cannot put a price on curing some of their cancer and doing it with minimal change to their life. It is priceless. Let them inspire you to go ahead and continue the innovation to lead surgery in to the future. Patients are your partners in this endeavor. Sure everything can be refined and everything can be improved but you only get one chance sometimes to cure someone of their cancer. Your technology has given me a step up in that pursuit. Companies that help us change patients' lives will survive and prosper.\"","This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery and we look forward to talking with you again in three months.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference call over to our host, Senior Director of Finance, Mr. Calvin Darling. Please go ahead.","Calvin Darling","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Patrick Clingan, Director of Finance.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, included in our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 4, 2013, and our Form 10-Q filed on July 22, 2013.","These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's EDGAR database. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.","Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website.","Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our third quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session.","Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our fourth quarter financial results. Patrick will discuss marketing and clinical highlights and I will provide our financial outlook for 2014. Finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.","With that, I will turn it over to Gary.","Gary Guthart","Thank you for joining us on the call today. 2013 was a challenging year for Intuitive. Trends that emerged in the second quarter of 2013 continued through the balance of the year, including revenue uncertainties for United States customers due to pressure on gynecology surgery broadly, the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and confusion surrounding the public debate regarding some da Vinci procedures. These factors resulted in the slowing of our growth in gynecology and a subsequent decline in the sale of systems in the United States.","The year also featured several strengths in our business. Among them, the publication of several large studies supporting the clinical and economic value of da Vinci use. We also experienced the acceleration of procedure growth in Europe and Japan, broad based growth in general surgery procedures in the United States and continued adoption of our new products worldwide.","I will start with a review of procedures. Year-over-year growth in procedures closed at 16%, led by growing use of da Vinci in general surgery in the United States, accelerating growth in the use of da Vinci outside of the United States and continued uptick in U.S. gynecology. General surgery growth in the United States was 93% in the year, including increased use of da Vinci in colorectal surgery and cholecystectomy using da Vinci Single-Site and Firefly, as well as growth in other general surgery procedures.","In the fourth quarter, general surgery overtook urology as the second largest category of da Vinci use in the United States. Outside of the United States, procedure growth accelerated, rising 21% over procedures in 2012 based on strength in Europe and Japan. We will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call.","Looking at trends in capital sales for the year. Procedures deceleration in the United States freed capacity on already installed systems. Combined with a lack of visibility of revenue for our customers due to pressure on gynecologic surgery and Affordable Care Act, U.S. capital sales fell for the year. Outside of the United States, our capital business in Europe and Asia performed very well with international systems revenue growing 59% over 2012. Investments in Europe have yielded solid results and we expect to continue to grow our European team given the large opportunity we see for da Vinci use in several procedures and countries.","As we have mentioned on prior,calls sustained growth in our business in Japan depends upon approval for reimbursement for additional procedures, which is targeted for the 2016 revisions in national insurance coverage. Until additional procedure reimbursement is received in Japan, capital sales are likely to be constrained and to vary in timing. The combination of gynecology trends and the ACA implementation in the United States and uncertainty of future capital purchases in Japan creates difficulty in revenue forecast for at least the first half of 2014.","Calvin will take you through our view of 2014 later in the call. Our product launches proceeded well in 2013 and reflect the growing segmentation of our business. The combination of enabling technology, procedure opportunity and aligned economics is important. In the higher volume benign segment we serve, our Single-Site kit of instruments and accessories are being used increasingly for hysterectomy as well as cholecystectomy. We plan on rolling out our Single-Site kit for hysterectomy more broadly in 2014 and are working on a wristed, Single-Site needle driver to augment our existing offering. We anticipate submitting the wristed Single-Site needle driver 510(k) in the first half of 2014.","In 2013, we received a (inaudible) visualization indication for our Firefly Fluorescence Imaging Vision System in the third quarter, enabling enhanced visualization of anatomy during cholecystectomy. Firefly use in biliary imaging grew nicely in the fourth quarter.","Turning to products used for procedures typically performed through an open incision. Our focus has been on creating products that improve visualization, precision and control for surgeons performing these procedures. Taking colorectal surgery as an example, open colorectal surgery is hard on patients with high complication, morbidity, mortality, and readmission rates compared with minimally invasive surgery. We now offer colorectal surgeon the combination of wristed vessel sealing, wristed stapling and Firefly perfusion imaging. The combination of these technologies with the base capability of da Vinci's powerful and enabling minimally invasive colorectal surgery for a larger patient population.","Looking at each product individually. Our Vessel Sealer was cleared for use in Korea in Q3, in Japan in Q4 of 2013 and feedback from general surgeons and gynecologists has been positive. We are also pleased with the performance of our da Vinci Stapler in 2013. With outstanding feedback from customers on the clinical performance, ease-of-use and Smart Clamp feature, we expect most use of our current Stapler to be in colorectal procedures. We are currently expanding our rollout of the Stapler to general surgery customers in the United States.","A brief aside, you may have seen the press release yesterday Luna Innovations announcing our acquisition of their Shape-Sensing business for medical use. We have worked with Luna for several years and believe the sensing technology and the team that invented it, represent a foundation for new sites for new types of flexible mechanisms that can augment or expand our products. This is part of a long-term effort by Intuitive to innovate and reducing invasiveness in the access to the body and we do not expect it to materially impact our business in 2014.","Looking back at the full year 2013, our operating performance follows. Worldwide procedures grew by approximately 16%. We sold 546 da Vinci Surgical systems in the year, down from 620.","Total revenue grew to $2,265 billion, up 4% over 2012. Recurring revenue grew to 1,430 billion, up 15% and comprising 63% of total revenue. We generated $1,021 billion in operating profit before non-cash stock compensation expense, down 1% from last year.","GAAP net income grew to $671 million, up 2% year-over-year and we reduced our shares outstanding by repurchasing 2.6 million shares during 2013. Finally, we generated $880 million in cash flows from operations, ending the year with $2.8 billion in cash and investments.","Turning to our operating performance for the fourth quarter, procedures grew approximately 12% over the fourth quarter of last year. We sold 138 da Vinci Surgical systems, down from 175 in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Total revenue for the quarter was $576 million, down 5% from the prior year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $268 million, up 6%. We generated an operating profit of $250 million in the quarter before non-cash stock option expense, down 13% from the fourth quarter of last year and GAAP net income decreased to $166 million, down 5%.","In 2013, we opened two new technology training centers in the United States, one at our headquarters in Sunnyvale and the other in Atlanta. We ended the year with 2,792 members on our team and anticipate growing our organization in specific areas through 2014, with a particular emphasis on Asia and Europe.","For reviewing our priorities for authorities for 2014, I will take a moment to touch on our mission. In the face of near-term pressure and scrutiny, our commitment to our mission to fundamentally improve surgery remains unshaken.","Around the globe, surgery for many complex conditions still conducted through an open incision with serious risks of complications morbidity, mortality, readmission and prolonged recovery.","Despite their long availability, conventional MIS technologies are difficult to apply to some patient populations. And the advanced skills required to use them for complex procedures are hard to master. da Vinci has overcome these limitations of our targeted procedures with proven results.","Furthermore, today's minimally invasive surgery still leaves room for improvement in outcomes, predictability, recovery in economics. Taken together, these opportunities are the focus of our current and future product development efforts. Our team has weathered 2013 well and is fully engaged in the challenge of providing tools that improve the experience of surgery for those who need it.","Looking to 2014, our priorities are as follows. First, we will focus on the expanded use of da Vinci and general surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and single incision surgery. Second, we will support growth of da Vinci used in gynecology and urology worldwide. Third, we will broaden our stapling and Single-Site launches could find introduction of a wristed, Single-Site instrument and finally we will continue to strengthen our capabilities in international markets, particularly Europe and Japan.","Before passing the time over to Marshall, I would like to take a moment to thank Aleks Cukic for his outstanding service to this group. Aleks will continue to work with the company in an advisory capacity, but will no longer on these calls. We welcome Patrick Clingan for this role. Many of you know Patrick already and he has ably represented us.","With that, I turn the call over to Marshall. Who review financial highlights.","Marshall Mohr","Thank you, Gary. Our fourth quarter 2013 revenue and procedures were consistent with our press release issued on January 14th. Fourth quarter revenues were $576 million, down 5%, compared with $609 million for the fourth quarter 2012 and up 15% last quarter. Procedures for the fourth grew approximately 12%, compared with fourth quarter 2012, and approximately 8% compared with last quarter.","Procedure highlights will be covered by Patrick. Revenue highlights are as follows. Instrument and accessory revenue grew 6%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 and 12% compared to the third quarter of 2013. The increase relative to the prior year reflects procedure growth and sales of new products, including Single-Site, Vessel Sealer and Firefly, partially offset by lower instrument and accessory stocking orders associated with fewer system sales.","The change from quarter reflects procedure growth in the sales of new products. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including initial stocking orders was approximately $1,930 per procedure, compared with $2,050 in the fourth quarter of 2012 and $1,860 last quarter. The decrease in the prior year reflects fewer stocking orders associated with fewer system sales, partially offset by new product sales. The increase from the prior quarter primarily reflects new products sales and the timing of customer orders.","Systems revenue of $205 million decreased 23% compared with the fourth quarter of 2012 and increased 29% compared with the third quarter 2013. The decline in systems revenue primarily reflects fewer system sales in the U.S., partially offset by higher system sales outside of the U.S. In U.S., we sold 72 systems in the fourth quarter, compared with 133 systems in the fourth quarter of 2012 and 66 systems in the third quarter of 2013. The decline in U.S. system sales relative to the fourth quarter of 2012 reflects the impact of lower procedure growth, spending uncertainties associated with the Affordable Care Act and confusion surrounding the public debate regarding some da Vinci procedures.","The increase relative to the third quarter of 2013 reflect seasonality, and increased sales of our Si-e product. As benign condition procedures are becoming a larger portion of our procedure mix in the U.S., we are experiencing demand for lower-cost system for use and reimbursement of the benign conditions and patient settings. As a result, we sold 20 Si-e with prices between $1 million to $1.2 million, depending on the configuration.","Globally, our system ASP of $1,455,000 declined relative to the third quarter system ASP of $1,556,000. The decline reflects a higher portion of Si-e systems in the U.S. partially offset by geographic mix and a higher mix of dual console systems. In the fourth quarter, we sold 38 dual console systems compared with 32 systems in the third quarter. Outside the U.S., we sold 66 systems in the fourth quarter, including 28 in to Europe and 21 into Japan, compared with 42 in to international markets in the fourth quarter of 2012, which included 24 in Europe and 10 in Japan and 36 systems in international markets in the third quarter of 2013 which included 17 in to Europe and 13 in to Japan. Fourth quarter system sales also included eight into Korea, seven into Italy, five into France and seven into the Nordic countries.","Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the fourth quarter 2013 was 69.1% compared with 71.9% for the fourth quarter of 2012 and 71.5% for the third quarter of 2013. Our lower margin percentage reflects expensing certain system production cost in light of lower system unit production. Fourth quarter 2013 operating expenses of $189 million were approximately the same as the fourth quarter of 2012 and we are up 4% compared with last quarter. Our fourth quarter 2013 operating expense compared to 2012 operating expenses reflects headcount additions, offset by lower incentive compensation and lower R&D prototype expenses. Our increase compared to last quarter was driven by higher R&D prototype costs, severance costs and increased headcount partially offset by lower stock compensation cost.","Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.5% compared with 30.5% for the fourth quarter of 2012 and 12% last quarter. The third quarter of 2012 tax rate benefited from the release of reserves specific to tax years with the statute of limitations have now expired. The fourth quarter of 2013 rate benefited from a greater proportion of our pretax income coming from outside U.S. where our tax rates are lower.","Our net income was $166 million or $4.28 per share, compared with $175 million or $4.25 per share for the fourth quarter of 2012 and $157 million or $3.99 per share for the third quarter of 2013. Excluding one-time tax benefits, our third 2013 net income would have been $131 million, or $3.32 per share.","An important measure of our performance is cash flow from operations. We define cash flow from operations as net income, excluding after-tax, non-cash compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We will refer to this as non-GAAP net income.","For the fourth quarter 2013, we generated $193 million in non-GAAP net income or $4.98 per share, compared with $205 million or $4.99 per share for the fourth quarter 2012. The year ended December 31, 2013, we generated $795 million in non-GAAP net income, or $19.83 per share, compared with $777 million or $18.91 per share last year.","We will be providing the statistic to you going forward. We ended the year with cash and investments $2.8 billion, up $222 million compared with September 30, 2013. This increase was primarily driven by net cash provided by operating activities during the year. We repurchased 2.6 million shares for $1.1 billion at an average stock price of $429 per share.","As of December 31, we still have 1 billion of share buybacks authorized. With that, I would like to turn it over to Patrick to go over our marketing and clinical highlights.","Patrick Clingan","Thanks, Marshall. Q4 year-over-year procedure growth was approximately 12%, which was led by U.S. general surgery and international procedures. In the U.S. general surgery was paced cholecystectomy, colorectal resections in a wide variety of emerging procedures, reflecting the interest in da Vinci surgery among different specialties within general surgery.","U.S. urology continues to show signs of stabilization as modest declines in dVP or nearly offset by growth in treatment for kidney cancer. As expected, the growth rate for U.S. benign GYN procedures was down from Q3, which continued to place pressure on U.S. system sales.","Q4 international procedure growth of 23%, led by urology, with contributions with GYN and General surgery, dVP update in Europe and Japan was robust accelerating in the back of 2013.","During the fourth quarter, robust seller in fact 2013. During the fourth quarter. International dVP volume surpass U.S. dVP volumes despite representing approximately 30% penetration in key developed markets.","Earlier this month, the U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, published an update to its 2008 to 2000 clinical highlights on prostate cancer, which recommends consideration of robotic surgery in the treatment of prostate cancer. The recommendation also states that surgical treatments of localized prostate cancer are cost-effective by basing them in centers that are expected to perform 150 procedures per year.","As Gary mentioned, our U.S. customers are increasingly segmenting our business between less complex benign and complex for cancer procedures and we are pursuing strategy to realize the opportunities with the new segments.","The adoption of da Vinci surgery in less benign procedures has changed our procedure mix, growing from approximately 40% to approximately 60% of our U.S. procedures over the past three years.","In order to provide solutions for customers to address lower reimbursements and alternate types of care, we have launched products such as Single-Site and Si-e. Single-Site instruments are lower cost, enabling to offer the advantages of robotic surgery and the lower instrument price.","The addition wristed needle driver to the Single-Site product family will optimize this technology for additional procedures beginning with benign hysterectomy. Single-Site surgery provides an alternative to traditional approaches, for procedures that are being performed in a minimally invasive manner.","However, the push by robotic surgeons in the less complex benign procedures is not simply about patient choice, but the potential for safer outcomes. Following our September 5 10-K approval Firefly biliary imaging, we have witnessed acceleration in these options of Fluorescence Imaging during da Vinci cholecystectomy as firefly enabled visualization of the biliary. It cannot be the underlying life.","During the fourth quarter, Firefly was included on 80% of the U.S. Si-e system placements. While the available capacity on our existing installed base that served as a headwind to 2013 system sales. Not all capacity in the right location.","This industry-wide shift in surgeries from in-patient to outpatient setting has led some hospitals to pursue a robotic surgery in an outpatient setting. We believe our Si-e is suited to meet the needs of these hospitals.","At the other end of the spectrum, we believe the value proposition and evidence base supporting conversion of complex and cancer surgeries from open to MIS is growing increasingly clear. Traditional minimally invasive tools have attempted to make inroads in to these procedures for decades but the technical complexity and challenging patient anatomy has limited adoption. We believe da Vinci surgery represents an evolution in minimally invasive technology that can expand MIS more deeply into a number of traditionally open procedures.","Given the high value we bring to converting complex open surgery to MIS, we are seeing increased global interest in our fully featured systems and advanced instrumentation. Vessel sealing and stapling technologies are important tools for colorectal surgeons and with our Stapler entering full launch mode in the U.S., we believe we are well suited to drive adoption for colorectal resections. We believe there are more open colorectal resections and prostatectomy than malignant hysterectomy combined and we believe our vessel sealing, stapling and Firefly technologies bring a powerful array of tools to enable deeper penetration of MIS into colorectal surgery.","During the quarter, we continued to see growth in peer-reviewed publications, highlighting robotic surgery in a number of journals. I will take a moment to highlight just a few. Dr. Davis from MD Anderson authored a multi-institution database study in the December issue of Journal of Endourology evaluated over 71,000 plus technique patients from 2004 to 2010. This paper showed da Vinci surgery has a shorter hospital stay and lower rate of complications compared to open surgery, even for surgeons in their initial 25 procedures. We believe these outcomes reflect the value created by the totality of resources available for safely training surgeons on da Vinci.","Turning to GYN and specifically to benign hysterectomy. While near-term ACA implementation creates some uncertainty among our customers, this study supports that da Vinci surgery aligns with the underlying principles of healthcare reform. August and the October version of The Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology, Dr. Martino and colleagues from the Lehigh Valley Health Network presented results covering more than 2,500 benign hysterectomies, across all four surgical modalities, robotic, laparoscopic, vaginal and abdominal. The authors concluded that da Vinci benign hysterectomy had a statistically significantly lower rate of 30-day readmission as well as reduced blood loss and length of stay compared to the other three modalities of care.","Moving back to urology. A national database study of approximately 5,500 prostatectomy patients published by Dr. Polecki [ph] of Northwestern in the November Journal of Endourology. This study reported statistically significant results for robotic surgery, including a total complication rate of 6% da Vinci versus 23% for open surgery, a surgical complication rate of 1% for da Vinci versus 3% for open surgery, and readmission rate of 3.5% for da Vinci versus 5.5% for open surgery. These results came at cost of an additional 38 minutes of operative time for da Vinci.","Finally, we will conclude with the largest national database study on colon resection. Originated from Dr. Juo and colleagues at Johns Hopkins, they studied 244,000 U.S. surgeries from in 2008 to 2010. This paper published in the December edition of JAMA showed minimally invasive colon resections offered lower mortality rates, lower complication rate, shorter length of stay and reduced cost compared to open surgery. Robotic surgery represents less than 1% of the colectomies performed in this dataset. When comparing the smaller cohort to laparoscopy, there were two statistically significant outcomes in favor of robotics, reduced hospital stay and lower conversion rate, while cost statistically significantly favored laparoscopy. The authors concluded that robotic surgery was similar to laparoscopy with a higher cost but noticed that less than 50% of colon resections within this study were performed laparoscopy in 2010.","The authors could not include rectal resections in this study which are notably absent given the proportion of open surgery. We encourage you look closely at the underlying data and consider the opportunity for da Vinci surgery to expand MIS for colon resections as adoption grows among colorectal surgeon. Please visit the clinical evidence section of our website to learn more about these and other publications regarding the da Vinci surgery.","Thank you for your time and I will now turn the call over to Calvin.","Calvin Darling","Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our financial outlook for 2014. Starting with procedures. In 2013, total da Vinci procedures grew approximately 16% to roughly 523,000 procedures performed worldwide. We exited 2013 with fourth quarter procedures up approximately 12% versus the prior year.","During 2014, we anticipate a stabilization of the procedure growth rate with the full year procedures growing within a range of approximately 9% to 12%. Based on an increasing proportion of benign procedures in our procedure mix, we anticipate a more pronounced quarterly seasonality impact in the upcoming first quarter 2014.","Moving to revenues, as has been discussed earlier, several factors are pressuring our business, making it difficult in the near-term for us to predict system sales volumes, and as a consequence, total revenue. As we enter 2014, our visibility into system sales is challenged by the breadth of the range of our procedure growth forecast.","As a reminder, procedures drive capital sales and the relationship between procedure growth rates and capital sales is highly sensitive. Economic pressure and uncertainty at hospital associated with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, evolving utilization patterns and point-of-care dynamics as described by Patrick earlier in the call and likely variability and the timing of Japan, system sales given the time until additional procedure reimbursement anticipated in 2016.","Given our capital sales performance in the back half of 2013, and the persistence of some of the issues described above, it is likely that we will sell fewer systems and 2014 in the 546 systems sold in 2013. Due to limited visibility regarding the capital side of our business, we will not be providing revenue forecast at this time.","As we gain greater visibility, it is our intention to reinstate revenue guidance. We believe deeply in our ability to fundamentally improve surgery and are pursuing plans to increase the use of da Vinci-enabled MIS around the globe. As a result, 2014 will be a year of increased investment for Intuitive Surgical, even during this upcoming period of capital sales uncertainty. We will be building our international capabilities, investing in new product development and pursuing growth in both of our procedures businesses' segments.","In 2014, we plan to grow our operating expenses roughly 12% to 15% above 2013 levels. We expect our non-cash stock compensation to range between $180 million and $190 million in 2014, compared to $169 million in 2013. We expect other income which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $15 million and $20 million in 2014.","With regard to income tax, we expect our 2014 income tax rate to be between 25% and 28% of pre-tax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. This forecast does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2014.","Our share count for calculating diluted EPS in Q4 2013 was approximately 38.8 million shares, declining 500,000 shares in the quarter, primarily due to the full quarter impact of Q3 buybacks. Our actual Q1 and fiscal year 2014 share count will depend on several factors, including the magnitude and timing of any additional share buybacks.","That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Tao Levy with Wedbush.","Tao Levy -Wedbush","Hi. Good afternoon. A couple of questions on my end, obviously, the decision not to provide full year guidance leads us a little bit I guess not necessarily confused, but struggling to figure out where our number should end up this year especially given all the volatility. Would you maybe comment on the comfort that you feel around sort of where the consensus is that at this moment of your top line or do you stay away from that type of guidance?","Gary Guthart","Not clear where consensus will wind up, so I think try and project where that will go and I think it's probably not worth speculating on the call.","I think we laid out the underlying dynamics that have produced near-term visibility through the script pretty well and if we had greater visibility on that, we would share it with you. I think that the looking out at what the in-patient admissions will be for the benign procedures we serve and what those dynamics will be has been moving around looking at how hospitals model their revenues in the face of ACA in that benign segment that we operate in and then trying to predict what Japan will do. We have an operating plan. We understand where we are going. We are disciplined about what we expected to do in terms of activity, but this is a wide range and so rather than speculate, I think this is where we are.","Tao Levy -Wedbush","Okay, and I think at the beginning of the script, you had mentioned that there is more concern around first half of the year, specifically on capital system placements. Is this something that happens at the middle of the year, back half of the year that would get you more comfortable?","Gary Guthart","I don't think its an advance. I think its more around as we see how patient flows are going to our customers, although they will have a better view and as their view improves, our view improves. I think it is really as simple as that.","Tao Levy -Wedbush","Okay, and just lastly, anyway you can talk about level of their profitability of Si-e system versus the Si given that that's becoming a bigger part of your mix? Thank you.","Gary Guthart","Well, I will as Marshall to take you through a little bit of what framing looks like and my only comment before he jumps in is, beware of averaging. There is now multiple products in the line and the average is not necessarily predictive of what's going on underneath.","Marshall Mohr","So just as I said in the call, the average pricing that we receive for Si-e's was between about $1 million, $1.2 million depending on the configuration that's obviously lower than an Si with four arms. The Si-e does only have three arms and so it does not cost the same amount of money to produce. The gross margins are several points below. It is six, seven points below what they are for Si systems. It's able to open benign procedures for us. It is clearly an outpatient settings, we are upward.","Tao Levy -Wedbush","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will go to the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just following up on the last one. What should we be thinking about in terms of a run rate for Si-e placements and maybe could you also discuss on your pricing assumptions that you are thinking about for '14 overall?","Gary Guthart","So we really have, if you go back, we sold three in the first quarter, two in the second quarter, two in the third quarter and then we sold 21 total. There are 20 in U.S., 21 total. To me, that's one quarter of success in selling it to customers that are looking for a lower cost system for benign conditions. I think I don't have enough data to really predict exactly how many we will be selling every quarter. So I am not going to go there.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Okay, and then can you comment on your pricing assumptions for '14?","Marshall Mohr","Yes. I assume you mean the system pricing assumptions, and like Gary said, here it is really important to be aware of the averages. If you look at it overall, our ASP was about $1.5 million in both the full year of 2012 and 2013 and in Q4 our ASP declines to $1.455 million as we saw this significant increase in the lower-priced three arm Si-e's. As you know, these Si-e's are targeted towards a growing procedures segment of Single-Site and less complex procedures and in 2014 we will remain focused on ongoing these procedure category with more Si-e system sales but also as was mentioned at the same time, the proportion of the higher featured dual console and Firefly systems also increased in 2013 and furthermore the systems that went to Japan's in strong numbers were higher. So I guess the point of it is, now going forward the ASPs will potentially vary more significantly quarter-to-quarter based upon this broader pricing mix and I will just fall short of trying to guess which way it is going to go.","Gary Guthart","One comment I guess I would add for a little clarity there. I don't think with any sub-segment, the ASPs are going to fluctuate that much. It's a mix of those sub-segments that makes it predictive.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Okay. That's helpful. Then on Japan, it sounds like we should assume that you had a replacements here and that's going to slow a little bit. Is that the right way to be thinking about it for '14?","Gary Guthart","The timing of it is very hard to predict, but we have '14 and '15 before the next round of a broad national reimbursement. There may be hospitals that get individual redemptions to collect data, but broadly, there will be some time and so figuring out how much absorption there will be in Japan over that two-year period as it's just very hard to model, so looks likely it's hard to predict, but over time. I think it's going to be constrained and so directionally, I do not think you will keep selling systems at a very high rate and so that constraint is broken with reimbursement.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Last one you talked about, we are having to reinvest it this year, you had a small headcount reduction at the end of last year. Should we be thinking about headcount being up and talk - if you look at more specifically if you can on where those investments are being made? You need to build the channel ambulatory markets for example.","Gary Guthart","Good question, so we had a small reduction in our U.S. Sales force at the end of the year. It was about 50 people just for those who maybe listening to the haven heard this conversation. We had a team that had grown that was layered on top of our main course design to pursue gynecology. As gynecology has matured in the U.S. they were in essence double serving those accounts, so we hold them back into the main force, but that's was 50 out of a commercial force of about [800].","We anticipate growing forward in the year in a few places. Europe, we continue to see investment in our organization there. In Asia, more broadly we will invest in that opportunity and in our channel there. In the U.S., in product development, we will continue investments and other parts of operations.","I think headcount growth will continue through the year. I won't be a sharp increase, but I think that it will be targeted where we needed.","With regard to how we discuss opportunities with hospital customers in terms of standard of care. we think our capital sales team is well positioned to start the year here to have those conversations.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will move to the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Thank you and good afternoon. I also wanted to point out that it's very helpful all the disclosure you are giving on the website now it takes time to add that all together, so thank you for that.","My question I wanted to just take a step back for a second if you look at the overall U.S. market and what transpired this year. I guess in some ways when I look at the trending capital that this could have - this could have happened to any point in time as procedures slow, what I am trying to reconcile that you had a modest slowing in procedure volumes, but a very significant drop off in capital, so I am just wondering if you could talk about why we should think of is overcapacity in the and that you have penetrated just a large segment of the addressable market here and there is going to be sort of a normalization period until procedure volume picks backup.","Gary Guthart","Let me start and Calvin, you can jump in. I think a couple of things to know underlying capital sales are really three factors and U.K. and a couple, but one of them is procedure capacity and that's a highly sense development so that just a percent change in procedure growth rate can free about 20 worth capacity give or take not on an exact number, so there is a high sensitivity there since capacity is highly sensitive to the growth rate. That's one element.","Second element is, do hospital customers feel they have the right technologies to pursue the opportunity that's in front of them, so if they have enough system and they want to pursue colorectal or Single-Site, then there is an upgrade opportunities for them to move up and Si.","Then Patrick pointed out in section that not always this is not always in the same awkward so that if hospitals are doing benign procedures in a different point ambulatory surgery environment. It is not the same sort of aura, so while they have capacity in one place, it's not necessarily in the right place and so those three things are underlying, what happens and one of them sensitive procedure volume. The other two one sensitive technology one is point-of-care. Calvin?","Calvin Darling","Yes. I mean I don't have much to add to that other than just to acknowledge that prior to 2013, we had really a longstanding history of gradually increasing utilization per system and it is true that based upon the issues that we described, we had a modest decrease in utilization, average utilization. Again, be aware of averages in 2013, but again capacity is really just one of the factors involved in system acquisitions by hospitals.","Gary Guthart","To finish the thought to acknowledge your question, I think procedures are the number one. Of the three things, procedures are very important and procedure growth rate is important and it's something we are focused on.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Okay, that's helpful. Then maybe just a follow-up. As you are think about the operating profile of the business from a profitability standpoint, I know you have talked a lot about being focused on topline growth and while your margins have come down they are still very high, particularly on a cash basis, so can you maybe just talk about how you are thinking about P&L leverage versus efforts you are undertaking to re-stimulate topline growth? I would assume that at this point, resumption of topline growth is the priority and that you have financial levers to help protect earnings? Or am I not thinking about that the right way?","Gary Guthart","I will start and Marshall can chime in. I think the first thing is, we will manage the business for the long-term and we will look around and say, the mission of the company and the way we ought to be evaluated is, are we satisfying the mission of improving surgery in the areas and markets that we can do that and I think there's a lot of opportunity for us and we will pursue that. Fiscal discipline is important and I think it's important in two ways.","One is, spending discipline is important to make sure that we are careful about where we spend. And investment discipline is important. In this period of time we will invest. We will invest in a disciplined way but we think that the opportunity ahead of the company to make surgery better is substantial and we are in a great position to do it and I think pulling back that set of investments in the face of some near term uncertainty would not be in the long term interest of the company.","So that's how we look at it. In terms of operating levers, they are sort of near term and long term and I will let Marshall talk to that.","Marshall Mohr","Some operating levers, they operate on their own. What I mean by that is commission, a large portion of our cost base is variable. It varies with revenue. So even in the SG&A category, a large portion is commission based and so as revenue fluctuates so does the amount of costs that we have but otherwise, I think Gary outlined, that some of the other things. I think that we have some levers but we are going to continue to invest in our future.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","I got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will go to the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair.","Margaret Kaczor - William Blair","Good afternoon, guys. It's actually Margaret this time. Thanks for taking my questions. Gary, as we look at the opportunity in colorectal in 2014 and as you kind of look at the current system and the current tool set, do you think that can get you to the procedure growth guidance that at least you are modeling internally, if not giving to us?","Then how do you view the rate of penetration in general surgery over the next several years and 2014? Is it going to be similar to dVP, dVH or slower? Any clarity would be helpful?","Gary Guthart","I will speak to the first one. The second question has a few moving parts. On the first one, we think that the set of Vessel Sealer, Stapler. As you know, Stapler has a whole marketplace. It is quite broad in terms of the number of sub-products in the stapling family. Our first offering is targeted at colorectal and the feedback on that has been great and then perfusion imaging with Firefly. Those three things together combined with da Vinci is really powerful and a great staring point.","It will not be the last set of things we do in general surgery, but we think it's powerful and I think that it is in a good position to power the growth that we are seeing in colorectal surgery here and then later in the markets outside the United States. In terms of what that looks like for total colorectal as a whole, I think we are early in the adoption but I think we will have a real opportunity for growth there.","You had said how do we think about general surgery growth rates as a whole, and I will give you one framework that I think is important. We have gynecology and urology as precedents. In urology, prostatectomy was really the lead procedure and there are just a few procedures that followed it, kidney cancer treatment in partial nephrectomy, bladder cancer treatment in cystectomy. So it's not a huge broad set. Gynecology is little bit broader but hysterectomy was really the leading growth engine and then some other procedures behind it, myomectomy and sacral colpopexy, pelvic reconstruction.","General surgery does not quite have that same structure. There are subspecialties that are quite broad. So you have colorectal subspecialty. You have foregut procedures. You have bariatric surgery. What the folks do in academic centers is quite different than what they do in community centers. So the category, as a whole, is going to be the sum of adoptions in different places. The sum of adoption in Single-Site, the sum of adoption in colorectal and those are a really different.","Single-Site is largely done in community settings, cholecystectomies are, colorectal procedures are largely concentrated in cancer hospitals and so those different growth rates, they differ. How they add up? I think is a little bit hard to predict.","Patrick or Calvin, anything you would like to add?","Margaret Kaczor - William Blair","Is there something on the learning curve that can maybe speed that up as you come out with kind of new add-ons toolsets and so on to help drive general surgery?","Gary Guthart","I think that the new instruments that we are bringing in, I think the broadening of the launch of Stapling and the use of Firefly, those are enabling technologies. They speed the efficiency of the procedure, they allow a better workflow so I think that's helpful. The investments we have made in our training centers are really to make for easy access for learnings surgeons that have access to resources and I think that's been a good investment for us and that can help the investments we have made in simulation and access to simulation are other things that I think help.","We are really happy and feel that the data study is important in showing that the totality of learning resources for surgeons. It's not just what Intuitive does, what Proctors do, what advanced [work] does, has resulted in great and safe adoption of new technology, and I think that's a powerful message and likely to be repeated in other disciplines beyond just prostatectomy.","Margaret Kaczor - William Blair","Okay, then on the gynecology side. You guys are clearly, fairly well penetrated in hysterectomy and kind of some of the other ancillary procedures and the phacos, so how should we think about that as a category now that it's over 50% penetrated? Should it materially slow in 2014? Gradual changes and then could Single-Site actually become quickly material? Thanks.","Gary Guthart","Fair question. I think, and you know this well, I know your team knows this well. Once you are on these adoption curves, the year-over-year growth rate falls, that's just the nature of those adoption curves","On the multi-port side, I would expect that it continues in the U.S. but there is a continued deceleration the pace of which will be hard to predict and we will see.","Single-Site hysterectomy is an opportunity. We are early in that opportunity, we have been in limited launch. The limited launch has gone very well clinically and it's gone really well from uptake in the way surgeons who are being trained have adopted it. We are adding some instruments into that kit, bringing back some listed instruments that will we think optimize the procedure and give surgeons a little more flexibility in approaching tissue and we are working through those things.","I think that's a well known pathway for us and we think that will help. That's still early. We are not into a full very broad launch there. Although we have broadened the launch from its early days, really starting in the fourth quarter and continuing through here, so I think that launch will open up through the year Single-Site hysterectomy and we will continue to report on it to you as to how we progress.","Calvin Darling","I would just add, we still feel we have a significant opportunity here in Women's health, specifically hysterectomy on the more complex multi-port side. There are over 100,000 women now are still having open hysterectomies in the United States, so we think our technology can improve their outcomes.","Then we are very early on the less complex side, on our Single-Site offering where there is something like 200,000 laparoscopic in vaginal procedures that perhaps you would have a place there.","Margaret Kaczor - William Blair","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will go to the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Can you hear me okay?","Gary Guthart","We can.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Great. Just a couple on the guidance. I heard your comments about operating expenses for the year, but I was wondering if you had any comments on gross margins, both as it relates to 2014, and then given some of the changes in the customer mix longer term, just any longer-term thoughts on gross margin as well? Again for '14 and then longer term any thoughts on gross margin?","Gary Guthart","Yes. I think you saw in the fourth quarter there were some points there were mentioned first off, the margin the gross margin was impacted by lower production volumes which, when you divide some of the manufacturing cost by fewer units of production, that has a negative impact on margin, and so you saw that. Could that be a continuing headwind to some extent I would say yes.","Beyond that, you come down to some of the product mix discussions on gross margin that I think, we are not predicting how much is going to be Si-e versus four arm Si. Geographic, I think it's too many moving parts to make a prediction there on that.","Gary Guthart","I think you would ask kind of a longer-term question, directionally how do we think about it. And I think as we look at the opportunities and we talk about segmentation of the business, we want to match the clinical and technical capability of the products we bring, the procedure opportunity and the underlying economics of those procedures together. We think we have opportunities to do that and we think it's really in the best interest of the company to do it. I think we can get to an attractive margin profile in both segments. Some of that is near term and some of that is long-term in terms of investments and products. So we will do that.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Then on the decision on the revenue guidance, or lack thereof, for 2014, I just want to ask a little bit about that, because you guys have always been so adamant about saying that system sales are driven by procedure volume and you are willing to give procedure volume numbers, but not some thoughts on system sales. So I am wondering, if there is anything sort of different in that relationship going forward. In other words, we have historically assumed that utilization just has to go up and that's the way we have tried to predict your system sales. Is there something unique about 2014 that would cause that relationship to bifurcate further? Do we need to assume much greater utilization than we have been seeing in the past in terms of increases and again, just want to ask about that, because you guys have been so adamant about the correlation.","Gary Guthart","I will just maybe start. Two ways to think about it. I think the first one is, the range and procedure guidance is pretty broad relative to the base and because system placements are sensitive to that range, that's a multiplier on the uncertainty. That's one.","The second is that, it may be that utilization trends differ over time just because of point of care, as Patrick had mentioned pretty clearly, and because hospitals may look out and say I want greater capital utilization of what I have got, and I am willing to make some compromises and convenience to get that.","We may see those two different things that work against each other and so how that plays out. What I would say on that second half is that, those changes are unlikely to switch on a dime, because they are operational in nature. You have to move, you have to adjust hospital operations to make it happen. So that may happen, but I don't think that happens the day after tomorrow. I think that's something that would play out in time.","Patrick Clingan","To add to what Gary said, you are right. We do believe that procedures will drive systems in the long-term. So there's going to be short-term fluctuations in capital sales, but overall long-term, in mature markets you are going to see capital sales will catch up over time. Having said that, in nascent markets like Japan, which also causes our overall utilization statistic to fluctuate, we are selling systems ahead of procedures and so that one's more difficult to predict.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","And then lastly, you guys have again talked about the opportunity for outpatient, more benign type procedures. Can you just help us think about how big of an opportunity that might be for the company? I assume today your sales into outpatient surgery centers and centers like that are pretty minimal. So have you guys given much thought to how big an opportunity that might be?","Gary Guthart","As always, we start with procedures and work our way back rather than thinking about outpatient operating rooms and work our way forward. So Calvin or Patrick can speak to it.","Patrick Clingan","Yes. So if you look at where most of these outpatient surgeries are performed, it's in a hospital outpatient setting. So either within the four walls of the hospital or in an adjacent ambulatory care facility, but the predominance of them are in fact channels as opposed to the physician owned freestanding facilities.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Thank you.","Gary Guthart","We have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Good afternoon. Thanks for fitting me in. Gary, I wonder if you could just talk qualitatively about procedures in 2014. I am assuming the two biggest dynamics driving procedure deceleration is one, obviously still very rapid growth in general surgery but maybe slowing off of a large base and then hysterectomy, it's deceleration or stabilization. I wonder, if just very broadly you could help us understand those two buckets? Can general surgery hold its growth rate trend line based on a further or broader launch in minimum invasive in colon rectal? And do you expect dVH to hold its trend line, slightly decelerate or potentially even improve in 2014?","Gary Guthart","Yes, I will start with hysterectomy. I think that the underlying disease state is not changing in the U.S. I don't see any rapid change there.","I think the set of treatments that are being offered are also not changing very much. What we seem to be seeing change is payor behavior and kind of patient decision making with that payor behavior and so it's a little bit hard to predict what that will look like, but over time and I think any of the three possibilities you outlined is possible.","I think, I look out and Calvin mentioned it as well. There are 100,000 or so open procedures being done. For women in United States for hysterectomy, many of whom are great candidates for proven safer, minimally invasive procedure and yet they are getting open procedures and that is an opportunity, so if that patient population comes in and has an opportunity then that would be a positive and an upside.","The other possible upside is of course single incision, Single-Site hysterectomy as that kit rolls out further and we augment it, so those are possible upsides. How payor behavior changes through the year? What some of the patient decision-making looks like? That's a little bit harder to predict.","On the general surgery side, as you know the adoption rates are always year-over-year growth rates and adoption curve always highest in the beginning and then they decline over time. As the base grows, it's absolutely a natural progression.","The speed of that I think is going to depend on procedure-by-procedure. What is the total available market for single incision cholecystectomy, that's an estimate. Everybody would look at that and try to figure it out. It's not a clear substitution against another one that's just sitting there, so we will see what that looks like.","Colorectal, I think, we feel really good about. You look at colorectal and we bring a huge amount of value there.","Cholecystectomy, patient enthusiasm, surgeon commitment, training and growth in those procedures has been really encouraging, and the last thing is that general surgery has been growing beyond those two into some other things and we will let them evolve for a couple of quarters, but I think that will be interesting to see where else general surgeons take the opportunity in the technology and it looks to be broader than just those two. Overall, I think our feeling is, we could bring a lot of value to general surgery is high.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Gary, just one quick one on, just so I understand the Si-e, I mean that's system.","Gary Guthart","Make it a quick one.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","This is going to be very quick and I promise even for me. The Si-e it's been available for a while, but it sounds like there is sort of growing enthusiasm, so I am trying to understand that trend line has been relatively stable which is the hard to understand, just obviously because this year larger capitals under pressure, so is the situation with Si-e, you now see better positioning in ambulatory care market, had there been upgrades to that system or is it simply going to be a corporate focus on the Si-e heading into 2014. I am just trying to figure out what's changing relatively given this system has been available. Thank you.","Gary Guthart","Yes. Good question, so short answer, combination of a couple of things. The Single-Site instrument kit is both, procedurally adopted to a three-arm system, it's also priced right for that set of procedures. Then Firefly adding into that is a nice mix together that gives kind of a fully capable system to do those things in an ambulatory setting, so I think those combinations bought together helped and I think an organizational alignment around describing the value of that also helps, so that's how we have gotten where we are.","Thank you for the question. That was our last question. As we have said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organization focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma.","I hope you are following segment of an editorial by Dr. Tim Wilson, Chief of the Division of Urology and Neurologic Oncology, at the City of Hope Cancer Center gives you some sense of what this means to da Vinci surgeons and their patients.","\"In this era of health care reform, policymakers, hospitals and providers are all evaluating ways to reduce the overall cost burden to society while improving the quality outcomes for patients. Often lost in the debate is the need for investment in technologies that can help mitigate the significant cost drivers of health care. Robotic-assisted surgery is a game-changing technology in medicine yet it is deeply misunderstood and often dismissed as just another expensive tool for driving costs up. This could not be farther from the truth.","The cost of that technology has to be compared with the alternative cost of treatment. Displacing large abdominal incisions that have complications, high rates of death, blood loss, higher risk of infection and higher length of hospital stay is a good investment and aligns with the goals of health care reform.","Medicine needs innovation, but usually is slow to change. Decades ago, the same criticisms of robotic surgery plagued laparoscopy. It was expensive, unproven and not safe. To-date, more than 2.1 million da Vinci surgeries have been performed worldwide with an extremely low death rate, a declining rate of adverse events, and a growing body of clinical evidence that demonstrates safety, effectiveness and an ability to reduce both costs and complications of open surgery. As a surgeon who has performed thousands of procedures, including open, manual laparoscopic and robotic-assisted urologic cancer surgeries, I believe robotic-assisted surgery is the kind of technological disruption that truly will reform health care.\"","The improvements in surgery described by Dr. Wilson drive our team and form the foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference.","This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery and we look forward to talking with you again in three months."],"12673":["Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I\u2019ll now turn the conference over to Senior Director of Finance and Investor Relations, Calvin Darling. Please go ahead, sir.","Calvin Darling","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive Surgical\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call. With me today we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Patrick Clingan, Vice President of Finance and Sales Operations.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today\u2019s call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 6, 2016. These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC\u2019s EDGAR database. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.","Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today\u2019s press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website.","Today\u2019s format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter\u2019s business and operational highlights; Marshall will provide a review of our first quarter financial results; Patrick is rejoining us to discuss procedure and clinical highlights; then I will provide our updated financial outlook for 2017; and finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Gary.","Gary Guthart","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on the call today. This first quarter of 2017 was a dynamic one for Intuitive, with strong performance in procedures and solid growth in system placements. We are making good progress in developing deeper connections to our customers worldwide and advancing technologies and offerings that fundamentally improve surgery.","Procedure growth accelerated in the quarter rounding up to 18% over the first quarter of 2016. The growth was broad-based by procedure category, as well as global region. Starting with the United States, procedure growth in both the emerging category of general surgery and more mature categories in neurology and gynecology exceeded our expectations.","General surgery growth continues to be encouraging with order of early clinical reports, surgeon interest, and utilization. Procedure growth in Europe, Korea, and China were strong in the quarter. While reasons for quarter-to-quarter fluctuations can be hard to assess, we estimate that Q1 benefited from some tailwinds that will balance out through the remainder of the year.","Patrick will take you through these factors in more detail later in the call. Our capital placement performance in Q1 2017 strengthened over Q1 of 2016, resulting in a growth in total placements from a 110 to 133 this quarter.","As we mentioned on these calls, capital placements can be lumpy, and after a strong 2016, U.S. capital placement settled into moderate growth relative to Q1 of last year. Outside the U.S. placement growth in the quarter was a highlight with 56 systems sold in the quarter versus 36 in Q1 of 2016. The lack of a new system quota in China and limited reimbursements in Japan constrained placement growth in these regions, Marshall will take you through system placement dynamics in greater detail.","Turning to profitability for the quarter, strong procedure growth and solid system placements combined with favorable product mix and improvements in product cost to lead to gross margins at the top of our expected range and solid operating margin performance. Our fixed cost growth was as expected, with significant increases in R&D spending that reflect investments and bringing new products through clinical trials on the path to market.","A summary of our first quarter pro forma operating results was as follows. Procedures grew proximately 18% over the first quarter of last year. We shipped 133 da Vinci Surgical Systems up from a 110 in the first quarter of 2016. Revenue for the quarter was $674 million, up 13% from the prior year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $381 million, up 18%.","Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $521 million, representing 77% of total revenue. Gross profit margin was 72% compared to 70% in the first quarter of last year. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $264 million in the quarter, up 15% from the first quarter of last year, and pro forma net income was $196 million, up 15% from Q1 of 2016. In the quarter, we also entered into a stock repurchase agreement in the amount of $2 billion. Marshall will take you through our finances in greater detail shortly.","Turning to our product pipeline, as you know, we\u2019ve increased our mid and long-term investments in creating our next-generation of products and services. Based on our belief that substantial opportunity exists to enable more minimally invasive surgery, better outcomes, and to expand access to our technologies globally. To bring these investments to market, we have developed a product pathway that responds to our customer\u2019s desire for choice in clinical capability and choice in total economics.","Over the next several quarters, we plan to launch a new technology upgrade to Si, named da Vinci X that enables a compelling entry point to our advanced technologies. da Vinci Xi will remain our flagship and we will provide customers with logical upgrade paths for more affordable entry-level systems like Si and X to Si and Sp.","We have submitted our documents for CE Mark review for X and anticipate it will be available in Europe in the second quarter, with clearances in other regions following over time. We\u2019ll provide you with additional information on X as it launches. The upcoming availability of da Vinci X has some accounting implications, which Marshall will describe in greater detail later in the call.","Our Sp program continues to progress in its clinical trial work and new site initiation. Cases at our active trial site in Asia have included transoral, urologic and colorectal surgery. We\u2019re also on track in initiating our U.S. IDE sites to gather clinical data in transoral surgery. In reviewing feedback from surgeons in Asia and the latest standards for human factors validations, we have elected to pull forward a software release for Sp ahead of our urology 510(k).","This will pushback our urology 510(k) submission into the back-half of 2017 and it\u2019s likely to delay launch of Sp in the U.S. by one or two quarters. While I\u2019m disappointed by the delay, we believe this simplifies our submission and our ultimate path to market.","In our flexible robotics program, we completed our first clinical experience in Australia in the quarter. Surgeon commentary on its performance has been enthusiastic. There are finishing patient follow-up and preparing their manuscript for publication. The overall program is now in its design for pilot production phase.","In closing, the first quarter of 2017 has been a busy one for Intuitive. We remain focused on the following for the balance of the year: first, continued adoption of da Vinci in general surgery; second, continued development of European markets and access to customers in Asia; third, advancing our new platform, imaging advanced instruments, da Vinci Sp, and diagnostic platform progress; and finally, support for additional clinical and economic validation by global region.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marshall who will review financial highlights.","Marshall Mohr","Thank you, Gary. I would describe our results in a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes specified legal settlements and claim accruals, stock-based compensation, excess tax benefits related to employee stock awards, and amortization of purchased IP.","We provide pro forma information, because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro-forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website, so that there is no confusion.","First quarter 2017 revenue was $674 million, an increase of 13% compared with $595 million for the first quarter of 2016, and a decrease of a 11% compared with the fourth quarter revenue of $757 million.","As Gary outlined, we\u2019ll be launching da Vinci X system in certain markets pending appropriate regulatory clearances. In conjunction with the launch, we will offer customers who purchased systems in the first quarter the opportunity to upgrade, or trade out their systems for the X system. As a result, we deferred $23 million of fist quarter revenue and consistent with prior deferral, this revenue will be recognized when customers either trade out their systems, or when the offers expire, whichever comes first.","First quarter 2017 procedures increased nearly 18% compared with the first quarter of 2016, and increased 2% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth relative to last year and the fourth quarter has been driven by general surgery in the U.S. and urology worldwide, and reflects the benefit of Easter Holiday being in the second quarter of 2017 rather than the first quarter of 2016. Patrick will provide more detail concerning procedure adoption.","Revenue highlights are as follows. Instrument and accessory revenue of $381 million increased 18% compared with last year and decreased 1% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, which closely reflects procedure growth. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders was approximately $1,840 per procedure compared with $1,830 last year and $1,900 last quarter.","The increase relative to the first quarter of 2016, primarily reflects increased sales of our stapling and vessel sealing products, mostly offset by customer buying patterns. The decrease compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily reflects the impact of customer buying patterns.","System revenue of $153 million, which excludes the revenue deferred in conjunction with the customer trade-out program increased 4% compared with the first quarter of 2016 and decreased 35% compared with last quarter. The year-over-year increase reflects higher system placements and higher lease buyout and operating lease revenue, partially offset by the revenue deferral and lower average selling prices.","The quarter-over-quarter decrease reflects seasonally lower number of systems, the revenue deferral, and lower average selling prices, partially offset by higher lease related revenue. 133 systems replaced in the first quarter of 2017 compared with 110 systems in the first quarter of 2016 and 163 systems last quarter. 21 systems were placed under operating these transactions in the current quarter compared with 19 systems in the first quarter of 2016, and 13 last quarter. As a reminder, revenue on operating lease transactions is recognized ratably over the lease \u2013 life of the lease.","As of the end of the first quarter, there were 95 systems up in the field under operating leases. We generated approximately $5 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter, compared with $4 million in the first quarter of 2016, and approximately $5 million last quarter. We generated approximately $10 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with $6 million in the first quarter of 2016, and $7 million last quarter.","Globally, our average selling price, which excludes the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts and revenue deferrals was $1.46 million compared with $1.5 million last year and $1.48 million last quarter. The decrease in ASP compared to the fourth quarter primarily reflects geographic mix. The decrease compared to last year primarily reflects a higher proportion of Si refurbished systems sold to cost-sensitive market segments. We expect lower price systems to be \u2013 to cost-sensitive market segments to represent an increasing proportion of our sales in the future.","Service revenue of $140 million increased 13% year-over-year and increased approximately 4% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect growth in our installed base of da Vinci systems.","Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. First quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $183 million increased 12% compared with $164 million for the first quarter of 2016 and decreased 14% compared with $212 million for the fourth quarter. Recurring revenue increased 23% compared to previous year and 5% compared with the fourth quarter, reflecting procedure growth, partially offset by customer buying patterns.","Systems revenue decreased 9% compared with the first quarter of 2016 and decreased 39% compared with the previous quarter. The decrease in OUS systems revenue relative to both the prior year and the prior quarter reflect lower system ASPs, reflecting sales of Si refurbished product to cost-sensitive market segments, revenue deferrals, operating leases fixed in the current quarter versus none in the prior year and two in the prior quarter, geographic mix, and changes in the number of systems placed.","Outside the U.S., we placed 56 systems in the quarter compared with 36 in the first quarter of 2016, and 63 systems last quarter. The decrease in the system \u2013 in system placements relative to the prior quarter, primarily reflects seasonality. The increase in system placements relative to the prior year reflects higher sales into Europe, Korea, and India.","Current quarter system placement included 21 into Europe, seven into Korea, six into India, six in Japan, and two into China. System placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy, as some of the OUS markets are in the early stages of adoption, some markets are highly seasonal reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns, and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations.","Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. The pro forma gross margin for the first quarter of 2017 was 72% compared with 70% for the first quarter of 2016 and 71% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase compared to the prior year reflects reduced product costs and manufacturing efficiencies. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, the higher gross margin reflects a higher mix of instrument and accessory revenue relative to systems revenue.","Since we deferred costs associated with the $23 million revenue deferral, the trade-out program had a little impact on our margins. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of systems and instrument and accessory revenue, our ability to further reduce product costs and improve manufacturing efficiency, and in the long-term the potential reinstatement of the medical device tax.","Pro forma operating expenses increased 19% compared with the first quarter of 2016 and increased 1% compared with last quarter. The increases are consistent with our planned investments in product development, specifically da Vinci Sp, flexible robotics, imaging and advanced instrumentation, and the expansion of our OUS market.","Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28.1% compared with an effective tax rate of 27.4% for the first quarter of 2016 and 26.9% last quarter. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income and with the impact of one-time items.","Our first quarter 2017 pro forma net income, which excludes income associated with the revenue deferral was $196 million, or $5.09 per share, compared with $170 million, or $4.42 per share for the first quarter of 2016, and $242 million, or $6.09 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016. The $23 million revenue deferral, including the associated deferral, the cost of sales, and income tax effect reduced GAAP and pro forma net income per diluted share by approximately $0.28 per share.","Earnings per share benefited from our $2 billion stock buyback, because our average shares outstanding were reduced by 1.7 million shares, as we retired 2.4 million shares on January 27, 2017. Our final delivery of shares under the ASR if any will be delivered at the end of the contract period.","As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $180 million, or $4.67 per share for the first quarter of 2017, compared with $136 million, or $3.54 per share for the first quarter of 2016, and $204 million, or $5.13 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016.","GAAP net income for the first quarter included $21 million of litigation charges compared with $2 million in the first quarter of 2016 and $6 million last quarter. The first quarter charges included approximately $14 million for the estimated cost of settling product liability claims covered by tolling agreements. We\u2019ve made substantive progress resolving over 90% of the tolled cases. The remainder of the first quarter charges is related to a settlement of the dispute over a license and supply agreement.","Beginning in 2017, we were required under GAAP to report the excess tax benefits, or deficiencies associated with employee stock awards in our tax provision rather than as an adjustment to paid-in capital in prior periods. The excess tax benefit included in our GAAP results for the first quarter was $33 million, contributing $0.85 per share. We have excluded this benefit from our pro forma result. This amount will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on the volume of employee stock option exercises and the number of RSUs vesting.","We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $3.1 billion, down from $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2016. The decrease reflects our $2 billion stock buyback, partially offset by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises.","And with that, I would like to turn it over to Patrick who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights.","Patrick Clingan","Thanks, Marshall. Of our first quarter procedure growth of nearly 18%, U.S. procedures grew approximately 14% and outside of the United States, procedures grew approximately 28%. Procedure growth benefited from tailwinds from the shift of the timing of the Easter holidays from Q1 into Q2, which had the greatest impact on our European business.","Excluding the benefit from these tailwinds, our procedure performance exceeded our expectations during the quarter. The United States both mature and growth procedures such as general and thoracic surgery outperformed our plan. Though difficult to assess, strength in the U.S. may have been due to a short-term uptick in patients seeking care ahead of any potential healthcare reform.","In U.S. urology, the first quarter growth rate for da Vinci prostatectomy was similar to 2016. We believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market. Earlier this month, the United States Preventive Services Task Force, or USPSTF proposed a change to its 2012 guidance around PSA screening from recommending against screening at any age to encouraging individual patients and physicians to consider PSA screening for men aged 55 to 69.","We are pleased to see the USPSTF more closely aligned its recommendation with guidelines from the American Urological Association. In U.S. gynecology, first quarter procedure growth sustained trends observed during 2016. Procedure growth in U.S. GYN appears to be driven by consolidation of surgeries towards physicians that specialize in complex and cancer surgery, who tend to be users of da Vinci system.","First quarter U.S. general and thoracic surgery procedure adoption remained strong, led by solid growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures. Hernia repair continues to contribute the largest volume of new procedures in the United States and existing surgeon retention and utilization remains encouraging. Trends in lobectomies and other thoracic procedures continue to show early-stage adoption.","Turning abroad, procedures outside of the United States \u2013 procedure growth outside of the United States was approximately 28% in the first quarter, led by the global adoption of da Vinci prostatectomy with solid contributions from kidney procedures, general surgery, and gynecology. As I mentioned earlier, the shift of the timing of the Easter holidays from Q1 into Q2 serves as a tailwind in the quarter, likely contributing an estimated 3% to our 28% procedure growth outside of the United States.","Procedure growth was led by Europe, China, and South Korea. In Europe, procedure growth benefited from the Q1 calendar tailwind, but also showed strength on an organic basis. Procedure growth in China was driven by a strong expansion in system utilization. The system placements remain constrained pending the issuance of the new quota for civilian hospitals. In South Korea, procedure growth is driven by a mix of specialties and procedures in addition to a recent uptick in system placements over the past several quarters. Recently, procedure growth in Japan as well as dVP penetration has grown above 80%.","During the quarter, clinical study being conducted to support a reimbursement submission for gastrectomy completed an enrolment. Over the past several months, new clinical evidences highlighted the role of da Vinci in treatment of gastric cancers in Asia. Case series comparing da Vinci to open or laparoscopic procedures have emerged from both South Korea and Japan.","Dr. Yang and colleagues from Yonsei University Health System compared all three modalities of surgery across nearly 1,000 patients, an article published in the Annals of Surgical Oncology. The authors found that the da Vinci patient cohort had the highest rate of surgical success compared to open or laparoscopic procedures, while experiencing a reduction in major in hospital complications, a reduction in positive resection margin, and improved lymph node yield.","Dr. Uyama and colleagues from Fujita Health University published a letter in the Annals of Laparoscopic and Endoscopic Surgery highlighting prior work on over 500 radical prostatectomies for gastric cancer. The authors found that exchange for greater blood loss and operating time. da Vinci prostatectomy was associated with a reduction in complications and length of hospitalization compared to laparoscopic gastrectomy. In addition, the authors found that da Vinci patient cohort included a larger proportion of advanced gastric cancers, proposing that da Vinci technology was best for these patients.","Looking forward, during the second quarter, we expect our procedure growth rate outside of the United States to slow, as the calendar tailwind becomes a calendar headwind of similar magnitude during Q2. As we move throughout the year, we also expect the contributions from China and Japan to moderate until we obtain a new quota and place new additional systems in China, and obtain additional procedure reimbursements in Japan.","The first quarter was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications evaluating da Vinci surgery. Of these, I wanted to highlight two additional publications. Dr. Luwan from Baptist Hospital of Miami and colleagues published results from nearly 300 right colectomy patients in the Journal of Surgical Laparoscopy Endoscopy & Percutaneous Techniques.","Comparing da Vinci surgery with intracorporeal anastomosis to laparoscopic surgery with extracorporeal anastomosis, the authors found that while patients in da Vinci cohort have longer operating times, they experienced less blood loss, shorter incision lengths, and longer specimen lengths. Other clinical endpoints that trended towards improvements in da Vinci patient cohort include readmissions, post-operative complications, lymph node yield, and zero incisional hernia repairs compared to 7% in the laparoscopic cohort.","The next publication is from Dr. Leon and colleagues from the McGill University in Montreal Canada published an article in the Journal of Gynecology-Oncology on the associated \u2013 to their hospital from adopting da Vinci surgery for gynecologic-oncology.","The authors reported that the introduction of da Vinci increased the use of minimally invasive surgery from 15% to 76%, increasing the volume of patients treated by 27% and decreasing in-patient board cost by approximately $5,000 per patient, despite a higher proportion of patients with complex comorbidities, the authors concluded, \u201cOrganizations are beginning to recognize that the economic implications of introducing the robotics program extend beyond the operating room. It is timely to evaluate the broader ripple effects robotics has on hospital departments outside of the operating room.\u201d","This concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call over to Calvin.","Calvin Darling","Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2017. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full-year 2017 procedure growth of 9% to 12% above the approximately 752,000 procedures performed in 2016. Now, based upon favorable trends and key markets outside of the U.S., U.S. general surgery growth and solid results in mature U.S. procedure categories, we\u2019re increasing our estimate for 2017. We now anticipate full-year 2017 procedure growth within a range of 12% to 14%","We expect the Q2 procedure growth, procedure rates \u2013 procedure growth rates, particularly in Europe will reflect fewer operating days than in the previous year. In regards to system placements, 21 of our 133 first quarter system placements were structured as operating leases.","Going forward in 2017, we expect an increasing proportion of system placements to be under operating leases. We have recently expanded our leasing programs in Germany and Korea and in the U.S. more customers are considering operating lease arrangements to acquire da Vinci capacity.","The average selling price for system sold outright will vary quarter-to-quarter based upon factors, including product, regional, and trade and mix. With the upcoming expansion of our value-oriented system offering and increasing placements in the cost-sensitive markets segments, we expect that our average system selling price will trend gradually lower in 2017.","As we have described, approximately $23 million of product revenue was deferred in Q1 related to our da Vinci X trade-out program. In future quarters, we expect to defer additional revenue related to da Vinci X trade-out offers that we will make to customers in the U.S. and other markets ahead of the availability of the product. We will recognize revenue at the point the trade-out offers are executed or when they expire.","Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast 2017 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 69% and 71% of net revenue. We now expect our full-year 2017 gross profit margin to be in the upper-half of that range.","Turning to operating expenses. As we have described previously, we have accelerated our investments in several strategic areas that will benefit the company over the long run. Accordingly, we have ramped our operating expenses as we focus on execution. On our last call, we forecast pro forma 2017 operating expenses to grow between 15% and 18% above 2016 levels. We now anticipate coming in at the higher-end of that range.","Consistent with our last call, we expect non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $190 million and $200 million in 2017 compared to $178 million in 2016. We expect 2017 other income to be between $30 million and $35 million, compared to the $25 million to $30 million range forecast on our last call.","With regard to income tax. Consistent with previous guidance, we expect our 2017 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5 and 28.5 of pre-tax income depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits.","During Q1, we had $38.5 million diluted shares outstanding for EPS calculations. As Marshall described, in connection with our accelerated share buyback program, on January 27, we took delivery and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, representing the initial delivery from Goldman Sachs. Based upon the timing of this transaction during the quarter, about 1.7 million shares were reduced from our Q1 share count. The remaining 700,000 of the 2.4 million share reduction will be realized in Q2, reflecting the full quarter impact.","The final delivery of shares under the program, if any, will be delivered at the end of the contract period in November. Beyond the accelerated buyback, our actual Q2 shares outstanding will also be affected by the impact of employee option grants, share price, and other diluted share calculation inputs, as well as any other buybacks.","That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Go ahead please.","Robert Hopkins","Hi, yes, good afternoon. Can you hear me, okay?","Gary Guthart","We can.","Marshall Mohr","We can.","Robert Hopkins","Great, good afternoon. So, I guess, the first thing I\u2019d like to ask about is your announcement on da Vinci X. And it sounds like if you\u2019re deferring revenue now that the timing of this is fairly imminent. So is it safe to assume that X will be launching this calendar year?","Gary Guthart","We plan to launch in Europe first and we are in the process of the CE Markreview. We expect that we\u2019ll pass through that review in the next quarter or so.","Robert Hopkins","And then there are couple of other follow-ups in terms of U.S. timing. And then, Gary, can you just describe this a little bit more? I think you said it was an add-on to Si. I\u2019m just curious is this technology primarily a lower-priced offering, or is it going to be positioned as a tool for new settings, or new surgical markets? I just wanted to try to get a better understanding of what kind of new market opportunity that this is addressing?","Gary Guthart","Sure. So let me describe a little bit of what it is first. It really combines our latest instrument accessory, robotic, and computing and imaging technology with an Si patients cart chassis. This brings to market advanced upgrade package for Si technology that\u2019s lost between the Si and the Xi in terms of its breadth of clinical reach. And it creates an attractive entry point for either an upgrade or a new install.","I think that it will do well in places that Si does well today and adds to it some of the Xi technologies at an attractive economic place. Where that goes in terms of treatment locations, we\u2019ll see. I think it will be well received.","Robert Hopkins","And then lastly, I guess, on da Vinci X. Can you just talk about what sort of difference in price point are we talking about here? And what sort of difference in functionality if it\u2019s primarily addressing similar kind of surgical opportunities, I\u2019m just curious to any sense for what\u2019s the ASP difference and the functionality difference that would be very helpful? Thank you.","Gary Guthart","Yes. You\u2019ll have to wait on ASPs. We aren\u2019t announcing it at this time just directionally it will be between Sis and Xis. In terms of capability, again, we\u2019ll, as we launch, we\u2019ll give you additional information in terms of future benefit. It isn\u2019t foundational in terms of the types of procedures it can do. It will make Sis more capable to more comfortably do more procedures. So Xi will remain the top of the line. Xi has intraoperative table motion. It has automated help and set up an optimization and multi quadrant functions that X will not have.","Robert Hopkins","And could it launch in the U.S. this year, that\u2019s my last question?","Gary Guthart","It is possible, but we haven\u2019t yet called the end date in terms of launch time.","Robert Hopkins","Okay, great. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Amit Hazan with Citi. Go ahead please.","Amit Hazan","Thanks. Hey, good afternoon, guys. Let me just start maybe with the da Vinci Sp delay and just ask for a little bit more color just specifically what happened to get you to drive that delay? And then also other than the software upgrade, are you pretty much ready for the 510(k) filing in terms of the clinical results you wanted to have?","Gary Guthart","Yes, the clinical side has been really good. We\u2019re feeling great about our clinical experience and overall product performance. We do \u2013 we did learn some things in our trial that we want to make a little easier, it has to do with making it a little bit easier to set up and a little bit smoother and optimize workflow.","We decided that, given the extensive HF, human factors validations that are required by regulators these days that we would rather do that sooner ahead of the submission than later. And so, we made a decision to go ahead and pull that software release forward into those validations on the newly released software.","So I\u2019m not foundationally upset about where we are with regard to Sp. You get out and you learn. I\u2019d like to take those learnings and put them back in the product and get on with it.","Amit Hazan","And just two quick questions on guidance. First, on the gross margin side, I think, I want to try to understand you had another really good gross margin quarter and your guidance is still kind of a little bit below where we were last year. But it seems like the same drivers are in place, lower cost and new products, managing fixed costs well.","So I\u2019m just trying to understand if this is conservatism by you, or if you\u2019re actually starting to think about some of the \u2013 maybe da Vinci X products coming through and that\u2019s why the guidance is lower, what else is the offset versus what you\u2019ve been able to achieve over the last five quarters?","Calvin Darling","Yes, Amit, this is Calvin, and we\u2019re definitely pleased with our Q1 gross profit results and our continued progress to reduce costs and improve efficiency, as Marshall took you through. And as such, we did take up our guidance to the upper-half of the 69% to 71% range. But you look at specifically in Q1, the gross margin of 72% in the quarter benefited from product mixes, 77% of our revenue is from higher margin recurring revenue and 23% came from lower margin capital. Also during the quarter again, we had very few charges associated with field actions, excess, obsolete inventory.","So as we look forward into the balance of 2017, we think the margin will be impacted by things, including of course, capital sales comprising a higher proportion of the revenue and that mix factor, there will be some costs start to build up that \u2013 to support the manufacturers some of the new products. We are assuming a higher field action and charges more aligned with historic ratios.","And then, as I talked about in the prepared comments, some directionally lower system ASPs as we expand our value-oriented system offering and increased placements in the cost-sensitive market segments, and of course, the margin will vary quarter-to-quarter.","Amit Hazan","Okay. And then just lastly, for me on \u2013 is on the procedure guidance. So if I\u2019m kind of hearing you correctly putting all the pieces together, you had some selling day impact that you\u2019re calling out for the first time really, I\u2019m assuming you kind of knew that ahead of time, so I don\u2019t know how much that has an impact on your new higher guidance, but maybe a comment on that?","And then, in addition to that, you talked about strong kind of legacy growth, but your legacy growth was right in line with where it\u2019s been more recently. So I\u2019m just wondering is the net effect that the higher guidance for you comes really from general surgery in the U.S., that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the higher number?","Gary Guthart","Yes, there\u2019s a lot of factors. Again overall, we\u2019re again very pleased with our Q1 procedure results and growth trends, and we do expect 2017 procedure growth to continue to be driven by U.S. general surgery and international procedures. We\u2019re still very early stages of adoption in these categories. And again, we raised our guidance in the quarter from 9 to 12 to 12 to 14, so it\u2019s reflecting our increased confidence overall.","But at the end, we feel like our Q1 results were exceptional in the quarter. And going forward, we would expect some moderation in growth in Asia, as Patrick took you through as we await additional da Vinci procedure reimbursement in Japan and sales growth in China. We do expect moderation in the European growth rates due to the timing of the Easter holiday, slight moderation in U.S. mature procedures, which have continued trends, as you mentioned. But dVP and GYN, we\u2019d assume some moderation there. And then just, the overriding uncertainty and policy direction in the United States and what impact that may have.","Amit Hazan","Fair enough. Thanks, guys.","Gary Guthart","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please.","David Lewis","Good afternoon. Just a few quick ones. Gary, just starting off with da Vinci X. for a second here, I wonder what the upgrade electronics package on da Vinci X. Is it going to be possible to upgrade the X with Sp, meaning, will that tower work with Sp, so potentially you can bring Sp to a broader marketplace than we initially thought, which we thought maybe was limited to just Xi?","Gary Guthart","Yes. So it\u2019s a good point, is the \u2013 the answer to that is ultimately, yes. But the competition or hardware platform and the basics are shared across all three X, Xi and ultimately Sp. So in addition to giving people lower entry point on advanced technologies, it gives them logical upgrade pathways to advanced technologies.","David Lewis","Perfect, very clear. And then Gary, just two more quick ones. One on Sp, does this software upgrade, or software pull forward, I should say, does that impact to the timing of the second and third filings you were forecasting out ahead than others?","Gary Guthart","It does not appear to.","David Lewis","Okay. And then, Gary, the one procedure we talk a lot about prostate, we talk a lot about hernia lately. But this thoracic procedure, or segment has really come into the dialogue the last six months. Can you just talk more about what\u2019s happening in thoracic? How much of it is long resection? How much of this is broad category of VATS surgery? And any you can share with us in terms of market size, stage of inflection, because it\u2019s sort of merged from a nice place to a definitive driver, it\u2019d be helpful to get some clarity? Thanks so much.","Gary Guthart","Sure. I think just painting it broad strokes, the opportunity for us in thoracic surgery over time is real. There\u2019s a lot of open surgery in that space. These are complex procedures and delicate surgeries. As we think that sets us up well for da Vinci kind of platform, as we have brought Xi to market with its longer reach, its narrower arms and its set of Xi staplers that has helped.","So we\u2019re seeing what would amount to early interest and early growth in that category. In terms of market sizes and rate of penetration, I \u2013 I\u2019ll let Patrick speak to that a little bit. We still think we\u2019re early. I would also say that, we\u2019ve got our sales force and commercial team really focused primarily on general surgery. I think we want to support that market very well. But Patrick, take it away.","Patrick Clingan","If you look at the United States market, there\u2019s probably around 100,000 patients who receive surgery a day, split evenly between lobectomies and other types of thoracic procedures for which we think our products can bring value to patients and surgeons. We look outside the United States beside, markets are much, much larger, particularly when you look to Asia and China in particular.","So we\u2019re optimistic about the future. But we\u2019re still in very early days and you\u2019re seeing some of the early evidence that\u2019s come out comparing robotics to open and even VATS surgeries with their improving outcomes and evidence holds up over time. We think there\u2019s a runaway for us here.","David Lewis","Great. Thank you very much.","Gary Guthart","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Go ahead please.","Tycho Peterson","Hey, thanks. I\u2019ll start off with just a couple of clarifications on procedure expectations. Are you factoring in any impact from the USPSTF guidelines? And then, can you comment on hernia ventral versus inguinal? Are you still seeing relatively balanced growth rates between the two?","Patrick Clingan","Hey, Tycho, it\u2019s Patrick. From a USPSTF perspective, in 2012 when the original announcement came out, we saw dVP volumes decline over a couple of year period. However, since then you\u2019ve seen our volumes really return to nearly the level they were in 2011. So I think a lot of that has played through, so we\u2019re pleased to see the statement become more aligned to what the AUA society guidelines are.","From a ventral and inguinal hernia perspective, we remain encouraged by the trends we\u2019re seeing. You continue to see growth in our existing surgeon populations doing more and more procedures, new surgeons coming along. And there\u2019s a lot of positive energy coming out of society meetings like the American Hernia Society and the SAGES meeting. So we continue to be pleased by the adoption that we\u2019re seeing.","Tycho Peterson","And then on Sp, I know you suggested the software release would necessarily impact the timing for follow-on procedures down in urology. Can you maybe just help us think of when you may have those filings for the follow-on procedures? And also, when can we get a readout from the first clinical experience in Australia? Is that something that would be published.","Gary Guthart","Okay. So two different things there; one is Sp and one is our flexible robotics program. But just going to Sp to start, we have not yet settled on submission timelines for the additional indications on Sp beyond urology. We are imminently initiating the transoral surgery trials, and then we\u2019ll open colorectal trials thereafter, but we have not yet set dates publicly for when we expect those submissions. That said, the software update we\u2019re doing vis-\u00e0-vis the urology filing should not disrupt the timeline of those two.","With regard to the work that was done in Australia that was on the flexible robotics platform, they are in patient follow-up now. So they\u2019re following patients after their treatment for the prescribed amount of time in their protocol. I\u2019d expect them to be presenting publicly in the fall.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We now have a question from Tao Levy with Wedbush. Go ahead please.","Tao Levy","Great, thanks. Good afternoon. So I had a question on the X \u2013 on the da Vinci X. Are the instruments similar to the Xi, or it\u2019s still going to be a different course set of instruments?","Gary Guthart","Good question. The instruments on X are the same family as the Xi, so there are generation 2 advanced instrument kit. So things like stapling and vessel sealing, or gen 2, they are the same exact instruments, same part numbers as the Xi likewise with the imaging system. So if you\u2019re on account that has multiple systems, you have Xis and Sis then moving to X can standardize your Si base and have one set of instruments and accessories.","Tao Levy","Gotcha. And the pricing pathway for an upgrade from an Si to and an X outside of obviously the deferral?","Gary Guthart","So not \u2013 we haven\u2019t published yet what the list price steps are going to be.","Tao Levy","Okay And just lastly, I asked this question last quarter, I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any update on the quota from China? Is that still something you expect over the near-term? Thanks.","Marshall Mohr","There really \u2013 this is Marshal. There really isn\u2019t much of an update as we\u2019ve previously communicated. We\u2019re still waiting for a quota, which would cover the civilian hospitals in China, and we\u2019ll keep you informed as we hear.","Tao Levy","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brandon Henry with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Brandon Henry","Yes, thanks for taking my question. First, can you talk about the dynamic? You mentioned of patients coming in for surgery ahead of potential healthcare reform changes, and what you heard from surgeons regarding that dynamic? And then should we expect this similar dynamic to occur in the second quarter? And I have a couple of follow-ups?","Gary Guthart","This is Gary. I don\u2019t think we have a deep insight there. There has been a little bit of speculation that there has been some pull forward. We have seen just in the numbers a little more buoyance kind of broadly across our procedure base not just in the single category, but kind of across each category, which leaves us to believe there\u2019s something environmental going on.","I would not say that we have special insight. I think it\u2019s a little bit of speculation we\u2019ll know in the future quarters. I cannot predict what will happen Q2, Q3 with regard to how ACA dynamics will occur.","Brandon Henry","Okay. And then and separately on the international side, I think the company breaks at international procedures by prostatectomy, hysterectomy in kind of other bucket. The other bucket has become the larger portion of the international procedures, but we don\u2019t really have a lot of visibility into the underlying trends there.","So can you just spend sometime discussing what specific countries our procedures are driving that continued 30% plus growth in the other bucket and your confidence that that rate of growth continuing for the other category going forward? Thanks.","Patrick Clingan","Yes, sure, Brandon, it\u2019s Patrick. We continue to see most of our outside of the United States procedure growth being driven by urology, mostly prostatectomy and dVP, but also in kidney repairs, mainly through partial nephrectomies to which the system tends to be an enabler for population of patients to access partial nephrectomy for kidney cancers. We also do see encouraging signs in general surgery and gynecology, stronger in Asia and in certain markets in Europe, where we\u2019ve already deeply penetrated urology.","Brandon Henry","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Go ahead please.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Hi, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. First, if I focus on the pipeline, any updates on the new technologies that you\u2019re working on the imaging agent and additional instruments? And I had one follow up.","Gary Guthart","Imaging trial on the uro imaging agent is initiated so far so good. We\u2019re still early in that trial, but we\u2019re pleased. Otherwise our imaging programs are progressing against our plan. Your second question was on, I\u2019m sorry advanced?","Lawrence Biegelsen","Additional instruments?","Gary Guthart","Instrumentation. We have a portfolio of instruments we\u2019re working on nothing to really call out in terms of dates for you. We are making progress on expanding our stapler line to be a full line stapling system, but nothing I call out for you on this call.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Gary, let me ask one on the competition. So Medtronic has talked about bundling their surgical portfolio to drive sales of their robot assuming they have a competitive offering. Can you talk about things you could do such as partnering to mitigate that advantage that they could have? Thank you.","Gary Guthart","We think \u2013 the way we think about it in terms of servicing our customer is to allow them to have a minimally invasive surgery program that they get the outcomes they want to across a broad population of patients and surgeons. We think that our technologies are outstanding and we\u2019ll continue to be market leading.","To the extent that they need to augment a robotic system with other products, there are a plethora of other companies that are happy to sell into surgical suites. And I think as long as those were at an economically attractive price point and the products are well accepted, I think, we\u2019re going to be in good shape.","Lawrence Biegelsen","All right. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Richard Newitter","Hi, thanks a lot for squeezing me in here. I just the first one, coming out of SAGES, we noticed just a palpable kind of acceptance \u2013 increased acceptance of hernia procedures in general, multiple kind of podium sessions devoted to it. So just wondering, is there that acceptance that you\u2019re seeing, so that we saw do you guys feel that kind of there has been a notable inflection in the acceptance of kind of hernia robotic hernia surgery? And would you be willing to kind of give us an updated kind of sense of where we are on the market opportunities within ventral and hernia \u2013 inguinal how big they are and kind of where you think that could go from your addressable market?","Gary Guthart","I think in the first part of your question where are we in acceptance? I think that you\u2019re seeing some early exploration and enthusiasm and we\u2019re feeling that enthusiasm as well. But as you well know the surgical population is not of one mind. And I think that we\u2019re going to see pro-conned dates in hernia for sometime, and I would expect that. And I think it will be challenged and debated and discussed variance by patient population, variance by surgical technique, and variance by total economics to treat.","That leads to your second question, which is are we ready to make any changes to our thoughts on estimated market size? And I think it\u2019s really too early to try to redraw boundaries there. So the summary for us is so far so good. I think, surgeons are finding real value and pursuing that value. They\u2019re doing what I think they should in terms of assessing it carefully and publishing the results and debating, which patient groups and subgroups make sense, and we\u2019ll support them in that effort.","Richard Newitter","That\u2019s helpful. And then just a follow-up on the ACA kind of some of the dynamic that might be playing out in the marketplace. I\u2019m just wondering on the capital side and on the decision-maker side of the equation and hospitals institutions, any updates on what you\u2019re hearing from customers on kind of their willingness to invest in innovation like robotics?","Gary Guthart","I think on the one hand in a good way a lot of people understand the basic value proposition of robotics are familiar with the kinds of things they can do. So that has led to, I think meaningful conversations that are data driven and effective.","I think on the margins right now, the ACA has injected some caution on the part of capital buyers. So on the positive side, I think, robotics the value it can bring is pretty well understood. On the negative side, I think, on the margin at the outside it\u2019s been \u2013 ACA uncertainty has been a slight negative.","Richard Newitter","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Wise with Stifel. Go ahead please.","Rick Wise","Good afternoon, everybody. Hi, Gary. Just a big picture question, first. I mean, I would assume you\u2019d think that the opportunity for robotics and surgery is under penetrated. I\u2019m just sort of fascinated with the several times you\u2019ve mentioned \u2013 you Marshall, Calvin had mentioned that average selling prices will trend lower because of new products and mix here. Just stepping back from both specifics, how do we think about the opportunity for a lower-priced system perhaps driving increase penetration?","I mean, is this the next leg in robotic market penetration? And does da Vinci X and Sp and should we think about that more specifically as one of the next big opportunities as opposed to just a procedure, or a geography if you see what I\u2019m getting on?","Gary Guthart","I\u2019ll answer a little simpler question that you asked. I think we have been in close contact with our customers, particularly those outside the United States and have been listening carefully to what kind of procedures they want to do, what the reimbursement environments are in their countries, and what kind of capabilities need to match that procedure set and reimbursement set, and we think X fits that bill.","And as a result, I think that it will be well received. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s limited to a single country. I do think that we believe and I think our customers believe the total cost to treat is the right economic measures, that better outcomes followed by economic analysis to look at total cost to treat. And to the extent that your technology offering can match that, so that you get both great outcomes and lower total cost to treat that will drive adoption.","How big, how fast X goes? We don\u2019t have a crystal ball. But we have invested in it based on some conversations and research we think was right. I think that is going to hit the mark for them, and we will be delighted to report to you in future quarters how it\u2019s going.","Rick Wise","Yes. And Gary, just a follow-on to that. So just to be very clear, I mean, this is not, \u201cJust an upgrade for existing Xi installed base, it is that, but it\u2019s definitely something much broader potentially\u201d?","Gary Guthart","You can \u2013 if one has an Si then you can upgrade to Xi to an X. If you have no system and you want to get started then you can buy an X to get started.","Rick Wise","Yes. And you didn\u2019t mention, I know it\u2019s small table motion this quarter. Just out of curiosity where are we with adoption and the uptake there? Is it going as you expected and planned?","Gary Guthart","Yes. At the top level, attach rate of table motion has exceeded our initial expectations and kind of our original business plan for that product. I think with regard to the last quarter, I would imagine, I look at Patrick about\u2026","Patrick Clingan","Very solid attach rates with new Xi system sales. We\u2019ve worked largely through the existing population of customers. So we are not seeing as much on a year-over-year basis as we saw when the product launched.","Rick Wise","Okay. And then just last for me on Fosun. Any milestones we should expect and, let\u2019s say, the next 12 months on the program? And maybe just more broadly, how do we think about this partnership\u2019s impact, if anything now looking ahead on the broader high surge Chinese business, and especially given the complex geopolitical situation? Thank you.","Gary Guthart","Okay. With regard to Fosun, I think, I\u2019d focus the audience on really two things. One is the technical progress of the flexible robotics platform, because we think that\u2019s a major component. And then the other one will be our activities in building that organization, hiring staff. As the organization builds out, then we\u2019ll announce to you kind of where we are. I gave you an update on where we are in the flex robotics program.","We are very bullish on the interest in and the value that robotic surgery can bring to China. We have the right partner in Fosun. Over time, that partnership exists today in the form of our distribution relationship with one of their subsidiaries in Chindex, that will grow into the relationship into a full JV. And we will navigate the international waters as need be.","Gary Guthart","So thank you for the question. That was our last one. As we\u2019ve said previously, while we focus on financial metrics, such as revenue, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing value by enabling surgeons to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things, which really make a difference.","This concludes today\u2019s call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery and look forward to talking to your again in three months.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) Also as a reminder, today\u2019s teleconference is being recorded.","And at this time, I will turn the conference call over to our host, Senior Director of Finance for Intuitive Surgical, Mr. Calvin Darling. Please go ahead, sir.","Calvin Darling","Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's third quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Aleks Cukic, our Vice President of Strategic Planning.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, included in our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 4, 2013, and our Form 10-Q filed on July 22, 2013.","These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's EDGAR database. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.","Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release has been posted to our website.","Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our third quarter's results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session.","Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our third quarter financial results. Aleks will discuss marketing and clinical highlights, then I will provide an update to our financial forecast for 2013, and finally we will host a question-and-answer session.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Gary.","Gary S. Guthart","Thank you for joining us today. This quarter we continued to see significant pressure on our U.S. business. Trends that started in the first half of the year in gynecology have continued. On the procedure side underlying causes for slowing growth include weaker overall gynecologic admissions which is pressuring surgical volume. There are also lingering yield founded concerns regarding the benefits of da Vinci Surgery compared to the available surgical alternatives.","Since we\u2019re a significant share of hysterectomy, our growth rate is sensitive to these issues. This slow growth has resulted in capacity in our U.S. installed base combined with changes in hospital capital spending associated with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, U.S. capital sales fell substantially compared to prior year. Overall procedure trends in the quarter were stable rising 16% over prior year.","In the United States general surgery was our fastest growing segment led by Single-Site cholecystectomy and followed by growth in colon and rectal resections. Our gynecology business still grew year-over-year, but at a slower pace than prior quarters and urologic procedures in the U.S. were stable compared to prior year.","In Europe, we are continuing our investments in market access in clinical research. We are seeing early positive results in HTA and reimbursement analysis as a consequence of these efforts. Year-over-year procedure growth accelerated led by urology and early growth in malignant gynecology. Growth was strongest in U.K., France, Italy and the Nordic countries. Procedure growth in Asia was solid off a small base led by growth in urology and general surgery.","With regard to resolution of our FDA warning letter, we are making good progress in addressing the elements of the letter and the Form 43 that preceded it. As part of our work in responding to the letter, we expect to file corrections and updates to our labeling and to file documentation for some past field actions. These activities will be documented on FDA\u2019s websites over the next several weeks.","Turning to our operating performance for the third quarter; procedures grew approximately 16% over the third quarter of 2012. We sold 101 da Vinci Surgical Systems, down from 155 during the third quarter of last year. Total revenue was $499 million, down 7% from last year. Instrument and accessory revenue was $239 million, up 10% over Q3 2012.","Total recurring revenue grew to $341 million, up 11% from prior year and comprising 68% of total revenue. Net income was $157 million, down 14% over last year, and we generated an operating profit of $225 million before non-cash stock option expense, down 13% from the third quarter of last year and representing 45% of Q3 revenue.","We ended the quarter with $2,532 million in cash and investments, down $495 million from last quarter. In the quarter, we generated $204 million in gross cash flow from operations, and we repurchased $694 million of our stock.","Our new products continue to gain acceptance with customers. We expanded our stapling rollout at a measured pace through the first three quarters of this year. Surgeons\u2019 clinical feedback on the Stapler has been strong, and our stapling operations debt has increased substantially. We will accelerate the stapling launch in Q4 and beyond.","This quarter, we received FDA clearance for an expanded indication of our Firefly system to include biliary imaging in combination with normal white light imaging during cholecystectomy. This is another step in providing surgeons with imaging capability that enables them to see anatomical structure beyond what can be seen with the naked eye.","Our Single-Site product line continues to perform well. Single-Site cholecystectomy is moving out of early adopting centers into the broader clinical practice. Single-Site for hysterectomy progressed during the quarter while on limited release. As part of this limited release, customers have requested an additional instrument, a wrist needle driver to complement the product line.","We have designed it, are testing it, and planning to submit an application in early Q1 to the U.S. FDA for 510(k) clearance. We believe the addition of the wrist to Single-Site instruments will optimize the procedure for surgeons who expect EndoWrist functionality. Our Single-Site products are well positioned to deliver increased patient satisfaction with reasonable economics for single incision surgery.","We have great confidence in the safety, efficacy, and cost effectiveness of our products, and we remain deeply positive on the value da Vinci brings to surgery now and in the future. The benefit da Vinci brings as an alternative to open surgery has been demonstrated in hundreds of independent peer-reviewed clinical papers. Increasingly well designed cost studies demonstrate that upfront in operating investments in da Vinci surgery are offset by downstream savings resulting from fewer complications, readmissions, and length of stay.","We recently updated intuitivesurgical.com with links to high level of evidenced clinical data and adverse event data, and in the next few days, we\u2019ll add abstracts of well-designed, peer-reviewed cost studies comparing da Vinci surgery to open surgery alternatives. We encourage a full and careful examination of the literature by anyone interested in the facts about da Vinci use.","In summary, we continue to see substantial long-term opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery using our technologies, and we are focused on the following. First, educating the surgical community on the facts about da Vinci surgery including its safety, efficacy, and cost of effectiveness; next building da Vinci capability and supporting it\u2019s use in general surgery.","Extending the benefits of minimally invasive surgery using da Vinci in gynecology and urology worldwide, and disciplined execution and expanding our stapling and Single-Site adoption.","I will now pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer.","Marshall L. Mohr","Thank you, Gary. Our third quarter 2013 revenue was $499 million, down 7% compared with $538 million to the third quarter of 2012, and down 14% from last quarter. Third quarter revenues by product category were as follows; third quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $239 million, up 10% compared with $218 million for the third quarter of 2012 and down 10% compared with the second quarter of 2013. The year-over-year increase in instrument and accessory revenue was driven by procedure growth of approximately 16%.","Sales of new products, including Single-Site, Vessel Sealer, and Firefly, partially offset by lower instrument and accessory stocking orders associated with fewer system sales and the timing of customer orders. The sequential decrease in instrument and accessory revenue was driven by lower instrument and accessory stocking orders and the timing of customer orders.","The 16% increase in da Vinci procedures for the quarter reflected growth in general surgery and gynecology procedures in the U.S. and urology procedures outside of the U.S. The lower third quarter growth rate reflects slower growth in U.S. benign gynecologic procedures and flat U.S. DVP volumes.","Factors effecting U.S. benign gynecologic procedures include reduced hospital admissions, a trend by payers toward encouraging conservative disease management and treatment in out-patient settings and negative media reports. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including initial stocking orders was approximately $1,860 per procedure compared to $1,980 per procedure in the third quarter of 2012, and $2,020 last quarter.","Our third quarter 2013 revenue per procedure reflected fewer stocking orders associated with fewer system sales and the timing of customer orders. Third quarter 2013 systems revenue of $159 million decreased 32% compared with $232 million for the third quarter of 2012 and decreased 27% compared with $216 million last quarter.","Overall, we sold 101 systems in the third quarter of 2013 compared with 155 systems last year and 143 systems last quarter. We sold 65 systems into the U.S. market in the third quarter of 2013 compared with 114 systems last year and 90 systems last quarter. The lower third quarter 2013 U.S. system sales reflected among other things the impacts of moderating growth in U.S. benign gynecologic procedures, increased economic pressure on hospitals, uncertainty related to and spending associated with the Affordable Care Act, and negative media reports.","During the third quarter of 2013, we sold 36 systems in the international market, including 17 into Europe and 13 into Japan, compared with 41 into international markets in the third quarter of 2012, which included 13 into Europe and 16 into Japan and 53 systems into international markets in the second quarter of 2013, which included 21 into Europe and 20 into Japan.","Our third quarter average sales price per system was $1.56 million, compared with $1.48 million realized in the third quarter of 2012 and the $1.5 million realized last quarter. ASPs include all da Vinci models, all simulators in Firefly when configured with the system and exclude upgrades.","Our higher third quarter 2013 ASPs were driven by a higher proportion of dual console configurations and geographic sales mix. 29 of our third quarter 2013 systems involved trade-ins compared with 34 trade-ins last year and 43 trade-ins last quarter.","Service revenue increased to $101 million, up 16% compared with $88 million last year and up 3% compared with $98 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was driven by larger system installed base.","International revenue results were as follows; third quarter revenue outside the U.S. was $133 million, up 15% compared with revenue of $115 million in the third quarter of last year and down 16% compared with revenue of $158 million last quarter. Our higher year-over-year international revenue was driven by higher recurring instrument, accessory, and service revenue, partially offset by lower system sales. Our lower sequential international revenue primarily reflects summer seasonality.","Third quarter 2013 international procedure volume was approximately 25% higher than the third quarter of 2012 and 6% lower than the second quarter of this year. The growth over the prior year reflects DVP growth in Europe and Japan. The decrease compared to last quarter reflects summer seasonality patterns in Europe.","Moving onto the remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the third quarter of 2013 was 71.5% compared with 72.5% for the third quarter of 2012 and 70% for the second quarter of 2013. Our lower margin percentage compared to the third quarter of last year resulted primarily from the impact of the medical device excise tax or higher gross margin percentage compared to last quarter was driven primarily by higher system ASPs.","Third quarter 2013 operating expenses of $183 million were up 2% compared with last year and down 2% compared with last quarter. Our higher year-over-year operating expense was driven by headcount additions, partially offset by lower incentive compensation, and lower R&D prototype expenses, a decrease compared to last quarter was driven by lower incentive compensation, partially offset by stock compensation expenses.","Third quarter 2013 operating income was $174 million or 35% of sales compared to $211 million or 39% of sales last year and $219 million or 38% of sales last quarter. Third quarter 2013 operating income included $50 million of non-cash stock compensation expense compared with $47 million last year and $39 million last quarter. The increase in stock compensation expense relative to the prior quarter has to do with the timing of stock option grants in the related testing periods.","Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 12% compared with 15% for the third quarter of 2012 and 28.6% in last quarter. Both the third quarter of 2013 and the third quarter of 2012 tax rates benefited from the release of reserves specific to tax year where the statutory limitations have now expired. Excluding one-time benefits, our third quarter 2013 tax provision would have been approximately $26 million higher and our third quarter 2012 tax provision would have been approximately $35 million higher.","Our net income was $157 million or $3.99 per share compared with $183 million or $4.46 per share for the third quarter of 2012 and $159 million or $3.90 per share for the second quarter of 2013. Excluding the one-time tax benefits, our third quarter 2013 net income would have been $131 million or $3.32 per share and our third quarter 2012 net income would have been $148 million or $3.61 per share.","Now moving to cash flows; we ended the third quarter with cash and investments of $2.5 billion, down $495 million compared with June 30, 2013. The decrease was driven by $694 million used to repurchase our common stock and $34 million of capital and IP acquisitions, partially offset by $204 million in cash flow generated from operations.","During the third quarter we bought back approximately 1.74 million shares at an average price of $399 dollars per share. We ended the quarter with approximately $1 billion authorized by the Board for future share buybacks.","And with that, I would like to turn it over to Aleks who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights.","","Aleks Cukic","","Thank you Marshall. During the third quarter, we sold 101 da Vinci systems; 65 in the United States, 17 into Europe and 19 in rest of world markets. As part of the 101 system sales, five standard da Vinci systems and 24 da Vinci S systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si systems. We finished the quarter with a net 72 system additions to the installed base, bringing to 2,871 the cumulative number of da Vinci systems worldwide; 2,042 in the U.S., 455 in Europe and 374 in rest of world markets.","48 of the 101 systems installed during the quarter represented repeat system sales to existing customers. In total, 100 of the 101 systems sold represented da Vinci Si or Si-e systems, which included 32 dual consoles. The 36 system sales internationally included 13 into Japan and six into France.","Clinically, Q3 year-over-year procedure growth was approximately 16%, which was led by the category of general surgery and paced by cholecystectomy, followed by colon rectal resections, and bariatric procedures. Our U.S. urology business was stable, while growth in the international urology business was solid.","As expected, the growth rate in the U.S. for benign dVH was slightly down from Q2, which continued to place pressure on U.S. system sales. Demand for recently released new products continues to be strong. Through Q3, 2013, we sold Single-Site instruments and accessory kits to approximately 825 U.S. customers. Our Vessel Sealer product utilization trend continues to strengthen with most of the interest coming from the specialties of colorectal, advanced general and GYN surgery.","The customer adoption for both da Vinci Simulator and Firefly continues to expand, with 63 customers purchasing a da Vinci Simulator and 48 customers purchasing Firefly systems, as part of their initial system purchases this quarter.","In addition, we've expanded our phased rollout of both the da Vinci surgical stapling system and Single-Site hysterectomy products to several new sites. These rollouts will be expanded in a measured fashion, so we do not expect them to contribute materially in the near term.","During the quarter, several 100 robotic abstracts and papers, representing a variety of surgical specialties were published within peer-reviewed journals, many focused specifically on safety and\/or efficacy. Clinical conferences also produced several live da Vinci procedure transmissions, postgraduate robotic courses, podium presentations and clinical poster sessions, several with emphasis on safety and\/or efficacy.","I\u2019ll take a moment to summarize a few. da Vinci hysterectomy is the single largest procedure that our customers perform. It is widely accepted that when compared to open hysterectomy the benefits provided to a patient through an MIS approach are significant. As the data supports, the rapid conversion to open hysterectomy to a minimally invasive approach continues to be led by da Vinci\u2019s incorporation in to GYN practices.","In a recent addition of the journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgery, a group out of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Yale University, published a study entitled Robotic versus Abdominal Hysterectomy in Women with very large uteri. The study compared the results of 60 hysterectomies, 30 abdominal, and 30 dVHs in patients with uteri greater than 1,000 grams in weight.","It is generally understood that the larger the uterus the more complex the surgery. Often necessitating an abdominal hysterectomy, and the statical scale uteri in excess of 1,000 grams are considered very large. The uteri in both cohorts study ranged in size from between 1,000 grams to just over 3,500 grams. The published results were as follows: median length of hospitalization for patients in the da Vinci cohort was one day with a range from one to two days as compared to 2.5 days with a range from two to nine days for patients in the abdominal cohorts.","Estimated blood loss was 150 milliliter for the da Vinci patients versus 425 milliliters to the abdominal approach. Transfusion rates for the da Vinci cohort was 3.3% versus 13.3% with the abdominal approach. Conversion rates from da Vinci hysterectomy to an abdominal surgery was zero, as with the hernias.","In their commentary, the authors pointed out the following findings. First, hysterectomy is for very large uteri are challenging procedures. Second, obesity and morbid obesity and\/or previous surgeries compound the difficulty. Despite these challenges patients who are obese experience some of the greatest differential benefits for minimally invasive surgery. Finally, morbid obesity and\/or previous procedures appear to not be an impediment for completing these procedures robotically.","Within general surgery procedures related to the colon and rectal disease management have been among our most promising. Right and left co-intersections, sigma intersections, low anterior resection and rectopexy continue to exhibit solid growth. With the exception of right hemicolectomy and rectopexy, laparoscopic penetration has been modest with inter colon rectal surgery.","Rectopexy is a procedure designed to address pelvic floor disorders or PFDs. Among other things, PFDs obstruct the patient\u2019s ability to defecate. A recent French study compared the results of patients undergoing a laparoscopic rectopexy versus a da Vinci rectopexy. 118 patients were evaluated in the study, 44 da Vinci as compared to 74 laps. The study evaluated OR time, blood life, complications, length of hospitalization and postoperative ODS scores for obstructed defecation syndrome.","Regarding total OR time which included system time, the da Vinci rectopexy took approximately 15% longer than the laparoscopic approach, but the authors noted that their times came down over their last 20 patient and were expected to continue to trend down.","Blood loss was difficult to even to test during the da Vinci rectopexy and measured only 8 milliliters as compared to 42 milliliters in the lap cohorts. Complications with the da Vinci approach were 2% as compared to 11% in the lap patients. Hospitalization was reduced by a full day when using da Vinci with the authors attributed to less strenuous tissue manipulation due to improved vision and dexterity.","Post op ODS scores improved for patients in both groups. However the difference in improvement for patients in the da Vinci cohort was substantial in being statically significant. In their conclusions the author stated and I quote, \u2018although not a randomized comparison this study shows that ventral mesh rectopexy performed by robots was followed by better functions than lap rectopexy\u2019. Da Vinci thoracic procedures specifically lobectomy and segmental resection has been steadily expanding over the past few years. Similar to colon and rectal surgery, the presence of minimally invasive resections has been minor as compared to open surgery.","In a recent edition of the Annals of Thoracic Surgery, physician and healthcare economists from both Harvard Medical School and Cornell Medical Center collaborated on the study which compared open surgery, video assisted thoracoscopic or VAS and da Vinci resections.","The study evaluated the results of over 33,000 patients who have received pulmonary resection within the eight stage study cohort. While the mix of patients was dominated by patients undergoing an open resection, the rate of growth for da Vinci surgery was significant over the three year study period. Da Vinci expanded from 0.2 of the pulmonary resection studied in the first year to 3.4 by the third year, numbering 430 in total.","da Vinci procedures were performed in all stages of study with 38 being performed in community hospitals. The results in a propensity matched analysis da Vinci resections were associated with significant reductions in mortality, 0.2% versus 2.0% for open surgery. Length of stay was 5.9 days for the da Vinci patients versus 8.2 days for the open surgery.","Overall complication rate was 43.8% for da Vinci versus 54.1% for open surgery. These improvements were all considered statistically significant and propensity matched analysis versus path. da Vinci lumpectomy demonstrated directional improvements in mortality and length of stay.","In their summary, the authors wrote, and I quote, \u2018case volume for pulmonary resections have increased significantly during the study period of thoracic surgeon, and thoracic surgeons have been able to adopt the robotic approach safely. Robotic resection appears to be an appropriate alternative to that and is associated with improved outcomes compared with open thoracotomy.\u2019","This concludes my remarks and I will now turn the time over to Calvin.","Calvin Darling","Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing you with an update to our financial forecast for 2013 on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates of significant non-cash expenses.","Starting with procedures, on our last call, we projected our full year 2013 procedures to grow between 15% and 18%, above the base of approximately 450,000 procedures performed in 2012. Now, with one quarter remaining in 2013 we are refining our estimate for full year 2013 procedure growth to a range of between 16% and 17%.","Moving to revenues, as has been discussed several factors are pressuring our business, making it difficult to predict system sales volumes. On our last call, we projected full year 2013 revenue to range from approximately flat to 7% growth. We now expect full year revenue growth in the lower half of that range.","Turning to operating income; on our last call, we forecasted operating income to fall within a range of between 37% and 38% of net revenue. We are taking steps to scale back our expenses while not comprising our longer term expansion strategies. We continue to anticipate full year 2013 operating income to fall within the range of between 37% and 38% of revenue.","Now, with regard to non-cash stock compensation expenses; we are refining our forecast to between $169 million and $172 million for the year. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $16 million and $17 million in 2013.","With regard to income tax, as Marshall described, our Q3 tax rate benefited from non-recurring discrete events. For Q4 2013 we\u2019d expect our tax rate to be approximately 28% of pre-tax income, slightly lower than previously forecast, primarily due to the geographic mix of our pre-tax income.","Our share count for calculating EPS in Q3 2013 was approximately 39.3 million shares, declining 1.5 million shares in the quarter primarily due to buyback activities. In Q4 we expect our share count to decline approximately 600,000 shares further based upon the full quarter impact of our Q3 buybacks. The actual Q4 share count will depend on several factors, including the magnitude and timing of additional share buybacks if any.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tycho W. Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","","Hey, thanks for taking the question. I guess, first of all, just kind of given the change of procedures in ACA uncertainty, can you just talk about whether we should be assuming that there will be U.S. placements only if system utilization continues to increase sequentially, and how are you thinking about where system utilization could ultimately go in the next couple of years?","Calvin Darling","","So, I think in the near-term the factors that place new systems will be a few as you know. So one of them is procedure growth, one of them is access to technologies for folks who have older technology, and then last one is point-of-care where in the hospital they want to use the devices, and by far the biggest driver of those three is the procedure side. So I think utilization over time, I think people are going to look at it and look as capital owners to drive it up. It can be lumpy though. I don\u2019t know that it has to progress linearly in terms of increases. As I said before, if you have an S platform and you want to have access to stapling that requires an Si, that they can make changes as we go through.","Tycho W. Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then on Japan, given that you\u2019re not likely to have reimbursement for additional procedures until 2016, could you maybe just talk about how you think about the trend there, is there going to be kind of a pause in investments beyond this initial round of placements in [indiscernible] procedures?","Calvin Darling","I think, in terms of the process for reimbursement, just so everybody knows that there will be a set of clinical data collection that\u2019s going on out there and that will involve some hospitals getting limited approval from the government to collect that data, so we\u2019ll see that. I think that capital sales by the broad market will be really lumpy in this period. I think it will be very hard to predict accurately what the sales profile will look like as people go through that set of clinical data and trial data. I think the commentary from the Japanese market as to their interest is strong.","Tycho W. Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then one last one for Marshall, just quickly on inventories $200 million, can you just comment on why they were that high?","","Marshall L. Mohr","","So we run on \u2013 we have lead times that we provide to our suppliers, particularly the system itself, and we obviously didn\u2019t sell the number of systems we had anticipated until [indiscernible]. We are still taking that inventory and we don\u2019t think there is any exposure there. We\u2019re talking about Si, and Si is a very capable unit and capable of doing all of the surgeries we see in our near-term future.","Tycho W. Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Ben C. Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Maybe Gary talk a bit about any shift in the spending plans that Calvin referred to, and if you can give us a little bit of detail on that and over what time frame we might see that pullback?","Calvin Darling","","I think there are some things that makes sense in the next quarter or two in terms of spending, something that just scale with production volume and things like that that make a lot of sense. The other side is being careful in prioritizing the investments that we make, both in terms of prototype spending and in terms of expansion plans. We have a pretty clear set of priorities in terms of the kinds of products and the markets we want to invest in. We will not short those, but for things that are perhaps a little further out or a little bit more on the edges, then we\u2019ll be careful about where we put our investment.","Ben C. Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then on the clinical side, what sort of role do you have in data collection for things like complications and other clinical data sets relative to procedures like Chole where there is an opportunity to maybe transform the space further with a strong registry set or clinical study, and is that a material kind of investment for you all at this point?","Gary S. Guthart","","We do have programs where we invest in clinical research. We also invest in things like supporting registries. Also we\u2019ll go out and provide materials and access to training and other types of resources to allow people to design trials, so we perform that way. We also fund fellowship training. We also fund residency training in different places. So we have a set of things that we do. There are institutions that will look for our health, and there are institutions who want to do things at arms length and that make sense too. So there is a combination of all of those things.","I think the areas of study are diverse from very large population studies that occur in more mature procedures to smaller cohorts that are direct comparisons across one or two centers for things that are emerging, so as you think about cholecystectomy and use of Single-Site and things like Firefly Imaging, you\u2019ll see the smaller cohort study start and those will get bigger as time goes on.","Ben C. Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC","","Okay. And then finally for me, in terms of the pipeline for system sales in the quarter, did you see a shift in terms of how people characterize them as a delay or cancellation or any other trends there? Thank you.","","Gary S. Guthart","","Well, that\u2019s pretty similar to last quarter. We had a number of systems that \u2013 where we got the approvals that we\u2019re accustomed to, but then at the end, we couldn\u2019t get the CEO or CFO and there was a hesitation there on the basis of their own concerns, uncertainties, I should say their own uncertainties around spending capital. And then of course, there\u2019s some capital spending that\u2019s required under the ACA for IT and so forth. And so, I think those are also capturing a greater part of the pie than we\u2019re used to. But I don\u2019t know that there was anything in particular I would point out.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Tao Levy with Wedbush. Please go ahead.","Tao L. Levy \u2013 Wedbush Securities, Inc.","","Good afternoon. So one of the questions I had was just jumping on what Dan had just asked, is there anything that you are doing differently now on the activities or investments that you weren\u2019t doing previously just to address some of the challenges that have cropped up over the last few quarters?","Gary S. Guthart","","No, I think the things that are \u2013 perhaps front and center is making sure that people have access to all the data that\u2019s out there. There is an enormous amount of published literature on da Vinci. People looking for proof points can absolutely find them. I think the total publication database now is greater than 5,000 peer-review general articles on da Vinci. The number of Level 2 evidence and above, high level evidence is greater than 200. The issue was not a dearth of clinical data. There are cost studies, we\u2019ll be posting them on links to them on the web. I mean, there is a fair amount out there. What we can do better is make sure people know it and see it and are able to digest it, so we\u2019ve been doing that kind of activity.","We\u2019ve talked about both in Japan and in Europe. The economic analysis that needs to be done with regard to reimbursement from government payers is work that we can do and we\u2019re having success in that work. The data is out there, the analysis can be done and so we\u2019re making those kinds of investments, and so we\u2019ve been scaling.","Tao L. Levy \u2013 Wedbush Securities, Inc.","","Okay. And if you can maybe comment on sort of how we should think about prices per procedure over the near-term until, I guess, systems start to recover? Is it here sort of in the 1850, 1860?","Gary S. Guthart","","I\u2019ll let Calvin go into the modeling and the mix, but before he does just I have a comment. I think there are a couple of things going on. On the things like Single-Site and some of the benign procedures that are more cost-sensitive, we have offerings that reflect that greater cost sensitivity, and we\u2019re happy to provide them. I think that they make sense and they fit the procedure profile.","And at the other end, on the more complex procedures, the cancers, some of the more reconstructive procedures, we have a set of products that carry higher ASPs, Stapler, and Vessel Sealer, and alike. And so, I\u2019ll let Calvin go through the modeling dynamics for you, but those are the push and pull of this kind of conversation.","Calvin Darling","","Great. And as Marshall described on the call, the Q3, the lower revenue per procedure in Q3 specifically was driven by lower stocking orders associated with the lower system sales in Q3 as well as timing of orders. We saw hospitals reducing inventory levels in the quarter as well.","Longer term, Gary was mentioning, the initial sales have an increased utilization of Vessel Sealer product, Firefly, and Stapler will help us garner a larger portion of the overall procedure revenue and serve to bolster our revenue per procedure, but then offsetting that would be diminishing impacts of stocking orders as well as procedure mix as we move deeper into benign procedures, and they become a larger portion of our overall business. It\u2019s likely in the much longer term that this procedure mix could serve to trend the overall revenue per procedure down.","Tao L. Levy \u2013 Wedbush Securities, Inc.","So should we keep it in sort of at this 1860 level or higher?","Calvin Darling","Yes, and there are a lot of factors. I think there were some specific factors that impacted Q3 that will be pretty relevant now as you look at Q4 and next year and some of these other things are longer term.","Tao L. Levy \u2013 Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. So can I just ask last question. And procedure trends in the quarter, it seems like September might have been particularly strong for you guys on a worldwide basis. Is that the case for September year-over-year was pretty much the same?","","Gary S. Guthart","","Generally speaking, you see people coming back from vacations globally in September and so the seasonality there is such that September is stronger than the prior months and we do expect that. And then the other piece is that as our business has a greater share of benign surgeries in it over time, those tend to be more subject to seasonality. So the mix is becoming a more seasonal mix, relative to prior years and so you see that bulk of those effects kind of compound.","Tao L. Levy \u2013 Wedbush Securities, Inc.","","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","","Hi, guys. This is Chris in for David. Can you hear me okay?","Gary S. Guthart","Yes.","Unidentified Analyst","Wonderful. Thank you for taking the questions. First question, I feel like historically the monitor has always been that that procedure growth tries just in utilization. But at this point it feels like the rate of change and the delta per procedure is a lot slower than what\u2019s happening at the system level and that\u2019s kind of given rise to this over capacity debate a little bit and I\u2019m little bit curious about how your visibility and given the revised guidance, where the confidence is coming from and the revised outlook on systems growth, what has changed in the conversations with the administrators for some of the pipeline accounts that makes you feel that these guys are still on the pipeline that they won\u2019t push out, their decision making in another six months, nine months or 12 months and maybe you could share a couple of other anecdotes of specific conversations that are happening to get, let\u2019s have a better feel for it?","Gary S. Guthart","I\u2019ll answer the last part first. On the system side, I think that we\u2019ve given you a pretty broad range for the results for Q4, and Calvin even said this in his script, that reflects uncertainty as to how capital will close. And so I don\u2019t think we exited any particular confidence on what will happen in Q4 relative to Q3.","Our visibility to procedures is better. It is imperfect, but it is better than into capital purchasing decisions, particularly in the U.S. where you\u2019re seeing some market dynamic changes. And so, we\u2019ve given you a broad range and the reason for that broad range is it\u2019s hard to predict how hospital administration will make some of their decisions. And right now some of the anecdotes are that hospital administrators are trying to project what their revenues will look like as the elements of the ACA get implemented and that revenue uncertainty on their side just flows through into the capital decision making uncertainty and down the line.","Unidentified Analyst","","Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And if I could have a follow-up here, I\u2019m curious I noted there is a lot of work being done on the share repurchase side, but given the significant amount of cash that you guys have in the financial flexibility, is there any reason that you wouldn\u2019t be able to up the R&D spending and really focus on addressing some of the concerns that have been out in the media and some of the major bodies recently to help, address some of the perception issues that seem to kind of keep coming up and potentially could be impacting some of the near-term system placement sales. And I feel like with the financial flexibility that more repurchases could also up that level of spending. Is that something that is on the table or has been considered or not?","Gary S. Guthart","There\u2019s a couple of things wrapped together there, just kind of teasing them apart. With regard to the R&D spend side, we\u2019re thoughtful and serious about our R&D priorities and the spending that goes with it. We listen really carefully to surgeons and hospital customers about what we think they need and what they think they need to make for both great surgery and surgery whose economics make sense for all the players. And so that\u2019s the product enrollment pipeline and something that we do continuously.","With regard to R&D being the solution to some of the concerns in the press, I\u2019d encourage you to go, look at our website, look at the data. Safety profile of da Vinci is outstanding when it\u2019s compared with the surgical alternatives that people have. So I think on that side that\u2019s not really an R&D investment sort of issue. With regard to the use of cash and buybacks and how we think about that alternates, Marshall?","Marshall L. Mohr","We look for opportunities or discontinuities in the share price relative to the market and we did some buybacks this last quarter. It\u2019s really a Board decision. We\u2019ll be having those discussions on an ongoing basis with the Board and you\u2019ll see what comes out of it.","Unidentified Analyst","","All right, great, very helpful. Thank you, guys.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Amit Hazan with Sun Trust. Please go ahead.","Amit Hazan \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","","Thanks very much. Good afternoon guys. I thought may be I\u2019d ask the first question about existing versus new customers, just regarding the U.S. system side if you can distinguish between existing customers adding capacity and then new customers. I think if we think about last quarter you seem to be saying that most of the weakness came from existing customers you choose to differ. It seems like that\u2019s the case again here. What has been happening more on the new customer side, new customer additions and the trend line there?","Marshall L. Mohr","","All right. So just to kind of review the numbers that was mentioned there were 65 total system sales in the third quarter, 22 of them went to brand new customers, Greenfield as we call them and 43 were to existing customers. So and then let\u2019s see, 24 involved trade-ins, so that means 19 added systems for capacity reasons in the quarter.","So I think when you look at the capital environment, we talked about the issuing and I believe that the issue is described whether it\u2019d be capacity from the decreasing growth in benign hysterectomy or the various macro issues including the ACA. I think they really impacted all of these categories.","Amit Hazan \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. And then moving on to the procedure side, I want to address the question, so it\u2019s very clear, I think you might have touched on it, but if we go through the U.S. benign hysterectomy side and think about how to model it for the next several quarters and how you saw this quarter versus last quarter. Is the impact that you are seeing there and obviously I am referring to the developments earlier in the year more than anything. Has it gotten, did it get worse this quarter or was it something that you saw as stable versus last quarter?","Gary S. Guthart","As we mentioned in the script, I think it\u2019s following a pretty normal trajectory or trend from what we introduced in Q2 and in Q3, the Q1, Q2, Q3. So it was pretty stable and I would say, seasonally stable going into a Q3. So not much of a change between the two course.","Amit Hazan \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Great. And then just the last one from me; in terms of the impact from that same noise on other procedure categories; urology or general surgery in the U.S., do you feel at all that hospitals has applied more scrutiny to those as well because of the noise factor coming out of the first half of this year?","Gary S. Guthart","That\u2019s an interesting question Amit. You really have to tease it apart and you have to take a look at the underlying condition, the surgical specialty itself, the alternative opportunity, the alternative treatment. In other words, when you are looking at urology and you are talking about kidney cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer. I think it\u2019s safe to say that, you are more immune to some of these sort of allegations that people are throwing out in the media than you are versus let\u2019s say a benign procedure that has some benign therapies and they will high line cost and some incorrect comparators. And so I would say that the majority of that noise that we have heard and have felt is probably been in the benign GYN ide, more than anything else we have seen thus far. And I think that continues.","Amit Hazan \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Demchick \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hello, this is actually Jon Demchick in for David. Thanks for taking the questions. A quick question on I guess a few pipeline products for you guys; starting with Single-Site, had a question about having restricted capabilities, you mentioned I guess the Needle Driver that should be submitted for 510(k) approval next year, where there plans to expand the restricted capabilities across other aspects of the Single-Site platform like what are the main obstacles in doing this and what impact do you believe that this could have on broader adoption?","Aleks Cukic","I think the first question is limited to Needle Driver, can it be good taking more broadly. I think that the Needle Driver is clearly the first one to go with, with regard to Single-Site and applied to hysterectomy. I think that once you have that architecture you can start to broaden and in terms of what\u2019s possible and the decision that would be made is to which ones coming next and why we\u2019ll have a lot to do with which indications are the next most interesting indications for Single-Site and so that will be a process. If you follow this for a while you\u2019d see same kind of behavior that as indications change then you bring instruments and help you optimize that set of indications.","Jonathan Demchick \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Okay. And then second also, I guess moving on to the Stapler rollout and as you continue with the rollout I was just wondering if there was a potential timeline on expanding the Stapler offering the different sizes to maybe deal in one effective bariatric surgery or other surgeries?","Gary S. Guthart","","So our first expansion will really be in terms of number of site supported with the existing Stapler. So the Stapler we have today is really targeted and optimized for colorectal procedures in terms of how big it is and what these Staple Reloads look like. And so we are going to do that and that\u2019s where we are focused on in the near-term. Longer-term, we are working on prototypes and developing the capabilities for other types of reloads focused on other types of procedures and we will do that. That will be further out. That\u2019s not a near-term.","Jonathan Demchick \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Okay, very helpful and just had a quick follow-up on the procedure guidance. I know you guys have given a little bit of detail here, but I just wanted to push a little further. I think it implies roughly 13% to 17% procedure growth in the fourth quarter and I was wondering if maybe you could discuss some of the assumptions across the product categories that you revealed in that guidance, and if you see any significant acceleration or deceleration across any of the large groups.","Gary S. Guthart","","Yes, I think it\u2019s probably similar to the commentary we had last quarter and at the higher end of the range you\u2019re talking about a continuation of the trends that we\u2019re on from benign gynecology, general surgery and prostatectomy in the U.S. as well as international growth rates. At the lower end of the guidance it\u2019ll just be contemplation of other factors coming to play in terms of a further decline in benign, demand for benign procedures. You\u2019re entering a quarter that\u2019s typically very strong seasonally and if it comes out less strong for some reason that\u2019d be considered as well as if you see any changing trends in the cholecystectomy or prostatectomy that will be reflective in the lower end.","Jonathan Demchick \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Thank you, very helpful.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bob A. Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Can you hear me okay?","Gary S. Guthart","","Yes, we can. Yes.","Bob A. Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Good afternoon. So I just wanted to ask you a big picture question on procedure volume growth. If I look at the model going back to the first quarter of 2012, your procedure volume growth was close to 30% and it\u2019s kind of going down a little bit each quarter and now we\u2019re at 16% this quarter and you\u2019re looking at fourth quarter maybe being at the same level or a little bit lower. And so I guess just from a big picture perspective I want to get a sense of your confidence that this sort of mid-teens procedure volume growth rate is close to a bottom or is the bottom? Any thoughts there would be helpful.","Gary S. Guthart","I don\u2019t think we are ready to give really 2014 guidance. What I\u2019d say here in terms of what are that dynamics, what\u2019s going on underneath these things. I think we have a large category that in the U.S. were quickly and is now growing more slowly and that was gynecology and we have a large category in the U.S. in general surgery that\u2019s on the early part of this adoption and I think the answer to your question is going to come down to the rates of that growth on both of those sides and I think what you would expect of the company is to manage the activities that would support growth and so in the U.S. our activities are focused on supporting surgical growth and that comes down to making sure the product set makes sense for that customer, making sure that our training capability is aligned and ready to go, our sales force is capable of doing what they need to do and we have opportunity for growth or accelerate growth in U.S. markets, in Japan, where we\u2019re making investments in Europe. So those are the underlying drivers and how it shapes out in future quarters we\u2019ll report to you as we have greater\u2026","Bob A. Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","I appreciate that and I wasn\u2019t really asking about any particular quarter, just asking about all the different trends that are impacting growth and where we stand now and just trying to kind of gauge your confidence on. At this point there are more positives to negatives and again just trying to gauge confidence as to sort of where we are in the cycle right now and your confidence that this is obviously critically important metric to your company that we have your best sense as to where that\u2019s going to fall out.","Gary S. Guthart","One of the challenges, Bob has always been trying to read the assumptions that we\u2019ve given you and hold them for long periods of time. In other words, we\u2019re almost \u2013 the way the question is framed, it\u2019s almost asking us to sort of freeze the assumption as the final assumptions and not take into consideration things like potential expansion of, let\u2019s say Single-Site hysterectomy and\/or international market growth where we\u2019re putting in a lot of resources and training centers and so on and so forth.","So I would say from a confidence standpoint, we believe there are a lot of future drivers and present drivers in the business and it becomes as it always does, an execution story, both downstream and upstream execution of what we think are great opportunities and that\u2019s what you should judge us on and that\u2019s where our focus is.","Calvin Darling","Bob, time for one more follow-up question.","Bob A. Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Thanks. Just one real quick one on utilization, that\u2019s also a challenging part of the model going forward. How do you think that we should be thinking about utilization sort of per system going forward? I assume that that needs to continue to climb up, but just any general thoughts on kind of utilization per installed base as we look forward.","Gary S. Guthart","","Yes, I mean if you look at just the trends right, coming up prior to 2013, we\u2019ve seen gradual increases in utilization per system as measured by procedures done in a quarter as a numerator and a denominator of the systems installed at the beginning of the quarter. We\u2019ve seen that gradually increasing. Now you get to 2013 with the moderating growth in benign gynecology. Now you\u2019re seeing moderate decreases in each of the first three quarters of this year.","Yeah, ultimately I think we\u2019d still say procedures are really what drive this business here. There are other factors that impact the timing of system sales, which we\u2019ve been through, but again procedures and the greater growth there is going to be the key and I think the ultimate utilization is going to depend on a lot of factors; hospitals gaining efficiency, Affordable Care Act, procedure mix. So the ultimate direction, it\u2019s hard to really say.","Bob A. Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Thanks very much.","Gary S. Guthart","","That was the last question. As we have said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma.","The following is a part of an interview published by Medscape with Dr. Joseph Colella, Director of Robotic Surgery at Magee Women\u2019s Hospital, part of UPMC.","When he was asked about the future of robotic assisted surgery, the answer is follows, \u201cAs a potential patient stop for a moment and put on the commonsense hat. Your surgeon tells you that he can see 100% better in three dimensions that he can sew better and in the future, he will be able to do every procedure through one incision. You can imagine that the sky is the limit in employing robotic surgery. It\u2019s an enabling technology. I firmly believe that we are finding new and beneficial applications, almost on a monthly basis. For instance, nobody ever thought you would be able to resect tumors of larynx without taking half of the face apart to get to them. With the robot in the right hands, you can do those operations in an hour and the patient goes home the next day.\u201d","This concludes our today\u2019s call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery and we look forward to next three months.","Operator"," Thank you.

(Operator Instructions) and as a reminder this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the conference over to Calvin Darling, Senior Director of Finance for Intuitive Surgical. Please go ahead.","Calvin Darling","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive Surgical\u2019s fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Aleks Cukic, our Vice President of Strategic Planning.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.","Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release has been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our fourth quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session.","Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our fourth quarter financial results. Aleks will discuss marketing and clinical highlights, then I will provide our financial forecast for 2012, and finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.","With that, I will turn it over to Gary.","Gary S. Guthart","Thank you for joining us on the call today. 2012 has been a productive year at Intuitive, in the past year our focus was in the following four areas; first, continued growth in gynecology and urology worldwide. Second, disciplined execution of our Single-Site and vessel sealing launches. Third, building robust clinical programs with leading customers in emerging procedures in general surgery, thoracic surgery and transoral surgery.","And finally strengthening our capabilities in international markets. In reviewing the year I'll turn first to procedures. Year-over-year growth in procedures finished at 25%, led by continued uptick in gynecology and growing use of da Vinci in general surgery. The gynecology growth was broad-based with increased use of da Vinci surgery for gynecologic oncology, hysterectomy, myomectomy, and sacrocolpopexy. General surgery growth was substantial in the year led by increased use of da Vinci in colorectal procedures and Cholecystectomy, the latter driven by interest in da Vinci Single-Site.","Global urology as a category was up slightly for the year, pressured by a significant reduction in prostatectomies in the United States. As we have mentioned on prior calls, we believe the reduction in prostatectomy is the result of a combination of factors including recommendations moving away from the use of PSA testing for early detection and an increase in non-definitive treatment pathways such as watchful waiting.","However we did see a quarterly sequential rise in the United States in prostatectomies from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2012. Aleks will take you through greater detail on our procedure performance later in the call.","Turning to da Vinci surgery outside of the United States in 2012 we focused on improving our performance in Asia and in Europe. In Japan, reimbursement approval for da Vinci Prostatectomy contributed to significant early uptake of systems and procedures. In the fourth quarter, we have received clearance for our da Vinci Si System in Japan and customer shipments for Si are planned to commence in the first quarter of 2013.","We expect progress in Japan to proceed in steps as we pursue additional instrument regulatory clearances and additional procedure reimbursement. In Europe, we made progress in the fourth quarter, seeing a significant increase in system sales as we invested in deepening our organization. However for our commentary through the year, we have more work to do in building our organization to perform in a challenging environment. We expect these challenges in Europe and our investments to continue for the next several quarters.","Our product launches proceeded well in 2012, response to our da Vinci Vessel Sealer and Single-Site instrument kit was positive in the year, with over 450 Si customers purchasing Single-Site starter kits. Surgeon acceptance of Vessel Sealer has been encouraging with Vessel Sealer used focused on colorectal surgeons as well as GYN and Oncologist. We received 510(k) clearance in the United States for our da Vinci Stapler and we planned to start a controlled roll out over the next several weeks. Our rollout this year for our Stapler will be carefully phased and focused on excellent customer experiences.","For our prior calls, in Q3 of 2012 we submitted a 510(k) for an additional set of instruments and an expanded indication for Single-Site, for use in Hysterectomy and Nephrectomy. Our dialog with FDA on this kit has been constructive.","In imaging, we submitted a 510(k) application to expand indications for our Firefly Fluorescence imaging system to use in biliary imaging. We believe this will have application for use in imaging in the common bile duct during Cholecystectomy, and we\u2019ll complement the use of Single-Site.","Looking back at the full year 2012, our operating highlights are as follows. World wide procedures grew by approximately 25%. We sold 620 da Vinci Surgical Systems in the year, up from 534. Total revenue grew to $2.178 billion, up 24% over 2011. Recurring revenue grew to $1.246 billion, up 27% and comprising 57% of total revenue. We generated $1.31 billion in operating profit before non-cash stock compensation expense, up 24% from last year and GAAP net income grew to $657 million, up 33% year-over-year.","Turning to operating highlights for the fourth quarter. Procedures grew approximately 25% over the fourth quarter of last year. We sold 175 da Vinci surgical systems, up from 152 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Total revenue for the quarter was $609 million, up 23% from the fourth quarter of 2011. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $254 million, up 29%.","We generated an operating profit of $286 million in the quarter before non-cash stock compensation expense, up 22% from the fourth quarter of last year and GAAP net income grew to $175 million, up 16%. We ended the year with $2.921 in cash and investments, up $219 million from last quarter and up $749 million from last year.","We received $263 million in cash during the year from the exercise of stock options and invested $180 million in intellectual property, working capital, property, plant and equipment, and $238 million in stock repurchases for the year. In the quarter, we added 170 people to our team predominantly in our clinical sales force, our manufacturing team and design functions in Q4, bringing our total team to 2,362 employees.","Looking to 2013, our priorities are as follows: first, continued focus on use of da Vinci in gynecology; second, supporting emerging growth for da Vinci in general surgery; third, disciplined execution of our stapling and Single-Site for hysterectomy launches, focused on outstanding early customer experiences; and finally, continuing to strengthen our capabilities in international markets particularly Europe and Japan.","I'll now pass the time over to Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer to take us through our financial performance in greater detail.","Marshall L. Mohr","Thank you, Gary. Our fourth-quarter revenue was $609 million, up 23% compared to $497 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 and up 13% compared to $538 million last quarter. Fourth quarter revenues by product category were as follows; fourth quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $254 million, up 29% compared with $196 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 and up 16% compared with $218 million in the third quarter of 2012.","The year-over-year increase in I&A was driven by procedure growth of approximately 25%, sales of new instrument and accessory products, including Single-Site, Vessel Sealer and Firefly and higher stocking orders associated with higher system unit sales. The year-over-year procedure growth was led by U.S. gynecology and general surgery procedures, partially offset by lower growth in Europe and a year-over-year decrease in U.S. dVP's of approximately 17%.","The sequential increase in I&A revenue compared with the last quarter was driven by higher procedure volume benefitting from favorable fourth quarter seasonality in benign procedures, higher new product sales, higher initial stocking orders, and the timing of distributor orders.","Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including initial stocking orders was approximately $2,050 per procedure, which is higher than the $1,980 realized in the fourth quarter of 2011, and the third quarter of 2012. The sequential year-over-year increases were driven by higher new product sales, including Vessel Sealers, Single-Site kit, and Firefly kits.","Higher initial stocking orders associated with higher systems unit sales, and the timing of distributor orders.","Fourth quarter 2012 systems revenue, $265 million, increased 18% compared with $225 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of 14% compared with $232 million for the third quarter of 2012. We saw 175 systems in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared with 152 systems in the fourth quarter of 2011, and 155 systems in the third quarter of 2012. Our fourth quarter average sales price per system was $1.49 million, slightly above the $1.47 million realized in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $1.48 million realized last quarter.","ASPs include all da Vinci models, all simulators, and Firefly when configure with the systems and exclude upgrades. Fourth quarter ASP's benefited from the favorable mix of dual console systems, Firefly enabled systems, and direct sales to Europe. ASPs will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on product, customer, and trade-in mix as well as foreign exchange rates on direct sales to international customers.","We sold 150 simulators during the quarter, mostly in conjunction with new system sales compared with 123 last year and 87 last quarter. We sold 32 dual console systems compared with 29 last year and 20 last quarter. 52 of our fourth quarter 2012 system sales involve trade-in comprised of 40 da Vinci S and 12 standard models. 50 of our fourth quarter 2011 sales all trade-in, and 34 of our third 2012 sales all trade-in.","Service revenue increased to $91 million, up 20% compared with $75 million last year and up 3% compared with $88 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue is primarily driven by a larger system installed base.","Total fourth quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue increased to $344 million, up 27% compared with the fourth quarter of 2011 and up 13% compared with the third quarter of 2012. Recurring revenue represented 57% of total fourth quarter revenue compared with 55% in the fourth quarter last year and 57% last quarter.","International revenue results were as follows. Fourth quarter revenue outside the U.S. was $131 million, up 23% compared with revenue of $107 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and up 14% compared with revenue of $115 million in the third quarter of 2012. Our year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter international revenue growth was driven by increased procedures and higher system revenue.","Fourth quarter 2012 international procedure volume was approximately 21% higher than the fourth quarter of 2011, and 15% higher than the seasonally lower third quarter of 2012. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we sold 42 systems outside the U.S. compared with 39 in the fourth quarter of 2011 and 41 last quarter. We sold 24 systems in Europe this quarter compared with 23 in the fourth quarter of 2011 and 13 last quarter.","We sold 10 systems in Japan this quarter compared with five last year and 16 last quarter.","A higher mix of systems to direct customers in Europe also contributed to higher system revenue in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared with the third quarter and the fourth quarter 2011. Aleks will provide additional details in international system sales.","Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2012 was 71.9% compared with 73.1% during the fourth quarter of 2011, with 72.5% last quarter. Our lower year-over-year gross margin percentage resulted primarily from lower margins earned on our newer Single-Site and Vessel Sealer products, are slight decline in margin percentage compared with the third quarter is mostly due to the lower margins on a higher volume of our Vessel Sealer product.","Fourth quarter 2012; operating expenses of $190 million were up 16%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2011, and up 6% compared with the third quarter of 2012. Our higher fourth quarter 2012 operating expenses were primarily driven by variable compensation associated with our higher fourth quarter revenue and headcount addition.","Fourth quarter 2012 operating income was $248 million or 41% of sales compared with $200 million or 40% of sales for the fourth quarter of 2011, and $211 million or 39% of sales for the third quarter of 2012. Fourth quarter 2012 operating income reflected $38 million of non-cash stock compensation expense, compared with $35 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, and $47 million last quarter.","Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 31%, compared with 26% for the fourth quarter of 2011, and 15% last quarter. I want to remind you that the third quarter of 2012 tax rate of 15% included discrete tax benefits of $38 million associated with the expiration of statutes of limitations. Our fourth quarter 2011 rates up 26% reflected the federal R&D credit and discrete benefits associated with state tax return.","Our fourth quarter 2012 rate up 31% is in line with our expectation and excluded the impact of the federal R&D credit reinstatement which was enacted in 2013 and will be reflected at the discrete item in the first quarter of 2013. We estimate the R&D tax credit benefit for 2012 will be between $6 million and $8 million.","Our net income was $175 million or $4.25 per share compared with $151 million from $3.75 per share from the fourth quarter of 2011 and $183 million or $4.46 per share for the third quarter of 2012. Excluding the third quarter discrete tax benefits of $38 million, our third quarter net income would have been $145 million or $3.54 per share.","Let me quickly summarize our results for the full year of 2012. Procedures grew by 25% to approximately 450,000. Total revenue was $2.179 billion up 24% compare with $1.757 billion last year. The revenue increase included recurring revenue growth of 27% and an increase in systems revenue of 20%. Full year operating income was $878 million, up 26% compared with $695 million last year. Operating income included $153 million of stock-based compensation charges compared with $136 million in 2011.","Net income was $657 million or $15.94 per share compared with $495 million or $12.32 per share last year. 2012 net income included approximately $46 million associated with statutes of limitations and a change in rules for 199 tax credit. Excluding these items, net income would have been $610 million or $14.85 per share. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $814 million compared with $678 million last year.","Now, moving on to cash flows. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and investments of $2.9 billion up $220 million compared with September 30, 2012. The increase was driven by $217 million of cash flows from operations about $87 million from the exercise of stock-option, partially offset by $53 million in stock buybacks and $61 million of capital and IT purchases.","We bought back 102,000 shares at an average price of $524 per share, and we have $330 million Board authorized buybacks remaining.","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks to go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights.","Aleks Cukic","Thank you, Marshall. During the fourth quarter we sold 175 da Vinci systems, 133 in the United States, 24 into Europe and 18 into rest of world markets. As part of the 175 system sales, 12 standard da Vinci systems and 40 da Vinci S systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si systems. We had a net 123 system additions to the installed base during the quarter, which brings to 2585 the cumulative number of da Vinci systems worldwide, 1878 in the United States, 416 in Europe, and 291 in rest of world markets. 114 of the 175 systems installed during the quarter represented repeat system sales to existing customers.","In total, 167 of the 175 system sold represented da Vinci Si or Si-e systems, which included 32 dual console systems. The 42 system sales internationally included 10 into Japan, four into Italy and three into the countries of Denmark, Switzerland, and Canada. Overall, our da Vinci sales remained strong through the year totaling 620 systems.","Clinically, we finish the year strong with Q4 year-over-year procedure growth of approximately 25%. The specialties of GYN and general surgery were responsible for most of this growth. dVP more specifically U.S. dVP, a topic we\u2019ve extensively discussed over the past several quarters declined 17% on a Q4 over Q4 basis, but was up 2% on a sequential basis, while the rate of decline has tampered a bit, we are not in position to declare an endpoint to its decline.","Our fourth quarter growth rate matched our 2012 overall procedure growth rate of 25%. U.S. procedure growth for the year was approximately 26% as compared to 23% for our international markets. The specialties of GYN and general surgery contributed the overwhelming majority of 2012 procedure growth.","Benign hysterectomy, Cholecystectomy, colon and rectal resections, endometriosis resection, partial nephrectomy, and sacrocolpopexy were the largest individual contributors to procedure growth, which more than offset the decline within our 2012, U.S. dVP business. The U.S. procedure breakdown for 2012 was as follows; total procedures grew to approximately 373,000, up from 292,000 in 2011.","Total GYN grew to approximately 222,000 procedures, up from 170,000 in 2011. dVH accounted for approximately 176,000 procedures, up from 140,000 in 2011. Urology accounted for approximately 88,000 procedures, which were down from approximately 93,000 in 2011. U.S. dVP declined from approximately 73,000 to 62,000 procedures. general surgery procedures increased to approximately 42,000, up from 15,000 in 2011, representing a 173% increase.","Recently released new products continue to do well, notably Single Site. Early customers\u2019 feedback has been positive and our initial sales have been strong. through the fourth quarter, we\u2019ve sold Single-Site instrument in accessory kids to approximately 450 U.S. customers.","Our recently launched Vessel Sealer product continues to pick up clinical momentum with most of the interest coming from colorectal, advanced general and GYN clinicians. The customer adoption for both da Vinci Simulator and Firefly continues to expand, with 115 customers purchasing a da Vinci Simulator and 88 customers purchasing Firefly systems, as part of their da Vinci purchase this quarter.","During the quarter, several hundred robotic abstracts and papers representing a variety of surgical specialties were published within various peer-reviewed journals while quarterly conferences produced several live da Vinci procedure transmissions, postgraduate robotic courses, podium presentations and clinical poster sessions. Some of our early general surgery success is rooted within complex procedures, which are often considered difficult to perform through traditional laparoscopic technique.","Laparoscopic mid and low rectal cancer resections have for years proved challenging for even the most advanced laparoscopic surgeons and as a result, clinical adoption remains low. The added benefit of da Vinci\u2019s articulated instrumentation, Intuitive movement and magnified 3D HD vision, has provided a new foundation for MIS advancement in this field. A recent three arm comparison out at the Department of Surgery at Yonsei University College of Medicine was published in the anal surgery, the study reported pathologic results, morbidity, preoperative recovery and short-term oncologic results of 165 patients undergoing robotic laparoscopic and open, mid and low rectal cancer procedures. The findings from this case, this case match study revealed that robotic surgery for the treatment of mid to low rectal cancer resulted in significant decreases in the amount of analgesia used, postoperative pain and length of stay.","Although sphincter-preserving procedures were frequently performed with robotic surgery, the incidents of circumferential margin involvement and immediate postop vomiting problems showed a significant decrease with robotic surgery as compared with open surgery. Robotic surgery showed better recovery outcomes than lab surgery with regard to time to resume diet and length of hospital stay.","The visual analog scale was significantly lower in robotic surgery than in laparoscopic surgery and open surgery from postoperative days one through five and no significant differences were found in two year disease free survival rate between the three groups, causing the authors to conclude anticlot, robotic surgery maybe an effective tool in the effort to maximize the advantages of minimally invasive surgery and the management of mid and low rectal cancers.","The clinical pursuit toward nephron-sparing kidney surgery has increased significantly over the past several years and with more and more urologists adopting Partial Nephrectomy. A 500 patient study out of the Cleveland clinic entitled Comparative Outcomes and Assessment of Trifecta in 500 robotic and laparoscopic Partial Nephrectomy was published in the Journal urology.","Trifecta is defined as a partial nephrectomy where warm ischemia time is kept below 25 minutes with negative surgical margins and no perioperative complications. The study reported that even with a more complex tumor profiles found in the da Vinci cohort operating times were nearly 22 minutes less as compared to the laparoscopic cohort, 169 minutes versus 191 minutes.","Intra-operative complications, associated with da Vinci patients were less than half when compared to laparoscopy, 2.6% as compared to 5.6%. Postoperative complications were 24.5 in the da Vinci cohort as compared to 32% for patients within the laparoscopic arm. Positive surgical margins were 2.9% in the da Vinci cohort as compared to 5.9 for laparoscopy. The overall Trifecta rate was significantly higher in the da Vinci cohort at 58.7% as compared to 31.6% for the laparoscopic group. These findings led to the author's conclusion and \u201cour large analysis shows that robotic partial nephrectomy offers a wider range of indications, better operative outcomes and lower perioperative morbidity compared to laparoscopic partial nephrectomy\u201d.","Overall request for Trifecta seems to be better accomplished by robotic partial nephrectomy, thus likely to become the new standard technique for minimally invasive partial nephrectomy, close call.","Once again the category of GYN contributed greater total procedure growth than any specialty we serve. da Vinci Sacrocolpopexy volume trails only da Vinci Hysterectomy within this specialty and it continued its solid growth during the year. In a recent edition of female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery, physicians from the University of South Florida reported the results of their 164 patient study comparing da Vinci Sacrocolpopexy to Open Sacrocolpopexy. This retrospective study focused on costs, operative time, and the length of stay for each group. Within this study both system costs and maintenance costs were considered and included. The authors reported that the median operative time for Open Sacrocolpopexy and da Vinci Sacrocolpopexy was 166 minutes and 212 minutes respectively. Estimated blood loss averaged 150 milliliters in the Open Sacrocolpopexy as compared to just 50 milliliters within the da Vinci patient cohorts.","Length of stay for the da Vinci group averaged two days as compared to three days for the Open Sacrocolpopexy group. However 48% of the women treated within the da Vinci group experienced a length of stay of less than 24 hours as compared to just 1% for the women undergoing in Open Sacrocolpopexy. The median direct costs reported for the da Vinci group was $6,668 as compared to $7,804 for the open group. The overall costs reported for the robotics group was $9,725 as compared to $12,485 for the Open Sacrocolpopexy group with similar readmission rates at 30 days post-op. The author stated that while da Vinci sacrocolpopexy took slightly longer to perform than in open sacrocolpopexy, both the direct and indirect cost for the da Vinci Sacrocolpopexy was less than for open sacrocolpopexy.","This concludes my remarks. And I\u2019ll now turn the time over to Calvin.","Calvin Darling","Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing you with our financial forecast for 2013 including procedures, revenues and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates of significant non-cash expenses to provide you with visibility into our expected future cash flows.","Starting with procedures, in 2013, we expect procedure growth to be driven by U.S. gynecology, U.S. general surgery and international dVP procedures. We expect our 2013 total procedures to grow approximately 20% to 23% from the base of approximately 450,000 procedures performed in 2012.","Based on an increasing proportion of the nine short-term elected procedures in our procedure mix, we anticipate a more pronounced quarterly seasonality impact in 2013 as compared to 2012, resulting in proportionally lower Q1 and Q3 procedure volumes and proportionally higher Q4 volumes.","Moving on to revenues, in 2013, we expect to achieve annual revenue growth of between 16% and 19%. We expect typical capital sales seasonality in 2013 with the proportion of full-year system units sold on each quarter to follow a pattern fairly consistent with 2012. We would expect the U.S. system to be sold in the upcoming seasonally slower first quarter than in the recently completed seasonally stronger fourth quarter.","As a result, total first quarter 2013 revenue is likely to be lower than the fourth quarter of 2012. All of 2013 revenues particularly capital sales are subject to the impact of economic conditions.","Now turning to operating income; our full year 2012 operating income was 40.3% of revenue. In 2013, as we reviewed on our last call, the medical device tax has become effective. Based upon our 2012 regional and product mix, we would estimate the tax to equate to roughly 1.1% of our consolidated revenue. We plan to record the expense as a component of cost of sales, thus impacting both gross and operating profit margins.","We also expect the impact of new products to shift our overall gross margin percentage slightly lower in 2013. In addition, we expect to continue to invest in field sales and training resources to support procedure adoption. Based upon these factors, we expect our 2013 operating income to fall within a range of between 38% and 39% of revenue. Consistent with prior years, we would expect our operating income as a percent of revenue to be lower in the first quarter of 2013, reflecting system sales and procedure seasonality.","2013 operating expenses should follow a quarterly growth pattern similar to 2012 with Q1 reflecting the full quarter impact of our Q4 new hires. We expect our non-cash stock compensation charges to increase from $153 million reported in 2012, to approximately $184 million to $192 million in 2013. Amortization of purchased and intellectual property, which is mostly reported as R&D expense is expected to increase from $23 million in 2012, to $28 million to $30 million in 2013.","Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income, was approximately $16 million in 2012. We expect other income to grow to between $18 million and $23 million in 2013.","With regard to income tax, on our last call we have estimated a 2013 income tax rate of between 29% and 31% of pretax income. Now including the impact of the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit for 2013, we anticipate our base full year tax rate to fall within the range of between 28% and 30% of pretax income.","As Marshall mentioned, we expect to recognize a discrete benefit of between $6 million and $8 million during the first quarter of 2013 related to the reinstatement of the 2012 R&D tax credit. This discrete item will result in a downward adjustment of our Q1 2013 income tax expense from the $28 million to $30 million full year rates.","We estimate our share count for calculating EPS in Q1 2013, will be approximately 41.2 million shares. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Lennox Ketner with Bank of America.","Lennox Ketner \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Hi, can you hear me, okay?","Gary S. Guthart","","Yeah.","Lennox Ketner \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Great. Congratulations on a good quarter. I guess first on, I just wanted to touch base on general surgery and the growth you\u2019re seeing in Cholecystectomy. I am wondering at this point in Europe is it possible to speak kind of either quantitatively or qualitatively to how much of that uptick you think is trialing versus the key procedures? I don\u2019t know, if you can give any sense as to what percentage of the 450 customers that have bought Single-Site, kits have bought second kits or if it\u2019s possible to speak it although to how much do you think is trialing versus the key procedures?","Aleks Cukic","Well, I think it\u2019s really too early to say what is a trend, what is ultimately a long-term expectation. It\u2019s our belief and what we can say at this point, and it\u2019s our belief that with 450 U.S. customers purchasing starter kids that there\u2019s a lot of interest in people moving towards single incision surgery. trying to define how many of those we will have going forward that a part of the initial purchase is difficult to say. But I think we\u2019re most pleased with the fact that it is indeed a large number of U.S. customers that are going through the purchasing activity and actually doing these procedures today.","Lennox Ketner \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. and then just as a follow-up. there is some concern around the recent AAGL statement regarding robotic hysterectomies, in fact that AAGL doesn\u2019t believe it should be used to replace laparoscopic hysterectomies, I know that most of your hysterectomy procedures that are being done right now are \u2013 it\u2019s actually replacing open surgeries that I\u2019m wondering if you could maybe just frame for people on a go-forward basis, what percentage of the hysterectomy market, you think is still being done as open procedures, just so people have a sense as to what the remaining opportunity is there in terms of simply converting open procedures to robotic?","Gary S. Guthart","Well, you are right, I think many of the studies that were cited in the AAGL statement actually compare robotic surgery to laparoscopic surgery, and really failed to recognize that the majority of the robotic cases would have probably previously been done via laparotomy. We had as you recall as we\u2019ve gone through our sizing if you will of our target market, we\u2019ve talked about this pretty specifically over the years, when we started really with the da Vinci Hysterectomy, I think it was estimated that somewhere along the lines of 66% of the hysterectomies performed in the United States were being performed through laparotomy. I believe the solution database, which is a division of Thomson Reuters, I think in their most recent publication I think goes to 2011, they estimated that only 39% of the procedures in the United States, now the hysterectomy procedures are being performed through laparotomy.","You know, vaginal, I think, was something like 14%, laparoscopy was around 16% and the remainder was through da Vinci. So our objective really is to move these complex procedures from open invasive incisions to minimally invasive surgery and I believe that the record shows that that\u2019s taking place.","Lennox Ketner \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. thanks very much. ","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC","Good afternoon guys, two questions from me. first, can you talk about the adoption curve that you\u2019ve seen in Gen Surg so far and if you adjust for the installed base change, how it compares to maybe dVH most appropriately?","Aleks Cukic","Well, it\u2019s interesting in general surgery versus let\u2019s say dVH, as we\u2019re talking about a category. within the general surgery category if I\u2019m not mistaken, there have been some where around 40 plus procedures that have gone into the category of general surgery that have been done \u2013 performed with da Vinci. So it\u2019s difficult to really compare apples-to-apples between a category and let\u2019s say something like dVH, which is a single procedure and it\u2019s even more difficult comparing it to let\u2019s say dVP, which is a single procedure that is always done for a single disease, which is cancer. In other words, there\u2019s just too many inconsistencies between the three, but what we will say is within the category of general surgery, the two procedures that are driving a great deal of that growth are Cholecystectomy and colon surgery, not just low anterior resection, but right colons, left colons, transverse colons et cetera.","Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC","And Aleks, can you talk a little bit about the typical experience for a new general surgeon starting out in sort of wanting to do Single-Site chole or whatever, is there a typical kind of process they go through and how quickly, people are coming up that curve?","Aleks Cukic","That depends on what their experience is going into that case. In other words, are they completely laparoscopically trained, are they laparoscopically naive, are they robotically trained, robotically na\u00efve, and I think each one of those is a little bit different, but I would say that by and large, you will have people that will do multi-incisioned cholecystectomies with the traditional da Vinci system or they will do some other procedures prior to moving into the single incision surgeries. I don\u2019t know that I can say that there is a typical profile and\/or a typical experience.","Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just maybe a quick question for Marshall, can you talk a little bit about the expectations on guidance, and specifically thinking about Europe, if you guide to the 20% to 23% procedure growth, does that give you 25% U.S. and 15% Europe or international more broadly, just characterize for us what you built in there, please? Thanks.","Marshall L. Mohr","We haven\u2019t broken it down and we\u2019ve given you a range, because there is some uncertainty associated with certain elements of the guidance itself. And so, I\u2019m not going to break it down into those details.","Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you.","Aleks Cukic","Yeah.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David R. Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Aleks, I wonder if you could tell us maybe in the back half of 2012 or for all 2012, you think about total general surgery procedures, either in terms of adoption curve steepness either in Single-Site Chole versus LAR. Where you're seeing a steeper relative adoption curve of where the contribution to growth is stronger?","Aleks Cukic","Well, it is too early to say. As you know with adoption curves, it's dangerous to try to project steepness too early in the equation. So try and do really pull out an individual point today and draw a lot of conclusions from it is probably dangerous. But in terms of overall growth, I mean cholecystectomy is as we have said, I think in our previous call is our third largest overall procedure, and that's all cholecystectomy including Single-Site and for incision cholecystectomy, so that one would be growing at a steeper rate.","David R. Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, very helpful. And then Marshall just a quick question on margins, it sounds like some of the dynamic is mix with some of your higher growth procedures coming in at maybe a slightly lower GM. How much of that is simply temporary, when you start getting real scale advantages, back half \u201813 and \u201814, does that sort of vanish and get back to a corporate gross margin for consumables that's more appropriate or are we always going to see some sort of a drag here, just based on how you are pricing somebody\u2019s individual units?","Marshall L. Mohr","This is the variation in margin really have to do with the introduction of new products. And the margins that are earned under this new product. Initially you are dealing with low-volumes, you're dealing with maybe non optimized, may be factoring in and design, those products are, we work on reducing those costs over time, increasing volumes, and reducing those costs over time. But some of those products are more complex than the products we've had in the past, and so it's not practical to predict that it will actually get to the same level of margin and let\u2019s say a simple product that we have.","Gary S. Guthart","Some improve quickly in margin and some take greater investment and longer time.","David R. Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Next, we will go to the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tycho W. Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon. Question maybe first one on dVP, your sequential performance, it was a little bit better than we have been modeling. I know you're somewhat reluctant to the kind of call it bottom here, but can you talk about whether there is any change in your own expectation from kind of a peak to trough drop-off in dVP, and is it too early to start to think about some of those that have dropped out coming back in for surgery?","Gary S. Guthart","Yeah, I think as you started out in your question. I think you accurately stated the way we feel about it. It is too early for us to call 90 days have passed since the last time we talked and we watched a little closer, where we\u2019ve seen a favorable Q4 recognizing the Q3 as historically a seasonally slower quarter. And so I think trying to draw too many conclusions at this stage is probably not in anyone's best interest. So I can say that we didn't see a great deal of difference other than the numbers in terms of the discussions with the physicians, I think people are pretty much in the same place today as they were in Q3, however the numbers have shown an improvement, and we will watch it and we\u2019ll see when we feel safe to call it a drop.","Tycho W. Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then in terms of the quarter, in terms of placements, were you able to call out the impact of DA order at all, we had to keep watching about that.","Gary S. Guthart","So the DA contract was for about $34 million of products that was a contract for both systems initial stocking of instruments and accessories as well as other things that go with like simulators. And we did ship majority of what was under that contract in the last quarter.","Tycho W. Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just last one as we think about full ramp of the stapler here. I know you\u2019re kind of still in the trailing period in working with [KOLs], but when should we think about that moving into kind of full commercial launch.","Aleks Cukic","","We\u2019ll be advancing it carefully the first half of this year and likely through the full year, so in the first half, we expected the customers in this first quarter, and will advance as slowly as we get the customer feedback and really make sure that we\u2019ve optimized their experience. So this will be a conservative launch, really focused on the fact that, stick when you sell, and we want to make sure that our customer is having great experiences.","Tycho W. Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","","Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Lawrence S. Keusch \u2013 Raymond James Financial","","Thanks. Also maybe you can talk a little bit about prostrate and the experience in Europe, I guess there had been some concern that some of the changes in the U.S. here would have a pronounced effect over there, so any thoughts on that would be great.","Aleks Cukic","Well, I think as we\u2019ve said in the past, the world is getting smaller, information is shared quickly and narrow our same senses if you will of participants at both national and international meeting. So I think there is some effect and it is in some markets, it\u2019s probably felt a little bit more than in others. In other words, in a place like Japan where you\u2019re starting relatively new, there is a lot of growth ahead of us and you\u2019re probably powering through that, any concerns \u2013 if there were some concerns about whether or not, PSA screening is appropriate or conserve the treatment, whereas in other countries it\u2019s probably a little bit more pronounced. So I don\u2019t know that we can necessarily label Europe homogenously and believe more international for that matter and believe that it\u2019s something that resembles \u2013 each country resembles the next, but I think there are probably some markets where it\u2019s a little bit more pronounced than others.","Gary S. Guthart","Like in the U.S. it\u2019s a hard think to model.","Lawrence S. Keusch \u2013 Raymond James Financial","Got it and then just two other quick ones, just relative to the 510 clearance that you guys are anticipating for Firefly in \tbiliary, could you talk about how important that is to proceed the option of Single-Site Chole. It seems to me that obviously we can reduce kind of bile duct injuries that would be a positive with that technology. And then separately, I think last quarter you provided some feel for kind of in the U.S. what procedures grew if you were to adjust for the declines in prostatectomy. I was wondering if you can help us with that in the fourth quarter.","","Gary S. Guthart","Just speaking to the first one, the 510(k) submission for Firefly biliary imaging that has just been submitted this quarter, so in terms of when we expect clearance, no end point to tell you about yet. We do think that biliary imaging in real time is interesting and meaningful for Cholecystectomy for the reason that you indicated that a common bile duct injury is a serious complication, and we think that Firefly can augment the white light imaging and be a complement to cholangiography, so that\u2019s the intend. We\u2018ve just started that conversation with FDA and as it proceeds in we have something more material to share we will. With regard to the break outs on kind of the adjustments and the procedure mix, I\u2019ll turn to Aleks.","Aleks Cukic","Yeah, I think it\u2019s pretty consistent with what I had mentioned earlier in terms of Hysterectomy, if cholecystectomy, colorectal surgery, endometriosis resection, partial nephrectomy, I mean those procedures are the ones that I think primarily are the strength for the quarter and for the year.","Gary S. Guthart","Yeah. And just looking at the numbers on a full-year basis, dVP on a full-year basis was down 15%, as Aleks described in his notes, if you kind of back that out in the U.S. everything else was up about 39%.","Lawrence S. Keusch \u2013 Raymond James Financial","Thank you so much.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David H. Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good evening everyone. And I\u2019m certainly echoing the comments earlier on the very strong quarter here. So congrats, nice way to start - end the year and start 2013. I wanted to sort of focus a little bit on the general surgery application and more specifically, can you give some perspective on where the procedures you\u2019re doing are coming from, and I guess what I\u2019m asking is, are these procedures that were done in a laparoscopic setting, were they done open, are these people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise do their procedures, are you adding growth to the market, maybe just any perspective you can give us on the competitive modalities would be helpful?","Aleks Cukic","Yeah. I think if you look at again, we believe, we talked about 42,000 procedures, up from 15,000 in 2011. If you look at the biggest contributor there it\u2019s cholecystectomy. And almost all of those procedures had been done laparoscopically, because the standard of care is laparoscopic cholecystectomy. So that one I think is fairly simple to say where it\u2019s coming from. If you look at bowel surgery and specifically large bowel or colon, you have left colons. You - starting the other side you have right colon is transverse, left sigmoid moving down into the rectum and then you have total colectomy. depending on which procedure each of those are accounted as a different procedure, depending on which of those procedures you\u2019re talking about, if you did it inversely and you started at the most difficult or the lowest penetrated laparoscopically it would be low rectal cancer. There you are talking about data which suggest that it\u2019s single digit penetration of laparoscopy whereas if you\u2019re talking about right colon, it\u2019s double digit and I have seen numbers perhaps as high as 20% or 21% or 22%, that is laparoscopic.","So you have a range of where those patients would have gone either to a open surgery or laparoscopic surgery and then you have a smattering of procedures that range from some open, that would have been done open, whether it would be distal pancreatectomy or liver surgery and then you have other procedures such as Nissens that may have been laparoscopically. So there is a lot of movement that\u2019s going on which is I think was an earlier question that Ben had asked about general surgery, you have what amounts to I think 40 some procedures that have been done and trying to build an individual profile for general surgery is a challenge.","David H. Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then maybe just a follow up on the guidances obviously 20% or 22% procedure guidance is a sold number. I mean look at that in contrasted with a total revenue guidance, it does imply a fairly sharp slowing on the system side of the business. Is there anything particular to call out there, is it comps, is it lapping the Japan reimbursement or anything to help us understand why that business would start \u2013 would slow to the degree that the guidance implies.","Calvin Darling","Yeah, I am not sure that \u2013 yeah the conclusion is absolutely right. I mean there are lot of factors in the guidance including the average selling prices of the systems and the procedures and so on, so yeah. So don\u2019t necessarily agree with the conclusion.","","Marshall L. Mohr","","I think we\u2019ve lived in a good world of \u2013 a good mix on systems. And so I\u2019m not sure that we believe that that system mix in that ASP will hold for the whole year. I think on the I&A front, as we move out in time as we\u2019ve always said, as stocking orders will become a smaller part of the picture and have less impact. And so, we would see some level of pressure on pricing on I&A. and then I think in general, I think we\u2019ve shown over the years, the procedure growth outpaces revenue growth, because our systems generally are not at the same level.","David H. Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then lastly, just to clarify on the share count, you said 41.2 million shares. is that a comment regarding the first quarter or the full-year of 2013?","Gary S. Guthart","That\u2019s the first quarter comment.","David H. Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Got it, thank you.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Rick Wise with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.","Rick A. Wise \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon everybody.","Gary S. Guthart","Hi, Rick.","Rick A. Wise \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","If you could just give us a little more color on some of the structural changes you\u2019re making in Europe. Gary, you indicated that you\u2019re making significant progress as you\u2019ve deepened the organization. just a couple of things, how long do you envision this investment, maybe extraordinary investment process continuing and maybe, give us a little more details about some of the specific actions, if you could that you\u2019re taking place and maybe how you\u2019re approaching the market or Pan-Europe or company specific, anything to just to understand a little better, some of the things that are happening there? Thank you.","Gary S. Guthart","","Yeah. I think with regard to the progress we\u2019ve made, I think we\u2019ve made some progress, I\u2019m not ready to call it significant progress yet. I think that our investments have really been in kind of three areas; one has been getting the right sales reps in the right territories, pretty straight forward. We\u2019ve done that and we\u2019ll continue to do so. And that runs on a set of coverage metrics and kind of market analyses that are pretty straight-forward.","We\u2019ve been making some more targeted investments, this isn\u2019t [cash of thousands] [ph] spent in terms of understanding reimbursement and regulatory and the resources that are required to perform in different markets. And so that\u2019s been a more targeted set of investments. and we\u2019ve invested in some better kind of top line leadership, and I think investments in all three of those are encouraging, but they\u2019re early. I think that we\u2019ll continue to invest for the next several quarters. It isn\u2019t a huge dollar value investments, they\u2019re more targeted in that way, but they\u2019re important. and so far I think that that we\u2019ve made the right first steps, I think we need to continue on that pathway.","Rick A. Wise \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And thank you for that, and you think that the major thrust is completed this year or by midyear just getting any sense of timing?","Gary S. Guthart","I think we\u2019ll be concentrating on it through the year and by this time, next year; we don\u2019t ask that same set of questions.","Rick A. Wise \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Gary S. Guthart","Just time for one more question, if you will.","Rick A. Wise \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Japan, just again, I think you said a significant demand, with the da Vinci Si approval on hand, is this going to be an incremental driver or we\u2019re going to see more upgrades maybe in 2013, getting help or bring that for us? Thank you.","Gary S. Guthart","I think there are really two things to say with regard to Si approval in Japan. The first one is we\u2019re excited about the approval in large part, because it allows us to bring the Japan with follow-on clearances, a set of technologies that we think have really made a down set in the rest of the world and things like Single-Site and Firefly and thus assuming to counsel and simulate or a bunch of things that we invest on the SI system side. So we\u2019re excited about that. I think structurally though in the longer term, the Japanese market penetration will be based by additional procedure reimbursement and so near-term it\u2019s a great thing to get in the hands of Japanese customer. We need to continue to work on reimbursements beyond Prostatectomy and we will continue to do so.","","Rick A. Wise \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you so much.","Gary S. Guthart","Thank you. That was our last question. As we\u2019ve said previously, while we focus on financial metrics, such as revenues and profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value and by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. I hope the following experience from Warne in California gives you some sense what this means in the lives of our patients.","\u201cLast year I made a donation to the Sutter Maternity & Surgery Center. I had no idea that some day I might benefit by the use of this system. Having ontological engineering background, I am interested in innovations that benefit people. I consider this system to be a must have tool for our surgical centers. A few months ago after successive urine samples show traces of blood, my nurse practitioner asked me to see a urologist. Dr. Joe Franks discovered a small cancer in my bladder which I removed on May 8, 2012. A follow up CT scan on May 25, showed a tumor in my left kidney, because I am 88, I was considered borderline for surgery and if the mass appeared to be stable, I might be lucky enough to outlive the tumor.","This was not to be, by late July, I was passing visible blood in my urine. On August 1, Dr. Franks agreed we should go ahead with surgery if my internist gave the okay. On Friday, August 30, internist pronounced me to be fit and I was on the list for surgery. On Saturday, Dr. Franks called me to say there was a surgery cancellation for that Monday morning, August 6.","Using the new da Vinci System I eagerly accepted. Dr. Frank said that, all my stars must have been in the line as the procedure only took about two hours, not counting the admissions procedure. The next day, I walked out of the hospital without having to take any pain medication, much easier than a root canal. Without da Vinci the hospital stay would have been several days.\u201d","Patients like Warne are the strongest applicants for da Vinci surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure you that we remain committed to driving about a few things that truly make the difference.","This concludes today\u2019s call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery and we look forward to talking with you again in three months.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference for today.

Marshall will provide a review of our third quarter financial results. Patrick will discuss procedures and clinical highlights. Then I\u2019ll provide our updated financial outlook for 2014. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Gary.","Gary Guthart","Thank you for joining us on the call today. In this third quarter our customers have continued to advance minimally invasive surgery through the use of their da Vinci surgical systems. Total da Vinci procedures grew nearly 10% over prior year led by multifaceted growth in general surgery and growth in urology in Europe and Asia.","Capital placements in the quarter were solid, totaling 111 systems with strong performance outside of the United States. Our newest system da Vinci Xi is receiving favorable reviews and interest from our customers.","Looking more closely at the United States, growth in general surgery lead the way with procedure -- with the procedure category, our second largest behind gynecology. General surgery procedure growth was broad-based, including conol resection, rectal resection and hernia repair.","Trends present in prior quarters in gynecology continued with stable trends in hysterectomy for malignant conditions combined with the slight decline in benign hysterectomy versus prior year.","Urology grew in the U.S. in the quarter, with strength in prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy. Given the large proportion of da Vinci use in prostate cancer surgery, the increase in da Vinci prostatectomy likely reflects broader trends in patient care.","Turning to systems in the United States, we placed 61 systems in the quarter, 8% of this systems were our newest product the da Vinci Xi Surgical System. In Europe, procedure growth returned to form, growth in Germany improved materially. Likewise, I'm pleased with our performance in France with multiple segments contributing.","Growth in Italy, U.K. and the Nordic countries was also encouraging and broad-based. Capital sales in Europe were strong. We continue to see capital segmentation with interest in both our most featured product the da Vinci Xi System, as well as interest in refurbished systems acquired by price sensitive customers.","In Asia, the urology category leads continues to lead in volume, while procedure growth was driven by both urology and general surgery. As you know from last quarter, we are in the midst of a transition of our commercial business from our distribution partner in Japan to a direct team.","We are building our direct sales organization, as well as building deeper marketing, service and support functions to better serve our Japanese customers. I'm encouraged by their progress.","We continue to pursue additional reimbursement in Japan and surgeons have initiated prospective clinical trials to gather data for this purpose. The reimbursement process in Japan can be lengthy. We will report on our progress as we gain greater clarity.","Turning to the capital sales in Asia, as we've said in the past, timing of placements can be lumpy and Q3 is no exception. We placed 19 systems in the region, 10 of which were to customers in China. Given the role of governments and reimbursements and approvals, the timing of system placements remains hard to predict.","Taken together, our non-GAAP pro forma operating performance for the third quarter is as follows, procedures grew nearly 10% over the third quarter of 2013. We placed 111 da Vinci surgical systems, up from 101 during the third quarter of last year.","Pro forma total revenue was $534 million, up 7% from last year. Pro forma instrument and accessory revenue was $272 million, up 14% over Q3 of 2013. Total pro forma recurring revenue grew to $380 million, up 12% from prior year and comprising 71% of total pro forma revenue.","We generated a pro forma operating profit of $197 million, down 14% from the third quarter of last year and representing 37% of Q3 revenue. Pro forma net income was $145 million, down 45% over last year, and cash and investments in the quarter grew by $219 million.","Our new products continued to gain acceptance with customers. Starting with systems, da Vinci Xi has been well-received. It is being used in a wide range of procedures, including urology, gynecology, general surgery and thoracic surgery.","Positive customer feedback highlights the flexibility and efficiency of set-up, the ability of the system to work over a large workspace in the body, the ability of the endoscope to move to any port and the integration and convenience of the imaging system, including Firefly.","Urologist, colorectal surgeons and general surgeons have been the main proponents for Xi System purchases to date. Also, we received regulatory clearance for da Vinci Xi in Korea earlier this month.","With regard to our dedicated single-port platform da Vinci Sp, we continue to make progress and design for manufacturability and compatibility with Xi. I believe Sp will have strong applicability for procedures in which a single small entry point to the body and parallel delivery of instrument is important. A good example is head and neck surgery. We anticipate initiating clinical use of our Xi compatible Sp in the latter half of 2015 likely in support of regulatory submissions.","We are planning a measured role out of Sp as we receive necessary clearances and optimize our supply chain and now do not expect 510(k) clearance for our Xi compatible Sp in 2015.","Turning to instruments, we initiated a soft use of our da Vinci Si Stapler in the quarter after three reports of malfunction. Our investigation has identifying -- identified the underlying causes of the malfunctions and our team has developed potential solutions. We are making good progress in validating these solutions and we will update our customers and you once these validations are complete.","Finally, we have received 510(k) regulatory clearance and initiated first cases for our Single-Site Wristed Needle Driver, an important addition to our product line for use in single-incision surgery with the Si platform.","The Wristed Needle Driver is the first instrument of its kind, a fully articulating single-port surgery instrument that returns to the surgeon in a wrist capability in a single-incision format.","Gynecologist performing single-incision hysterectomy are expressing a high level of interest and excitement about the Wristed Needle Driver. Surgeons performing initial cases with the Wristed Needle Driver have integrated it seamlessly into their cases, bringing a wrist to Single-Site platform for da Vinci Si further enhances Si\u2019s capability and ease-of-use for surgeons pursuing single-incision technique and provide a capable and cost-effective platform for our customers.","In summary, we are passionately pursuing the long-term opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and are focused on the following. First, extending the benefits of minimally invasive surgery using da Vinci systems worldwide. Building da Vinci capability and supporting its use in general surgery. Disciplined execution in our new product launches and finally continuing to invest in our capabilities in key international markets.","I will now pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer.","Marshall Mohr","Thank you, Gary. I\u2019ll be describing our results on a non-GAAP pro forma basis which excludes the impact of our Xi trade-in programs, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and investment impairments. We\u2019re providing pro forma information in addition to GAAP information because we believe the business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later.","We\u2019ve posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there is no confusion. Pro forma third quarter revenue was $534 million, up 7% compared with $499 million for the third quarter of 2013 and up 5% from last quarter. Procedure growth for the third quarter rounded up to approximately 10%. Compared with the third quarter of 2013, it was seasonally slower by approximately 1% compared with the last quarter. Procedure highlights will be discussed by Patrick.","Pro forma revenue excludes the impact of offers made to customers to trade-in their recently purchased SI product for newly introduced Xi product. As discussed last quarter with the introduction of da Vinci Xi surgical system, we offered certain customers in the U.S. and Europe, the ability to trade-in their recently purchased da Vinci SI surgical systems for da Vinci Xi surgical system. These trade-in offers also provided these customers the opportunity to exchange certain da Vinci Si instruments and accessories for da Vinci Xi instruments and accessories.","As a result of these offers, we reserved $26 million of U.S. revenue in the first quarter and reserved $6 million of European revenue in the second quarter. As these customers accepted or declined their trade-in offers, we refined our estimates of the revenue reserves.","In the third quarter, we recognized $16 million of revenue, reflecting eight trade-outs completed and a refinement of the number of customers that we expect to accept our offer. Pro forma results exclude the impact of this program. As of September 30th, we had $4 million of reserves for three trade-ins that we expect to occur in the fourth quarter. ","Revenue highlights are as follows. Pro forma instrument and accessory revenue of $272 million was up 14%, compared with the third quarter of 2013. It was up 4% compared with the second quarter of 2014. The increase relative to last year primarily reflects increased procedures, new-product revenue and increased stocking orders. The increase relative to last quarter primarily reflects customer buying patterns, new product revenue and increased stocking orders.","Pro forma instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including initial stocking orders was approximately $1,930 per procedure, compared with $1,860 in the third quarter of 2013 and $1,830 last quarter. Pro forma systems revenue of $154 million decreased 3% compared with the third quarter of 2013, an increase of 11% compared with last quarter.","We placed 111 systems in the third quarter, excluding the eight Xi-es traded for Si-es under our traded program. Compared with 101 systems placed last year and 96 last quarter, six of the systems placed -- just six of the system placements in the quarter and three of the placements in the second quarter of 2014 were structured as operating leases.","The system average selling price for the third quarter was $1.45 million, which is lower than the $1.56 million recognized in the third quarter last year and $1.5 million recognized in the second quarter of this year. The decreases compared to prior quarters reflect a greater number of trade-ins and products sold to cost sensitive customers particularly in Europe.","59 or a little more than half of the 111 systems placed in the third quarter were da Vinci Xi models. 38 were Si models, seven were Si-es and seven were S models. Hospitals financed approximately 27% of systems placed in the third quarter, down from 37% last quarter. We directly financed 11, of which six were structured as operating leases and five as sales type leases.","Through the third quarter of 2014, we have entered into nine operating leases. The amount of revenue that we recognized in any future quarter for these operating leases will be immaterial. In the U.S., we placed 61 systems in the third quarter compared with 65 systems last year and 61 systems last quarter.","Outside the U.S., third quarter pro forma revenue was $153 million, up 15% compared with revenue of $133 million in the third quarter of last year and up 14% compared with revenue of $135 million last quarter. Our higher year-over-year U.S. revenue was driven by increased procedures and higher system sales.","Our higher sequential OUS revenue primarily reflects higher system sales, partially offset by a seasonal decline in procedures. Third quarter 2014 procedure volume outside the U.S. was approximately 20% higher than the third quarter of 2013 and 4% lower than the second quarter of this year. The growth over the prior year reflects DVP growth in Europe and Japan. The decrease compared to last quarter primarily reflects third quarter seasonality in Europe, partially offset by increased procedures in Asia.","We placed 50 systems outside of the U.S. in the third quarter, including 25 in the Europe and 7 into Japan, compared with 36 into outside the U.S. in the third quarter of 2013, which included 17 into Europe and 13 into Japan and 35 systems outside the U.S. last quarter, which included 19 into Europe and 5 into Japan.","Third quarter system sales included 10 into China and 9 into Germany. The sales in the China were completed under tender offers following the Ministry of Health\u2019s announcement in 2013 that 38 hospitals were eligible to import da Vinci systems through 2015.","The Ministry of Health announcement does not represent a commitment to purchase and we do not expect additional systems to be sold under the tender in the fourth quarter. And there's no assurance that the remaining 28 hospitals will purchase systems. Sales in new markets and markets where we have limited reimbursements like Japan will be lumpy.","Moving on to the remainder of the P&L, pro forma gross margins were 67.2% in the third quarter of 2014, compared with 73.8% for the third quarter of 2013 and 69.2% for the second quarter of 2014. Our lower margin percentage reflects a higher mix of new product sales including the da Vinci Xi system, costs associated with our stapler or stop use and scope recall, costs related to purchase accounting for the buyout of our Japanese distributors market rights and service costs associated with product recalls in the Xi rollout.","In the first quarter, we recorded a pretax charge of $67 million to reflect the estimated costs of settling a number of product liability legal claims against the company. During the second quarter, we recorded an additional $10 million charge reflecting additional claims. Our estimates remained unchanged in the third quarter and we paid out approximately $16 million associated with previously accrued amounts.","Pro forma operating expenses which exclude reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expense and amortization of intangibles were $162 million for the third quarter of 2014, compared with $138 million for the third quarter of 2013 and $155 million for the second quarter of 2014.","The increase in pro forma operating expense in the third quarter relative to the second quarter reflects costs associated with new product launches, cost for expanding our operations in Japan and Europe and increased incentive compensation. We expect operating expenses to ramp in the fourth quarter primarily associated with international expansion, particularly in Japan and Europe and new product launches.","Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 27.2% compared with 17% for the third quarter of 2013 and 29.8% last quarter. The tax rate for the third quarter of 2013 included the reversal of reserves where statutes of limitations had expired. The reduction in rate from the second quarter of 2014 reflects an increase of non-U.S. taxable income relative to U.S. taxable income.","Our pro forma net income was $145 million or $3.92 per share, compared with $194 million or $4.94 per share for the third quarter of 2013 and $140 million or $3.73 per share for the second quarter of 2014. I will now summarize our GAAP results.","GAAP revenue was $550 million for the third quarter of 2014 compared with $499 million for the third quarter of 2013 and $512 million for the second quarter of 2014. GAAP net income was $124 million or $3.35 per share for the third quarter of 2014 compared with $157 million or $3.99 per share for the third quarter of 2013 and $104 million or $2.77 per share for the second quarter of 2014.","We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $2.3 billion, up from $2 billion as of June 30, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations. We've completed the repurchase of stock under our 1 billion accelerated stock repurchase program. Under the program, we purchased a total of 2.5 million shares at an average purchase price of $397.52 per share.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over procedure and clinical highlights.","Patrick Clingan","Thanks Marshall. As mentioned earlier, total Q3 year-over-year procedures grew nearly 10% with U.S. procedures growing 8% and international procedures growing 20%. U.S. procedure results were broadly similar to our commentary after Q2 with the exception of dVP which was better than expected.","Given our high-rated penetration in the U.S. prostatectomy market. Our dVP volumes are likely to attract overall U.S. prostatectomy volume. In U.S. gynecology, Q3 results were similar to the first half of 2014 with low-single-digit procedure declines. dVHb volume appears consistent with expected total market benign hysterectomy procedure decline while the myomectomy negative year-over-year trend continued from the second quarter. Single site hysterectomy grew quickly off the small base. And we will monitor the adoption of our wristed single-site needle drivers impact on this procedure.","Moving onto U.S. general surgery. Adoption continues to be solid across a broad number of procedures. Colorectal procedure adoption remains a source of strength. It is too early to precisely estimate the impact the stapler-stop shift action may have on our procedure growth.","Though initial inspection suggests it may weight on colorectal procedure growth. Single Single-Site cholecystectomy continue to grow in Q3, though at a more modest rate relative to the first half of 2014. Hernia growth remains encouraging in this early phase of adoption. In addition, the robust procedure growth for hernia repair, we are hearing positive feedback from surgeons about the clinical outcomes being generated with their da Vinci Surgical Systems.","During the quarter, one of the first studies comparing robotic and laparoscopic ventral hernia was published supporting the feedback we have been receiving. These results when combined with some of their early cost analysis that suggest robotics has a similar level of material operating costs as laparoscopic ventral hernia repair gives us belief that the current adoption is sustainable.","Looking abroad, international procedure growth of 20% continues to be lead by global adoption of dVP and other urologic procedures with solid early contributions from gynecology and general surgery. Procedure growth rebounded in Europe after holidays weighed on Q2 growth rate.","In Japan, we have observed a slight disruption to procedure growth in Q3 as we transition sales and service to our direct organization. We believe that this is temporary in nature and expect to stabilize as we move towards the direct selling model.","Recently clinical trials to support our reimbursement submissions for partial nephrectomy and gastrectomy have begun enrollment. Though it is uncertain how quickly these trials will enroll and whether they will achieve the outcomes needed to support reimbursement.","We continue to expect international procedure adoption to be a driver of procedure growth. And the opportunity for da Vinci surgery is substantial. As we said in the past, quarterly procedure growth rates may be lumpy as adoption is not uniform across countries and procedures.","One of the challenges of evaluating clinical and economic advances in surgery is the diversity in patient and surgeon population. As da Vinci is used in more and different types of procedures, well-done studies evaluated in the clinical and economic efficacy, consider the impact of new technology and techniques on different segments of the patient population and surgeon population. They evaluate important pre-existing conditions in the patient population such as disease state, obesity, prior surgery and other comorbidities as well as appropriate near-term and long-term clinical outcomes.","They also consider diversity and surgeon experience and practice patterns. As da Vinci is adopted in gynecology and general surgery, where a range of surgical approaches exist from open surgery to other forms of minimally invasive surgery, careful segmentation of patient surgeon population is important.","A couple of colorectal studies published this quarter are good examples of using an appropriate set of patients and procedures. Unlike rectal resections, where open surgery remains the most common procedure, right colectomies are often performed laparoscopically. The studies of various types of right colectomy and broad patient populations have noted high rates of complications.","We believe there is an opportunity for robotics to improve upon these outcomes. One study is a meta-analysis by Dr. Shu in studies and colleagues from the Shandong Cancer Hospital published in the World Journal of Surgical Oncology, which concludes \u201ccompared to laparoscopic right colectomy, robotic right colectomy was associated with reduced estimate of blood loss, produced post operative complications, longer operative times and a significantly faster recovery of bowel function.\u201d","The second study published in Surgical Endoscopy by Dr. Trusturi and colleagues, noted that intra-corporeal anastomosis in right colectomy is associated with improved clinical outcomes. It remains uncommon in laparoscopic procedures due to its technical difficulty.","The study showed that cohort of patients undergoing robotic right colectomies with intra-corporeal anastomosis, recovered more quickly compared to laparoscopic cohorts with both intracorporeal and extracorporeal anastomosis. While there are over 8000 peer-reviewed clinical studies on robotic surgery, many of which support the value of our technology, we wanted to take a moment to highlight future clinical initiatives in which we are participating.","We are working with surgical societies, including support of the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists, Clinical Outcomes Registry for cancer procedures, as well as a national registry for ventral hernia repair. In addition to supporting research, during the quarter we also expanded our support of Society Fellowship Trainings for both the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons and the American Association of Thoracic Surgeons.","Turning back to research, we are supporting a number of multi-center clinical studies, including studies on rectal resection, single site cholecystectomy, thoracic resections and benign hysterectomies. We were also supporting national database reviews looking at outcomes from a population health perspective for rectal resection, thoracic resection, and benign hysterectomy. This concludes my remarks and I thank you for your time. I'll now turn the call over to Calvin.","Calvin Darling","Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2014 in pro forma terms. As Marshall mentioned, our GAAP financial results and pro forma reconciliations are available on our website.","Starting with procedures, on our last call we estimated full year 2014 procedure growth of between 5% and 8%, above the approximately 523,000 procedures performed in 2013. Now based upon trends described earlier on the call, we are increasing our 2014 procedure growth guidance to a range of between 8% and 9%. Consistent with our recent calls, we will not be providing revenue guidance.","Moving on to gross profit margin. Our Q3 2014 gross profit margin was 200 basis points lower than Q2. Certain charges to Q3 2014 cost of sales that Marshall described earlier on the call were non-recurring in nature. We estimate that these non-recurring items accounted for about three quarters of the sequential decline. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely upon product mix and systems production volume.","Operating expenses. Last quarter we forecast full year operating expenses to grow between 10% and 13% above 2013 levels. Now based upon the timing of certain expenses, we expect to grow our operating expenses between 9% and 11% above 2013 levels. We expect 2014 non-cash stock compensation to be towards the lower end of the $170 million to $180 million range forecast on our previous call. We expect other income, excluding the impact of the Q2 impairment charge, to total between $12 million and 13 million.","With regard to income tax, we expect our pro forma based tax rate for the balance of 2014 to fall within a range of between 27.5% and 29% of pretax income. Our current estimate is directionally lower than our expectations earlier in the year, driven by the geographic mix of our pretax income. Note that the pro forma tax rate tends to run above the GAAP tax rate, driven by the geographic mix of the pro forma items.","Our Q3 2014 diluted share count decreased to 36.9 million shares, reflecting the full quarter impact of our accelerated share buyback completed in Q2. We estimate our Q4 diluted share count to range between 36.9 and 37.1 million shares. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Thanks everybody and then for taking the questions. I want to start on procedure volumes, given Calvin\u2019s outlook that you provided for the balance of the year. And I\u2019m just hoping you could help us understand the balance of the year and the context where you done year-to-date. I guess specifically this guidance now implies 6% to 10% growth for the fourth quarter. Maybe you could just frame for us what\u2019s happening to the assumption at the bottom end, then what\u2019s happening in the assumptions at the high end, and why we would see -- why we wouldn\u2019t see a continued trajectory from what we\u2019re seeing year-to-date?","Gary Guthart","Yes. I can help you over there. As you mentioned, we are three quarter off the way through the year. Q3 rounded up to 10% as we described. And on a year-to-date basis, we are also rounding up to 9%. It has a lot to do with the numbers. You are three quarters away through the year, but the fact is in order to get a 10% procedure range, let\u2019s say you would have to do an excess of 12% in the fourth quarter. And based upon the trajectories and the procedures that we\u2019ve seen in our projections, it\u2019s just not we\u2019re expecting at this time.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And maybe on the topic of total revenue. And maybe Gary you could just sort of comment on the overall operating environment, I mean the data points thus far around the hospital CapEx continuum look to be coming together a little bit more favorably than where we were starting the year. And I think some of the concerns that if Europe don\u2019t look to necessarily play themselves out as expected. So maybe you should help us understand what\u2019s happening in the broader operating environment and what it will take for you to get more confident in the forward view?","Gary Guthart","Yes. As we look at the systems sales side, as we described before really, we can describe our environment and that is really driven by three things. One is interest in acquiring technologies for existing customers and Xi is being well received and so we are seeing some interesting trade-ins. The second piece has been adding capacity if there are existing, possible existing customer and that will have to do with what their procedure mix and procedure growth looks like. And the last one is starting new programs.","And in terms of looking at global capital equipment environments, you are probably in a better position to comment on that than we. In general, we are hospital, finances looks stronger that gives them flexibility. Turning to Europe, what we have talked about before is really true, it\u2019s not a smooth distribution of customers. There are those who are interested in the most highly featured products and there are those who are interested in real price sensitive offerings. And so we see a little bit of both in that marketplace. So one size doesn\u2019t fit all.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","And then maybe very specifically to your business, we started the year I think what somebody would call a very turbulent set of events and you are talking about I think your language was intended consequences around the Affordable Care Act and some of the gyration and procedure volumes and what was happening at the hospital, particularly the evolution of your technology, that\u2019s followed last year which was an adjustment period around utilization rates. Like where are we more broadly speaking just in the adoption of your technology and are we close to the point where you think we are back on a positive trajectory, positive sustainable trajectory?","Gary Guthart","Speaking first to procedures, I think the procedure performance speaks for itself. We are seeing early adoption in several general surgery procedure categories. I think that\u2019s a positive. As that grows and matures, I think, we'll see whether it continues and how fast it accelerates in general reports on things like ventral hernia and colorectal surgery have been really strong and leave us encouraged.","I think with regards to the early impact of Affordable Care Act, we saw some uncertainty with regard to hospital finances as to how that would impact them and that uncertainty put them into a pause mode as it related to us.","As I think they get better clarity than that that allows them to plan a little bit and looking forward should smooth things out. What will actually be like as time plays out we\u2019ll have to see.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Go ahead please.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Hey. Thanks. Gary, I\u2019m just wondering if you can elaborate on the Sp delay, just a function have you guys doing more trial work? I\u2019m just kind of wondering what the rationale there was?","Gary Guthart","Yeah. The biggest reason for us to move it out a little bit was actually some of the positive things we\u2019ve learned from our Xi launch. We are seeing customer feedback on Xi, that is really strong and some things that they particularly appreciate and as we do our customer valuations on Sp and look to integrate those things, there is a few things that we\u2019d like to bring over from one to the other and we made a decision to do so.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Okay. And then, Marshall, can you comment a little bit more on some of the drivers of the gross margin softness? I mean, I know you talked about the stapler stop using some of these other dynamics? Is there anyway to kind of quantify the various costs and I guess, the underline question is, where do we reach a low watermark on margins?","Marshall Mohr","","Yeah. So the -- what we commented on with -- there is about a 200 basis point decline in gross margins. I will attribute three quarters of that to unusual items in the quarter a you mentioned that the stepper stop use. The -- we also had a scope recall and then we had some cost associated with our acquisition of Japan, the Japanese distribution business and the accounting around that.","So, I guess, I would say that there is a portion of it though that is just part of the normal margin and reflects new product and new product has lower margins to start and we\u2019ll continue to try to drive those down overtime. As far as where we\u2019re going in the future, I think, Calvin gave you the projection for Q4. We\u2019re not going to give you 2015 but you get a sense as to where we were this quarter.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Okay. And then last one China, nice number there. Can you maybe just talk about the sustainability of the trend there, are we are at kind of an inflection point? I think, up till now you had only 26 systems or so in China? So just maybe talk about some of the drivers?","Gary Guthart","I think, we\u2019re in our first phase. Long-term, we think there is real opportunity in China but in the near-term, I think, there are a lot of steps to building a sustainable business there.","It\u2019s -- in terms of feel and approach. We feel little bit like our conversations around Japan. I think there is an element of having a deeper presence in China of both direct and potentially with others and requiring a build out to have sustained growth. So I think it\u2019s a goods first step. Certainly a positive, but I don\u2019t think it is signaling us strong inflection point, I would not assume that.","Marshall Mohr","","And that brought our total systems in China ending the quarter up to 36 systems.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Wise with Stifel. Go ahead please.","Rick Wise - Stifel","Good afternoon, everybody. Starting with the Xi, Gary, on last quarter, it felt like you all were pleased and maybe a bit surprised by the strong trend system placement trend? Is Xi now this quarter the same kind of surprise there, is the rollout where you expected at this point or again are you -- is it a little better you might have thought?","Gary Guthart","I think we\u2019re pleased with where we\u2019re on the Xi rollout. I think that we are getting feedback that I think is what we expected in some parts of the market in terms of multi-port access and multi-quadrant access and we\u2019re surprised and pleased by, I think, the broad-based nature of commentary in terms of urologist and GY oncologists, who are find value in it, perhaps, more than we had anticipated. So, I think, we\u2019re continuing the feeling and the trend that we saw in the second quarter.","Rick Wise - Stifel","Okay. And back to the stapler, it just maybe one by two quickly. So you hope to resolve the stapler issues this year? I think you said, you weren\u2019t going to be specific, but is it in 2014 and when we reflect on fourth quarter procedure trends, does that -- does the recall or have any impact on those procedures or a meaningful impact, how do we think about that?","Gary Guthart","We haven\u2019t given you a date that will put it back on the market. We think we have root cause well-identified and are in the midst of validating solutions. When those are validated when we have them in our hands and they are done, the validation is done, we\u2019ll report to our customers and to you. I don\u2019t have a timeframe for you.","Yet, having said that, I think that the teams are making good progress, both understanding where we are and what the possible solutions are. In terms of modeling procedure impact, a little hard to say, I think, that it's certainly some drag, very hard to know how big the drag is.","Rick Wise - Stifel","Okay. And just last for me on the da Vinci prostatectomy side. It sounds like things are stabilizing. Can you just give us little more color there, Gary, just I mean what\u2019s happening? Do you think the market is sort of set to remain stable or actually grow? How are you thinking about and how would you have us think about it? Thank you.","Gary Guthart","It\u2019s a little bit hard to know based on one quarter of return to growth here, so what happens in the next quarter and the next one after that, hard to predict. It\u2019s -- we have seen in past quarters that when there is an increase and things like watchful waiting. At some period of time after that you see a bolus of patients come out of watchful waiting and into definitive treatment of one type or another as some subset of that watchful waiting cohort has their cancer progress and maybe that we\u2019ll have to wait a couple of quarters to see if that indeed is the case.","Rick Wise - Stifel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go now to Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Ben Andrew - William Blair","Good afternoon. Can you talk a little about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the expenses because you talked about trimming that back a little based on timing. Are those things are likely to drop in 2015 so we could actually see operating margin go down a bit because I think most of us have modeled it flat, kind of through the end of \u201915?","Gary Guthart","Yeah. We\u2019ve been talking about investments we\u2019re making this year and we clearly believe strongly in our opportunities and have been investing. We did take the guidance range down a bit on expenses this year. It has mostly to do with the timing of some of the hiring activities. As we move forward into next year, obviously we will be providing that guidance commentary on the next call. But that being said, in the longer-term we really wouldn't expect to make the types of operating expense investments in future years that we made in 2014 relative to revenue growth trends.","Ben Andrew - William Blair","Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Gary, is there any comments relative to the approval we saw a few weeks ago for base of tongue resections. Is that for combination used with UPPP for like our sleep apnea case or is that sort of an entr\u00e9e to the ENT space broadly?","Gary Guthart","It\u2019s the next step in clearances for ENT surgeons. It is not a sleep apnea claim and the company does not take that position. It really is as it has been published which is a clearance to allow surgeons to do resection of benign tongue-based issue as they deem appropriate. Where they take it from there, I think we\u2019ll have to see in future quarters?","Ben Andrew - William Blair","Okay. And can you characterize as best you can given the confounding nature of the Stapler pullback. How the general surgeon procedure growth trajectory as compared to prior procedure growth trajectory? They have tended to parallel each other except some of the recent ones are faster? Are those more encouraging than you would've expected?","Gary Guthart","In terms of stepping back, I think as you look at the segments of growth and general surgery, the hernia growth is still early in its life cycle. But it\u2019s been on the faster side. In terms of hernia growth, if you look at separate rectal and colon, rectal so deep in the pelvis has been the one that is most utilizing the stapler and is the one that for which I think the surgeons are most wanting it back quickly. That has been -- growth is been consistent with what we've seen in past adoptions and that\u2019s one we watch pretty closely for any changes with regard to the Stapler.","The solution to the Stapler problem is really straightforward, which is identify the issues, get the solutions validated and bring it back to market, we will do that scientifically and carefully but that\u2019s the path forward. As you look at colon resection, that growth has been positive for us also. It\u2019s a multifaceted procedure. It\u2019s not just one thing. We do see Stapler use in colon resection but not in all segments. And so it\u2019s kind of a mixed story in that one.","","Ben Andrew - William Blair","","Okay. And then finally from me, when might we see the first of some of the clinical work being done in Japan for expanded indications?","Gary Guthart","The beginning in terms of reimbursement, those trials have initiated already. I think first enrollments have already occurred this month.","Ben Andrew - William Blair","","When might we see results of those? Is that 2015\u2026","Gary Guthart","","That will play out over multiple quarters in terms of when they start to publish, we\u2019ll have to talk about that as we get greater clarity on their timelines.","Ben Andrew - William Blair","","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tao Levy with Wedbush Securities. Go ahead please.","Tao Levy - Wedbush Securities","Hi, good afternoon.","Gary Guthart","Hi Tao.","Tao Levy - Wedbush Securities","Hi. So couples of quick question under the single-site, the wristed device, that you recently got approval. The uptake in that market, is it possible that you can start to see benign hysterectomy sort of go flat to positive as a result of that technology and basically what I\u2019m getting at is -- is that going to go after the laparoscopic patient population or still the open patient population that you normally talked about?","Patrick Clingan","Hey, Tao, it\u2019s Patrick. First off, we were excited about the level of enthusiasm and interest that gynecologists probably have shown towards adopting single incision surgery. The initial case series that have been done since the product was approved have been seamlessly integrated and surgeons have reported positive feedback to us about what they are able to achieve with the device.","Relative to what happens in the overall market, this has been a market that has been in decline for a while now as payers have looked for alternative treatments rather than surgery, putting pressure on the overall number of benign hysterectomies performed. But we\u2019ll see where we go from here. But we\u2019ll definitely try to use the device to restore our rate of growth. But it\u2019s just too earlier to comment on the trajectory at this stage.","Tao Levy - Wedbush Securities","Is there any difference between the gall bladder sort of approach or experience, obviously different types of surgeon and what you could see in gynecology?","","Gary Guthart","","I think the way that we would envision segments here are little bit different than in the past where the segments have typically been open versus MIS. I think this one may draw a little bit from both. So the segmentation is more likely around patient interest in needs with regard to single incision surgery and a little less about open versus robotics. So I will see as it develops, how that actual segments develops.","Tao Levy - Wedbush Securities","Great. And then just lastly, the approval in Korea, that\u2019s one of your larger markets and now you are direct there, I think maybe a year or two ago. How -- any expectations to how quickly that market get start to purchase excise of sums?","Gary Guthart","","I believe given the clearance that they can start to purchase product as soon as we start shipping it. And I think we have intentions to ship it before the end of the quarter.","Tao Levy - Wedbush Securities","","Okay. But the interest is there, I guess is kind of with us?","","Gary Guthart","","Yes. We have customers who have an interest.","Tao Levy - Wedbush Securities","","Okay.","Gary Guthart","Thank you, Tao.","Operator","","Thank you. And next we have Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Go ahead please.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","","Hi thanks. Can you hear me okay?","Gary Guthart","","We can.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Great. Good afternoon. And just a couple of quick things. First off, I noticed in your quarter I think you guys have confirmed that there has been a change in your Head of Sales in the U.S. And I was just wondering if there is any color you are willing to provide on that change. I\u2019m sure folks in this call -- it will be interesting to hear if there is any commentary from you guys.","Gary Guthart","We\u2019ve had a couple of changes in our leadership team over the last couple of quarters. I think just standing back as the marketplace changes out in the United States as well as the company needs a change. I think, for both the company and for individuals, people look at what they want to do and what their skills are and what\u2019s the match? We have been the beneficiaries of a really strong team and we also have a strong bench.","So for those who moved on we wish them well and expect them to do great things in their next engagement. Having said that, I think we also have a really good team here. And so it\u2019s natural in evolution of any company, you will look out at what the needs of the organization are and what peoples\u2019 long-term needs are, what they do and we do and so these transitions occur. I think we have a great team. We are confident in our opportunity and we are confident in their ability.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Great. So the other two things I want to ask you about really quickly is one for you, Gary and one on the finance side. And Gary, I was just wondering if you could just give us your thoughts on, how your thoughts on SP have changed since you first announced the technology? I\u2019m not asking about the timing because you\u2019ve already addressed that. I\u2019m just asking about your thoughts on the, kind of long-term market opportunity for that technology. Things like, could this system ultimately be competitive with traditional laproscopic surgery in addition to some of the other things that you\u2019ve talked about. So that\u2019s a question for you.","And then on the finance side just to get it out of the way, I just wanted to be clear on the comments on operating expense growth as we look forward. Were you suggesting that relative to the double-digit growth in OpEx that we might see this year that you wouldn\u2019t expect double-digit growth going forward or was that the message I just wanted to be clear?","Gary Guthart","Okay. Let me take them in order and I think I got them both. With regard to SP, I think there is -- just standing back on the introduction of new technology, there tends to be a trend for folks to overestimate what they do in near term and underestimate what they do in the long-term. And so I look at SP and I think it has a lot of long-term potential. It is fundamentally a technology that enters the body through a small entry point, brings in instruments in a parallel way and works with high precision in tight spots.","And as you sit down and talk to surgeons and I\u2019ve spoken with many, many, I have personally as well as our team. I think there are lot of possibility as to where there can go and take it. What that looks like and whether it displaces one alternative or another depends entirely on what part of the body it\u2019s applied to. There are some places that are really straightforward areas to explore that are just set up well for this type of technology. And so things like Transoral surgery or transrectal or transvaginal, these are areas that hold a lot of promise.","Having said that, bring a new technology market, you want to make sure you do it in a way that brings value early and establishes value for your customer, gives high value patient outcomes and value to the surgeons and hospitals who adopted and so how we evolve that is something that we work through in the next several quarters. And as we get closer, we will describe it too.","With regard to OpEx growth, speaking after \u201915, we will give your thoughts on \u201815 in the next call. But longer term, we don\u2019t expect that we will ramp expenses highly out of sync with the growth and revenue. We think longer term working out a few years that we have an opportunity for both stabilization and then later leverage, so that\u2019s how we are thinking about it.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Great. Very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Ross Muken with ISI Group. Go ahead, please.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. This is Vijay and I had a question. I guess last quarter, Gary, lot of questions on instrument accessories and I guess you guys were pretty sort of, I guess had this view that procedures for up and you expected that number to come back up right. And I guess then going forward when you look at that, you had this dynamic of a general surgery, which had higher pull through but then you also have hernia and coli is sort of growing. How should we think about the normalized, I guess longer term I&A revenues for procedure?","Gary Guthart","Let me give you a kind of a directional pointer and then, I think Calvin, maybe a little help on the modeling side. I think directionally, remember the general surgery is a cluster of different procedures and doesn\u2019t out model as one thing. And just the few that you mentioned have really strong differences in I&A per procedures. So you think about rectal case, cancer case uses staplers will be on the high end of I&A per procedure, hernia somewhere in the middle.","Hernia is also in itself a cluster of procedure. It\u2019s not one thing. So ventral hernia is different than inguinal hernia and there are different techniques in each of those, so that the cost basis for each one of those subsets maybe a little bit different. And than Single-Site cholecystectomy is at the lower end of our revenue per procedure and so then you start modeling this out. It all has to do with mix in growth rate and that\u2019s when it gets turned over to Calvin.","Calvin Darling","Yeah. I mean, I think you laid it out pretty well. This is an average, right. The average I&A revenue per procedure and our message is really just be aware of the average. You have got a widening and widening gap in the actual per procedure on the complex side and the less complex side. So, I don\u2019t think we have any specific commentary whether it should be increasing or decreasing. It really depends on really, which factors win the day on this thing and you can be successful in any scenario as far as that goes.","Gary Guthart","Yeah, I will make a last comment on that point. We feel comfortable with pricing in those procedures. We think it\u2019s appropriate for us and for the customer, and we think the margin structure is right in those things. So it\u2019s really looking out at what the mix is going to be rather than whether the company has to make a change.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group","Great. And I guess, I had a one follow-up on procedure side and I think you guys have been pretty consistent when you were talking about this changing healthcare dynamic and increased seasonality and back half pick up. And when you look at that guidance of 8% to 9%, I guess at the high end you\u2019re sort of getting in flattish Q-on-Q. Is that a reasonable assumption? Or is there a belief that given this exacerbated seasonality, Q4 should be better than Q3?","Gary Guthart","","The simple way I think to answer that is, we are all together experiencing what seasonality is going to be like after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. And I think nobody has been through it yet. So we are -- have our estimates. We have given the guidance based on those estimates, but I think we are all just going to have to see and gain some experience together.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group","Thanks, guys. I\u2019ll step back in the queue. Congrats on the queue.","Gary Guthart","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Go ahead, please.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners","","Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. I just want to turn back to the stapler stop use for a movement. Can you just characterize whether or not or the feedback that you\u2019ve gotten in the field? Is it a matter of an issue for the moment not using the Stapler, obviously it\u2019s not available, but the second it comes back, it gets reused? Or is there an actual hesitation in your customer base amongst rectal resection users that they are concerned about the safety issues from an ongoing basis? Or is it just a very transient issue?","Gary Guthart","First characterize where we are, we have asked customers to stop using it until we have identified and given them further instructions about what and how to handle it. We have taken a reserve with regards to inventory should we want to send them replacements depending on what the conclusions of the cause and validations are. I think that the customer sentiment around it has been, they understand our request. It is quite a conservative request, three malfunctions over greater than 10,000 fires. They have viewed this as an understandable. And so I think that we have not seen -- I have not seen any deep confidence been shaken. We have many requests to hurry up and bring it back. I think they want to use it. I think it\u2019s differentiated relative to other products that they use. And so that\u2019s what we are working on.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners","Okay. And can you maybe just describe what they are doing in the mean time? Does it actually decrease the utilization? I mean, it sounds like you are more hesitant there. How are they managing to not having access to the stapler?","Gary Guthart","Yeah. It depends on what the case is. If it\u2019s a low rectal case and they can do it with the manual stapler, they will try that. If it\u2019s very deep, they may have to use a laparotomy rather than doing it only basically. So there is a real variety depending on what the patient characteristics are.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners","Great. And then if I could just ask one more on, just as we look out into your new product initiatives, obviously Sp is getting delayed. I didn\u2019t catch whether you provided a timeline for when that might be delayed until. And then also are there other new products that we can potentially expect to hear about making progress on? I am thinking about things in that brochure that we saw at stages like the rotating bed and where are you on some of those additional features? Thank you.","Gary Guthart","With regard to commercialization timing with Sp, we are not giving you updated timing. We do expect clinical use of Xi compatible Sp in '15. With regards to other things that we have been working on, there is another set of Xi instrumentation, Phase 2 instrumentation that we will describe as it goes through the process. We are making progress on an Xi integrated bed. We don\u2019t have the timeline to describe to you at this time, but in future quarters we will. The pipeline is quite robust and we continue to walk down it.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners","Thank you.","","Operator","Thank you. We have a question now from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Well, thank you, excuse me and Gary just two quick ones here. On Japan, you talked about the clinical development program, are you still -- is it still the company\u2019s thinking that 2016, is it good estimate for reimbursement in Japan?","Gary Guthart","We are working towards 2016 on a couple of fronts. It is as yet uncertain. We don\u2019t have of course final approval from anybody on that timeline, but we are working toward that end.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And nothing has changed in that front. It sounds like the clinical development program is on track.","Gary Guthart","Well, it\u2019s a dynamic conversation. So I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as everything is solid and locked in stone. I think that\u2019s a set of conversations that has been going on and we will continue to do so, but that\u2019s the nature of these kind of conversations in Japan.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","I think Gary just if you think about the last several quarters adjusting for the second quarter, where obviously Xi was going to be stronger in the U.S. It does look like O-U.S. net system placements were stronger than the U.S. Do you think these three quarters justifies the trend and on a go forward, it\u2019s likely that O-U.S. net placements are higher than U.S placements?","Gary Guthart","Hard to say. I think a couple of things. I\u2019d say that on the one hand, we are earlier in total market adoption in some of our U.S countries and we think that those are real markets and we are the pursuit. And so if they go where we hope they go, then we will see increased spending there. In the U.S. of course, we have a bigger install base so the conversation tends to be somewhat around new technologies and other things they want to do. I think as you look over years and not quarters I\u2019d expect that the O-U.S. represents a strong growth time for us.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you very much.","Gary Guthart","Thank you. That was our last question. As we have said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits, and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient benefit by providing surgical outcomes, by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. This concludes today\u2019s call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery and we look forward to talking with you again in three months\u2019 time.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and using AT&T Executive Teleconference.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Calvin Darling, Senior Director of Finance, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Calvin Darling","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive's second quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; and Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 4, 2019, and 10-Q filed on April 19, 2019. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.","Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Latest Events section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website.","Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our second quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session.","Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Marshall will provide a review of our second quarter financial results, then I will discuss procedures and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2019. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.","With that, I will turn it over to Gary.","Gary Guthart","Thank you for joining us today. The second quarter of 2019 was a solid one for Intuitive with healthy customer interest and demand for our products. Overall procedure growth met our expectations, while capital placements exceeded them. Global procedure growth was approximately 17% in the second quarter of 2019. Growth again centered on general surgery in the United States, with positive contributions to the global growth rate from Germany, France, and Japan. In China, we are pleased with procedure performance, given the recent release of systems under the new quota.","Turning to the United States, year-over-year growth in the quarter was 16%. General surgery growth again accounted for the largest increase year-over-year, accompanied by expected moderation of growth in U.S. urology and gynecology. Underlying this performance, we saw a continued strength in bariatrics and cholecystectomy, with modest tempering of growth rate in hernia and colon resection. Given the different types of procedures being performed by general surgeons, we see additional demands on system access and accounts as well as increased demands on our representatives' time to support different procedure types. ","We believe system placement strength in the U.S. is driven in part by the desire of general surgeons for increased access. We have efforts ongoing to manage these issues. Calvin will take you through global procedure dynamics in more detail later in the call.","With regard to our installed base, placement of new systems in the quarter was strong with growth in total placements rising 24% from Q2 of 2018. Net of trade-ins and retirements, our da Vinci installed base again grew 13% over Q2 2018 to approximately 5,270. The mix of system placements this quarter moved towards our flagship Xi System, while both sales of X Systems and trade-ins remained healthy. The proportions of systems placed under operating leases was 32% this quarter compared with 33% last quarter. We do not anticipate this quarter-to-quarter variance is indicative of a larger trend in leasing. ","With regard to capital average sales price, the mix of systems and geographies last quarter resulted in a lower ASP when compared to historical trends. The second quarter saw a reversal of mix dynamics, with more fully featured system sales and a greater proportion of system placements in direct markets, resulting in an ASP that is higher than recent quarterly averages. As we said last quarter, this variance in ASP quarter-to-quarter is the result of system and regional mix, not a fundamental change in our philosophy.","Turning to expenses, we continue to invest as we launch new platforms, strengthen our computational capabilities, and execute projects that support future scale and provide leverage opportunities as we grow. Our spending met our expectations, falling within the range of projections we shared with you last quarter and supported by solid procedure growth and capital placements. ","Financial highlights of our second quarter results are as follows: Procedures grew approximately 17% over the second quarter of last year; we placed 273 da Vinci surgical systems, up from 220 in the second quarter of 2018; our installed base again grew 13% from a year ago; revenue for the quarter was approximately $1.1 billion, up 21%; pro forma gross profit margin was 71.3% compared to 71.1% in the second quarter last year; instrument and accessory revenue increased to $579 million, up 22%; total recurring revenue in the quarter was $780 million, growing 21% over Q2 of 2018 and representing 71% of total revenue.","We generated a pro forma operating profit of $455 million in the quarter, up 17% from the second quarter of last year, and pro forma net income was $388 million, up 18%. As you know, we measure our efforts by their ability to positively impact the quadruple aim: better outcomes, better patient experience, better care team experience, and lower total cost to treat per patient episode. ","We believe intelligent surgery takes the integration of 3 elements: first, a deep understanding of human interactions that inform holistic system design; second, the development of high-quality, smart and cloud-connected robotic imaging and instrument systems; and lastly, informatics and AI to deliver relevant validated insights. For our customers, surgery has been digitized for the past 20 years. While we've made significant progress over our history, we believe continuous improvement is required and we have deployed our investment toward these aims. ","We design instruments and accessories to enable repeatable, high-quality surgeries that are efficient and cost-effective relating to total cost to treat. Taking one example of our advanced instrument platforms, our second-generation SureForm staplers are now in the market at both 60-millimeter and 45-millimeter instrument lengths and represent product families. Our 60-millimeter stapler has 4 staple lengths available and is sold in the U.S., Europe, Korea, Australia and now Japan. Our 45-millimeter SureForm stapler has 5 different staple-length cartridges as well as a straight-tip and curved-tip instrument and is available in initial launch in the United States and our direct EU markets. Measured through Q2, surgeons have fired Intuitive staplers clinically over 1 million times cumulatively since our stapling launch.","Turning to systems, we are in the first phase of launch of da Vinci SP. We installed 13 systems in Q2 to bring our clinical installed base of SP to 34. Our teams have done a nice job resolving the manufacturing variances that slowed our installs in Q1. The highest per system utilization of SP is occurring in Korea, where regulatory clearances support the access to a large range of clinical applications. The Korean experience with SP is encouraging with regard to the broad possibilities for our platform. In Korea, procedures in urology, gynecology, general surgery and head and neck surgery are being performed. ","In the United States, we have two cleared indications for SP: urologic and transoral surgery. As you know, we're pursuing additional clinical indications for SP and have engaged regulatory agencies regarding their requirements. These requirements are in discussion, which implies projected timelines for additional indications are not yet available. Our pipeline of interested SP customers is healthy, and the combination of additional indications for SP and our readiness for deployment at larger scale pace the speed of our SP commercial expansion. ","In flexible diagnostics, our Ion platform is focused on the need for accurate, timely biopsies to support definitive early diagnosis of suspicious lung cancers -- lesions for lung cancer. Ion received FDA clearance in the first quarter. With 510(k) clearance, we've initiated our next phase focused on clinical use, customer feedback, and production optimization. First cases on the cleared system were performed at the end of Q1, and we plan a measured rollout this year. Placements to date are at hospital sites collecting data. So far, 3 have been initiated and over 50 procedures have been performed so far. We're pleased with early clinical results and look forward to our customers' continued progress. We expect commercial placements to commence in the next few months along with the initiation of additional clinical collection sites. We do not anticipate material revenue from Ion in 2019. ","Turning to imaging and analytics, this week, we announced the acquisition of the 3D robotic endoscope business from our long-time supplier, Sch\u00f6lly Fiberoptic. The transaction is subject to closing conditions and thereafter, we look forward to welcoming their employees to the Intuitive team. Leading visualization has been a core pillar of our offerings and we believe it is essential to the future of intelligent surgery. This acquisition strengthens our design and supply chain capabilities and increases our manufacturing capacity for imaging products.","For the balance of the year, our focus remains in completing the tasks we set for ourselves: first, supporting adoption of da Vinci in general surgery and in key procedures in global markets; second, launching our SP and Ion platforms; third, driving intelligent surgery innovation; and finally, supporting additional clinical and economic validation in our focus procedures and countries.","Before I turn the call over to Marshall, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge our Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Sal Brogna, who announced his intention to step back from day-to-day operations after 20 years at Intuitive. Sal has made enormous contributions to building our product line, our capabilities and, in the past few years, our leadership team. I extend my personal thanks and that of the company for his efforts over these past 2 decades. We anticipate working with Sal post-transition on projects of mutual interest.","I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will review financial highlights.","Marshall Mohr","Good afternoon. I'll describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Key business metrics for the second quarter were as follows: Second quarter 2019 procedures increased approximately 17% compared with the second quarter of 2018, and increased approximately 7% compared with last quarter; procedure growth continues to be driven by general surgery in the U.S. and urology worldwide. Calvin will review details of procedure growth later in this call. Second quarter system placements of 273 systems increased 24% compared with 220 systems last year, and increased 16% compared with 235 systems last quarter.","We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems by 17% to approximately 5,270 systems. This growth is consistent with last quarter and slightly higher than the 12.5% increase last year. Utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, grew approximately 3.5%, which is slightly lower than last quarter growth of approximately 4%, and below the 5% growth last year.","Our revenue overview is as follows: Second quarter 2019 revenue was $1.1 billion, an increase of 21% compared with $909 million for the second quarter of 2018, and an increase of 13% compared with $974 million last quarter. Instrument and accessory revenue of $579 million increased 22% compared with last year, which is higher than procedure growth, primarily reflecting customer buying patterns and increased usage of our advanced instruments. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure was approximately $1,920, an increase of 4% compared with the second quarter of 2018 and a decrease of 2% compared with last quarter.","Systems revenue for the second quarter of 2019 was $344 million, an increase of 24% compared with the second quarter of 2018 and an increase of 39% compared with last quarter. Systems revenue in the quarter reflected higher system placements, higher ASPs and higher lease-related revenue. We completed 88 operating lease transactions, representing 32% of total placements compared with 44 or 20% of total placements in the second quarter of 2018, and 78 or 33% of total placements last quarter. As of June 30, we have 486 operating leases outstanding and realized approximately $25 million of revenue related to these arrangements in the quarter compared with $12 million last year and $20 million last quarter. Operating leases create a future source of recurring revenue and reduce the volatility of system revenue, while the increased number of operating leases placed in the quarter dampens short-term revenue growth for the quarter in which they are placed. ","Operating leases included usage-based financings that we provide to certain experienced hospitals. We believe that our lease financing alternatives align with customer objectives and have enabled faster market adoption. Related to systems purchased over the lease period, we earn a small premium, reflecting the time value of money, and in the case of usage-based arrangements, the risk that those systems may not achieve the anticipated usage levels. The proportion of these types of arrangements could increase long term and will vary quarter-to-quarter. We recognized $27 million of lease buyout revenue in the quarter compared with $12 million last quarter and $13 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly from quarter-to-quarter and will likely to do so. We do not expect the second quarter buyout -- level of buyout revenue to repeat. 38% of the current quarter system placements involved trade-ins, reflecting customer desire to access or standardize on fourth-generation technology. This is an increase in the proportion of trade-ins compared to 34% in the second quarter of 2018 and 36% last quarter.","74% of the systems placed in the quarter were da Vinci Xis and 20% were da Vinci X systems compared with 67% da Vinci Xis and 25% da Vinci Xs last quarter. 13% of the systems placed were SP systems. Our rollout of the SP surgical system is measured, putting systems in the hands of experienced da Vinci users while we optimize training pathways in our supply chain. Globally, our average selling price, which excludes the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts, was approximately $1.54 million compared with $1.42 million last year and $1.31 million last quarter. ","Our mix of systems and customers in the second quarter of 2019 was very favorable relative to prior periods. We had a high mix of Xi versus X and SI systems. We also had a low mix of distributor versus direct sales. In the second quarter of 2019, we also had fewer multisystem arrangements where we provided volume discounts. The mix of systems, customers and size of arrangements will vary over time. We expect system ASPs to be in the range of the midpoint of the first 2 quarters.","Outside of the U.S., results were as follows: OUS procedures grew approximately 20% compared with the second quarter of 2018 and increased 4% compared with last quarter. Second quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $314 million increased 19% compared with the second quarter of 2018 and increased 11% compared with last quarter. The increase compared with the prior year reflects increased instruments and accessory revenue of $34 million or 29% growth. The increase in instrument accessory revenue was primarily driven by procedure growth and customer buying patterns. Outside of the U.S., we placed 80 systems in the second quarter compared with 82 in the second quarter of 2018 and 81 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 30 into Europe, 24 into Japan, and 8 into China. 61% of the systems placed in the quarter were da Vinci Xis and 33% were da Vinci X systems compared with 38% da Vinci Xis and 44% da Vinci Xs last quarter. 12 of the system placements were operating leases compared with 6 last year and 11 last quarter. Placements outside of the U.S. will continue to vary as some of the OUS markets are in the early stages of adoption; some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns; and sales into some markets are constrained by government limitations.","Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of 2019 was 71.3% compared with 71.1% for the second quarter of 2018 and 71.2% last quarter. The increase compared with the second quarter of 2018 and last quarter primarily reflects higher system ASPs. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our new products, the mix of systems and instrument and accessory revenue, system ASPs and our ability to further reduce product costs and improve manufacturing efficiency.","Pro forma operating expenses increased 27% compared with the second quarter of 2018 and decreased 1% compared with last quarter. Spending is consistent with our plan and includes, in order of magnitude of increase, costs associated with expansion of our OUS markets, spending on our informatics capabilities, and investment in our infrastructure in order to scale the business.","Our pro forma tax rate for the second quarter was 20% and within our expectations of 19% to 20%. Our tax rates will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income, changes in taxation made by local authorities, and with the impact of onetime items. Our 2020 tax rate will increase with the return of the medical device tax. Our second quarter 2019 pro forma net income was $388 million or $3.25 per share compared with $327 million or $2.76 per share for the second quarter of 2018 and $312 million or $2.61 per share for the last -- for last quarter.","I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $318 million or $2.67 per share for the second quarter of 2019 compared with GAAP net income of $255 million or $2.15 per share for the second quarter of 2018 and GAAP net income of $307 million or $2.56 per share for last quarter. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website, and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee equity and IP charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition-related items and legal settlements.","We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $5.1 billion, approximately the same as March 31, 2019. Cash generated from operations was offset by stock repurchases and investments in working capital and infrastructure during the quarter. We repurchased approximately 400,000 shares for $200 million at an average purchase price of $477 per share. In the quarter, we grew inventory by $45 million to $513 million, representing approximately 140 days of inventory. We continue to build inventory to address the growth in the business as well as mitigate risks of disruption that could arise from trade, supply or other matters. With the growth in the business and our focus on efficiency and scale, we expect our capital expenditures will increase to over $250 million in 2019.","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Calvin, who will go over procedure performance and our outlook for 2019.","Calvin Darling","Thank you, Marshall. Our overall second quarter procedure growth was 17% compared to 18% during the second quarter of 2018 and last quarter. Our Q2 procedure growth was driven by 16% growth in U.S. procedures and 20% growth in OUS markets. In the U.S., Q2 procedure results were generally consistent with recent trends. Q2 growth was again driven by growth in U.S. general surgery, thoracic and benign gynecology procedures. Q2 2019 U.S. procedure growth was 16% compared to 17% last year and last quarter, reflecting anticipated slight moderation in mature urology and gynecology procedures and general surgery growth rates. In U.S. general surgery, second quarter hernia repair and colorectal procedure growth remained solid, although at slightly lower growth rates than last quarter and last year. Other general surgery procedures such as cholecystectomy, bariatric and liver and pancreatic cases made increasing contributions to growth in Q2, with higher growth rates than last quarter.","As anticipated, U.S. procedure growth in mature urology and gynecology procedure categories moderated in Q2 compared to last year. U.S. gynecology growth and urology growth were in the mid-single digits. dVP growth specifically was in the low single-digit range, in close alignment with the underlying incident rate for prostate cancer. As a mature procedure category, we believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market. In other U.S. procedures, adoption of lobectomies and other thoracic procedures was again solid during the second quarter. ","Second quarter OUS procedure volume grew approximately 20% compared with 22% for the second quarter 2018 and 21% last quarter. Second quarter 2019 OUS procedure growth was driven by continued growth in dVP procedures and earlier-stage growth in kidney cancer procedures, general surgery and gynecology. Q2 OUS procedure growth faced modest working day headwinds due to the timing of the Easter holiday, mostly affecting Europe, and other national holidays, particularly in Japan. Japan procedure growth remains strong but moderated somewhat in Q2, reflecting lower growth rates in mature urology procedures as we reach higher levels of market penetration, the impact of holidays, and the anniversary of the new procedure reimbursements. ","In China, after several quarters of declining procedure growth, procedure growth accelerated slightly in Q2, driven by procedures performed on new systems installed under the latest system quota. In Europe, procedure growth was driven by strong results in Germany and France. Overall, European procedure growth was largely consistent with prior periods, with variation by country.","Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certainly recent published studies of note. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. We are pleased to see the evidence landscape regarding our recently cleared Ion endoluminal system start to grow. A manuscript describing the first term and use experience, led by Dr. David Fielding from the Royal Brisbane & Women's Hospital in Brisbane, Australia, has recently been accepted for publication in the peer-reviewed medical journal, Respiration.","Previously presented at the annual CHEST Conference in 2017, this study was designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the Ion endoluminal platform and included 29 consecutive subjects with follow-up data through 6 months. Although each nodule was located in the peripheral part of the lung and the mean nodule size was approximately 15 millimeters, approximately 97% of the nodules were reached, with a tissue sample suitable for assessment obtained. Importantly, across the entire study population, no instances of pneumothorax, bleeding or device-related adverse events were reported, suggesting a good safety profile. ","We believe that further scientific study and clinical evidence will be essential to build the market for Ion. Soon after receiving FDA clearance for Ion in the U.S., we initiated a post-market clinical study called PRECISE, intending to enroll 360 subjects across 6 key centers in the United States. Full details regarding the construct of the PRECISE study are available on the web at ClinicalTrials.gov. ","In May of this year, a large scale, real-world comparative study using the National Cancer Database was published in the journal, Colorectal Disease. The analysis, led by Dr. Ravi Kiran from NewYork-Presbyterian\/Columbia University Medical Center, compared the results of over 41,000 patients from between 2010 and 2015 by surgical approach. The National Cancer Database captures data from over 1,500 cancer-accredited facilities and represents approximately 70% of newly diagnosed cancer cases. The population for the study consisted of approximately 15% robotic-assisted, 33% laparoscopic and 52% open procedures. In propensity score-matched analysis, with over 4,000 subjects in each cohort, comparing the robotic LAR approach to the laparoscopic approach, the robotic LAR was associated with shorter length of stay, 6.3 days versus 6.8 days; and lower risk of conversion to open, 7.5% versus 14.95%; with multivariate analysis showing laparoscopic LAR patients being 2.2x more likely to be converted to open. Compared to open LAR, the robotic-assisted approach had shorter length of stay, 6.3 days versus 7.8 days; a higher rate of negative margins, 97.01% versus 95.96%; and higher nodal yield, 17 versus 16.4.","The authors concluded, and I quote, \"For patients with rectal cancer, robotic LAR shows recovery benefits over both open and laparoscopic LAR, with reduced conversion to open compared with laparoscopic LAR and less prolonged length of stay compared with laparoscopic LAR and open LAR. Robotic LAR is associated with short-term oncological outcomes comparable to open LAR, supporting its use in minimally-invasive surgery for rectal cancer.\"","I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2019. Starting with procedures. Last quarter, we forecast 2019 procedure growth of 15% to 17%. We are now refining our forecast to the upper half of this range and expect full year 2019 procedure growth of 16% to 17%.","Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast our 2019 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 70% and 71% of net revenue. We now expect to come in at the higher end of that range. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions.","Turning to operating expenses, we continue to expect to grow pro forma 2019 operating expenses between 24% and 28% above 2018 levels. We continue to expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $320 million and $340 million in 2019. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $130 million and $135 million in 2019, up from $120 million to $130 million forecast on our last call. With regard to income tax, we continue to estimate our 2019 pro forma income tax rate to be between 19% and 20% of pretax income. ","That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Robert Hopkins","So first question, I wanted to ask about U.S. procedure growth. By our math, the overall Q2 U.S. growth on the procedure side accelerated a little bit when you take into consideration the year ago comp, but you called out some slight moderation in hernia and colorectal. So I was wondering if you could just talk about that a little bit. Like was that -- was the growth you experienced in hernia and colorectal this quarter different than you expected? And how do you manage through this issue of kind of managing access?","Gary Guthart","This is Gary. We saw a tad of moderation. I think demand remains strong, and what we're really seeing is what we indicated to you. We have two things going on. One is there are a lot of different procedure types, and now, in busy centers, competition for system access. We can of course solve that with additional systems placed as well as work with folks on efficiency of use. And we're doing both. And you've heard that from us over the last several quarters. The next one is our commercial teams have been growing in the United States to support the growth of the company. And it takes some time to have teams come up to full productivity and we're -- the percentage of new folks in new territories has been ticking up the last couple of quarters. And it's -- the new ratio is amongst the highest we've had in the last few. Employee retention has been great. It's really around increased need to get increased case coverage, and so there, it's supporting our new folks in the field with tools and some of it is just time on task.","Calvin Darling","Yes. Bob, from just a pure mathematical standpoint, you know we track adoption curves pretty regularly around here. And it's a mathematical reality that really all points along the curve, the rate of growth actually declines. So our results here in Q2 is aligned with what we would have expected. And clearly, there's a lot -- substantial remaining opportunity in both hernia and colorectal procedures, and our checks with surgeons generally indicate healthy demand.","Robert Hopkins","That's great. And then just one on the system side because revenue growth from system sales this quarter was much higher than the first quarter due to mix, as you called out. But the placement numbers and the placement growth in both quarters suggest very strong underlying demand for your systems in both quarters. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the differences you saw from Q1 to Q2 in that mix dynamic and what that suggests about the outlook for the rest of the year on the system side.","Marshall Mohr","This is Marshall. We have seen, as you suggested, reasonable strength in terms of system placements. I don't think there's anything really different quarter-to-quarter other than the mix. In other words, the buying behaviors of the customers hasn't changed. We're seeing a nice cycle on trade-ups. And -- but we did see, again, more Xis this quarter. And there's volatility or variability between quarter-to-quarter as it relates to particularly our distribution channel. And so we saw fewer distributor sales this quarter and more direct sales. And our direct sales are at a higher price than what we sell to our distributors as they incurred the selling costs associated with those systems. So that's really -- that's the color that we would provide on systems revenue.","Gary Guthart","Marshall, is it fair to look at it and say, if you view the first half as a whole rather than in different quarters, you'd get a better picture?","Marshall Mohr","That's true, Gary. You should -- when you look at ASPs, you should think about the combination of the 2 because 1.31 was a low point and 1.54 is a high point.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho Peterson","Maybe I'll just follow-up on that last question. Why should ASPs take a little bit of a step back? You did -- you skew more toward fully featured system sales. Obviously, your procedure mix is expanding. Why logically should ASPs step down a little bit going forward?","Marshall Mohr","You should expect that the -- again, distributor sales tend to be variable quarter-to-quarter. So, I think you should blend the first quarter and the second quarter when you're looking at what level of the distributor sales you should expect. And I think same thing with the mix of Xi and X, just depending on the geography, X is targeting geographies where reimbursements are pressured. And so this quarter, just based on mix, we wound up selling fewer Xs and that should even out as well.","Tycho Peterson","And we've had a couple of quarters now of operating leases in kind of the low 30s, it was 29% at the end of last year. Is this kind of the new norm in your view? Or how should we think about operating leases in terms of mix going forward?","Marshall Mohr","I don't think about it as a norm. I think that there's going to be variability quarter-to-quarter. And yes, Q2 is slightly lower, if not close to being the same as Q1. But I think, over time, we will accommodate customers, and we think that on the other hand, leases are positive for the company in that they -- as I said in my prepared remarks, it increases the recurring revenue. It eliminates volatility. It also enables an upgrade cycle when and if new systems come out. So we think it's a positive and so we'll supply those to customers as they ask for them. I would guess that over time -- or we're predicting over time that there's the possibility that the percentage actually will increase.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then on IRIS, I know it's early days, I didn't really hear you bring it up in the comments, but can you just talk a little bit about interest levels for kidney and liver and how we should think about the expanded use of that going forward?","Gary Guthart","I think the interest from the forward-leaning surgeons is very high. I think, in general, people are looking out seeing additional access to data. IRIS, just a reminder for everybody, is the integration of preoperative imaging, 3D imaging into a case in real-time. We're not in the clinic yet. We do have our 510(k) clearance. We're working through agreements with first customers. We don't expect revenue this year. ","I think, directionally, there's quite a lot of support. I think part of what we want to develop in the market as we go forward are use cases and really getting the value statement for them in terms of what it drives, either accuracy or efficiency or both.","Early response is great, but these things take a little time to develop and to develop the evidence base that goes behind it.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","A couple of questions here. I'll start with Gary. Gary, last year, procedures began to inflect from a mentor perspective and they still remain pretty strong. As you think about the next inflection for procedure growth, I mean, do you think it's more likely that it comes from new systems? Obviously, SP, Ion creating this access, you've already talked about it on this call, or accessing new geographies, Japan and China. I notice you already mentioned in a comment that just a few systems in Japan -- sorry, in China, was able to drive some demand. So across those 3 buckets, Gary, systems, access, geographies, what is the most likely driver of the next wave of procedure inflection?","Gary Guthart","I think in the near term, access in core markets is going to be important. What's been nice here in the last few years is the procedure base has been building. So healthy double-digit growth rates in procedures, and absolute growth numbers are starting to become substantial and making sure that those surgeons who want access to the system have it has been important, and it's been one of the drivers for our increased flexibility and agility in capital acquisition models. ","As you look at SP and Ion, both of those are interesting platforms that I think, over time, will expand the total available market for robotic systems and diagnostics in single-port or single-access surgery. They take some time to develop. And the speed with which they develop is, as I said in the script, paced by additional indications and manufacturing scale. Longer term, I think those things are exciting, but it will take some time to go through. ","Geography, we've seen real successes but they take time. Japan has been a great success. They're doing a really nice job. But it is really heavy lifting to do all the things required to build market access, from partnering networks to training centers to the clinical evidence base to support additional adoption. So I think those things are important. We have invested in them and we'll continue to do so. So short answer, maybe not a perfect modeling answer but I'll leave that to you.","David Lewis","Okay. And then just maybe a follow-up for you, Gary, just trying to get a sense of thinking about the SP rollout and the Ion rollout, your Ion commentary was fairly consistent with the first quarter. If I think about the first 4 quarters of SP, obviously ex-ing out the manufacturing issues last quarter, do you see Ion rolling out from a system placement perspective in a similar fashion to SP? Is there a reason why it would be faster in the first four quarters of commercialization? Or slower?","Gary Guthart","Yes. I'd anticipate measured in these first 4 quarters of launch as we optimize our systems on our side and also gathering our data. After that, we'll see. I don't think I'd predict it one way or another for you. The indications in Ion, we feel pretty good about to get started. I think the size of that market is real, and so we'll see a year from now, I think, as to how fast we want to move. On SP, it has, I think, great long-term potential. It requires additional clearances, in the U.S. anyway, to keep moving and so we'll do that in sequence.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Amit Hazan with Citigroup.","Amit Hazan","Let me start with one on the quarter and just follow after that. So on the quarter, the I&A versus procedures, I&A was up 22%, procedures up 17%. That's the widest gap I can recall in a little while. You touched on it a bit, but maybe just a little bit more color. Is it that new and advanced instruments driving something that's sustainable? Or are there onetime things in there that we should consider?","Calvin Darling","Yes. I think, in general, we have seen increasing revenue, instrument accessory revenue per procedure. Obviously, there's variability by quarter based mostly on the timing of customer orders. But in general, we've been gradually increasing. And the biggest aspect of that has been increasing usage of the advanced instruments, from vessel sealing, the Vessel Sealer Extend we launched recently, now to stapling as well, and the 60-millimeter stapler we launched last year and are more fully available this year in the U.S. So I think that's been the biggest factor that's probably been more than offsetting most everything else, whether it's more procedures in general surgery, hernia repair and others that may be lower tool usage. So I think that's the biggest factor there.","Amit Hazan","And just a slightly longer-term question on flexible endoscopy with surgical instruments. One of your bigger future robotic competitors has been talking about this publicly now for the first time in just the past month or so. Can you talk to how much of a priority this is for Intuitive? What you can tell us about the opportunity from a robotic perspective?","Gary Guthart","Sure. In general, as we've described before, we like to think in platforms. And what I mean by that is if we can build some core technologies from advanced imaging to great precision to great software, then we can mix and match those core capabilities to pursue different endpoints clinically. And so you look at SP, SP is an exceptionally powerful system that brings together four instruments through a single access point. You look at Ion, and Ion has exquisite sensing and a flexible endoscopy or a flexible diagnostic platform. Over time, I think those two different sets of ingredients give us a lot of opportunity and optionality. And so I think those things are interesting and they could open for us additional clinical markets over the long term. ","That said, product design is subtle, and architectural choices are really, really important. Doing it right, getting a great clinical outcome comes down to sub-millimeter precision and microsecond timings of these electronics. And as a result, we want to make sure that we really deliver on the things we put in the market, from SP to Ion. So we're not sprinting to go as broad as possible. We really want to make sure we deliver against the commitments we make and for the customers who purchase our products. There's a fair amount of history out there of companies that have failed to attend to the details and start strong and peter out. And so we're careful and thoughtful about it.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen","First, could you talk about the strategic and financial implications of the Fiberoptics acquisition? And I had one follow-up.","Gary Guthart","Sure. I'll speak to why we did it. This is a -- Sch\u00f6lly is a strong team and a supply chain partner that has been important for us over many years. Clearly, great imaging manufacturing capability, design capability and processing is a core part of surgery of the future and interventions of the future. As we've grown, we wanted to make sure that we can continue to invest in that space, both on the design side and on the manufacturing and production capability side. It's been a great partnership with that team. We respect them and have been very productive with them. And so that gives us additional optionality and agility going forward in a core part of our business. On more of deal specifics and logistics, I'll turn it over to Marshall.","Marshall Mohr","So we entered into an agreement to acquire certain assets and operations from Sch\u00f6lly for a cash consideration of approximately $100 million. The exact amount of the consideration and timing of the closing is subject to certain closing conditions. And so that will occur over the next future periods. And the employees will transfer after each of the closing events occurs.","Lawrence Biegelsen","And then, on Ion, we haven't heard you talk about the opportunity or timing outside the U.S. What's the status, particularly in China and rest of the world?","Gary Guthart","Yes. On the specifics on China, we are in discussions with China's regulatory agencies about how best to bring it to market and timing there. I don't have a definitive answer for you yet, but it's an active discussion. Clearly, we believe there are end-user opportunities and value, health care value to bring in China and in Europe and in other markets. And we'll take it in sequence. We think this is a powerful set of technologies and a powerful platform. We are still in the early days. ","Our greatest organizational focus right now is on really understanding the technology and the use of it carefully. The early clinical results are great and they are differentiated relative to other products in the market, so far, in these early days. That's really important to us. We will focus there. And as we build strength and experience and scale, then it gives us a lot of opportunities to engage the rest of the world.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Lawrence Keusch with Raymond James.","John Hsu","This is John Hsu on for Larry. Maybe if we could start, without providing guidance for 2020, can you give us some high-level guideposts for how we should generally think about investment spend next year going into 2019? You obviously have a lot of products on your plate this year, but just any high-level color would be greatly appreciated.","Marshall Mohr","Well, we'll give you a better color when it comes to January about what's going to happen next year. But the things that we're investing in are not short-term investments. They take -- they occur over a long period. And so you should expect that spending will continue to -- continue on those and on other matters going forward. And as we grow the company, of course, there's an increased amount of support that's necessary to grow the company, particularly on the sales side in terms of personnel and commissions. And so I think spending will increase. I won't give you anything more specific than that until we get later in the year.","Gary Guthart","Maybe I'll just speak for our philosophy a little bit. We think the opportunity for improved performance and, therefore, opportunities for the business are substantial. And what paces us as to how we decide how much we'll invest and when is that which we think we can do with excellence. Generally speaking, we see more opportunity than we think we can pursue. We wind up saying no to some things that are probably good ideas but we don't know that we can perform them well. And so that's what balances our investment portfolio. And we'll continue to use that philosophy as we plan out 2020 and go forward.","John Hsu","Great. And then just on the balance sheet, you obviously have $5 billion-plus in cash, you bought back some stock in the quarter, you also did a tuck-in acquisition for imaging capabilities. Can you just remind us how you think about your capital deployment priorities at this point?","Marshall Mohr","Yes. The philosophy and approach to capital deployment hasn't really changed. But to remind you, we think about that cash obviously to operate the company. We're making investments in our future. We want cash. The market is volatile in terms of -- the environment is volatile in terms of tariffs and other things going on. We want to make sure we've got proper investments to be able to deal with those. And then, ultimately, we look for opportunities to buy back stock and return cash to shareholders.","John Hsu","Okay. Great. And then just -- I could sneak one last one in on the tax rate. I think you mentioned the medical device tax coming back in 2020. By my estimate, I think we're coming up with an impact of roughly $30 million. Is that a decent ballpark for how you're thinking about the impact of product gross margin in 2020?","Calvin Darling","Yes. When we're talking about medical device tax we were recognizing in the past, we charge that expense item to cost of sales. So it impacts our gross margin there. We saw an impact around 70 to 100 basis points then. And it's probably a similar kind of impact, should that be reenacted.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of JP McKim with Piper Jaffray.","Jonathan McKim","I wanted to ask one on just this push to -- on trade-ins and upgrading the installed base to Generation 4. I think, after the last quarter, I think, half the installed base was still older generation. And so can you give us an update on where that is today? And then just how -- strategically how important is that to you to get everyone on Gen 4 ahead of competition that, in theory, should come sometime next year or after that?","Calvin Darling","I'll give you the numbers and let Gary talk to the strategy. You heard on this call, it was another 38% of our system sales involved trade-ins this quarter. It's likely to continue to be a significant part of our capital sales in future periods. At this point in time, it is about 45% of our installed base of 5,270 systems that are Gen 3 and prior, mostly SIs.","Gary Guthart","We think it helps. I mean, as to the strategy, we think our customers appreciate it. Many customers now are multisystem owners, or across their integrated delivery network, they have systems at different hospitals where surgeons visit. So having consistency helps them. Gen 4 products have a greater access to advanced instruments and other technologies and are well appreciated. So in that sense, we think we can lean in and help those organizations go do it. There's a different set of regulatory clearances. In different countries around the world, there are different trade-in economics in each country. So as you think about the analysis, you think a little bit about which region and which country can move most quickly, and we work through that as well.","Jonathan McKim","Okay. And then, if I could ask one on just -- the comments you made on the general surgery dynamics with hernia and some of the others is tempering based on just law of large numbers. But the shift to bariatrics and some more on chole, I mean, the shift in turnaround on general surgery, what does that do for your instrument ASPs? Are they more advanced instruments as you shift to different procedures in general surgery?","Calvin Darling","Highly variable. You look at choles, those are lower revenue-per-procedure cases. If you look at bariatrics, it's the other side where a lot of staple pliers are used. So it's a highly variable landscape.","Gary Guthart","Bariatrics is in early innings. And as we start to optimize the instrument kit therein, we're seeing really pull from the market there. We haven't changed our priorities in the U.S. sales force with regard to general surgery. We continue to believe there is opportunity and value in, of course, hernia and colorectal procedures. The bariatric side are really customers coming to us and starting to move that along.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink.","Richard Newitter","I have two and housekeeping. With the housekeeping, can you just quantify what the selling day headwind was, what your procedure growth would've been excluding the -- not the selling day, but some of the headwinds that you had described related to the holiday timing and whatnot? And then, Gary, I was wondering, with respect to the capacity issues just getting robot time, are there certain types of procedure mix cases or certain types of institutions where you can proactively get in front of those capacity issues to get there before they occur? And is there any kind of characteristic of the institution's procedure mix that specifically is leading to capacity constraints?","Calvin Darling","Yes. First, on the working day, really minor in the quarter. Not a big thing. We mentioned in the commentary, overall, maybe a 30-ish basis point impact on procedure volume, with a much larger portion attributable outside the U.S. due to the timing of Easter.","Gary Guthart","On the capacity side, as we've said in the past, our customer base doesn't -- one size does not fit all. Each institution runs with different operating cadences within their organization. So in some places, we see extremely efficient capital utilization. Really, a focused actuary approach where they have very high predictability and get a lot of procedures out of the system. We're delighted to support that. And we help to benchmark that and teach others as they need it. ","We see other institutions that, for various reasons, are operating at lower capital capacity for some reasons that are quite good. Some may be teaching institutions, some may be institutions that take on the most complex comorbid patient sets where predictability of procedure duration is difficult. So you can imagine, if you're sharing a system between a thoracic surgeon who's performing lung cancer procedures and a general surgeon who's doing hernia repairs, the cadences and rhythms in scheduling are quite different and you're going to get less optimal scheduling.","To the extent that we can have those conversations up front and help them optimize, we do. That's something we've been strengthening over time, so I think we can do better than we do today.","Richard Newitter","Great. If I get one more, just the China utilization pickup on just 8 systems placed under the quota, did that surprise you that it was able to translate into a pickup in volumes so quickly? I was always of the impression that you needed -- there was going to be a lag time to train institutions. If you could comment there.","Gary Guthart","I don't know if we were surprised. I'd say we were pleased. That tells you the level of commitment and motivation of those customers to make their investment productive. Last questioner, please.","Operator","Yes. The last question comes from the line of Imron Zafar with Deutsche Bank.","Imron Zafar","First question is on Japan. I believe you noted some moderation in procedure growth there, but at the same time, we're still seeing some very strong capital equipment placement numbers this quarter. Can you just sort of give us some color on what's driving these placements? Is it more sort of greenfield robotics programs that are looking to get into presumably urology? Or is it the established customers wanting to get more into general surgery? In light of the sort of the less financial incentive that they have, I'm just wondering if there's any -- if the growth should continue to slow going forward in general surgery.","Marshall Mohr","It's a combination of greenfields, where you have hospitals that are positioning themselves to do the newer procedures that were approved for reimbursement last year. And there's still a trade-in cycle going on in Japan. Our distributor had sold SIs on leases, and as those leases are coming up -- are coming due, then we see customers wanting to upgrade to the newer technology.","Imron Zafar","Okay. And then we've heard some mention from some surgeons on some third parties that hospitals can ship instruments to their -- that are approaching the end of their useful life and that this limited useful life can be extended presumably via some sort of a software intervention or something. Is this something that you're seeing any impact from? Or is there any regulatory preclusion that would limit the ability for companies to do this kind of stuff?","Gary Guthart","On how good an idea is it, the people in reprocess like that are bound by the same regulatory framework that we are in terms of assuring the quality of that product and making sure it's not sold as an adulterated product, and they have to take on that burden and it is a sophisticated one. Calvin, I'll let you respond.","Calvin Darling","No. Yes. I think that's essentially it.","Gary Guthart","In terms of materiality of it.","Calvin Darling","Yes. And you look at our revenue per procedure, I mean, it's -- we've talked about that a little bit and I don't think we've seen any impact on that.","Gary Guthart","That was our last question. In closing, we believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute intervention. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim: better and more predicable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for the care teams, and ultimately, a lower total cost to treat. We believe that accomplishing this aim takes the integration of 3 elements: first, a deep understanding of the human interactions across the continuum of care; second, smart and connected systems, imaging and instruments that augment care teams; and third, the ability to measure impact through analytic insights and translation of these insights into action driving positive change. ","Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

[Operator Instructions]  As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Calvin Darling, Senior Director, Investor Relations for Intuitive Surgical. Please go ahead.","Calvin Darling","Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to Intuitive Surgical's second quarter conference call.","With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Aleks Cukic, our Vice President of Strategic Planning.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.","Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archives section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release has been posted to our website.","Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our second quarter's results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our second quarter financial results. Aleks will discuss marketing and clinical highlights, and I will provide an update to our financial forecast for 2012. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.","With that, I will turn it over to Gary.","Gary S. Guthart","Thank you for joining us today. In the second quarter, our team has delivered a solid performance driven by robust growth in both our U.S. gynecology business and our emerging general surgery business. As a reminder, for 2012, Intuitive is focused on the following: First, continuing our growth in gynecology and urology worldwide through outstanding execution in the field; second, disciplined execution of our Single-Site and vessel sealing launches focused on outstanding early customer experiences; third, building robust clinical programs with leading customers in emerging procedures in general surgery, thoracic surgery and transoral surgery; and finally, strengthening our capabilities in international markets, particularly Europe, Japan and Korea.","In the second quarter, we continued to experience strong growth in gynecology and general surgery. Growth in gynecology came from a broad base of procedures, including benign and cancer hysterectomies, sacrocolpopexy, myomectomy and endometriosis resection. Growth in general surgery was also multifaceted, including growth in colon and rectal surgery, as well as cholecystectomy. The latter following the introduction of Single-Site earlier in the year. This strength was tempered somewhat by weakness in Europe and a decline in our U.S. da Vinci Prostatectomies. In total, procedures for the second quarter 2012 grew by approximately 26% over the second quarter of 2011. Aleks will provide additional procedure commentary later in the call.","Globally, our business in Asia has continued to build as a result of fine execution by our team. Japan's system sales and procedure performance have responded well to MHLW's reimbursement of da Vinci Prostatectomy at the start of the second quarter, and we continue to invest in building our capabilities in Japan. Conditions in Europe are challenging, with both broad austerity issues, as well as specific structural issues impacting our business. In response to these conditions, we have brought in an experienced executive from our key accounts group in the United States to lead our European commercial organization. We also continue to invest in our international regulatory and reimbursement teams. Given the depth of environmental issues in Europe, we expect challenging conditions to persist into the second half of the year.","Turning to operating highlights for the second quarter. Procedures grew approximately 26% over the second quarter of 2011. We sold 150 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 129 during the second quarter of last year. Total revenue was $537 million, up 26% over last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $224 million, up 30% over Q2 2011. Total recurring revenue grew to $307 million, up 28% from prior year and comprising 57% of total revenue. Net income was $155 million, up 32% over last year. We generated an operating profit of $259 million before noncash stock option expense, up 27% from the second quarter of last year. We generated $223 million in gross cash flow from operations and ended the quarter with $2,631,000,000 in cash and investments.","Turning to recently launched products and those in development. In the second quarter, we focused on launches of our Single-Site instruments and vessel sealer. We expanded the use of Single-Site cholecystectomy in the U.S. in response to growing early customer demand. Surgeon and patient response to Single-Site has been positive with over 200 of our U.S. hospital customers having purchased initial Single-Site kits 2 quarters after launch. As mentioned in prior calls, we are working on expanding our instrument offering in Single-Site to enable its use in additional indications.","In our vessel sealing launch, we are optimizing procedure choreography through collaboration with leading surgeons, while firming up our manufacturing and supply chain. Clinical response to the vessel sealer has been encouraging, with positive commentary on precision, articulation, vessel sealing quality and thermal spread. We expect applications for the da Vinci vessel sealer to be centered on general surgery and Gynecologic Oncology procedures.","Lastly, with regard to our da Vinci stapler, we are gathering data to respond to FDA questions and working on product optimization. As we enter new surgical markets and drive into new product arenas, we continue to invest in building our team. In expanding partnerships and in acquiring those technologies, they can make a difference to robotic surgery. This quarter we added 82 people to our team, predominantly in sales, manufacturing and R&D, bringing our total team to 2,100 employees. I'll now pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer.","Marshall L. Mohr","Thank you, Gary. Our second quarter revenue was $537 million, up 26% compared with $426 million for the second quarter of 2011, and up 8% compared with $495 million reported for the first quarter of 2012. Second quarter revenues by product category were as follows. Second quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $224 million, up 30% compared with $172 million for the second quarter of 2011, and up 8% compared with $208 million in the first quarter of 2012. The increases in instruments and accessories were driven by procedure growth of approximately 26% and sales of our new instrument and accessory products, including Single-Site, vessel sealer and Firefly. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $2,015 per procedure, which is higher than the $1,940 realized in the second quarter of 2011 and the $1,985 realized in the first quarter of 2012. The increase in I&A per procedure was driven primarily by new product sales in advance of their use in cases.","Second quarter 2012 systems revenue of $229 million increased 23% compared with $187 million for the second quarter of 2011, and increased 11% compared with $207 million for the first quarter of 2012. We sold 150 systems in the second quarter of 2012 compared with 129 systems in the second quarter of 2011 and 140 systems in the first quarter of 2012.","Our second quarter average sales price per system was $1.53 million, an increase from the $1.44 million realized in the second quarter of 2011 and $1.47 million realized in the first quarter. ASPs include all da Vinci models, all simulators and Firefly when configured with the system and exclude upgrades. The increase in ASPs compared with the first quarter of 2012 was driven by favorable channel, product and trade-in mix.","From a channel standpoint, we sold proportionally less systems to distributors, which are sold at lower prices than prices charged to direct customers. There were 14 systems sold to distributors in the second quarter compared with 26 in the first quarter.","On the product side, we sold 121 simulators, mostly in conjunction with new system sales compared with 108 -- or 102 last quarter. We also sold 28 dual console systems compared to 25 in the first quarter. 35 of our second quarter 2012 systems involved trade-ins comprised of 23 da Vinci Ss and 12 standard models, while 46 of our first quarter 2012 system sales involved trade-ins, comprised of 27 da Vinci Ss and 19 standard models. ASPs will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on product, customer and trade-in mix, as well as foreign exchange rates on direct sales to foreign customers. We would expect systems ASPs to decline in future quarters driven by a return to a more historic mix and lower ASPs earned on direct sales to European customers due to lower euro exchange rate.","Service revenue increased to $83 million, up 23% compared with $68 million last year and up 3% compared with $81 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was primarily driven by a larger system installed base.","Total second quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue, increased to $307 million, up 28% compared with the second quarter of 2011 and up 6% compared with the first quarter of 2012. Recurring revenue represented 57% of total second quarter revenue compared with 56% in the second quarter last year and 58% last quarter.","International results were as follows. Second quarter revenue outside the U.S. was $101 million, up 16% compared with revenue of $87 million in the second quarter of 2011, and down 3% compared with revenue of $105 million in the first quarter of 2012. Instrument and accessory revenue grew approximately 21% year-over-year and decreased 3% sequentially, reflecting procedure growth rates. Procedures outside of the U.S. grew 21% on a year-to-year basis and decreased approximately 1% sequentially. The growth in procedures compared to the prior year primarily reflect dVP growth in Europe. The decline in procedures compared with the first quarter reflects the macroeconomic environment in Europe coupled with fewer operating days due to holidays. dVPs in Japan grew at a high rate, albeit off a small base, as national reimbursement was approved at the beginning of the quarter. We sold 26 systems outside the U.S. compared with 30 in the second quarter of 2011 and 35 last quarter. We sold 13 systems in Europe this quarter, with 16 in the second quarter of 2011 and 14 last quarter. And we sold 7 systems in Japan compared with 7 last quarter and 4 in the second quarter of last year. The decline in European system sales reflects difficult macroeconomic environment. Aleks will provide additional details of international system sales.","Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the second quarter was 72%, roughly equal to the second quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012. Our gross margin has remained unchanged as the positive impacts of our higher second quarter system ASPs were offset by lower margins earned on new products and higher inventory reserves. Margins on newly launched products would typically be lower than those for our mature products, reflecting vendor pricing on low volumes, temporary tooling costs and other startup costs. Overtime, as volumes increase, we refine the manufacturing process of some products, we should see improvements in the margins of these newer products.","Second quarter 2012 operating expenses of $161.1 million were up 16% compared with the second quarter of 2011 and down 1% compared with the first quarter of 2012. We changed our stock option granting pattern this year, so that employees are granted options at both February 15 and August 15 compared with only at February 15 in prior years. Although approximately the same number of options will be granted annually, the amount of expense taken in the first quarter and second quarter was approximately $3 million and $5 million lower and the amount of expense in the third quarter will be approximately $8 million higher than had we not changed our stock granting pattern. We added 82 employees in the quarter, including 38 employees in our commercial operations and 39 employees in product operations. Second quarter operating income was $225 million or 42% of sales compared with $168 million or 39% of sales for the second quarter of 2011 and $193 million or 39% of sales for the first quarter of 2012. Second quarter 2012 operating income reflected $33 million of noncash stock compensation expense compared with $35 million for the second quarter of 2011 and $34 million last quarter.","Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 32% compared with 32% for the second quarter of 2011 and 27% last quarter. Our 32% second quarter rate was higher than our previous guidance of 31%, primarily due to a higher proportion of pretax income coming from our U.S. business. Our net income was $155 million or $3.75 per share compared with $117 million or $2.91 per share for the second quarter of 2011 and $144 million or $3.50 per share for the first quarter of 2012.","Let me quickly summarize our results for the first 6 months of 2012. Procedures grew by 27%. Total revenue for the first 6 months of 2012 was $1,032,000,000, up 27% compared with $814 million last year. The revenue increase included recurring revenue growth of 29% and an increase in systems revenue of 23%. Operating income for the first 6 months of 2012 was $419 million, up 32% compared with $316 million last year. Operating income included $68 million of stock-based compensation charges in the first 6 months of 2012 compared with $67 million in 2011. Net income for the first 6 months of 2012 was $298 million or $7.26 per share compared with $222 million or $5.51 per share last year. Cash flows from operations for the first 6 months of 2012 was $383 million compared with $306 million last year.","Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash and investments of $2.6 billion, up $260 million compared with March 31, 2012. The increase was driven by $217 million of cash flow from operations plus $56 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $15 million in stock buybacks and $14 million of capital and IP purchases. We have $553 million board-authorized buybacks remaining. Our accounts receivable balance increased to $323 million at June 30 from $300 million at March 31, primarily reflecting our higher second quarter revenue. Our net inventory of $119 million at June 30 is equal to the March 31 balance. And with that I'd like to turn it over to Aleks, who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights.","Aleks Cukic","Thank you, Marshall. During the second quarter, we sold 150 da Vinci systems: 124 in the United States, 13 into Europe and 13 into rest of world markets. As part of the 150 system sales, 12 standard da Vinci systems and 23 da Vinci S Systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si Systems. We had a net 115 system additions to the installed base during the quarter, which brings to 2,341 the cumulative number of da Vinci Systems worldwide: 1,707 in the U.S., 389 in Europe and 245 in rest of world markets. 79 of the 150 systems installed during the quarter represented repeat system sales to existing customers. In total, 142 of the 150 systems sold represented da Vinci Si Systems, which included 28 dual console systems. The 26 system sales internationally included 7 into Japan, 4 into France and 3 into the U.K.","Clinically, we had a solid quarter, achieving year-over-year procedure growth of approximately 26%. Gynecology, general surgery, along with the emerging categories of thoracic and head and neck surgery, accounted for a large part of this growth. Da Vinci Hysterectomy, Cholecystectomy, Colon and Rectal Resections, Lobectomy, Endometriosis Resections, Myomectomy and Partial Nephrectomy exhibited strong quarter-over-quarter growth, which was partially offset by dVP softness in the United States. The recent pressure from nonsurgical disease management, namely active surveillance, as well as an apparent decline in PSA screening has caused some pull back in the U.S. dVP number. As the incumbent leader in the surgical treatment of prostate cancer, it's difficult, perhaps impossible to remain unaffected by this larger trend, at least in the short term.","Recently released new products continue to do well, most notably Single-Site. Early customer feedback has been positive and our initial sales have been strong. Within the first 2 quarters, post-launch, we've sold Single-Site kits to over 200 U.S. customers, while demand for training remains strong. We initiated our phased rollout of the vessel sealer product in February and its use within the segments of general, colorectal and GYN surgery has begun. The product is performing well and the feature set, specifically the articulated risk design, appears to be satisfying a strong market need.","Operationally, we continue to make progress toward optimizing the manufacturing process while reducing product costs. Regarding system attachments, namely da Vinci Simulator and da Vinci Firefly. Both attachment rates remained high in the second quarter. Strong market acceptance for these products has helped buoy our da Vinci system ASP to an all-time high. During the quarter, over 350 robotic abstracts and papers representing a variety of surgical specialties were published within various peer-reviewed journals, and the clinical conferences were abundant with live da Vinci procedure transmissions, postgraduate robotic courses and podium presentations and clinical poster sessions. The adoption of our international dVH business has lagged behind the United States for both malignant and benign conditions, not surprising. We believe that dVH for the treatment of malignant conditions will likely pace the international GYN business. In a recent edition of the International Journal of Gynecologic Cancer, doctors Mark and Yang  [ph] from the National University in Singapore, published a study describing the conversion of their open hysterectomy practice to a da Vinci Hysterectomy practice in treating endometrial cancer. Open surgery is the standard of care for endometrial cancer staging in Singapore, as it is in many other countries. This study compared the results of open hysterectomy to dVH in 124 consecutive endometrial cancer patients. The patients in each cohort were of similar age, BMI and pre-existing health condition. The authors reported that their operating time was longer during their initial 20 dVH procedures but had dropped significantly thereafter and were subsequently on par with the comparator. Lymph node harvests were also slightly lower within the initial 20 cases, but were similar thereafter. However, dVH was associated with 56% less blood loss than open surgery; had a lower rate of postoperative complications, 8.8% versus 26.8%; and a lower wound complication rate, 0% versus 9.9%. In addition, the requirement for postoperative parenteral analgesia was only 5.9% for the dVH patients as compared with 51.1% for the open laparotomy patients. And hospitalization was reduced to 2 days for the dVH patients as compared to 5.9 days for the open laparotomy group. They concluded their paper by stating and I quote, \"Our series shows that outcomes traditionally associated with laparoscopic endometrial cancer staging are achievable by laparoscopically naive gynecologic cancer surgeons moving from laparotomy to robotic-assisted endometrial cancer staging after a relatively small number of cases.\"","Early data for da Vinci Single-Sites choles is being collected at various sites within the U.S. and abroad, while the initial EU publications begin to appear in the literature.","In a recent edition of the Archives of Surgery, a consortium made up of 5 leading Italian robotic centers published initial results of their first 100 Single-Site cholecystectomy procedures. The paper entitled Overcoming the Challenges of Single Incision Cholecystectomy with Robotic Single-Site Technology, described the contribution of traditional single incision laparoscopy as an important development step in moving from multiple site laparoscopy to single incision interventions. However, single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomies has not gained wide spread use due in large part to the physical limitations of the technology, which compromises optimal triangulation, the overall ergonomics of the procedure and quality of view, this, according to the authors. They also reported that the combination of these factors provides challenges for optimal tissue exposure and that traditional instruments platforms have significant limitation when used for SILS. They went on to say and I quote, \"Da Vinci Single-Site Cholecystectomy was regarded as a safe procedure by all surgeons involved in this study and as safe as standard four-port laparoscopic operation.\" They also reported that 4 out of the 5 surgeons participating in this trial claimed to be considering the extension of da Vinci Single-Site Technology toward treating other conditions. In their conclusion, they wrote and I quote, \"The robotic technology is a compensatory technique that can overcome the constraints and the ergonomic limitations of SILS and is potentially capable of realizing the full potential of single-access approach. We showed that it allows for the quick overcoming of the learning curve that is typical to most new procedures, particularly of laparoscopic single incision approach. This is likely to increase the safety of single-incision surgery, and in turn, expand adoption to a wider number of general surgeons and surgical procedures.\"","In a recent edition of the British Journal of Urology, an interesting paper out of Asia authored by Dr. Shin Dong Chung  [ph] and others from National University Hospital in Taiwan studied the readmission rates for patients who have undergone open prostatectomy, lap prostatectomy and robotic prostatectomy. The nationwide Taiwanese study included 2,741 patients, studied over a 5-year period with the objective of determining the sub 90-day readmission rate associated with each of the 3 techniques. The reduction of readmission rates is a goal shared by all economies since the associated costs can be quite significant for payers and patients. In total, 257 or 9.4% of the 2,741 patients studied required a readmission to a hospital within 90 days post surgery. The diagnosis for readmission included intestinal infections, UTIs, hernias, pneumonia, prostatic hypertrophy, retention of urine and postoperative infection. The authors reported that the readmission rate for traditional laparoscopic prostatectomy patients was more than twice as common than for patients undergoing a dVP. 8.2% for lap versus 3.6% for dVP. When comparing the readmission rate for open prostatectomy to dVP, the frequency of readmission was nearly 3x as great, 10.7% versus 3.6%. In a written discussion, the author stated and I quote, \"In the present study, we clearly showed that patients undergoing robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy had a lower risk of 90-day readmission than the patients undergoing open prostatectomy. We think that the present study is an important step in helping to define the relative efficacy of robotic prostatectomy, laparoscopic prostatectomy and open prostatectomy as a treatment option for localized prostate cancer. Moreover, the present findings may prove valuable to patients trying to make an objective decision about the various treatment options. Because the present study used nationwide population-based data sets, its robust findings can be generalized to a population as a whole.\"","This concludes my remarks. And I'll now turn the time over to Calvin.","Calvin Darling","Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing you with an update to our financial forecast for 2012, including procedures, revenues and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates of significant noncash expenses to provide you with visibility into our expected future cash flows.","Starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecast procedures to grow approximately 25% to 27% from a base of approximately 360,000 procedures performed in 2011. Halfway through 2012, our procedure growth stands at 27%. During the second quarter, we saw a continued strength in U.S. gynecology and general surgery procedures, while we experienced a pull back in U.S. dVP volume and challenges in our European procedure business. Based upon the net of these factors, we continue to forecast full year 2012 da Vinci procedure volume to grow approximately 25% to 27% above our 2011 total.","Moving on to revenues. We are increasing our 2012 revenue guidance. Based primarily upon capital sales trends and revenue contributions from new products, we now expect 2012 revenue to grow between 20% and 23% above total 2011 revenue of $1.76 billion. This is up from the 19% to 21% revenue growth forecast on our previous call. Specifically related to system ASP, as Marshall mentioned, our Q2 ASP came in at $1.53 million. This metric largely resulted from favorable channel, trade-in and product mix. Going forward, we would expect to see a system sales mix more in line with previous patterns. In addition, euro-based system ASPs will be lower in U.S. dollar terms due to the weaker euro. As a result, we would expect system ASP to return to more historic levels realized in previous quarters. Overall, we would expect our total Q3 2012 revenue to be near or possibly below our Q2 level.","Now turning to expenses. Consistent with our last call, we continue to forecast full year noncash compensation to fall within a range of between $152 million and $156 million for the year. The timing of these expenses however will be considerably different in 2012 as compared to prior years. As Marshall mentioned, in 2012, we began issuing employee option grants in 2 installments, one in February and one in August, rather than a single February grant. As a result, in 2012, Q1 and Q2 received lower proportions of the full year expense and Q3 will receive a significantly higher proportion. Specifically, 2012 actual stock compensation was $34.4 million in Q1 and $33.3 million in Q2. We would expect Q3 stock compensation to be between $13 million and $14 million higher than Q2 and come in around $47 million then declining to around $40 million in Q4.","R&D expenses. Based upon the timing of various R&D projects, we anticipate a significant uptick in Q3 R&D expense compared to Q2. Based upon the timing of stock compensation and R&D expenses and continuing business growth, we would expect Q3 operating expenses to come in over $20 million higher than Q2.","Now turning to operating income. Consistent with our previous forecast, we continue to expect operating income to fall within a range of between 39% and 40% of net revenue. Again, while second quarter operating income came at 42% of sales and we stand at 40.6% on a year-to-date basis, based upon the timing of expenses I just described, we expect full year operating expense to come in within our 39% to 40% guidance range. We expect other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income, to total between $16 million and $17 million for the year. With regard to income tax, our Q2 reported tax rate of 32.4% was above the 31% projection on our last call. While our Q2 tax rate was higher than the forecasted rate, our estimates for Q3 and Q4 remains about the same, 31% of pretax income rate. We estimate that our share count for calculating EPS in Q3 2012 will be approximately 41.7 million shares. That concludes our prepared remarks. And we will now open the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ben Andrew with William Blair.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Gary, maybe give us some insights into dVP trends here and how far you think that may go down. If you can give us some sense of what happened in the quarter. Where does this stabilize in your view based on the trends?  And it does something. It's a broader industry shift in terms of the way patients are being managed. And obviously it\u2019s becoming less important with the growth of the other pieces, but just wanted to understand and isolate that bit if we can.","Gary S. Guthart","Yes. The way we look at it is really being driven by 2 different effects. One of them has been the scrutiny and discussion around PSA testing and what that impact is. It's hard for us to exactly handicap what the impact on PSA test and discussion is. But clearly as one of the major treatment modalities for prostate cancer care, if there are changes to PSA testing in the number of people going into the pipeline, that will flow-through to us. And then the second part that you've described has been, if there is a look at nonsurgical treatment modalities and other alternatives like active surveillance, that also will have an impact. Hard for us to predict where that will play out over the long haul. We know for -- with high confidence that surgery is the best treatment for men with high risk prostate cancer, there's really no question. And now the question is going to be okay, while surgical societies and surgeons look at this over the long term: how do they vector patients in through their treatment pathways.","What we've seen in the past, just one more comment, is that over time as men are moved into active surveillance and those kind have come in waves, having to do with the amount of publicity it gets. Over time, people will start coming back out of active surveillance either because cancer is progressing or because over time, the active surveillance is in itself a burden. So hard to predict with a quantitative sense exactly where that will head. But clearly those 2 factors are having an impact on us in the U.S.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","But maybe try another way, Gary, I mean, was it down single-digit percentage, double digit? And what's baked in the guidance for the balance of the year?","Gary S. Guthart","On our side, it was a significant push. I don't -- we don't usually break out the numbers for you quarterly. And so we've gone through and done our best to project. It's an estimate. And if I had a perfect crystal ball, I'd share it with you, but we don't.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then you talked about some of the timing of research projects. Maybe give us some an insight as to what those are. And are we going to see a structural shift in R&D spending perhaps higher? And also on the operating expense side, can you talk a little bit about opportunities for investment in the sales force? Are you're looking to accelerate that to move things along quicker or maybe offset some of the prostatectomy weakness in other applications? Or are you happy with kind of where the trends are set there?","Gary S. Guthart","Fair question and a lot of questions. The first side on the R&D and the projects side, as you know, we have a few things that we have been working on pretty hard. Stapler, you should think of stapler not as a single product. Stapler will really ultimately be a family of products, kind of a platform. And that will come out in sequential releases. So there is a set of releases and products that make sense for colorectal surgery, a different set that makes sense for thoracic surgery and a different set that might make sense for bariatric surgery in the future. And so those things will move in sequence. Likewise, vessel sealing is a strong instrument for us. Right now it's pointed at general surgery applications and complex gynecologic cancers. But we can see that as being a platform technology as well. So there are investments here that are sequential. As you know, we also work on Single-Site expansion, other sets of instruments, and then other things longer term in terms of platform improvements. It's -- I guess what I'd say is the signal from Q2 to Q3 has more to do with lumpiness and timing than it does kind of a seismic shift in the kind of work we're doing. There is some gradual sequential growth in R&D spend. But mostly what you're seeing is lumpiness.","Turning to the question of sales force investments. We are making investments in the sales force. The way you might think about that is significant investments in Japan in terms of our capability. We're happy with our team there, and they're growing, and that will be to allow us to have a greater presence over time. We're also making investments in Europe. The investments there are around the sales and commercial team, mostly around bringing in experience in selling and support skills, as well as investments in our ability to respond to regulatory needs and reimbursement and economic analysis needs. So we're making those investments there. They're kind of investments that are ahead of what you would think of as the U.S. norms. In the U.S, we continue to invest in the U.S. sales force although about on pace to what you've seen in past quarters.  We don't feel like we're ahead or behind there, but really moving in sync.","Marshall L. Mohr","Specifically we added about 20 people to our clinical team in the quarter bringing us up to about 600 on the clinical side. We stayed roughly flat about 90 on the capital side.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","If I can sneak in one more quick one. It looks like you had a strong de novo placement effort in the quarter. Talk a little bit about how Si-e affected that. And I heard the number 200 customers. Are you starting to see a lot of productivity from that in terms of initial cases? And are people actually doing cases beyond chole already?","Gary S. Guthart","So I'll just start and Aleks can add, jump in. On the Single-Site versus Si-e, something a little bit different. But with regard to Single-Site, initial purchases, we did say over 200 hospitals in the U.S. have taken their initial kits. We're seeing good utilization so far although its early. The response, the commentary in terms of safety and efficacy and repeatability, the ability to learn the procedure quickly is strong, so we're feeling good about that. But we do caution that we're still in the early quarters there. With regard to people having an interest to doing things beyond cholecystectomy, we're FDA approved in the U.S. for chole. There is surgeon interest o U.S. and discussed interest inside the U.S. to do some other things. And so we're seeing interest in certain gynecologic procedures perhaps, some upper GI procedures over time, and that's where our R&D teams are spending their time. I'll turn it to Aleks.","Aleks Cukic","Yes, I would just reiterate under the comments pertaining to the 200 customers that have purchased initial sites. What we can tell thus far really from that is that there is a lot of general interest to try the system. We can't -- it's too early to make any large clinical claims, other than people are looking at reduced cosmetic -- improved cosmetics, I should say, and then whether or not there's pain differences between one technique versus the other. But at this stage, it's very difficult to say. But the interest is high to try it. The training queue is strong, and we'll look at it for a few more quarters I think before we can assess much more.","Gary S. Guthart","Yes, in terms of the Si-e impact on the quarter, 6 of the 150 systems sold were Si-e systems. And to remind you, Si-e's are 3-arm versions of Si and also have some other feature reductions. And they're primarily targeted towards the more price-sensitive customers who are engaged in the Single-Site or engaged in maybe a lesser complex hysterectomy. I think we are seeing more interest in this particular segment of our product offering.","Operator","And our next question will come from Lennox Ketner with Bank of America.","Lennox Ketner - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess if we can maybe just shift gears and focus on Europe for a minute. I guess I just wanted to understand in your view kind of what's driving the lower procedure growth. I know you talked about it being some structural issues. But in terms of the austerity measures impacting it -- I guess why I'm struggling a little bit is because it's -- obviously we've seen elective procedures impacted there. Because it's a cancer surgery, I would have thought we'd see less. Are you essentially seeing the government just lower their quotas for these surgeries even though they're cancer surgeries?","Gary S. Guthart","We definitely see -- depends on which country you're in. And I guess I'd start by saying different countries are behaving a little bit differently. So one answer won't cover them all. But taking a couple as an example, we have seen pressure on quotas. For sure you see total budgets getting pressured and people are making decisions about how they want to spend that money. We think some of it has to do a little bit with how we've grown our organization and their training and skill. If I just stand back from the point of view of bringing clinical and economic value to procedure that would have been open and taking it to noninvasive da Vinci procedure. We think there's value there. And we think we can do well in the presence of even tight budgets. And that's really the internal part that we're working on.","Lennox Ketner - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So I guess just as a follow-up. You had mentioned that you're investing in regulatory and reimbursement. If you -- is that -- are you focused on changing kind of reimbursement themes [ph] in Europe or was the reimbursement question or comment more directed towards Japan?","Gary S. Guthart","Well, the answer is a little bit of both. In Japan, it tends to be a more direct conversation with surgical societies in the government. In Europe it tends to be a little bit more working with surgical societies and health technology assessment groups to really understand the clinical benefits and the long-term, the downstream economic benefits of da Vinci Surgery. And it really is a way for hospitals and customers to understand what the total economics are.","Lennox Ketner - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just last question on the Single-Site, the attachment for that. Is it possible just to give us some sense as when a hospital does buy the Single-Site attachment, how much you're charging for that? And is that revenue recorded in -- as part of an upgrade revenue or is that in insurance and accessories?","Marshall L. Mohr","Well, just to let everyone know, the Single-Site is a set of instruments and accessory really instruments that attach to the da Vinci Si System. And so there's no system upgrade required to do Single-Site procedures. Usually initial customers, you need to have the 8.5-millimeter endoscopes, as well as the specific instruments for the case and so on. So it's an investment I think on average out of the gate it might be something like a $40,000 investment to kind of get going. It's recorded on the instrument and accessory line.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to go back to kind of the discussion on dVP from before, and understand obviously with the change in screening intervals, that's one aspect. But as we think about watchful waiting, do you have any color on what the conversion factor is in terms of patients going into watchful waiting and then coming back and heading into surgery? And obviously with PIVOT back in the news, is there anything you need to do differently in terms of data generation or marketing given that it's back in kind of the public press, if you will?","Gary S. Guthart","I'll speak to the first one. I'll let Aleks speak to the second one. With regard to what kind of behavior has been historically with regard to people on active surveillance in very, very rough outlines. It's been about 1\/3 -- start in active surveillance and stay in active surveillance throughout. About 1\/3 will convert to aggressive disease and in essence be kicked out by progression, and about 1\/3 will choose to leave because of the repeated going back in to being tested. At some point they decide to rather -- they'd rather have a definitive treatment. And that's been historical and it's rough. We'll see if it holds going forward.","Aleks Cukic","With regards to the second part of your question, the PIVOT trial being back in the news. I don't know that there was anything that was new that was reported today. I think this is something that we've discussed, I think, over the past year since it had been presented at the AUA. I think the editorial that accompanied the actual report in The New England Journal of Medicine really says, I think -- has a pretty consistent tone to I think the way we think about it as well.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just to clarify your comments in Europe. I'm just not understanding why the volumes are really declining here when you've got nationalized health care in a lot of these markets? Is it really that variable in these geographies?","Gary S. Guthart","Yes. Short answer is yes, it's variable. You have a few different things and, again, I think you have to think, well what's happening thing in Norway, what's happening in Spain, what's happening Germany, what's happening in France, what's happening in U.K., what's happening in the Scandinavian countries, and they vary. In many of the countries, you have a combination of private health systems and public ones. Their behaviors vis-a-vis da Vinci are quite different. And so depending on what the mix of private and public is and what the government-run hospitals are wanting to do, we'll see different kind of dynamics and behavior.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then last one, as we think about some of the gives and takes around procedures, I understand obviously you didn't change guidance on procedures this year. But do you see a path north of 30% in that kind of medium to intermediate term the next couple of years given everything you've got in terms of the new procedures or -- I don't want to box you into giving longer-term guidance, but how do you think about where procedures could go?","Gary S. Guthart","Our best thoughts are in the guidance we provide you.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I was talking beyond this year though.","Gary S. Guthart","And we'll talk to you about that in January.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Gary, these comments about dVP in the U.S., most of the comments so far have really focused on utilization or sort of patient-demand creation. I wonder have you seen anything in the U.S. that would suggest that maybe it's push and pull where it's a hospital specific issue, so I'm really referring to ACOs, demonstration projects with the hospitals just sort of targeting prostatectomy for its declining profitability or something like that, or this is a very acutely the patients just aren't proceeding to surgery and aren't showing up?","Gary S. Guthart","Without having talked to every hospital in the U.S., I have not heard the concern that you just voiced, that hospital is trying to direct patients one way or another due to their perceived profitability. Generally speaking, most hospitals will offer both or all 3 alternatives. They'll counsel all of them. And in that setting, where all the alternatives are discussed and a patient has been diagnosed, da Vinci does well, and we've seen a lot of stability there. So short answer is it tends to be more diagnosis and nonsurgical approaches than it is, I think, directed intervention.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then the clear positive this quarter sort of on the capital side in the U.S. is, you know, multiple capital peers have reported sort of softness in the second quarter. You don't appear to have exhibited any of that softness. Is it safe to assume that you feel, at least as far as the second quarter is concerned, relatively insulated from some of the factors that may have been out there or some of the push-outs that some of your peers had seen in the second quarter?","Gary S. Guthart","Well, again, I think that term insulated has got a few meanings. But I would say that if you look at and again, back away from just that number for a second and look at the overall procedure business. We've reported a 26% gain in procedures year-over-year, and for the first half of the year, it's up 27%. That's still a pretty large number. And so, that does necessitate the demand for systems. And so we do believe that. We do we believe that very strongly. I don't think there was a particular event or an episode in Q2 that separated us from our peer group or other capital companies anymore than just strong procedure demand. And now there are, as you said earlier, puts and takes on the procedures, while one has gone down, several have gone up, and some have gone up pretty significantly. And on balance, it's a very strong procedure business. And I think that's really what separates us from some of the other companies that are up there when you look at the actual numbers and the percentage of growth. So short of that, I don't think there's anything else we can really point to.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then just, Gary, maybe one quick one if I could. The comments about Europe, I wonder, have you seen anything in Europe over the last couple of quarters or several quarters that would suggest that perhaps the market development in Europe is going to be different than the U.S.? In one particular way, we would be, in the U.S. you never engaged in a directed significant study to prove a specific procedure, but you had a wealth of single center experience data and multicenter experience that was generated by users. Is there a sense sort of based on what you're seeing in Europe that a more directed or active approach to clinical data is going to be required in Europe or is that not the case?","Gary S. Guthart","I think a more active conversation is required, and that's a little bit of what we've been talking about with regard to health technology assessments and other things. We have -- now we've been in the market long enough in some procedures over a decade. That's because actually large population-based studies that are well done, multicenter, tens of thousands of patients in them, show clear benefits for da Vinci over other surgical alternatives. There's data being generated around comparisons to other kinds of treatment modalities between Da Vinci Surgery and nonsurgical outcomes. And I think that data is going to be helpful worldwide and in Europe. There may be cases and certainly we're in conversation and have thoughts and plans around specific trials that may help us in different locales, and Europe is one of them.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Larry Keusch with Raymond James.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just to pick up on Europe. Gary, I think I heard you correctly. It sounds like there's a change in the leadership there. And if I caught that accurately, if you could kind of just walk us through kind of what's changing and kind of what's the strategic direction?","Gary S. Guthart","Yes. We have changed leadership in terms of leadership of commercial organization in the direct side of Europe, and as well as overall leadership over the indirect as well. This is somebody who's been with us for many years in the U.S. and that run the national accounts side of the business here in the United States. He knows our business very well, has had prior experiences in Europe, and so he'll be taking over there.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","But I guess part of the question is, is that a result of the current environment or needing to change your strategic tactics within Europe coming back to needing more discussions around the marketing of the device and the procedures? Just trying to understand perhaps what there maybe the change in strategy in the European region?","Gary S. Guthart","Yes, I think it's probably less of -- capital less strategy change and more a focus on execution and organizational growth and capability. There are some things that we can do a little bit differently and perhaps a little bit better in terms of some of the conversations on the economic side. So sort of small strategy. I don't think it's Earth shatteringly different, but I do think it's an emphasis change, and they're working on those things.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then the -- obviously, it's terrific to hear that the Single-Site procedures are starting to gain some traction, and I fully understand that it's going to take a couple of quarters to fully feel that out. I guess the conversations that we've had with folks would suggest that where there is a da Vinci in place, the general surgeons are eager to jump in and get some time on the system to try out these procedures. And generally we've heard very good things once they get to do it. But I guess the question that I sort of wrestle with is, there are an awful lot of general surgical procedures, prostatectomies in particular, are probably done at institutions that today don't have a da Vinci system. So can you make a convincing ROI argument that this system can be used for general surgery sort of as a standalone device even with the Si-e option? Or at some point, does there have to be a segmentation strategy?","Marshall L. Mohr","Well, Larry, if you look at the overall number of da Vinci placements in the United States, we have a 1,707 total systems and I believe the number of U.S. customers -- Calvin, will give us that. I believe it's somewhere -- 1,200 to 1,300, I believe. But if you...","Calvin Darling","1,275.","Gary S. Guthart","1,275. The way -- what we have seen in prostatectomy for example is that the system has, to this point, become somewhat of a consolidator for the procedure rather than having to put procedures in all, and I should say, put systems in all 4,800 or 5,000 hospitals that are out there. You've seen a strong consolidation of, let's say, the urologic oncology business happen around the same base of systems that prior to the minimally invasive introduction was being done at significantly more hospitals. Fewer were being done at more hospitals. So I don't think we look at it and say, can we necessarily build this self-standing platform with general surgery as a paramount question today? Now what we do believe is that with the increased interest both from the colorectal surgeons, from other complex and general surgery procedures, as well as the individual cholecystectomy procedures that there is enough capacity out there for people to actually try, use it and then build into the flow of the robotics coordinators in the hospital to make sure that there is enough access whether it becomes second systems or third systems, et cetera. But the cholecystectomies by themselves is probably not the way we think about it. I think general surgery, as a whole, and then leveraging the installed base that we have.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Understood. And then just last one, not to continue to come back to U.S. prostatectomy. But I guess any flavor for where U.S. prostatectomy procedures, I assume, they were down sequentially. And would you characterize it as sort of a sharp falloff relative to where we've been over the last couple of quarters or sort of been a gradual decline and now we've hit a point where we're down year-over-year?","Gary S. Guthart","I think the way we think about it and really what the numbers will tell us that it's been a gradual decline over the past few quarters. We've called it out in the past, and now we're calling it out with a little more emphasis. And there appears to be more evidence in the sort of macroenvironment for prostate cancer that we can refer to with a little more clarity.","Operator","We'll go to Jose Haresco with JMP Securities.","Jose T. Haresco - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. On Single-Sites chole. You guys haven't broken this out in the past. Are you at a point where you can kind of give us a sense of how many procedures you think you've done in Single-Site chole, or just in general, who many Single-Site procedures have been done since these 200 devices have been placed -- I'm sorry, sets have been placed out there?","Gary S. Guthart","Yes, we're not ready yet to start breaking that out. Just because we're still on the early days of seeing new sites come up and really work through their initial orders. And what we would like to see is what happens on a sustained basis. How much of their future business they start to convert to Single-Site and so on, and that's just too early to tell. So we're happy to tell you -- to talk a little bit qualitatively about how the initial installs are going, but we'll wait a little bit on sequential use.","Jose T. Haresco - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Just on Europe trend [ph] a little more. Can you give us a little more granularity between say regions of Europe, Southern Europe versus Western Europe as an example, and then, procedures versus hardware? You guys raised the system guidance, revenue guidance for the year. I want to get a better sense for where that confidence is coming from beyond just the slight increase in ASP that we saw in the quarter?","Gary S. Guthart","On the kind of the break-outs country-by-country, it's a little bit mixed, probably not real surprising that some of the countries in the south that are always in the news have been most trained in terms of both system sales and procedures. Although I'd say that Italy has been a bright spot. We have seen some pressure in both capital and procedures in some of the core countries of Europe as well. And that's kind of where we are and what we are working through.","Gary S. Guthart","That was our last question. As we've said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. I hope the following experience from Rebecca in Maryland gives you some sense of what this means in the lives of our patients.","\"I went to Dr. Katherine Kratz upon discovering that I had a uterine fibroid and endometrial cysts, which had been causing painful menstrual cramps, as well as severe lower back pain. Dr. Kratz recommended da Vinci surgery for several reasons. The procedure is minimally invasive, so the recovery time would be much quicker. At the time I was trying to finish up my dissertation and apply for academic jobs, so it was important to me to have a quick recovery. My surgeon also explained that this procedure allows for greater visualization of the area, as well as providing for her a greater range of motion, allowing her to work with great precision in performing the surgery and in doing the stitches. Because of this, Dr. Kratz was able to save my left ovary, which would not have been possible otherwise. After my surgery, not only was I able to return to working on my dissertation within a few days but I was also able to attend my annual professional conference a few weeks later. Even with all that I have been told, I was shocked at how quickly I had recovered from surgery. Everyday I was able to move more easily and with far less pain, allowing me to stop taking pain medication after 1 day or 2. Now I'm free of back pain and have nearly no menstrual cramps. I'm extremely grateful for the da Vinci Surgery and the excellent care I received from Dr. Kratz and her entire surgical team, because the surgery has significantly improved my quality of life. When I look back at my time -- at that time of my life, I have only positive memories of my surgical experience. My surgeon provided me with comprehensive information about my options and about the surgery and allowed me to make the decision that was best for my situation.\"","Patients like these are the strongest advocates for Da Vinci Surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand. And I assure you that we remain committed to driving about [ph] a few things that really make a difference. This concludes today's call. We thank you for participating -- for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery, and we look forward to talking with you again in 3 months.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Calvin Darling, Senior Director of Intuitive Surgical. Please go ahead.","Calvin Darling","Thank you and good afternoon. Welcome to Intuitive Surgical's first quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and [Patrick Clingan] [ph], Director of Finance.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to inform you that comments mentioned on today\u2019s call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 3, 2014. These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's EDGAR database. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.","Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today\u2019s press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website.","Today\u2019s format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session.","Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our first quarter financial results. Patrick will discuss procedures and clinical highlights, then I\u2019ll provide our updated financial outlook for 2014. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.","With that, I will turn it over to Gary.","Gary Guthart","Thank you for joining us today. The first quarter was a difficult one in the United States. Certain elected da Vinci procedures in the U.S have been under significant pressure driven in part by changing surgical admissions, hospital financial uncertainty and payer incentives favoring watchful waiting and conservative treatment.","System sales in the quarter were down largely as a result of slowing growth in our U.S procedures. Despite near-term challenges, we remain confident in the value our products bring to surgery and are pleased with the U.S launch and first sales of our newer system for da Vinci Xi Surgical System earlier this month.","Turning to our procedure performance in the quarter, globally we experienced continued growth in general surgery and urology and a small declining gynecology. This resulted in 7% procedure growth in the first quarter over the first quarter of 2013. General surgery growth was led by increases in colorectal surgery and single-site cholecystectomy. Worldwide urology procedures experienced solid growth, particularly in prostatectomy, in Europe and Japan.","Gynecology procedures fell slightly year-over-year, driven by a contraction of procedures in the United States. As a result, procedure growth for the United States in the quarter was below our expectations.","Looking at procedures in the United States more deeply. General surgery led U.S procedure growth with strong uptake in colorectal surgery as well as encouraging early growth in several other general surgery procedures. Single-site cholecystectomy growth was solid in the quarter. The growth rate slowed relative to prior quarters in part due to exaggerated seasonality this quarter as well increasing economic pressures on hospitals.","As announced in our pre-release, U.S gynecology declined in the low single-digits year-over-year in the quarter, pressured by several factors including increased Q1 seasonality, payer disincentives for benign surgery and growing penetration in minimally invasive surgery for hysterectomy. Going forward, we expect U.S gynecology to pressure overall procedure growth rates through 2014. Patrick will provide additional procedure commentary later in the call.","Turning to markets outside of the United States, procedure growth in Asia was strong off of a small base with urology, general surgery, and gynecology segments contributing. We continue to expect lumpiness in capital sales in Asia due to limited reimbursement in Japan as well as anticipation of Xi approvals in the coming quarters.","In Europe, procedure growth was solid with urology, gynecology, and general surgery contributing to growth. We have filed for the CE Mark for our Xi system and system sales for the next quarter or two may be lumpy as customers evaluate the new system. Taken together, total system sales worldwide in the quarter were 87 down from 164 in Q1, 2013.","We launched our da Vinci Xi System in April at the SAGES Conference. The Xi System is optimized for multi-quadrant, multi-port procedures with smaller arms having greater reach and overhead architecture that allows multiple setup locations without repositioning the base of the system, a smaller wider endoscope with improved imaging capability and a host of other features that streamline setup and use. Early customer feedback has been enthusiastic and we look forward to its continued adoption in surgery.","The Xi System has not a direct replacement for our Si System and we continue to sell, support and develop instruments for the Si. We\u2019ve submitted 510(k) clearance applications for our advanced instruments for Xi, including the Xi Vessel Sealer and the Xi Stapler. We plan to submit our Firefly 510(k) for Xi this month.","da Vinci Xi currently does not have the available single-site instruments and the five millimeter instruments and it is not currently indicated for [trans level] [ph] procedures. As a result, we expect Xi adoption to proceed at a measured pace through 2014, as new instruments for Xi come to market and customers evaluate the differences between Si and Xi.","This week we received FDA 510(k) clearance for the da Vinci Sp Surgical System, which is designed to expand our single-port product offerings. The initial clearance is specific to urologic surgical procedures that are appropriate for a single-port approach. da Vinci Sp is built around a dedicated single-port patient side cart that delivers an articulating 3D HD camera and three fully articulating instruments through a single 25 millimeter cannula.","The EndoWrist Sp instruments have additional wrist joints inside the body compared to our current single-site instruments. This is a sophisticated technology that we believe has long-term potential in several areas of surgery. We do not intend to commercialize da Vinci Sp until the current technology is engineered to be fully compatible with our newly released da Vinci Xi, currently projected for the second half of 2015. This will require product refinements, supply chain optimization and additional regulatory clearances. Over the long-term we believe a single-port cart will complement not replace multi port and single-site technologies.","Turning to instruments, we\u2019ve expanded launches of both our da Vinci Stapler and da Vinci single-site for hysterectomy. da Vinci Stapler adoptions has been solid with strong reorder rates from early customers and increased utilization in colorectal surgery, our target market.","We're working on enhancements to da Vinci stapling by developing a [wide re-] [ph] load as well as pursuing indications in thoracic surgery. Our early launch of the single-site hysterectomy is expanding at a measured pace with solid procedure growth from the small base and robust customer interest. Development of our wristed single-site needle driver for Si is progressing and we plan to submit our 510(k) for the wristed needle driver later this month.","We\u2019ve been in regular contact with FDA while we work through -- while we work to resolve issues identified in prior audits and our Q4 warning letter. The FDA conducted a follow-up inspection of the Company in this first quarter in which they reviewed actions and process that address prior findings as well as exploring other areas. While we have made significant progress in addressing their concerns, they have noted additional areas for improvement that will be published on form 43, which we will post on our Web site later this week.","We continue to strengthen our operations capabilities and compliance programs by further developing our team, engaging seasoned leadership and improving our processes. Our U.S business is undergoing change, it is worth stepping back in considering the long-term value of da Vinci in surgery. In neurology we see significant opportunity globally for prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy procedures for which clinical and economic evidence supporting da Vinci use is well developed. Here we\u2019re focused on building our capability in Europe and Asia to support urologic growth.","In gynecology, the economic value of da Vinci in hysterectomy for a broad population of patients has been demonstrated in papers like the ones Patrick will describe shortly. We are supporting further clinical and economic evidence development for hysterectomy and other gynecologic procedures globally.","Also, we\u2019re in the early days of our single-site launch for hysterectomy. We believe additional instrumentation like our wristed single-site needle driver will make a significant difference for single-site surgeons. General surgery opportunity exists in several procedures globally, including colon and rectal resections, bariatric procedures, and other procedures within the abdomen.","In general surgery we are investing in products that optimize procedures, including stapler in vessel sealing, Firefly and our da Vinci Xi as well as supporting evidence development and research. Thoracic surgery also holds long-term potential for ISI, but we\u2019re developing products including Stapling and da Vinci Xi to address those thoracic procedures typically done through an open incision.","Lastly, we\u2019re still early in exploring the capabilities of single-port technologies like single-site and our single-port card. We will continue to pursue additional instrumentation and clearances for these new architectures as we work with surgeons to advance minimally invasive surgery.","As of to date we estimate that these opportunities represent millions of procedures annually for the countries in which we already operate. In future years we anticipate expanding our presence more deeply into Asia, India, and Latin America, further expanding the potential of da Vinci to positively impact surgery.","I\u2019ll now pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer.","Marshall Mohr","Thank you, Gary. Our first quarter 2014 revenue and procedures were consistent with our press release issued on April 8th. First quarter revenues were $465 million, down 24%, compared with $611 million for the first quarter 2013, down 19% from last quarter. Procedures for the first quarter grew approximately 7%, compared with the first quarter of 2013, and were down approximately 5% compared with last quarter.","First quarter 2014 revenue is net of approximately $26 million of deferred -- of revenue deferred in association with offers made to first quarter U.S customers, to trade-in their recently purchased da Vinci Si Surgical Systems for our recently announced da Vinci Xi Surgical System. The trade-in program also provides our customers the opportunity to exchange certain recently purchased da Vinci Si instruments and accessories for da Vinci Xi instruments and accessories.","The deferrals reduced first quarter 2014 system revenue by approximately $24 million in instrument and accessory revenue by approximately $2 million. The $26 million in deferral equates to $0.29 per share and is expected to be recognized within 2014.","Procedure highlights will be covered by Patrick. Revenue highlights are as follows. Instrument and accessory revenue was down 2%, compared with the first quarter of 2013 and was down 5% compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. The decrease relative to the prior periods reflects lower instrument and accessory stocking orders associated with fewer system sales, the 2 million deferral associated with the trade-in program, the impact of changes in procedures, offset by increased sales of newer products.","Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including initial stocking orders was approximately $1,920 per procedure compared with $2,110 for the first quarter of 2013 and $1,930 last quarter. The decrease from the prior year reflects fewer stocking orders associated with fewer system sales, partially offset by new product sales. The increase from the prior quarter primarily reflects new product sales and the timing of customer orders.","Systems revenue of $106 million decreased 59% compared with the first quarter of 2013 and decreased 48% compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. The decline in systems revenue reflects fewer system sales. In the U.S., we sold 45 systems in the first quarter compared with 115 systems in the first quarter of 2013 and 72 systems in the fourth quarter of 2013.","The decline in U.S. system sales reflects the impact of lower procedure growth, spending uncertainties associated with the Affordable Care Act, customer anticipation of a new system being released and relative to the fourth quarter seasonality. We sold 13 Si-es compared with 21 last quarter and five in the first quarter of 2013 at prices just below a $1 million depending on their configuration, reflecting continued demand for lower cost systems for use in lower reimbursed procedures.","Globally, our ASP of $1,476,000 increased relative to the fourth quarter system ASP of $1,455,000. The increase reflects a favorable geographic and product mix. In the first quarter, we sold 23 dual console systems compared with 38 systems in the fourth quarter. Outside the U.S., we sold 42 systems in the first quarter, including 14 in Europe and 19 in Japan, compared with 49 systems in to international markets in the first quarter of 2013, which included 16 in Europe and 25 in Japan and 66 systems into international markets in the fourth quarter of 2013 which included 28 into Europe and 21 into Japan. First quarter system sales also included three into each of France and Spain. Note, the first quarter is typically seasonally slower in most overseas markets except Japan.","Moving on to the remainder of the P&L, gross margin in the first 2014 was 67.9% compared with 71% for the first quarter of 2013 and 69.1% for the fourth quarter of 2013. Our lower margin percentage reflects a higher mix of new product sales and costs spread over lower production levels. Margins on newly launch products were typically be lower than our mature products reflecting vendor pricing on low volumes, temporary tooling costs and other start-up costs.","However, over time as volumes increase and we refine the manufacturing process and the product, we\u2019d expect to see improvement in the margins of these newer products, although they may not ultimately reach the level of our matured products. Our margins on the Xi system will be lower than the margins for our Si products.","As described in our pre-earnings release dated April 08, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $67 million equal to a $1.25 per share to reflect the estimated costs of settling a number of product liability legal claims against the Company. These claims relate to alleged complications from surgeries performed with certain versions of monopolar cautery scissor, or MCS instruments that included an MCS tip cover accessory that was the subject of a market withdrawal in 2012, and surgeries that were performed with MCS instruments that were subject of a recall in 2013.","The Company\u2019s estimate of the anticipated costs of settling these claims is based on negotiations with attorneys for patients who have participated in the mediation process that the Company established in conjunction with the polling agreement. To date approximately 3,000 claims have been reviewed as part of the mediation process. Many of these claims gave rise to MDRs reported in the FDA\u2019s MAUDE database.","First quarter 2014 operating expenses of $192 million excluding $67 million charge were in line with our planned spending and reflect investments in overseas markets and new products. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 26.8% compared with 26.1% for the first quarter of 2013 and 22.5% last quarter. The first quarter of 2013 tax rate benefited from the retroactive reinstatement of the federal R&D credit for 2012 as well as the federal R&D credit for 2013. The federal R&D credit has not been renewed for 2014 and therefore is not reflected in the first quarter tax rate.","Our net income was $44 million or $1.13 per share, compared with $189 million or $4.56 per share for the first quarter of 2013 and $166 million or $4.28 per share for the fourth quarter of 2013. An important measure of our performance is cash flow from operations. We define cash flow from operations as net income, excluding tax, non-cash \u2013 after-tax, non-cash compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We will refer to this as non-GAAP net income.","For the first quarter 2014, excluding the legal accrual of $67 million and the deferral of $26 million, we generated $135 million in non-GAAP net income or $3.46 per share, compared with $205 million or $4.99 per share for the fourth quarter 2013. We ended the year with cash and investments of $3 billion, up from $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily driven by $166 million in net cash provided by operating activities. Keep in mind that the $67 million charge to income has not affected cash flow to date. We\u2019ve not repurchased shares in the first quarter. As of March 31st, we still have 1 billion of share buybacks authorized.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Patrick to go over procedure and clinical highlights.","Patrick Clingan","Thanks, Marshall. Q1 year-over-year procedure growth was approximately 7%, with U.S. procedures growing 3% and international procedures growing 24%.On a macro basis, payer headwinds combined with higher patient payments have impacted the number of benign hysterectomies in the U.S and in turn the number of da Vinci hysterectomies performed, with both declining during the first quarter.","This minimally invasive surgery is currently a high proportion of benign hysterectomies and there is wide dispersion of the remaining open procedures among hospitals and surgeons. We expect da Vinci hysterectomy to continue to decline roughly in line with declines in the market through 2014. Other benign GYN procedures including sacrocolpopexies, endometriosis resections, and myomectomies also experienced year-over-year declines in the first quarter.","We are in our early launch phase of single-site kit for hysterectomies. The growth rate in the quarter was high off of a very small base. We plan to bring our single-site Wristed Needle Driver to the market in order to further enable benign hysterectomy procedure adoption, but it is too early to predict whether this will drive overall growth in dVH.","Before moving on, let me take a moment to discuss the recent FDA announcement discouraging the use of power morcellators and the surgical removal of assumed benign fibroids. Intuitive does not manufacture or sell power morcellation products. Power morcellators do not attach to da Vinci Systems and minimally invasive da Vinci surgeries are routinely performed without the use of power morcellators in both benign and malignant GYN surgeries.","Said another way, for many patients surgeons do not have to choose between minimally invasive surgery and morcellation. Other alternatives for tissue extraction exist. In the near-term this announcement may create uncertainty for surgeons and patients when choosing among minimally invasive surgical methods for removing fibroids. Moving forward, we look to surgical societies as they set guidance for removal of assumed benign fibroids.","For da Vinci cholecystectomy, moderating growth appears to be attributable to both seasonality and physicians increasingly offering single-site to those patients that are cosmetically sensitive and not morbidly obese.","Looking more deeply, adoption is taking place primarily among commercially insured patients seeking treatment from physicians at private hospitals with the ability to offer single-site benefits to patient, the hospital and the surgeon. If adoption remains limited to this segment, we\u2019d likely address a more narrow patient population than we previously expected.","We continue to believe that patients desire an improved cosmetic outcome compared to multi-port MIS. We have optimized the economics of our offering for our systems and instruments and we believe material operating costs are currently at a small premium to multi-port laparoscopic material operating expenses.","Beyond cholecystectomy, broader growth in U.S general surgery is encouraging as we continue to see adoption across many sub specialties. In particular, colon and rectal resections are a source of strength along with a variety of other surgeries for malignant and benign conditions. Well many of these procedures are too early to include in our addressable market opportunity, we are encouraged by the level of surgeon interest in these procedures as we continue to expand the breadth of our instrumentation for general surgeons.","Investments in the colorectal market including products and market development are showing results. International procedure growth of 24% remain strong. Growth was led by urology, with meaningful contributions from GYN and general surgery. DDP uptake in Europe and Japan continues to be robust sustaining the momentum we gained in the back half of 2013.","Highlighting the growing interest in da Vinci surgery education, 2013 European Association of Urology\u2019s Robotics section highlighted a da Vinci fellowship training program with 10 leading academic institutions across six countries. The Robotics section expanded the fellowship pilot in 2014 to 17 institutions as more country level societies support the program.","During the quarter, we continue to see growth in peer reviewed publications, highlighting da Vinci used in a number of journals. I\u2019ll take a moment to highlight just a few. Total cost to treat a population of patients is of high importance as providers are increasingly focused on published in health management. Two GYN studies published in this month edition of Obstetrics & Gynecology show an interesting juxtaposition of how two cost effectiveness studies can look at the same subject and develop contrasting conclusions, with one using a population health perspective, while the other evaluate the subset of the population.","The first study from Dr. Leitao and team at Memorial Sloan-Kettering took a population health perspective on the impact robotic surgery could have to the overall cost of malignant hysterectomies in the U.S. Looking at the adoption of robotic surgery within MSK for malignant hysterectomies from 2009 to 2010, the study showed laparoscopic procedures were less expensive than robotic procedures and then robotic procedures were less expensive than open surgery.","By extrapolating the MSK experience to a national experience, including the reduction in the rate of higher cost open surgery. The study concluded that the adoption of robotic surgery lowered the cost of malignant hysterectomies when evaluated for population health.","In contrast to these findings, Wright et al of Colombia wrote a follow-up to their 2013 publication. Using a similar methodology to the 2013 paper, this study also found that robotic surgery was more expensive than laparoscopic surgery, expanded to include both malignant and benign procedures. The study excluded the impact robotic surgery has brought to the broader population of patients who are historically treated through open surgery and the cost savings associated with the overall reduction in surgical morbidity.","The contrasting outcomes of these papers illustrates the impact that population selection has in drawing an economic conclusion. As providers look to manage population health more directly under the Affordable Care Act, Dr. Leitao study is more broadly applicable to a total population. We continue to work with customers to improve the understanding of the economic value da Vinci brings.","Next, the incidence rate and associated surgical procedures for early stage lung cancer are likely to increase, following the US PSTF recommendation to provide CT scanning to smokers at a high risk of developing cancer. Two recent studies have compared multi-center results of da Vinci lobectomies to over 10,000 lobectomies from the STS database gathered from 2010 to 2012.","The first study published in Innovations from Dr. Farivar and colleagues of Swedish Medical Center in Seattle compare open lobectomy to video assisted thoracic surgery or VATS and robotic lobectomies, and found that the use of robotic technology reduced the operative time, chest tube duration, post-operative blood transfusion and length of stay compared to both open and VAT lobectomies. More importantly, the use of robotic technology also showed a reduction in 30-day mortality compared to both open and VAT.","The second study from Dr. Adams and team of Owensboro Medical Health System in Kentucky, published in the Annals of thoracic surgery compared to the initial 20 completely portable robotic lobectomies or CPRL from six community surgeons to the STS database. While reflecting the initial robotic case series from each of these surgeons, the authors concluded \u201cCPRL was superior in several measures compared with open.\u201d as well as \u201coutcomes were equivalent between CPRL and VATs trending in favor of robotics.\u201d","I will conclude with two international publications on da Vinci use for rectal resections. Two papers focusing on robotic versus open or laparoscopic total mesorectal excision or TME. The first paper published in the European Journal of Surgical Oncology is from a group of Italian and Brazilian surgeons based at leading academic institutions. The study included 174 patients and results showed that at 5 years post-operation robotic TME has a lower rate of local cancer recurrence compared to open TME. The study also highlighted an increase in lymph nodes harvested reduced blood loss and lower length of stay at the cost of a longer OR time.","The second paper from China published in the Journal of Surgical Research by [ph] [Dr. Xiong] and colleagues from the Chongqing Medical University performed a meta-analysis on the robotic TME compared to laparoscopic TME. The study identified over 1,200 patients and showed that robotic TME was associated with a lower conversion rate from minimally invasive surgery to open surgery, a lower positive margin rate and a lower rate of erectile dysfunction compared to laparoscopic TME.","This concludes my remarks and I thank you for your time. I'll now turn the call over to Calvin.","Calvin Darling","Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2014. Starting with procedures, on our last call we estimated full-year 2014 procedure growth of 9% to 12% above the approximately 523,000 procedures performed in 2013. Now based upon factors described earlier on the call impacting U.S. for GYN, gynecology and other elective procedures, we\u2019re adjusting our 2014 procedure growth estimate to a range of between 2% and 8%. This is a wider range than we have previously communicated giving consideration to increased volatility in elective procedures and the recent FDA statement discouraging the use of power morcellation techniques and the potential impact this may have on our procedure business.","Moving to revenues, as it has been discussed earlier several factors are pressuring our business making it difficult in the near term for us to predict system sales volumes and as a consequence total revenue, specifically the breath and evolving nature of our procedure growth. As a reminder procedures are a primary driver of capital sales and the relationship between procedure growth rates and capital sales is highly sensitive. Our recent introduction of the da Vinci Xi System an upcoming period of transition in advance of it's release in international markets and ahead of the availability of Xi versions of certain advanced instruments, continued economic pressure and uncertainty at hospitals associated with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, evolving utilization patterns and point of care dynamics and likely variability in the timing of Japan system sales given the timeline for obtaining additional procedure reimbursement and beyond dVP anticipated no sooner than 2016. Due to these factors affecting the capital side of our business, we will not be providing a revenue forecast at this time. As mentioned on last quarters call, we expect to sell fewer systems in 2014 than the 546 systems sold in 2013.","Our Q1, 2014 gross profit percentage was roughly 68%. As we moved forward in 2014 we expect our gross profit percentage will shift directionally lower given that our newly launched da Vinci Xi System has lower gross profit margins at launch than the mature Si-e platform. While we will look to cost reduce the products and improve margins over time the da Vinci Xi will negatively impact gross margins in 2014. We also anticipate a growing proportion of sales of newer lower margin instrument products throughout the year including Stapler and Vessel Sealer. Our actual gross profit margin will vary depending largely on product mix and systems production volume. We believe deeply in our ability to fundamentally improve surgery and are continuing to pursue plans to increase the use of da Vinci enabled MIS around the globe. As stated previously, 2014 will be a year of increased investment for Intuitive Surgical. Even during this period of capital sales uncertainty we will be building our international capabilities investing in new product developments and pursuing growth in multiple areas of our procedure business.","Now excluding the impact of this quarters $67 million charge for estimated legal settlements, we continue to expect to grow our operating expenses roughly 12% to 15% above 2013 levels. We expect our 2014 non-cash stock compensation expense to be towards the lower end of the $180 million to $190 million range communicated on last quarters call compared to $169 million in 2013. We continue to expect other income which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $15 million and $20 million in 2014 also towards the lower end of the range. With regard to income tax, we continue to expect our 2014 income tax rate to be between 25% and 28% of pre-tax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. This forecast does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2014. Our share count for calculating diluted EPS in Q1, 2014 was approximately 39.1 million shares. Our actual Q2 and fiscal year 2014 share count will depend on several factors including the magnitude and timing of any additional share buybacks.","That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we have our first question from Ben Andrew from William Blair. Please ask your question.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company","Good afternoon guys.","Gary Guthart","Hi, Ben.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company","Gary, talk to us a little bit more about the 12% to 15% increase in OpEx with the revenue projection you just gave. Obviously you run the business on a multi-year basis and we all believe or at least we believe there\u2019s a long-term opportunity. But what are you seeing in \u201915 and the needs of the company today that, that\u2019s going to justify that level of spending with this revenue forecast?","Gary Guthart","I think as we have said in the past the places we\u2019re investing I think really all points to our future growth and they are international markets both in Europe, Japan, other places in Asia over time as well as bringing to market products that we think helps surgeons and therefore expand our opportunity both deepening it in markets that were already existing and a good potential to open new markets. I think that scaling back quickly as a result of near term pressure is not a long-term best interest of the Company.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company","Okay, no that\u2019s fair. So, should we think about a more kind of, if you will, permanent lower domestic growth rate given some of the pressures or maybe a multi-year lower domestic growth rate because it does sound like the continued effort to shift towards international is where the bulk of the growth would be coming from?","Gary Guthart","I think it's from my point of view too soon to make that comment. I look out and say it's clear that there are some changing dynamics within the U.S. marketplace particularly around some of the procedures that are elective. Some of those things are broader than in Intuitive when you look at the changes to surgical admissions that are changing and some of the payer behaviors around incentives or just incentives around surgery, we\u2019ll have to see how those things wash out in time. Some of them have to do with internal focus of the company as we look at opportunities and have adjusted ourselves towards focus that will pay off in time but those things take a little time to wash through. And so, I think that\u2019s a good question to ask again and then again in future quarters and I would not call it right now.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company","Okay, last question for me. Talking about if you will instrument pocket share in the evolving area of general surgery, if we go out to all or maybe even 24 months, what percentage of the instruments that are not da Vinci today in a particular case for you all in the training center, do you think we\u2019ll still not be da Vinci at that point, can we get to a 100% pocket share or is it going to be 50% for some -- whatever the number is for some protracted period of time? Thank you.","Gary Guthart","Yes, so as you think about what kinds of things makes sense for a customer on the da Vinci platform where we can really bring value, probably not a 100% but certainly higher than we are today and I don\u2019t think we have called out here\u2019s the endpoint, but a good example Vessel Sealer has been really well received by our customer, the adoption has gone deeper in different places than we had anticipated when we started and as we look at stapling in it's early adoption into Colorectal that\u2019s been pretty positive for us, customer feedback comment has been strong. And as we expand the stapling offering to bring them articulation and stability and some of the things that we can bring, I think that\u2019s an opportunity for the company as we go forward. So, I don\u2019t think we can peg an exact number for you, but I think it will move up certainly in the kind of the multi port -- multi-quadrant procedures that we think we can make a big difference in in the near term. Go ahead Calvin.","Calvin Darling","Yes, and just a few thoughts on just the overall metric of instrument accessory revenue per procedure. As it was mentioned, we saw the positive contribution of the Stapler and the Vessel Sealer here in the first quarter which really effectively offset the negative impact primarily from lower stocking orders with the lower system sales in the quarter. So the overall metric was fairly in line the first quarter of this year with fourth quarter of last year. And so, as you kind of look forward, this higher proportion -- you\u2019re going to have a higher proportion of Single-Site and less complex benign procedures in the overall mix and you have the positive impacts of Vessel Sealer and Firefly. So as you look out into 2014 you\u2019ve got factors moving in either direction and it's really difficult to gauge the net direction of the metric moving forward in this year.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please ask your question.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Thanks. I just want to understand the guidance revision on procedures specifically around the issue of morcellation which as you called out does not, you do not sell power morcellation products, but in the revised guidance you did call that out as a factor. So, can you maybe just talk about how you see that impacting the market and do you need to kind of step up marketing efforts around that to clarify the situation?","Gary Guthart","In the near term I think that the surgical societies are going to look and evaluate and they are what the implications are for minimally invasive surgery as a whole. As we mentioned we -- power morcellation is not a part of many, many of the gynecologic procedures we do. I think there will be some reassessment by the surgical societies and by surgeons themselves as they kind of look at tissue extraction techniques and where they want to take guidance from there. So, for us it's pretty hard to forecast. I think at this point we\u2019re just going to have to wait and see. da Vinci offers dexterity and the opportunity for alternative techniques to tissue extraction and so over time we\u2019ll see where surgeons want to go with that. And Patrick, I don\u2019t know if you want to add.","Patrick Clingan","I think Tycho that the issue here really is about the unknown oncologic status of these fibroids. If you step back and you think da Vinci is commonly used in procedures where cancer has been diagnosed. So while it's hard for us to get precise on it, we think -- until some of the treatment approaches are more settled there might be some uncertainty in the market place here over the short run.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Okay. And then since this is the first call post the launch of the Xi, can you maybe just talk about some of the early momentum understanding it's not necessarily an upgrade to the Si, but have you seen any interest in existing Si customers upgrading and then can you help us kind of quantify the opportunity around multi-quadrant procedures and maybe areas like microsurgery, which seem like they could be applicable as well?","Gary Guthart","Marshall, I'll let you describe a little bit of the early pipeline as qualitatively as you see it.","Marshall Mohr","Sure. So, I am not going to talk about inter-quarter activity, but intra-quarter activity but on the other hand there was a -- as you know there was a hospital in Texas that put out a press release on their first procedure and the excitement around it and the interaction that we have had with customers is positive. I\u2019m not going to predict how it's going to roll out. As Gary said in his part, there are certain instruments that da Vinci surgeons that are not yet available for it, so it will probably be a roll out over time versus [inaudible] upfront. ","Gary Guthart","When we think about multi-quadrant procedures and work that people are excited about, a lot of the features that have gone into the Xi are ones that surgeons have been interested in and asked us about and we\u2019ve been in development with them for some time. So the idea of being able to in essence change setups without having to move the base around the longer instruments help in larger patient populations in general surgery, the narrow instruments get you into tighter spaces, and so as we look at general surgery, general surgery is indeed that, a lot of different procedures and so we\u2019re excited about the flexibility that the setup of the platform brings as well as things like forward hopping the idea that the camera can move between different cannula to be able to get different views of the anatomy. So, I think that\u2019s been strong for us. Micro-surgery is not something we\u2019ve talked about. I am not quite sure where that came from. It's not an indication on the Xi and so, perhaps another time we could talk about that in more detail.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Last one, just quickly on the new Sp system announced today, I have had a few people asking about the 25 millimeter port size. Does that get you around the wrist of hernia and maybe just talk to the discussions with FDA, you\u2019ve obviously gone after some of your competitors around port-site hernia.","Gary Guthart","The 25 is about the same size as the port that\u2019s going on, that used a little bit different type of construction that\u2019s being used in Single-Site. I am not personally an expert in the herniation issues although understanding and listening to surgeons, I understand that how you make the cut down, how you make the incision and how you close it, closer technique has a large impact in what those things look like. Conversations with regard to FDA have really centered around the technical performance aspects of the device and its application to urology in terms of Sp itself, so really no additional color to provide you on that front.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please ask your question.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Thanks very much. Can you hear me okay?","Gary Guthart","Yes.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. So I just wanted to clarify some things on the procedure volume guidance. I just want to make sure I heard you right to start out, so your guidance is for 2014 now for procedure volume growth is 2% to 8% that\u2019s a global number, correct?","Gary Guthart","That\u2019s correct.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","So you started the year at 7%, and so obviously what you\u2019re contemplating here is things potentially getting worse from here. And so I\u2019d really like to just understand to the degree you\u2019re willing to talk about it. What are you contemplating getting worse from here, is this GYN getting a little bit worse or it's just GYN and chole getting a little bit worse. And then just broadly speaking, what turns this around in your view?","Gary Guthart","Yes, I think it's -- when you look at and the things we\u2019re calling out are the increasing pressure that we\u2019re seeing in the U.S. gynecology procedures, factors that we discussed on the call including the payer disincentives for benign surgery effects are of the Affordable Care Act and impacts on procedure potentially involving the power morcellation which is a rather recent event. We\u2019ve seen more volatility in these elective procedures and economic sensitivity as well. So, that\u2019s on the gynecology side, and then specific to Cholecystectomy as Patrick talked about what appears to be a tightening really of the types of patients that maybe that target robotic candidates. And so these are early days on both these categories, but I think the range of the guidance is broader and lower in recognition of these factors.","Patrick Clingan","Yes, just to add a little light. I think the big issue here is that you see some shifting winds in the U.S. benign surgery market place broader than intuitive and some that are specific to us. So, I think that uncertainty is pretty high especially around total hysterectomies -- in total the whole set not just us over time. And I think as hospitals start adjusting to some of the implications of Affordable Care Act and some of the swings an seasonality that we\u2019re seeing the exaggerated swings. We\u2019ll have to see how that plays out in the year and that\u2019s what accounts for this broad range.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","And so, I really had a follow-up to that, and Gary this is a question for you. It's a question on buyback but it's really a question about trying to understand your intended message regarding confidence in your long-term opportunities versus the near term uncertainties. So as you noted there\u2019s no buyback this quarter and obviously there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty, but you\u2019re sitting on $3 billion in cash, you have a $1 billion buyback authorized. And my question is; why wouldn\u2019t now be a time for you guys to be more aggressive about the buyback if you\u2019re encouraged about the long-term, and so again, I am really just trying to gauge here long-term opportunities versus near term uncertainty.","Gary Guthart","Right. I think that directionally we feel like buybacks are a good idea when we feel like there is a good opportunity for the company to be in the market and that\u2019s something we speak about routinely with the board here and so we\u2019ll see. I think with the fair amount of volatility that\u2019s been evidenced in the U.S. market and it's likely to persist for some time given all the moving parts in the U.S. market when opportunities arise then I think the board will sit down and evaluate.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","And then just lastly really quickly on the Sp system, could you just talk a little bit more about that. What does that look like long-term, really who is the customer for Sp, is that potentially a less expensive system that could be targeted to outpatient. I just want to understand who the real customer is for Sp as you see it, thinking long-term when you have multiple approvals and just trying to understand where this is going?","Gary Guthart","Right. So, the first thing is that, we have not announced pricing. Likely the operating cost for the Sp system will slide in above Single-Site and add a slight premium to a da Vinci set. It's not finalized, so it is not an operating cost lower cost than Single-Site which is actually quite good already. Single-Site instrumentation from a material cost point of view are within about $100 of multi-port laparoscopic cost. So the material cost comparisons are quite good on Single-Site. Already this has additional capability and we\u2019ll come into from an operating point of view at a small premium to that price point. In terms of why we think it's interesting, the first indication to be entirely clear is urology. We think there is some interesting things that can be done particularly in things like kidney cancer where you have the removal of the specimen. I think these are the type of procedures where co-articulation and forearms make sense in a single-port context. As we think about other places in the future that might have interesting indications, we think about places where you\u2019re going to be in confined spaces, head and neck is one of them, transanal procedures are another place that people have real interest in. And one of the reasons that we're talking about this a little bit early relative to launch is to give us room to discuss it with surgeons to develop it in terms of clinically clinical laboratory work over time, so we get a real chance to interact with customers about where this kind of architecture can take us. I think early interest is quite high in terms of enthusiasm. I think there is real work to be done in terms of refining some of the elements that are present in terms of both of the supply chain and the indications and we look forward to doing that over time. Long-term I think there are some unique capabilities here technologically that may lead us to some interesting questions.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Thank you and good evening. I wanted to ask one strategic question and then one just specific question about the numbers and maybe starting with the strategic side. Gary, I listened to your commentary in that prepared remarks where you brought up international, I think you didn\u2019t specially call emerging markets where you brought up Asia, India, Latin America. It sounds like there\u2019s sort of a shift a little bit in the strategy here as the U.S. markets mature and that thus the focus of the company is moving to being more of a global medical device company with a little bit more of a broader focus and lesser sort of a pure play technology company and if sort of you look at the market valuation showed us different types of businesses. I am just wondering how you sort of think about the evolution of the business as you start to look, it sounds like more sort of singles and doubles versus homerun opportunities coming from expansion of therapy versus kind of new product launches.","Gary Guthart","Yes, I understand the question. I don\u2019t think certainly in the next few years I don\u2019t see that it's either or I think that we\u2019ve made real investments and we\u2019ll continue to invest in those technologies we think can make a real difference in surgery and I expect that to continue. And the indications around thinking globally are not strongly this year or next year, I know you\u2019re following, you know we\u2019ve been investing in Europe and Japan. Longer term as you look multiple years out, I think there are real opportunities in other parts of Asia in Latin America and I think it will be important for the company to be there. It's not intended to signal a hard right-turn away from innovation. Innovation is in our DNA, you see it routinely in the products that we develop and bring to market and I expect that to continue.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","And then maybe just a second question on, maybe this does relate a little bit to the slowing in choles, but one of the things that you\u2019ve been talking about and this came up more in the fourth quarter call was on the R&D spending to collect more clinical data to support the adoption of therapies where you have stronger competition, I am presuming that\u2019s sort of Ethicon and Covidien, but maybe you could sort of talk about the type of data you\u2019re going to be collecting on choles in some of those procedures where you need to be more competitive and then ultimately when that could drive a resumption in growth in those categories -- a reacceleration of growth?","Gary Guthart","As you look out I think the types of data are pretty clear and we\u2019ve seen them collected. I think first you collect simple outcome data and that evolves in time from single institution studies, so multi institution studies and so on. And then with that I think economics that follow. So really it's a combination of how are your products used, followed by what kind of outcomes are being attained followed by what are the economic consequences of those outcomes and that\u2019s really what we invest in. And where you have all three you see strong benefit, where the out products are less differentiated, where the outcomes are differentiated and the economics follow, that has been a strong predictor of growth and so, that\u2019s a routine part of what we do both in the U.S. and OUS each health system calculates some of these things a little bit differently, disease states vary a little bit country-to-country and so it's not just the U.S. centric activity.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Okay, and maybe just a quick last one, I know Bob asked the question about buybacks and I understand the comments around volatility in the market, but maybe you just broadly help us think about the capital allocation if there are other priorities you might look at given some of the gyrations in the top line here and you haven't spoken about M&A sort of that in the past as a potential maybe how you\u2019re thinking about broader use of cash in the context of everything that\u2019s going on here?","Gary Guthart","The basic elements as you\u2019ve seen has been organic growth -- funding organic growth and development where we need to. We have invested OUS and sometimes those investments are organic and sometimes there are acquisitions of things that are important. I expect that to continue. We routinely look for technologies that will enhance our product lines and acquire them on an ongoing basis. Typically those have not been huge acquisitions, but in the future if there\u2019s an opportunity and a need then those can grow. And so those are really the basic elements in the mix. They change a little bit in terms of how they\u2019re mixed together over time, but the three elements are all there.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thank you very much.","Gary Guthart","Next caller please. Operator? All right, we appear to have lost our operator. If you\u2019re still on, I\u2019ll go ahead and close. While we discuss financial metrics on these call our organization remains focused on developing, delivering products that allow surgeons to deliver minimally invasive surgery to revive basic patients. I hope the following quote from Dr. Leitao and team from Memorial Sloan-Kettering in their recent paper on da Vinci news in hysterectomy gives you some sense of the value Intuitive brings to the surgical community.","\u201cThe key conclusion from our data in conjunction with other published data is that the cost of robotics much take into account, how it affects the rate of laparotomy and not just compare successfully completed robotic to laparoscopic cases, because these are both minimally invasive approaches using different instrumentation. Also it's important to take into account post discharge cost outcomes. Our data further validate and support the data from (indiscernible) and colleagues, enhancement of laparoscopic programs with the introduction of the robotic platform and a concomitant decrease in laparotomy rates reached a cost neutralization of the robotic platform and potentially of cost savings overall. The offers continue despite nearly 40 years of availability. Laparoscopic hysterectomy still comprises only a small percentage of all hysterectomies in the United States and the world. There are gynecologic surgeons who provide safe and efficient laparoscopic surgery, it is important to continue to support their efforts. Unfortunately they only represent a minority of all gynecologic surgeons. The robotic platform is a device that overcomes some of the limitations of standard laparoscopic instrumentation and has increased minimally invasive approaches.\u201d","In closing we\u2019re steadfast in our conviction in the value da Vinci has and can bring to medicine, and we thank you for your support in helping Intuitive expand the benefits of minimally invasive surgery.","That concludes today's call. And I look forward to speaking with you again in three months."],"12569":["Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

Welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Quarter Two 2015 Earnings Release Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Calvin Darling, Senior Director of Finance for Intuitive Surgical. Please go ahead.","Calvin Darling","Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's second quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; and Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer.","Note that Patrick Clingan, who has participated on these calls in recent quarters, will not be with us on the call today due to minor illness. We expect him back in the office next week.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties.","These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 5th, 2015, and 10-Q, filed on April 22nd, 2015. These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's EDGAR database.","Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com, on the audio archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website.","Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our second-quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights; Marshall will provide a review of our second-quarter financial results; then I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2015. And finally we will host a question-and-answer session.","With that, I will turn it over to Gary.","Gary Guthart","Thank you for joining us on the call today. In the quarter, growth in procedures was healthy, maintaining the rate of growth we experienced in the first quarter and showing solid performance in several specialties and geographies. Our capital performance improved in the quarter, as did our margins.","Starting with procedures, year-over-year growth in the second quarter was just under 14% compared with Q2 of 2014. Utilization trends present last quarter continued, with strength in hernia repair, solid growth in colon and rectal resections, continued recovery in prostatectomy, and stable trends in hysterectomy.","Growth in the use of our products was broad-based and included the U.S., Europe, and key markets in Asia. Procedures grew strongly in China, and growth was solid in Japan and Korea. Calvin will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call.","Turning to capital sales, we placed 118 systems in the quarter compared to 96 in the second quarter of 2014. The United States and Japan accounted for most of the growth in system placements year-over-year. We see interest across our product line, from our multi-quadrant Xi system to our Si system, with customers choosing the system that best fits their program's needs.","In Japan, clearance of the Xi system unlocked some system demand and we sold 13 systems in the quarter compared with five a year earlier. Procedure growth in Japan remains healthy, given the current state of reimbursement.","As we've said on prior calls, the growth of the market in Japan will be paced by continued progress on reimbursement. Clinical investigators have submitted their partial nephrectomy data to MHLW for review, and ISI continues to work with key stakeholders in the reimbursement for additional procedures. We have no assurance of additional procedure reimbursement at this time.","Turning to margins, our operating teams are focused on reducing product costs for our new products and we're managing our fixed expenses carefully. This quarter was a step in the right direction on gross margin, though an early one. We will continue to focus on improvements over the next several quarters. Marshall will take you through this and other financial performance in greater detail later in the call.","In summary, our operating performance for the second quarter is as follows. Procedures grew just under 14% over the second quarter of last year. We placed 118 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 96 in the second quarter of 2014.","Total pro forma revenue for the quarter was $586 million, up 16% from the prior year, and up 20% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Total pro forma instrument and accessory revenue increased to $297 million, up 13% over prior year.","We generated pro forma operating profit of $228 million in the quarter compared with $196 million in the second quarter of 2014. And pro forma net income was $173 million compared to $140 million in Q2 of 2014.","In product development, we are rounding out our Xi system offering by launching additional EndoWrist instruments, integrating table motion with Xi, and developing Single-Site for Xi.","In Europe in the second quarter, surgeons have performed the first clinical cases using integrated table motion with Xi with enthusiastic feedback. We recently submitted our 510(k) for software that enables table motion with Xi. We anticipate filing our 510(k) for Xi Single-Site in the second half of the year.","We have also broadened the roll-out of our white reload for our da Vinci Xi Stapler. Feedback on its utility has been positive. Additional Xi EndoWrist instruments have been released in the quarter, continuing to round out our instrument offering for Xi.","For da Vinci Sp, our dedicated single point of entry architecture, development is progressing with system integration and laboratory testing in progress.","Stepping back and looking at the business at the midway point of the year, we're focused on expanding the application of da Vinci in general surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair; filling out our product line for da Vinci Xi and launching in key markets globally; developing our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia; improving our gross margins; and advancing our technologies to improve surgery.","I will now turn the call over to Marshall, who will review our financial performance.","Marshall Mohr","Thank you, Gary. I will be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes the impact of our prior year Xi trade-in programs, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased IP, and investment impairments. We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis.","I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We've posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion.","Pro forma second quarter revenue was $586 million, an increase of 16% compared with $507 million for the second quarter of 2014, and an increase of 10% compared with last quarter.","Pro forma revenue for the second quarter of 2014 excludes net revenue associated with offers made in 2014 to trade out Si product for Xi product. All trade out offers were either fulfilled or lapsed in 2014.","Second quarter procedures of approximately 162,000 grew nearly 14% compared with the second quarter of 2014 and approximately 8% compared with the first quarter of 2015.","Revenue highlights are as follows. Pro forma, instrument, and accessory revenue grew 13% compared with the second quarter of 2014 and increased 7% compared with the first quarter 2015.","The increase relative to the prior year reflects procedure growth and customer buying patterns, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. The increase relative to the prior quarter primarily reflects procedure growth.","Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including initial stocking orders was approximately $1,830 per procedure, approximately the same as the second quarter of 2014 and similar to the approximately $1,840 last quarter.","Pro forma system revenue of $176 million increased 27% compared with the second quarter of 2014 and increased 25% compared with the first quarter of 2015. The increase relative to the prior year reflects increased unit sales, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. The increase compared with the first quarter primarily reflects increased unit sales.","118 systems were placed in the second quarter compared with 96 systems in the second quarter of 2014, and 99 systems last quarter. 64% of the systems placed in the second quarter were Xis compared with 52% in the second quarter of 2014, and 76% in the first quarter of 2015.","We sold more Sis in the quarter than the previous quarter, reflecting seven Si system sales under a contract with the Department of Defense, and eight Si system sales in Japan. We expect the mix of Xi to Si product to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.","Service revenue of $113 million increased 6% year-over-year and decreased $1 million compared with the first quarter of 2015. The year-over-year increase reflects the increase in our installed base. The decrease compared with the first quarter reflects the timing of service contract renewals and changes in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in our installed base.","Globally, our system ASP of $1,500,000 was approximately the same as the second quarter of last year, and increased relative to the first quarter ASP of $1,480,000. Relative to the second quarter of 2014, higher ASPs were primarily associated with higher mix of Xis, offset by the impact of the strengthened dollar.","The increase in ASPs relative to last quarter reflects geographic mix and lower trade-in activity. ASPs will fluctuate on a geographic and product mix, trade-in volume, and changes in foreign exchange rates.","Hospitals financed approximately 21% of the systems placed in the second quarter, up from 14% last quarter. We directly financed 12 systems, of which five were structured as operating leases. Several customers bought out previously leased systems in the quarter.","Although revenue associated with the buyouts are included in total revenue, we've excluded this revenue from the computation of system ASPs. We have also excluded these buyouts from the system placement number.","In the U.S., we placed 72 systems in the second quarter, compared with 61 systems in the second quarter of 2014 and 63 systems in the first quarter of 2015. As previously noted, second quarter system placements in the U.S. included seven systems sold under our Department of Defense contract.","In general, the increase in system placements relative to the prior year reflect growth in procedures and market acceptance of the Xi system. Outside of the U.S., results were as follows; second quarter pro forma revenue outside the U.S. of $168 million grew 25% compared with $135 million for the second quarter of 2014, and grew 12% compared with $150 million last quarter.","The increase compared with the previous year reflects higher Japan system revenue, higher instrument and accessory revenue reflecting procedure growth, partially offset by foreign exchange. The increase compared with last quarter reflects higher Japan systems placements, geographic mix of system placements, and procedure growth.","Outside the U.S., we placed 46 systems in the second quarter compared with 35 in the second quarter of 2014 and 36 systems last quarter. o-US system placements reflect 13 systems into Japan this quarter compared with five systems in the second quarter of 2014, and one last quarter. We obtained Xi approval in Japan in late March, and five of the systems sold this quarter were Xi systems.","European system placements grew to 22 systems this quarter compared with 19 last year and 18 last quarter. We placed no systems into China this quarter compared with one in the second quarter of 2014 and eight last quarter.","As we have indicated in the past, and consistent with our history, system placements in our o-US markets will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.","Moving on to the remainder of the P&L, pro forma gross margin in the second quarter of 2015 was 68% compared with 69.2% for the second quarter of 2014 and 65.6% for the first quarter of 2015.","The decline in gross margins relative to the second quarter of 2014 is primarily attributable to foreign exchange and a higher mix of newer products, including Xi and stapling.","The sequential improvement in gross margin is primarily attributable to the completion of activities that resulted in one-time charges in the first quarter and cost of sales efficiency gains.","In 2014, we recorded pretax charges of approximately $82 million, representing the estimated cost of settling a number of product liability legal claims under a tolling agreement.","During 2015, we have refined our estimate of the overall cost of settling claims and recorded additional charges of approximately $7 million in each of the first and second quarters.","These charges are excluded from our pro forma results and are included in our GAAP results. We will continue to refine our estimates as we proceed through the negotiation process.","Pro forma operating expenses, which exclude the reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expense, and amortization of purchased IP, increased 10% compared with the second quarter of 2014 and increased 4% compared with last quarter. The year-over-year increase of pro forma operating expenses primarily reflects headcount additions and higher incentive compensation.","Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 25.6% compared with an effective tax rate of 29.8% for the second quarter of 2014 and 28.9% last quarter. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2015 benefited from approximately $8 million, or the equivalent of $0.21 per share of discrete items, including the release of reserves specific to tax years where we recently completed audits.","Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S. and o-US income, and will not reflect a federal research and development credit, unless such credit is reinstated.","Our pro forma net income was $173 million or $4.57 per share compared with $140 million or $3.73 per share for the second quarter of 2014 and $135 million or $3.57 per share for the first quarter of 2015.","As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $586 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared with $512 million for the second quarter of 2014 and $532 million for the first quarter of 2015.","GAAP net income was $135 million or $3.56 per share for the second quarter of 2015, compared with $104 million or $2.77 per share for the second quarter of 2014 and $97 million or $2.57 per share for the first quarter of 2015. ","We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $2.9 billion, up from $2.7 billion as of March 31, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated by operations and proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by stock buyback.","During the quarter we repurchased approximately 100,000 shares for $49 million at an average purchase price of $494 per share.","And with that I would like to turn it over to Calvin who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights and provide 2015 financial guidance.","Calvin Darling","Thanks Marshall. Let me begin with the review of our procedure results. As mentioned earlier, total second quarter year-over-year procedures grew just below 14% with U.S. procedures growing approximately 10% and international procedures growing approximately 27%.","In the U.S. trends observed during the first quarter largely continued through the second quarter. In urology growth in da Vinci Prostatectomy and kidney cancer procedures continued at a similar rate as the first quarter. We continue to believe that our Prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader U.S. prostate surgery market. ","In U.S. gynecology, procedures were flat year-over-year with growth in malignant and complex hysterectomy, offset by declines in benign procedures. In recent quarters an increasing proportion of total hysterectomy procedures have been performed by gynecologic oncologists. ","During the second quarter general surgery remained the primary contributor to U.S. growth. With robust growth in hernia repair and solid contribution from colorectal procedures, being partially offset by continued declines in cholecystectomies. During the first half of 2015, ventral and inguinal hernia repair contributed the majority of the increase in the U.S. general surgery procedures.","The contribution to first half U.S. growth for mature procedures in highly penetrated markets such as da Vinci Prostatectomy and da Vinci malignant and complex hysterectomy has exceeded our expectations. In the second half of 2015 growth in da Vinci Prostatectomy is likely to slow as we anniversary into higher prior year growth rates.","Looking aboard during the second quarter, international procedure growth was led by a modest acceleration in the global adoption of da Vinci Prostatectomy with solid contributions from kidney procedures, malignant hysterectomies and colorectal resections. During the first half of 2015 growth in international da Vinci Prostatectomy was approximately 20%.","Let me take a few moments to provide a bit more color around China. Over the past year we've sold 20 systems under tenders from among 38 civilian hospitals authorized by the government\u2019s required da Vinci system. Procedure adoption has been broad based in urologic, gynecologic, general and thoracic procedures.","While we are encouraged by these developments, future system placements are dependent on completion of the Central purchasing tender under the current authorization which is said to expire at the end of 2015.","It is not certain whether the tender process will be completed or when future governmental authorizations and approvals may enable system placements in 2016 and beyond. Procedure growth rates are likely to be governed by the timing of additional system placements. ","Moving on to clinical and economic validation. A recent publication from Saarland University by Professor St\u00f6ckle and team evaluated the cost effectiveness of da Vinci Prostatectomy compared to open Prostatectomy from a German payor perspective in a 1,400 patient study, partially supported by Intuitive.","From a clinical perspective the robotic patient population showed fewer positive surgical margins and required fewer intraoperative transfusions with the reduction in hospitalization of approximately six days.","In the economic analysis the study showed that the robotic patients were roughly \u20ac3,000 per patient less expensive as measured by the period from date of surgery to two years post operation. The authors concluded that the improved clinical outcomes led to the reduction in post-operative cost. ","In the quarter there was considerable interest in colorectal clinical data with the initial outcomes reported from the ROLARR study. In addition, several other notable studies were published during the quarter. Let me take a moment to highlight two studies from large scale state-wide general surgery registries published in Surgical Endoscopy.","The first study was published by Dr. Cleary and team from Saint Joseph Mercy Health System in Michigan. After reviewing over 2,700 minimally invasive colorectal surgeries from the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative registry, the authors found that conversion rates were lower with robotic compared to laparoscopic procedures for rectal resections and hospital length of stay were shorter with robotic procedures compared to conventional and hand assisted laparoscopic colon procedures.","The second study was published by Dr. Altieri and colleagues from Stony Brook University in a broad based study of nearly 170,000 minimally invasive general surgeries from the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System, the authors found that robotic assisted procedures had lower rates of complications and hospital length of stay compared to laparoscopy across several general surgeries, with the lower rate of complications for colectomies. ","They concluded \u201crobotic approaches may facilitate safer adoption of minimally invasive approaches in areas where penetrance of conventional laparoscopy is low such as in colorectal surgery.\u201d ","This concludes my procedures and clinical commentary I will not be providing you with our update financial outlook for 2015.","Starting with procedures, on our last call we estimated full year 2015 procedure growth of 8% to 11% above the approximately 570,000 procedures performed in 2014. We are now increasing our procedure estimate for 2015. We now anticipate full year 2015 procedure growth within a range of 11% to 13%.","Turning to gross profit, our outlook for gross profit margin has modestly improved compared to last quarter. We expect our second half 2015 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of 67% to 68% of revenue.","Note that this range is a bit lower than our second quarter gross margin as Q2 benefited from favorable product and regional system mix and Q3 and Q4 will likely face stronger foreign exchange headwinds. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product and regional mix, systems production volume and foreign exchange rates. ","Turning to operating expenses, consistent with our last call, we continue to expect to grow pro forma 2015 operating expenses towards the lower end of a range of between 7% and 10% above 2014 levels.","We now expect our 2015 non-cash stock compensation expense to come in towards the lower end of the $170 million and $180 million range forecast on our last call. Fairly flat compared to $169 million in 2014. We expect other income, and just comprise mostly of interest income to total between $16 million and $18 million in 2015.","With regard to income tax, for the reminder of the year we continue to expect our 2015 pro forma income tax rate to be between 28% and 30% of pre-tax income depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. This forecast does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2015.","That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","We will first go to line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Robert Hopkins","Hi, thanks. Can you hear me okay?","Gary Guthart","Can.","Marshall Mohr","Can.","Robert Hopkins","Congratulations on a good quarter. Wanted to ask two quick questions. First on the gross margin side, I appreciate the specific guidance for the near-term and the back half. But Gary and Marshall, I was wondering if I could just get your views on a little bit longer term. Because gross margin is definitely a major issue for investors as they consider your Company and the stock.","So is the back-half level that you're talking about here, 67% to 68%, as you think about the long-term, is that a level that you view as sustainable when you think about all the different puts and takes? Would just love a comment on long-term gross margin. Thank you.","Gary Guthart","We don\u2019t -- as we look at long-term, we don\u2019t see huge changes form that range. There are lot of puts and takes that make it hard to call. So as we get scale along some of the newer products, we get some benefits in terms of cost and cost reduction. There are regional variances so there is mix changes in regions in terms of regional pricing. There are some things that will make it go up and down. ","Longer term we will benefit from some cost advantages, but also depending on the changes in the marketplace and the scale of some of our customers, there are other pressures. So we think where we are today that's a pretty good number to think about.","Robert Hopkins","Okay. And then as a follow-up, two other quick things. You've said a -- it sounds like another good quarter on the hernia side. I was just wondering, now that we're a good, solid couple of quarters in, any kind of commentary from you on -- your views on the sustainability of hernia growth over time, now that you are learning a little bit more.","And I also just wanted to understand the specifics around your comments on Sp, and when we should be thinking about a formal launch of that as we look forward.","Gary Guthart","Sure. So on the hernia side, as you mentioned we are seeing good early growth. I recognize that hernia is both more than one kind of procedure, abdominal hernia, or ventral hernia and inguinal hernia and even within those there is variations in both technique and patient population. So clearly right now there is a mixture of sustained use by our customers and people who are learning and trialing the technology.","What that mix looks like in the near-term is actually very hard to determine. We do see some early evidence of strong clinical benefit in some of the categories and segments and we think that's long-term durable.","Our calling right now how big those total available markets are going to be is still premature. So we have some basic estimates we are working them down. As the quarters go by here we will able to increase our certainty of what those long-terms look like.","With regards to Sp, we are not predicting the ship date at this time. We are on track in our technical developments. We are in conversations with several surgeon groups as well as regulators about where both long-term value can be and what regulatory pathways are and as those firm up we will share them with you in the future.","Robert Hopkins","Great. But that\u2019s still a 2016 event, right?","Gary Guthart","We have not anchored on when we are launching.","Robert Hopkins","Okay. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. We will move to line of Tao Levy with Wedbush.","Tao Levy","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. ","Gary Guthart","Hey, Tao. ","Tao Levy","Hi. So maybe the first question, we think about Japan and next April on the reimbursement and I know you mentioned that you've submitted sort of the kidney data to the regulatory authorities there recently. Are there any other clinical data that either required or that you\u2019re going to be submitting between now and I guess reimbursement decision time?","Gary Guthart","Yeah. So technically, by the way, the submissions are done by the clinical investigators not by Intuitive. We don\u2019t see another clinical data submission between now and April. On the other hand, the pathway that partial nephrectomy went through is something called [indiscernible] uro. That is not the only pathway that have a conversation with the government. ","So the one dataset that we see going in at that time is partial nephrectomy. But there are other conversations ongoing that don\u2019t necessarily have the same pathway. And with nothing has been assured, we can't anchor you on any particular pathway. But we are having multiple conversations.","Tao Levy","Okay, perfect. Just to reiterate that, just because there are no other studies, it doesn\u2019t mean that you can potentially get reimbursement in other procedures. ","Gary Guthart","Right. There are other methods besides just this one. Right.","Calvin Darling ","Yeah. We are not anchored on that April 2016 timeframe either. I mean these other methodologies could occur anytime. ","Tao Levy","Okay.","Gary Guthart","Having said that they are uncertain and they take real work and\u2026","Tao Levy","I understand that. So, my next question, if you think of the instruments that you've recently gotten approved, some of the more advanced disposables -- whether it's stapling and you've got now on the Xi, the energy -- or I guess you had that last year. But as you think about penetration of the applicable type of procedures where those types of instruments are commonly used laparoscopically, what type of penetration should we be thinking about today?","Gary Guthart","So the stapling products that we have in the market today are primarily focused on colorectal surgery and we are seeing really nice adoption in that procedure. That's what they were designed for. Staplers are typically used in those procedures and the adoption of Intuitive\u2019s product in that case has been good. So we've been pleased with that.","Things like vessel sealing are used more broadly and so we see increasing penetration of our vessel sealer in a variety of procedures from general surgery to gynecology and others. So they\u2019ve been good products for us. I think they are meeting customers\u2019 needs and we've seen growth.","Tao Levy","But in terms of the percent of times that the surgeon would use an assistant port, for example, for a stapler or a sealer while doing a da Vinci procedure, are there any metrics around that that you've looked at?","Gary Guthart","So we do track how often they use ours. I don\u2019t think we've gotten to a place of disclosing what the breakouts are for each of those subunits. ","Tao Levy","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. We will go to line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan.","Tycho Peterson","Hey, thanks. Gary, I'm wondering if you can elaborate a little bit on some of the developments for the back half of the year, in particular, around the interoperable table motion for Xi. Just trying to understand does this open up more complex procedures. How do you think about the opportunity set?","And then similarly with Single-Site for Xi, how do we think about the initial rollout?","Gary Guthart","Sure. With regard to table motion, just the value of it, why do it, the value of integrated intraoperative table is that it allows the surgeon to position the patient using gravity. It\u2019s something that they do frequently. It also allows the anesthesiologist an easier interaction to help manage the patient. ","And the power of the integration we've done with our partner has been that it allows it to be done quickly and efficiently. So it\u2019s fast. So the real value here is to speed up procedures. It allows them to do it seamlessly. And so we don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much opening a different market as it is making it easier on lower barriers. ","The feedback too, they\u2019ve been now used in dozens of cases in Europe where it has CE Mark. Feedback has been really good and the implementation done by the team is very, very good. So that looks good and we are encouraged.","We've submitted the 510 (k) just recently, answer FDA\u2019s questions as they come and work through that. It really is rounding out. It\u2019s one of the features that rounds out the Xi platform. Intraoperative table motion is a strong beneficiary for general surgery procedures where folks are wanting to move around the abdomen, helps a lot in that setting. And so the fact that they can do that dynamically is powerful.","Turning to Single-Site on Xi, Single-Site is already available, of course, as you know on the Si. There is nothing that's a technological limitation from putting it on Xi. It\u2019s really been doing the work and getting the clearances. ","What that will enable is the mid-sized hospital that owns one platform; they may have an Si now. They are doing Single-Site and they want to upgrade to an Xi, that\u2019s completes the set for them so that they don\u2019t have to step away from something on their Si system when they move to Xi. And so that's really the opportunity for us there and we are meeting our technical milestones and working through the set of validations that will be required to get clearance. So we are excited about it.","Tycho Peterson","Great. All right. And then a question on ROLARR, now that we've seen the data, I'm just wondering how the discussions with surgeons has evolved. Has this opened up some doors for you, potentially showing equivalency with laparoscopic? And yes, just wondering how you are marketing that to your physician base.","Gary Guthart","The conversation has generally been positive. As you know ROLLAR is really studies a little subgroup, right? So the trial design is such that it\u2019s comparing advanced laparoscopists, highly laparoscopists to new robotic surgeons in rectal cancer. What's not said in that study is that the dominant treatment modality in rectal cancer is open surgery.","So to show good data upfront as they presented, showing equivalence and leading towards some potential benefits even in that early stage in the small subgroup that is minimally invasively treated today, I think that's generally been seen as a positive. And so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been ground shaking in either direction. But I think it\u2019s generally been well received by our customer base. ","Tycho Peterson","And then just last one going back to the original question on the margins, on Sp in particular, I think part of your reason -- the original delay occurred was to get the engineering right and the manufacturing right. Are you able to just talk a little bit about how you are thinking about the margin profile of Sp when it comes out? Shouldn't it be additive to the overall base you are talking about?","Gary Guthart","Yes, as we think about Sp and margins, in total really we're looking for those procedures where we can really show significant outcome value. And I think there are some really interesting potentials out there.","Sp is a fundamentally different way to deliver the instrumentation relative to multiport. We have some experience in single port with Single-Site, but Sp allows us some different opportunities.","That said it's a little more complicated. Now, the engineering side has done a great job. The engineering team in terms of getting both the cost structure and the performance where we want it has been very good.","What we want to do is match that up with potential clinical outcomes that really are strong beneficiaries of our approach. That's really what the clinical side of work has been, and I'm feeling positive on it. I think that the design is really enabling.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to line of Ben Andrew with William Blair.","Ben Andrew","Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. If you think about the improvement we've seen versus the earlier guidance, primarily coming from gross margin and I know, Gary, you guys have been investing aggressively in Europe and overseas for quite some time now. Can we see some of that taper, and see more of the upside flowing through the operating margin over the next year or two?","Gary Guthart","On the time horizon, it depends a lot on which part of the world you are in. I think that as we've talked about in Japan, we now have a direct team there starting to perform more effectively. I think as they're integrating, that looks really good. There are barriers and other things that have to be overcome structurally. And how quickly those resolve I think will determine the pace of the commercial business, and we've talked about it already; things like reimbursement.","In Europe, I think we're seeing a nice performance in several countries. The barriers are a little bit different, depending on which country it is. Not every country is working at the same pace. But we're seeing some of the return on the investments in Europe, and we expect both better performance out of Europe in future quarters, and some continued investment.","Marshall Mohr","But I think you were headed towards -- is there additional leverage? And I think that although those are providing return, we'll continuously be investing in overseas markets. As we've characterized before, there's a really large opportunity out there and we have other things we have to get done.","Ben Andrew","Okay. And then just a quick check the box question. The procedure guidance, is that consistent o-US, U.S., versus what we've seen year-to-date?","Calvin Darling","Yeah, I mean I think in the commentary on the call, we talked about the second quarter really being a continuation of the first quarter trends. And I think that when you talk about the second half of the year, we are talking about a continuation of what we saw in the first half, both domestically and internationally. And the variance in the range really has more to do with just the magnitude of those key drivers that we went through.","Ben Andrew","Okay. And then last for me today, please. Gary, if you think about pocket share or revenue per procedure in usage and I know it's potentially variable with Sp, but how does that evolve over a three to five-year window? Because you've got vessel sealing, you've got the stapler; those are relatively underpenetrated versus where they could go.","You've been running kind of flattish, even with some erosion in procedure potential, if you will, in the number of instruments. You're running flattish on revenue per case. Where does that go? Are you just hoping to hold it steady? Or do you see a lot of rich targets out there to grab additional pocket share?","Gary Guthart","I think in the mid-term, there will be some trades here of some efficiency gains realized by hospitals and some increased penetration of advanced instrumentation. I think in the longer term, the efficiency gains will find a bottom and the advanced instrumentation will continue to grow.","Calvin Darling","And I think you look at where Q2 came in terms of revenue per procedure, at the $1,830 level. About what we would've expected, consistent with the last quarter and the last year. But there were some trade-offs. I think foreign exchange hit us harder and we did have some benefit from the newer products that we've talked about that largely offset it, so, a lot of moving parts.","As we look into the second half, we'd probably assume something similar we've seen in the first half on instrument accessory revenue per procedure. But to offset the exchange, you're probably going to have to have some favorability in other areas.","Ben Andrew","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to line of Matt Taylor with Barclays.","Matt Taylor","HI, thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to ask about some of the drivers here that could lead to system sales. I know you don't give guidance there. But could you talk about the importance of the movable table, the instruments, and those other factors that you've talked about in driving the sales and whether you may see some sequential uptick over the next couple quarters?","Gary Guthart","Yeah, just speaking to the main levers here of system purchase decisions, there's really three levers that we've talked about and remain in place. One of them is upgrade. For a customer who has a system and is thinking about upgrading from an S or an Si or one of the prior systems, they are really looking out and saying, does Xi bring to them either outcome benefit or new service lines relative to prior products?","That's where table motion and Single-Site can make a difference, particularly for single system hospitals. And so we think as those product lines fill out, that will help that upgrade pipeline.","There are people who just buy purely on capacity. They have used the existing capacity of their system. As procedures grow, they look to do additional procedures; they will buy a second system or so.","And the last one is really capacity, again, but often -- is it in the right place. If you are a larger institution or an integrated delivery network, you may be interested in moving the capacity to a different region or a different part of your service network. Sometimes they do that by moving systems; sometimes they do that by buying systems. So, capital decisions are really predicated on those three pillars.","Matt Taylor","Great, thanks. And one follow-up. Just you have a lot of kind of runway here in the general surgery arena. But we've heard other physicians talking about ENT and neuro and cardio. Can you talk about how you are looking beyond even the big opportunities here in general to other areas on the horizon?","Gary Guthart","We're always out scanning, really from the bottom of your feet to the top of your head, to think about where is current surgery difficult or outcomes suboptimal, and in a place where our kinds of technologies can make a difference. We're already participating in ENT with our Si product. We think Sp will have some real value to add in the ENT space over time.","There are other things, of course, in our radars as we go. I think that thoracic surgery is something that's going to matter in the future and something that our kind of technology can make a difference in, in terms of things like lung cancer, mediastinal cancers and so on.","And so we're looking at those things. And we have, of course, as you might imagine other things further out that as we get closer to commercialization we'll talk about.","Matt Taylor","Great. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Hey good afternoon.","Gary Guthart","Hi David.","Matt Taylor","Gary, just two questions. The first is on procedures. The real improvement this quarter was international procedures, I think got better by 7% or so. Can you give us any additional color on where specifically that procedure growth is happening?","And you had made this commentary last years about these reinvestments overseas. It certainly seems that those investments are paying off. So maybe just more color on where those investments are happening, and what specific regions the procedures are strong. And I had a quick follow-up.","Gary Guthart","Okay. Let me give Calvin the floor to just give a little color on the distribution of procedure growth and then we'll get back to it.","Calvin Darling","Yeah, I think it went a little beyond just international. I think on the U.S. side, as I mentioned in the prepared comments, we really had stronger than anticipated performance in the more mature procedures in the United States; I think continued strong growth in prostatectomy procedures.","And then in gynecology, I think we anticipated somewhat of a pullback relative to Q1 -- or relative to the prior year, with a tougher comp. And really we were able to maintain the same -- similar level in that mature category. So, I think those exceeded our expectations and were part of the reason to raise the guidance.","And then, as you say, international was driving it. I think Europe was in general tracking to trends and meeting our performance. The majority of our above-expectation growth was in Asia; as I mentioned, most notably China. We also had a very strong quarter in Korea.","David Lewis","And then, Gary, just a question on -- I know you get persistent questions on use of the balance sheet. But you've said historically that one of the drivers for using the balance sheet obviously is valuation, but the other driver really was just business visibility.","And certainly as evidenced by this quarter, business visibility has markedly improved. So, why not use of cash for buyback? Why was the buyback not bigger last quarter? And how are you thinking about -- what's not a better use your cash than buying back your own stock, just given the improvement in visibility? Thank you.","Marshall Mohr","Yeah, David, this is Marshall. We philosophically really haven't changed how we approach decisions around cash and utilization of cash or buybacks. And we do have an intention to return excess cash to shareholders through stock buybacks. But as you know, we've executed those opportunistically based on market valuations.","The stock market and our stock specifically has been volatile over time. And it creates opportunities for us to purchase stock at favorable prices. And, in fact, if you go back over the last two and a half years, we've repurchased more than 2 million shares at an average price of under $420 a share. So, we're philosophically aligned with what you just said, and that's how we've executed it.","Gary Guthart","David, you said that visibility has improved. Performance certainly improved this quarter on the -- in terms of the how we manage our business and internally and procedures we have strong visibility; the procedures a little less so. But capital remains highly volatile, and just because of the way capital purchase cycles in different economies work.","Operator","Thank you. We'll move on to the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.","David Roman","Thank you and good evening everybody. I wanted just to start with maybe Gary -- you are giving us just some reflection about what has transpired over the past four quarters. Because as I look at your business, this quarter really seems to represent a coming together of a lot of the key drivers, whether it's system placements, procedure volumes, global expansion, et cetera. Whereas in the past few quarters we've seen some of these things I think move in your favor, but not all of them.","So, is there anything that you saw change in the external environment over the course of the second quarter, or in your own business that really led to a positive coalescence of the key underlying fundamentals here?","Gary Guthart","I didn't see anything that looked really environmentally driven. As Calvin mentioned earlier -- I think moving with market trends tend to be things like prostatectomy and malignant hysterectomy, a little bit more mature, where those are probably more likely indicators of the total market behavior, rather than something specific to Intuitive.","With regard to the major drivers that you've been talking about, really I think we've been working on them, in terms of new product launches, investments in Europe, investments in Asia, developing our team, and working on costs and margins. It's really been, roll up your sleeves and do the hard work. And we've had -- as you've said, some of those have come together a little earlier than others. I think one quarter is great. It doesn't make a trend, and our job is to keep doing it.","David Roman","Okay. And as you think about the go-forward from here and understandably I think it's clear why you're not giving total revenue guidance. But what are the factors that you think could lead you to a point to conclude that what you're seeing this quarter turns into a trend? I understand results would be one of those things.","But if you look at factors that you monitor, are we at turning port where robotic surgery growth is back on track versus some of the challenges you've faced over the past couple of years? Or are there nagging factors that you think still need to be addressed?","Gary Guthart","I think there are always things to be worked on, and we've talked about several of them. I think with regard to visibility and predictability of the financials of the business, I think that's really, as I said before, predominantly predicated on capital.","I think there are some interesting things going in the market. I do think that market acceptance of robotic surgery is increasing. I think some of the debates of where it adds value are starting to be resolved. We see a different tone in some of the surgical conversations more broadly and I think that's a real positive. So, we feel good about that.","Having said that, I think that working through reimbursement pathways, working through regulatory pathways, and building really capable organizations takes time. And that's what we're focused on, and that will be the biggest predictor of our long-term performance.","David Roman","And maybe lastly, we've started to hear some discussion in the marketplace about potential competition for robotic surgery. Can you maybe just talk about either, A, what you're seeing; and, B, any actions that you're undertaking to position the business well should any new competitors potentially emerge in the next, call it, I don't know, six, 12, 18 months, et cetera?","Gary Guthart","We've been unwavering in our commitment to bringing value to surgery and our belief that we can. And, as such, we have really believed that increased competition is inevitable. It's validating in that it has other people putting their investments where they think it will bring value. And I think that actually increases the presence of robotic surgery in surgical societies and in the industry broadly.","In terms of our competitive position, clearly we've anticipated the increase in competitors over the years and we've not been idle during that time. So, we've been thoughtful and have I think made some investments that will make our position long-term sustainable.","David Roman","Okay, great. Appreciate all that perspective.","Gary Guthart","Thank you. I think we have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to line of Rich Newitter, Leerink Partners.","Ravi Misra","Hi, good afternoon, this is Ravi in for Rich. He's on the road today. Thank you for taking the question. Got a question on the Japan sales mix; more Sis than Xis. I understand it's early for the Xi launch, but curious as in terms of what you see it would take -- what you envision that it would take in Japan for Xi to inflect more quickly.","And then another one, staying o-US; I think you made a comment a little bit earlier regarding China, where you see procedure growth rates sort of system placement driving growth seems to be a little bit of the opposite of the U.S., where procedures appear to be driving systems.","At what point does the former turn into the latter? And any sort of -- I mean, are there certain number of systems or penetration that you look at when evaluating that opportunity? Thank you.","Gary Guthart","Yeah. I'll let Marshall take the first one on Japan, and I'll take the--","Marshall Mohr","Sure. So, in Japan what we said was that we had a split of eight Sis and five Xis. Now remember, Xi was just introduced -- or just approved, I should say, just approved in late March, so you've really had the opportunity to sell it in a three-month cycle.","Selling cycles in Japan are much longer than that. In fact, they take multiple quarters to get systems done. That's why you see Sis getting done in the quarter, because the process for which the budget was established by the hospital and the purchase process takes a long time. And so this is just completion of deals that were already in flight months before this.","And it will take time for Xi. And all of that should be caveated with the point that right now we have one reimbursement in terms of prostatectomy. We're hopeful to get other reimbursements. But until such time that occurs, system purchases are going to be spotty at best.","Gary Guthart","With regard to China, while we're pleased with the procedure growth and it has been strong, you're absolutely right, in early markets where there aren't a lot of systems placed, then system placements drive procedure growth. And in mature markets -- or more mature markets like the United States, where you have more capacity than procedure growth, turns around and drives the systems.","You were asking, what's the pivot or the inflection point there? It really comes down to accessibility, vis-a-vis the patient population you are trying to treat. So, how many systems are in the neighborhood of the patients who can benefit from them?","And so that's really how you have to back into it: start with the patient population that can benefit from them, and work your way backwards into systems. It's a regional model. We try to do that, but it's not always trivial because of data accessible.","Gary Guthart","Well, thank you. That was our last question. As we have said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits, and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on helping surgeons increase patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma.","We've built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference.","This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery. And we look forward to talking to you again in three months."],"12432":["Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) Q4 2011 Earnings Call January 19, 2012  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Gary S.

Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Quarter 4 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Senior Director of Finance for Intuitive Surgical, Mr. Calvin Darling. Please go ahead.","Calvin Darling","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's fourth quarter conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Aleks Cukic, our Vice President of Strategic Planning.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.","Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release has been posted to our website.","Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our fourth quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our fourth quarter financial results. Aleks will discuss marketing and clinical highlights. Then I will provide our financial forecast for 2012. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.","With that, I'll turn it over to Gary.","Gary S. Guthart","Thank you for joining us on the call today. 2011 has been a productive year at Intuitive. In the past year, our focus was in 4 areas: first, extending the benefits of minimally invasive surgery in gynecology and urology; second, expanding robotic surgery and deepening our organizational capability in Europe and Asia; third, crisp execution in our product development efforts; and finally, enabling emerging procedures in thoracic, transoral, colorectal and general surgery. We have made substantial progress in the areas above. ","Looking first at procedures. In gynecology, hysterectomy procedures grew by approximately 33% over 2010, led by growth in procedures for benign indications in the U.S. In urology, da Vinci Prostatectomy grew by approximately 15% worldwide with most of the growth coming from Europe. Emerging procedure growth was substantive during the year with thoracic surgery and general surgery leading the way followed by head and neck surgery. Clinical results and surgeon interest in these procedures reinforce our conviction in the value of da Vinci surgery in these disciplines. Aleks will take you through greater detail on our procedure performance later in the call. ","Internationally, our teams perform well. In the face of economic uncertainty, our European capital team continue to convert the demand for dVP into new system placements. In Asia, we continue to invest into key markets, particularly Korea and Japan. Earlier this month, we acquired our Korean distributor, Biorobotics, and will begin the transition from a distributor market to a direct sales market. Korea is a country that has embraced robotic surgery and whose surgeons have led in creating new techniques. This acquisition allows us to partner with Korean customers more closely in the development of procedures and products to advance the art. We welcome our Korean team to Intuitive. In Japan, customer interest in 2011 remained high despite the earthquake and ensuing tragedy that occurred in March. We have been working diligently on obtaining reimbursement for da Vinci in Japan and are actively engaged with our partners and MHLW. ","Our product development and regulatory teams also performed well in 2011. Response to our da Vinci Simulator and our Firefly Fluorescence Imaging system was positive in the year with more than half of our new customers purchasing simulators and with Firefly systems beginning use in several leading centers. ","Turning to instruments. We received clearance for our Single-Site instrument and accessory kit for use in cholecystectomy in Q4 2011 and are in the process of a phase rollout. Our first U.S. customers have been completing single-incision cholecystectomy cases and their early reports on outcomes and ease-of-use are encouraging. In December of 2011, we received our FDA clearance for our vessel sealer and we anticipate beginning its phase rollout in this first quarter of 2012. Lastly, we submitted our 510(k) for our da Vinci Stapler late in the fourth quarter. ","Looking back at the full year 2011, our operating highlights are as follows. Worldwide procedures grew by approximately 29%. We sold 534 da Vinci Surgical Systems in the year, up from 441. Total revenue grew to $1,757,000,000, up 24% over 2010. Recurring revenue grew to $980 million, up 30% and comprising 56% of total revenue. We generated $831 million in operating profit before noncash stock compensation expense, up 24% from last year. And GAAP net income grew to $495 million, up 30% year-over-year. ","Now turning to operating highlights for the fourth quarter. Procedures grew approximately 27% over the fourth quarter of last year. We sold 152 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 124 in the fourth quarter of 2010. Total revenue for the quarter was $497 million, up 28%. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $196 million, up 30%. We generated an operating profit of $234 million in the quarter before noncash stock compensation expense, up 27% from the fourth quarter of last year. And GAAP net income grew to $151 million, up 25%. ","We ended the year with $2,172,000,000 in cash and investments, up $285 million from last quarter and up $563 million from last year. We received $261 million in cash during the year from the exercise of stock options and invested $83 million in fixed assets and intellectual property, $19 million in working capital and equipment and $332 million in stock repurchases for the year. Going forward, we will continue to look for stock repurchase opportunities. Gross cash from operations for the year were $737 million, which is 149% of our reported GAAP net income for the year. This is a reflection of the significant noncash stock option and statutory tax expenses reflected in our GAAP net income and is the reason that we believe that gross  cash generated from operations remains the best measure of our financial performance. ","We added 79 people to our team predominantly in our clinical sales force, our design and operations functions in Q4, bringing our total team to 1,924 employees. Looking to 2012, our priorities are as follows: first, continuing our growth in gynecology and urology worldwide through outstanding execution in the field; second, disciplined execution of our Single-Site and vessel sealing launches focused on outstanding early customer experiences; third, building robust clinical programs with leading customers and emerging procedures in general surgery, thoracic surgery and transoral surgery; and finally, strengthening our capabilities in international markets, particularly Europe, Japan and Korea. ","I'll now pass the time over to Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer, to take us through our financial performance in greater detail.","Marshall L. Mohr","Thank you, Gary. Our fourth quarter revenue was $497 million, up 28% compared with $389 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 and up 11% compared with $447 million reported for the third quarter of 2011. Fourth quarter revenues by product category were as follows. Fourth quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $196 million, up 30% compared with $151 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, and up 12% compared with $176 million in the third quarter of 2011. Year-over-year, instrument and accessory revenue growth was driven by procedure growth of 27% and initial purchases of recently launched products, including our Firefly and thoracic instrument set. Quarter-over-quarter growth was primarily driven by higher fourth quarter stocking orders associated with higher fourth quarter system unit sales. ","Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders of approximately $1,975 per procedure, was higher than the $1,940 realized in the fourth quarter of 2010 and the $1,950 achieved in the third quarter of 2011. Over time, we expect instruments and accessories per procedure to decline slowly given that initial stocking orders have a lower impact on a larger installed base. This natural decline has been more than offset in recent quarters by the positive impact of our new instrument and accessory product. However, instrument and accessory revenue per procedure will fluctuate based on product and procedure mix as well as the rate of adoption of newer products. ","Fourth quarter 2011 systems revenue of $225 million increased 27% compared with $178 million of systems revenue for the fourth quarter of 2010 and increased 13% compared with $199 million of systems revenue for the third quarter of 2011. Our higher fourth quarter 2011 systems revenue was driven by higher system unit sales and increased average selling prices. We sold 152 systems in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with 124 systems in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 133 systems in the third quarter of 2011. The fourth quarter of 2011 system count included 50 systems involving trade-in comprised of 23 standard systems and 27 da Vinci Ss. During the third quarter of 2011, 35 systems involved trade-ins comprised of 14 standard systems and 21 da Vinci Ss. In the fourth quarter of 2010, 33 systems involved trade-in comprised of 24 standard systems and 9 da Vinci Ss. Upgrade revenue for the fourth quarter of 2011 was approximately $2 million compared with $3 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 and $5 million for the third quarter of 2011. ","Our fourth quarter average sales price per system, including all da Vinci models but excluding upgrades, was $1.47 million, an increase from the $1.41 million realized in the fourth quarter of 2010 and a slight increase compared with the $1.46 million realized in the third quarter. The increase in average sales price relative to the fourth quarter of 2010 reflects a higher proportion of dual consoles in surgical simulators and Firefly-enabled systems, both of which were introduced in the current year, partially offset by an increase in the number of da Vinci S trade-in. The increase in ASPs relative to the third quarter reflect a higher proportion of simulators and Firefly-enabled systems, partially offset by a proportionally lower mix of dual consoles and increased da Vinci S trade-in. We sold 29 dual console systems in the fourth quarter 2011 compared to 16 in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 29 in the third quarter of 2011. ASPs will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on product, customer and trade-in mix as well as foreign exchange rates on sales made in European currency. ","Service revenue increased to $75 million, up 24% compared with $61 million last year and up 5% compared with $72 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was primarily driven by a larger system installed base. Total fourth quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue, increased to $272 million, up 28% compared with the fourth quarter of 2010 and up 10% compared with the third quarter of 2011. Recurring revenue represented 55% of total fourth quarter revenue compared with 54% in the fourth quarter last year and 55% last quarter. ","International results were as follows. Fourth quarter 2011 procedures outside of the United States grew approximately 28% compared with fourth quarter of 2010 and 34% compared with the third quarter of 2011. dVP in Europe was the greatest driver of o U.S. procedure growth. We also experienced growth in dVH for malignant conditions in Europe. o U.S. procedures grew slower than previous quarters in part reflecting cost control efforts in certain European market and a decline in the Korean market. On January 11, we completed the purchase of our Korean distributor. The purchase price and the impact of the acquisition on 2012 income is not expected to be material. The acquisition will enable closer relationships with our Korean customers and increase focus on procedure adoption. ","Fourth quarter revenue outside of the United States was $107 million, up 12% compared with revenue of $95 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and up 13% compared with revenue of $94 million in the third quarter of 2011. Instrument and accessory revenue outside of the United States grew 34% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. We sold 39 systems outside of the United States this quarter compared with 38 in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 34 last quarter. Aleks will provide additional details of overseas system sales. ","Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Our gross margin in the fourth quarter was 73%, consistent with 73% for the fourth quarter of 2010 and 73% for the third quarter of 2011. Fourth quarter operating expenses of $163 million were up 27% compared with the fourth quarter of 2010 and up 11% compared with the third quarter of 2011. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects higher variable costs associated with increased revenue, higher engineering project costs and costs associated with employees added during the quarter. We added 79 employees in the quarter, including 30 employees in product operations and 31 employees in commercial operations. Fourth quarter 2011 operating income was $200 million or 40% of sales compared with $154 million or 40% of sales for the fourth quarter of 2010 and $179 million or 40% of sales for the third quarter of 2011. Fourth quarter 2011 operating income reflects $35 million of noncash stock compensation expense compared with $30 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 and $35 million last quarter. ","Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 26% brought our annual tax rate to just over 30% compared to an annual tax rate of 33% last year. The decrease in the annual rate reflects a higher mix of foreign earnings and lower state taxes. The change from the third quarter reflects lower state taxes and changes in our estimates of foreign versus U.S. income. Our net income was $151 million or $3.75 per share compared with $121 million or $3.02 per share for the fourth quarter of 2010 and $122 million or $3.05 per share for the third quarter of 2011. ","Let me quickly summarize our results for 2011. Procedures grew by 29%. Total revenue for 2011 was $1.76 billion, up 24% compared with $1.41 billion last year. The revenue increase included recurring revenue growth, 30%, and an increase in systems revenue of 18%. Operating income for 2011 was $695 million, up 25% compared with $555 million last year. Operating income included $136 million of stock-based compensation charges in 2011 compared with $118 million in 2010. Net income for 2011 was $495 million or $12.32 per share compared with $382 million or $9.47 per share last year. Gross cash flows from operations for 2011 totaled $737 million compared with $573 million last year. ","Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended 2011 with cash and investments of $2.17 billion, up $285 million compared with September 30, 2011. The increase was driven by $209 million of gross cash flows from operation plus $79 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $15 million of capital and IP purchases. During the fourth quarter, we did not repurchase any of our common stock. However, we remain committed to exercising the remaining board authorized buybacks of $568 million. Our accounts receivable balance increased to $298 million at December 31 from $265 million at September 30, primarily reflecting the higher impact of fourth quarter revenues. Our net inventory increased to $112 million at December 31 from $109 million at September 30. Our higher inventory reflects our business growth and expanded product offering. ","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights.","Aleks Cukic","Thank you, Marshall. During the fourth quarter, we sold 152 da Vinci systems; 113 in the United States, 23 into Europe and 16 into rest of world markets. As part of the 152 system sales, 23 standard da Vinci systems and 27 da Vinci S systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si systems. We had a net 101 system additions to the installed base during the quarter, which brings to 2,132 the cumulative number of da Vinci systems worldwide; 1,548 in the U.S., 372 in Europe and 212 in rest of world markets. 82 of the 152 systems installed during the quarter represented repeat system sales to existing customers. In total, 144 of the 152 systems sold represented da Vinci Si systems, which included 29 dual console systems. The 39 system sales internationally included 5 into Japan, 5 into France and 4 into the countries of Germany and Russia. ","As mentioned in the past, Q4 tends to provide seasonal strength for da Vinci system sales, most notably in the U.S. While international da Vinci sales were solid, the EU macroeconomic environment remained choppy. Clinically, we had a strong quarter, achieving an overall year-over-year procedure growth rate of approximately 27%. Gynecology and general surgery growth was particularly strong; while urology, most notably international dVP growth, was robust. Within GYN, strong growth took place across the board. The 9 dVH sacrocolpopexy, myomectomy and endometrial resections were up sharply. General surgery growth was also strong within several procedure subcategories, including G.I. surgery and cholecystectomy. ","During the quarter, nearly 300 abstracts and papers representing a variety of surgical specialties were published within various peer reviewed journals, while the clinical conferences were abundant with why da Vinci procedure transmissions, postgraduate robotic courses, podium presentations and clinical poster sessions. While our FDA clearance for Single-Site is brand-new, we've had the product selectively available in Europe for the past few quarters. The initial European response has been favorable with early clinical reports beginning to make their way into the clinical journals. In a recent edition of the journal, Surgical Endoscopy, Dr. Spinoglio and Lenti from Alessandria, Italy published a comparative analysis entitled, Single-Site Robotic Cholecystectomy Versus Single-Incision Lap Chole: A Comparison of Learning Curves. In the publication, they described how technical constraints, such as instrument collisions, lack of triangulation and cross-handing has hampered the SILS approach from fully emerging. They described how using a robotic platform may overcome these problems and enable more precise surgical actions by increasing freedom of movement and by restoring intuitive instrument control. In their study, performed under institutional controls, the surgeons compared the results of their first 25 Single-Site cases to their first 25 single-incision lap choles and followed up each patient 2 months postoperatively. The result showed consistency between the 2 patient groups when it came to wound complications where neither group experienced wound infections or incisional hernias. Length of hospitalization was reduced slightly within the Single-Site cohort. However, the most striking difference between the 2 groups was the operative time to perform the procedure. They published that the operative time was significantly reduced using Single-Site as compared to the manual single-incision approach. Average operative time was 83.2 minutes with the SILS approach compared to 62.7 minutes with Single-Site. Their conclusion was and I quote, \"Our preliminary experience shows that Single-Site robotic chole is safe, can easily be learned and performed in a reproducible manner and is faster than single-incision lap chole.\" ","We continue to experience general surgery procedure strength across several subcategories, cholecystectomy among them. Going forward, we anticipate general surgery playing a more prominent role within our overall procedure mix. While not a primary target, the conversion from laparoscopic hysterectomy to dVH has been taking place within a number of practices. These conversions have not been isolated to any particular pathological segment, meaning that we have seen conversions take place within both benign and malignant treatment pathways. Surgeons have provided various reasons for converting lap cases to dVH, most of which relate to the expansion of MIS technique across a wider spectrum of patients. But a recent study published in the journal, Gynecologic Oncology, provides a new postoperative cost savings argument. The study authored by Drs. Martino and Shubella was entitled, A Cost Analysis of Postoperative Management in Endometrial Cancer Patients Treated by Robotics Versus Laparoscopic Approach. The study retrospectively collected cost data from 215 patients, 101 dVHs and 114 lap hyst patients where all surgeries were performed by gynecologic oncologists. Demographic data, patient recorded pain scores, pain management interventions and post operative pain medication costs were compared. They reported that robotic patients had a lower number of initial drug interventions as well as a lower number of total drug interventions than laparoscopic patients. Robotic patients also had a lower initial pain score. There was a 50% reduction in the pain medication cost on the day of surgery for robotic patients and a 56% cost reduction for the rest of their length of stay. The author's conclusion and I quote, \"Endometrial cancer patients, who have robotic surgery experience, less initial postoperative pain and have fewer drug interventions, the cost associated for their pain management represents a savings of greater than 50%. These factors demonstrate the value of robotic surgery in regard to postoperative pain management by delivering higher-quality care at a lower cost.\" ","Drs. Magrina and Zanagnolo from the Mayo Clinic of Scottsdale published a study in the European Journal of Gynecologic Oncology entitled, Robotic Surgery for Endometrial Cancer: A Comparison of Perioperative Outcomes and Recurrences with Laparoscopy, Vaginal Laparoscopy and Laparotomy. The method of study was a prospective analysis of 67 patients undergoing robotic surgery for endometrial cancer as compared to 37 laparoscopic hysterectomies, 99 laparotomy approaches and 47 vaginal laparoscopic combination procedures. They reported that the mean operating times for patients undergoing these 4 techniques was pretty similar. But mean blood loss differed significantly; 141 milliliters for robotic patients, 300 milliliters for lap patients, 300 milliliters for vag lap patients and 472 milliliters for open laparotomy. The mean length of hospital stay was 1.9 days in the robotic cohort, 3.4 days for lap patients, 3.5 days for vaginal lap patients and 5.6 days for their laparotomy patients. There were no significant differences in intra or postoperative complications among the 4 groups. The conversion rate was 2.9% for robotics compared to 10.8% for the laparoscopy group. Their conclusion and I quote, \"Robotics, laparoscopy and vaginal laparoscopy techniques are preferable to laparotomy for suitable patients with endometrial cancer. Robotics is preferable to laparoscopy due to a shorter hospital stay and lower conversion rate and preferable to vaginal laparoscopy due to reduced hospitalization.\" ","Late adopters of urologic robotic surgery have, from time to time, issued critiques based purely on a structural academic point of view, citing little prospective randomized data comparing dVP to open prostatectomy. And since powering a large study with enough men willing to be randomized into the open surgery cohort is both difficult and unlikely, we have relied on the large body of clinical evidence that has been drawn from quality institutions around the world. This month, 2 more very large studies were published in the journal, European Urology. Each study was comprised of 5-digit national samples, but for sake of time, I'll highlight only one. The study was entitled, Perioperative Outcomes of Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy Compared with Open Radical Prostatectomy: Results from an Inpatient Sample. It originated out of the Vattikuti Urology Institute at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit and included authorship support from several other leading centers. The study, which included over 19,000 prostatectomy patients, compared the rates of blood transfusions, intraoperative and postoperative complications, prolonged length of stay and in-hospital mortality between 7,400 open prostatectomies and 11,900 dVP patients. In the comparison, the authors reported that the percentage of men requiring blood transfusions was approximately 3.5x greater for men undergoing an open prostatectomy as compared to dVP. The percentage of men experiencing intraoperative complications was over 2x greater for open prostatectomy. Postoperative complications were approximately 25% higher in the open prostatectomy group. Length of stay, prolonged length of stay and in-hospital mortality was found to be higher within the open prostatectomy group. The authors summarized their conclusion by stating and I quote, \"Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy has supplanted open prostatectomy as the most common surgical approach for radical prostatectomy. Moreover, we demonstrate superior adjusted perioperative outcomes after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy in virtually all examined outcomes.\" ","This concludes my remarks, so I'll now turn the time over to Calvin.","Calvin Darling","Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing you with our financial forecast for 2012, including procedures, revenues and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates of significant noncash expenses to provide you with visibility into our expected future cash flows. ","Starting with procedures. We continue to see strong growth in U.S. da Vinci gynecologic procedures and dVPs in Europe and general growth across a broadening range of procedures at early stages of adoption -- earlier stages of market adoption. We expect our 2012 total procedures to grow approximately 24% to 26% from the base of approximately 360,000 procedures performed in 2011. Based on an increasing percentage of benign hysterectomies and other short-term elective procedures in our procedure mix, we anticipate a more pronounced quarterly seasonality impact in 2012 as compared to 2011. ","Moving on to revenues. We expect to achieve annual revenue growth of between 17% and 19%. We expect typical capital sales seasonality in 2012 with the proportion of full year system units sold in each quarter to follow a pattern consistent with 2011. We would expect fewer systems to be sold in the upcoming seasonally slower first quarter than in the recently completed seasonally stronger fourth quarter. All 2012 revenues, particularly capital sales in Europe, are subject to the impacts of uncertain economic conditions. ","Now turning to operating income. Our 2011 operating income was 39.5% of revenue and it was 39.3% of revenue in 2010. For 2012, we would expect our operating income profile to remain fairly consistent with the past 2 years falling within a range of between 39% and 40% of revenue for the year. Consistent with prior years, we would expect our operating income as a percentage of revenue to be lower in the first quarter of 2012, reflecting system sales and procedure seasonality in combination with the more linear operating expense growth pattern. We expect our noncash stock compensation charges to increase from $136 million recorded in 2011 to approximately $144 million to $150 million in 2012. Amortization of purchased intellectual property, which is mostly recorded as R&D expense, is expected to increase from $18 million in 2011 to a range between $20 million and $24 million in 2012. Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income was approximately $15 million in 2011. We expect other income to be approximately flat within a range of between $13 million and $15 million in 2012. With regard to income tax, in 2011, we recorded an income tax rate at approximately 30% of pretax income. Going forward, we would expect the 2012 income tax rate to remain around that rate, between a range of 29% and 31% of pretax income. We estimate that our share count for calculating EPS in Q1 2012 will be approximately 40.5 million shares. ","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Ben Andrew representing William Blair.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I'm curious. You had a lot of activity going with all the single-incision approval, purchase of the Korean distributor, closing on Japanese reimbursement approval and it looked like you stepped up hiring in the fourth quarter to support some of that. Talk a little bit about the strategy going direct in Korea and how material event that could be. What does your organization look like in Japan now and what it may look like? And presumably, a lot of that is already contemplated into your operating margin guidance. So is there a chance that maybe we see a bigger investment as the year goes on that could -- that would push you towards the lower end of the range that Calvin just gave us?","Gary S. Guthart","A few questions embedded in there, but I'll start with Korea. Our view of Korea is that -- has a lot to do with being close to our Korean customer to help develop the next generation of procedures of general surgical procedures. We don't see it so much as being a big swing financially one way or the other but really an opportunity to be with some leading groups and be close to them, and it's something that we have contemplated for a little while and are excited to get started with. On the Japan side, most of our investment this past year have really been in regulatory and kind of back office support work getting ready to take on reimbursement and some of the other things we want to do with regard to building out that market. And we expect more of the same this year. I don't think I would forecast high or low end of the range based on that set of activities that we're going to do. I think Calvin's range that he described accurately represents where we're going to wind up.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then as you think about ramping single incision, obviously, that's a new approval for you guys. There's some iteration to do on the instruments and some experience to gain, perhaps. Over what time frame do you think that, that can become material to the business? Is that really a 2013 where you're talking maybe 5s or 10s of thousands of procedures? Or is that something achievable in '12 because obviously it's a large opportunity and the instrument set's early. And I know you're collecting experience in Europe. But just how do you think about that? And being a different call point, does that require a different sales force or just to get another duty for your already very busy sales organization?","Aleks Cukic","Dan, it's Aleks. And I'll take a cut at it and Gary can fill in anything that I leave blank. I think as a general matter, when we think of procedure launches or product launches that are really tied to a specific procedure, we have a set of activities that is requisite, really irrespective of the specialty. And that is getting the procedure up and running with key opinion leaders, making sure that you understand the nuances of the procedure, understanding what the training pathway is going to look like, setting up your proctors, embedding it into basic sales training for your large downstream organization, making sure you've got instrument optimization and so on and so forth. Unlike a, let's say, a pharmaceutical clearance where doctors basically fill out prescription pads and you can be off and running pretty quick, it requires a lot of work. So when we think about it in terms of is it going to be a material number in 2011 or is it 2012, we're really not that focused on it. The market is going to be there if we approach it well. And so we're more interested in really doing it well in the front end and give us a couple of quarters to sort of sort through that, and we'll probably have a better answer for you in the near future.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And just circling back, Gary, on one, that on the sales rep hiring, it does look like the headcount picked up more like the trajectory we saw several quarters ago. Was that an artifact or was that the distributor? Is that kind of more just again in support of this and we should expect to see that sustained over the course of '12?","Calvin Darling","So just in terms of the numbers, I'll fill those in and let Gary comment further. So we ended the quarter with roughly 565 clinical salespeople and 85 capital sales in the field. So what that results in was about 20 clinical adds and 5 capital for the year -- or for the quarter, sorry, which would bring our full year clinical adds to 90 and 15 on the capital side. So that's really more of a return to a pattern of hiring consistent with the system installations or the adds to the installed base that we've seen historically. You may recall in 2011 -- or 2010, we invested heavily in the field organization. In that year, we had 150 when we took it from 315 to 465. So here, we're back to a more status quo level.","Gary S. Guthart","Just to add a little, there's a couple of things in here that are a little bit of timing where we tend to want to bring in sales reps on the early side for the year and get them into training, and you do see the addition of the Korean team into the groups.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'm wondering if you could just provide a little bit more color on Europe. Your commentary there on Europe in the quarter was a little bit mixed. I'm just wondering, you brought up, I think, something like the cost control initiatives. So can you just talk a little bit more on the dynamics in the European market?","Gary S. Guthart","Sure. So what we saw in the -- in the European market, what we saw was that hospitals are cautious about what they're spending. And we understand that they're given fixed budgets and that they may have run through those fixed budgets and, therefore, didn't serve all of the patients that maybe they otherwise would have. We'll see in Q1. We don't know. The market is not predictable at this point and we'll see how it pans out.","Aleks Cukic","Yes. I think also, just to add, Tycho, is that when you look at the 23 systems that were sold in Europe and you're looking at the connection between procedures and system sales, really the strength of urology and namely dVP is really moving rapidly in certain markets. And you've heard us call out Germany quarter after quarter where they've had a pretty strong performance in Germany. And you're hearing a couple of new markets like Russia, and France has been pretty strong for the past few quarters. So we're pleased with the adoption of that, but it just becomes very difficult to predict which country is going to be able to close, which system and in which 90-day period.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then I guess maybe just shifting to new products. First of all, with the vessel sealer, can you talk about how you see the opportunity between general surgery and colorectal? And I think you've talked about lung and some other areas. And then also, are you willing to put a guess on when you'll get the Stapler out now that you filed?","Aleks Cukic","As far as vessel sealer, the way we think about that, if you look at the standard toolkit for a surgeon, be it general surgery, GYN oncology, thoracic surgery and more specifically, colorectal within general, a vessel sealer capable of taking larger vessels is usually in the armamentarium. Now with da Vinci today, we have the ability -- our customers have the ability to tie off large vessels, they can clip them. We have monopolar and bipolar, which usually goes into smaller vessels. We have the Endo PK device. So we have a number of tools but what has been missing is an integrated vessel sealer. So when we again think about it and where it's going to go, we know it's used in conjunction with da Vinci procedures across the board. When I say across the board, including general surgery and GYN, oncology and other areas. So we think that the choreography of giving them the ability to fire it from the system without having to get up or having the system fire it is going to add value. Where and how and how many, again, give us a few quarters to sort that out. It is a disposal product. We plan to roll it out this quarter. We've got our clearances. We will be cautious and make sure we set up the right sites and the work through it diligently as we do it with any other large product launch.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then on the Stapler?","Gary S. Guthart","Yes. On the stapler, we're feeling good about the product. On the other hand, trying to handicap exactly when we'll get through the clearance process we're not ready to do.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just one last one, following up on that. As we think about overall R&D spend, how do you feel about R&D levels? As you come off 2011, could we start to see R&D leverage at some point going forward? Or how do we think about that?","Gary S. Guthart","Yes, it's been lumpy and you saw some lumpiness in the fourth quarter. A little bit of what drove that lumpiness coming in, a little bit of acceleration in the fourth quarter were really 2 things. Some of it was just prototype timing. Those things aren't always smooth quarter-to-quarter. And a little bit of it was some of the things that we were asked to do for FDA clearances, and that brought it up a little bit. So I think it will be -- in profile it will hold about the same profile. It may be lumpy, though. It may not come in smoothly all the way through the year.","Operator","Our next question today comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","Jonathan Demchick - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Jon Demchick, in for David. We had a question on revenue per procedure trends. Over the last few quarters, we've seen a lot of progress with Intuitive's pipeline; adding Single-Site, the vessel sealer Firefly, suction irrigation, et cetera. These new tools have continued to help revenue per procedure stay in the mid-1,900s now moving up a little from there. As these instruments gain a little further traction, how do you expect revenue per procedure to trend? And also, do you expect to continue to introduce new products at the current rate that you have been over the past few quarters?","Calvin Darling","Yes. Jon, it's Calvin here. Yes, you correctly pointed it out. I think, as Marshall stated in our prepared comments, over a long period of time, we'd expect that the revenue per procedure would gradually trend down as the stocking order impact becomes lesser impactful on a larger installed base. But in recent quarters, as you correctly point out, some of our new product offerings, like Firefly and our 8.5-millimeter scope and our thoracic toolkit, the initial stocking of those new products has also served to kind of offset that national decline and we've kind of held it around the mid-1,900s. So now looking forward into 2012, which is your question, I guess there's forces moving it in either direction, including the timing of the stocking orders, international rate fluctuations, exchange rates, I mean, and new products, and particularly how successful we are with some of the new products that we have talked earlier, which we're just not really in a position to handicap that perfectly how much impact it will have. So really, it could go either way at this point.","Jonathan Demchick - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on the procedure guidance. So we were wondering if you could give any clarity to some of the assumptions behind that guidance at around 25% for year 2012 for both hysterectomies and for o U.S. prostatectomies. We were wondering if you were kind of assuming procedure growth in line above or below your total procedure guidance?","Gary S. Guthart","So the major drivers of a procedure -- procedure growth next year, we still expect to be in the gynecologic area in U.S. and dVP in Europe. We haven't profiled how much we think each one of those is going to grow next year, but those assumptions of those 2 areas driving the growth are embedded in our total projection.","Aleks Cukic","And also, strength in the emerging procedures that we've talked about in the general surgery or thoracic surgery and some of the other areas. So we're pretty careful about the makeup of the projected growth and we've thought through it pretty clearly.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tao Levy of Collins Stewart.","Tao Levy - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division","A question on the procedure growth rate in the fourth quarter of -- was that a -- mainly, the slowdown versus the growth rates that we saw throughout the first 3 quarters of 2011, that was mainly Europe, is that kind of correct?","Gary S. Guthart","Yes, we felt pretty good about our procedure performance through the year in the U.S. We saw some pressure in Europe right at the very end of the fourth quarter and a little bit out of Asia. Different things going on there. In Europe, it looks to be more anecdotes come back, pointing more to economic pressure. In Asia, it's really getting some of the structural issues resolved in Japan and in Korea.","Tao Levy - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division","Got you. And general surgery, I think, Aleks, you made a comment that expect that to play a bigger role going forward. And can you talk a little bit more or expand a little bit more into what areas, what type of penetration you expect to get to in this segment? And at least in your prior investor presentations, general surgery was mainly made up of colorectal. I mean, you're talking a little bit more about gallbladders being -- having grown nicely in the quarter. And I was just wondering how that fits into the long-term picture.","Aleks Cukic","Yes, so if you look at general surgery, there's obviously a number of ways to cut it. But I think for sake of the question, think of it in terms of G.I., gastrointestinal, made up mostly of the colon. So you've got right colon, transverse colon, you have descending, left colon, sigmoid, low anterior resections, et cetera. We have a nice emerging business there with good solid growth rates. It's off a small base, but we're hearing from customers that there is a lot of value to this procedure, a procedure that they have been doing in small numbers laparoscopically over the past 15 to 20 years. We think we can add some value there. A device, such as the vessel sealer, will be helpful to that cohort of physicians and customers. So we -- you can envision us spending more time there, more sales interactions, et cetera, whereas Single-Site is specific to lap chole. And so as we look at 2011 and compare it to, let's say, projected 2012 activity, you now have a number of exciting areas with higher value offerings to your customer. And so we're going to refrain from trying to give guidance in terms of what we think our penetration will be or by when because we're really focused on doing the right things at the front end to seed this market. The market isn't going anywhere. We will do it right. And so as we get a few more quarters into it, perhaps at that point, we can elaborate more deeply.","Tao Levy - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division","Okay. If I could just sneak one more in. Japan reimbursement, Gary, I think you mentioned that you may continue to make progress over there. So is it fair to say that you have not gotten reimbursement for prostate in Japan yet?","Gary S. Guthart","So we're in conversation, but we have not had a definitive conversation at this time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lennox Ketner with Bank of America.","Lennox Ketner - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","One, just if we could just return to Europe quickly. I was wondering if you can maybe characterize kind of what you saw throughout the quarter. The weakness that you're talking about, did that just manifest towards the very end of the quarter? Or was that kind of consistent throughout the quarter?","Gary S. Guthart","Thought it increased through quarter is the right way to view it. I think though, it's not a deep, deep analysis. But anecdotally, you saw some increased pressure as the quarter wore on.","Lennox Ketner - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then on the Single-Site launch, is it possible -- I know Aleks was talking about kind of all of the work that's involved in the early stages of the launch and then will be fairly gradual. But is there any way to kind of just qualitatively compare it to the European launch? I know you're in kind of 10 to 15 sites in Europe in the first year. How should we think about the U.S. launch? Can you -- do you feel like you can be in twice as many sites? How -- if there's any way to kind of compare it to the European launch in terms of the scope, that would be helpful.","Aleks Cukic","I think, structurally, when I say structurally, we'll go through the same process of picking the right centers. But I don't think you should think of it being materially larger or materially smaller than the initial launch that we had outside the United States. So it is something that will be carefully scripted in making sure we have the right centers. And obviously, our sales and marketing people have a list of people that they are working with now, and we'll keep it in that domain and eventually add more centers. And as we have more learning, roll it out fully at some point.","Lennox Ketner - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then I apologize if you answered this earlier, but are you guys planning to hire additional sales people for that product or to have the sales people specialize there? Or will it just be sold by your general sales force?","Gary S. Guthart","We have a small team who will help focus on Single-Site as it comes out and as it goes in the early phases, they'll be focused on that effort. As it gets a little bit broader, then it will work down into the rest of the organization.","Operator","And we have a question from Rick Wise representing Leerink Swann.","Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Let me come back to Korea. First, a broader question. Are there other international distributors to convert, one? And, two, I mean, I know that Korea has been a hotbed of a robotic activity, can you give us any flavor for how big it is relative to international sales or total sales? And where I'm going is -- and it would seem to me that as you convert from a distributor to direct that you'd realize higher ASPs, which all things equal should be helpful to a system pricing, all things equal, in 2012.","Aleks Cukic","First of all, Rick, as far as the -- kind of scoping it for you, Korea, I believe, through the end of the year has 36 da Vinci placements. And if you look at the things that are being done within the busy Korean centers, you'll see things like a lot of thyroid work, colorectal work, certainly urologic work. And some pretty advanced efforts into things like gastric and other G.I. cancers. Now as far as the overall procedures, we haven't broken out any individual country by procedure numbers. But you could -- you can envision it, I think, fairly accurately by thinking of a 36-system market that has a lot of activity going on. As far as other distributors, to my knowledge, and perhaps Marshall or Calvin can correct me if I'm wrong, the only other one that I'm aware of that we took from distributor to direct in recent memory has been the U.K. And so we've done it before. And Gary gave the reasons why Korea is an interesting market for us.","Gary S. Guthart","And that was a few years ago. Basically, we monitor the performance of all the distributors and make decisions as we go and so...","Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","So there could be others in the future. Turning to gross margins, did I miss it? Or did you not give a specific gross margin for cash for 2012? Any reason to assume anything other than the sort of stable performance we have seen?","Calvin Darling","Yes. So the guidance on this, we kind of truncated the gross margin and the operating expenses to come to an overall operating profit. That again, we guided to something relatively flat on a profile basis between 39% and 40% there. Splitting it out, roughly flat is probably reasonable. If it goes one way or another, we'd probably see maybe a little more downward pressure on the gross margins as we're introducing some of the new products and maybe a slight bit of leverage on the operating expenses. But again, focusing on the operating income, we're signaling pretty flat.","Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Yes, and then 2 last ones. Just back to Japan reimbursement, I'm not sure what this means, but I've read something that says that the government has certified the da Vinci system is \"highly advanced medical technology\" for prostate cancer operations, allowing patients to use health insurance. Can you just -- any color around that, what's that about?","Gary S. Guthart","I haven't seen the specific publication that you're talking about, so I really can't comment it on the call.","Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just a last quick one, if I could. And just sort of a fishing expedition, somebody asked me a question about patents. And last time we met, Marshall or maybe it was Gary, you said you have 1,000 patents or so now, 1,000 in the pipeline and just big numbers. Are there any key expirations that we should be sensitive to coming up in the next 12 to 24 months?","Gary S. Guthart","On the patent side, it's a sliding window. So as things mature, some things will fall off and other things get added. It's not huge numbers that falloff at any one time. And so as you go through kind of a detailed analysis, some will start coming off in future years as you'd expect. And we feel like the kinds of things that we're innovating on, and are obtaining patent coverage for either through organic work or through end licensing, will be important for our products and important to our customers.","Operator","Our final question today then will come from the line of Spencer Nam with Think Equity.","Spencer Nam - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","Just couple of quick questions. On the multisystem, the places, locations, if you will. Last quarter, you had provided some color on that. Could you give us a little more color on what the current multisystem location numbers would be?","Aleks Cukic","Yes. Spencer, I believe it's -- and Calvin can correct me. I think it's 306 at the end of this quarter. And now we have a hospital. I think the Mayo Clinic in Rochester is now up to 7 systems. So that would be the highest in any one hospital. And again, then there's a smattering of few hospitals with 6 and 5 and 4 all the way down to those.","Calvin Darling","For our total installed base of 2,132, they're spread across 1,718 sites.","Spencer Nam - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And then the -- in terms of these trade-ins with standards and Ss, how many of those are left out there? Can you guys -- do you guys have an estimate on that?","Calvin Darling","Yes. So on the standard side, we've got roughly 225 still remaining out in the field, of which about 100 are in the U.S. then on...","Spencer Nam - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","And then final question is, in terms of the customers who are picking up systems now, are they still focusing on prostatectomy and hysterectomy for the initial purchase, if you will? Or is it more broad nowadays that you guys have focused on a broad number of procedures out there?","Aleks Cukic","I think the answer is both or all of what you described. You can imagine if you do not own a single da Vinci system today that there is going to be support from a urologic group that has by -- by any count had some loss of patient volume. And GYN is growing at a pretty rapid rate. You are now starting to see other specialties or I should say you've been seeing other specialties, perhaps thoracic or general surgery to colorectal. Now with Single-Site, it will be interesting to see how some of those physicians weigh into the decision. But it is -- should be and has been considered a multi-specialty initiative, and that's the way our salespeople approach it.","Gary S. Guthart","That was our last question. As we've discussed with you over the years, while we spend our time on these calls reviewing our financial performance, our team remains sharply focused on the creation of patient value, improving the efficacy of surgery while reducing its invasiveness. I'd like to share with you a brief example of what this means in the lives of our patients. I'd like to share with you Cleave's story. \"I'm 51 years old. I was hurting in my lower stomach for a few months. I started passing a little blood, so my family said it was time to go to the doctor. So I went to see my regular doctor. And he said, \"You're 50, it's time to get a colonoscopy.\" So December 19, I had my colonoscopy. He told me there was a mass, and I wasn't sure you know that lingo, and he said it will be cancer. So the ball started rolling. Immediately, they referred me to an oncologist. We went in and we met with him, and he said he would be cutting me from the breastbone down and then over and then open me up. There would be 2 surgeons, 4 hands inside working. He said I would lose several pints of blood and that they may dislocate my pelvic bones. And when he started talking like this, I'm like, this doesn't sound right, this is too much. I've got too many years left, I don't like the odds. Meanwhile, my daughter was doing research. We were like, well, we see this da Vinci thing. We looked at the videos on the Internet, and we were like let's go talk to this guy. So we went to Dr. Hoss' [ph] office and he said, \"Yes, we can do this.\" I said, \"About how much blood are we talking about losing here?\" He said, \"Blood's not an issue.\" He said, \"You're a young guy. I'm going to do everything I can.\" So I came out of it. He took 12 to 13 inches of bowel out and put everything back together. My healing, as far as the procedure itself, my incisions and stuff, they healed up well. I've seen some people who've been cut, they get infections. And this was a scary thing for me, too, because I have a lot of years left. I've got a lot of stuff to do. And I think I've made a good decision.\"","Patients like these are the strongest advocates for da Vinci Surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you that we remain committed to driving a vital few things that truly make a difference. ","This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery, and we look forward to talking with you again in 3 months.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation and for using the AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"12690":["Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Senior Director of Finance, Investor Relations, Calvin Darling. Please go ahead.","Calvin Darling","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; and Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today\u2019s call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 4, 2019 and 10-Q filed on October 18, 2019. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC\u2019s website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.","Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Latest Events section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today\u2019s press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website.","Today\u2019s format will consist of providing you with highlights of our fourth quarter results, as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter\u2019s business and operational highlights, Marshall will provide a review of our fourth quarter financial results, then I will discuss procedures and clinical highlights and provide our financial outlook for 2020. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.","With that, I will turn it over to Gary.","Gary Guthart","Thank you for joining us today. At Intuitive, we measure our efforts by their ability to positively impact the quadruple aim; better outcomes, better patient experience, better care team experience, and lower total cost to treat per patient episode. This fourth quarter of 2019 was another strong one for Intuitive in pursuit of these aims, capping a good year for the company.","Our performance is reflected in healthy total growth and customer use of our systems, new capital installations, sustained quality service of our customers, clinical publications and the launch of new products and services.","For the quarter, global procedure growth was approximately 19%. Growth was led by general surgery in the United States, with positive contributions to the global growth rate from Japan, China, Germany and Korea.","Globally, customer utilization of systems increased again in the quarter, indicating greater productivity per installed system. Leasing and alternative placement models have also helped our customers gain access to additional procedure capacity with lower capital outlays.","In the United States, year-over-year procedure growth for the quarter was 18%. General surgery accounted for the largest increase accompanied by stable growth in urology and gynecology. Within general surgery, hernia repair, cholecystectomy, bariatric and colorectal surgery showed strength.","Outside the United States, several markets are early in their transition from growth in urology to other surgical categories, including gynecology, thoracic surgery and general surgery, with growth varying by country. Calvin will take you through global procedure dynamics in more detail later in the call.","With regard to our installed base, placement of new systems in the quarter was solid. We placed 336 systems in the quarter, with growth in total placements rising 16% from Q4 of 2018. Net of trade-ins and retirements, our da Vinci installed base grew to approximately 5,582.","The mix of system placements this quarter continues to favor our flagship Xi system and trade-ins were healthy. The proportion of systems placed under operating leases was 38% this quarter, compared with 33% last quarter. As a reminder, total placements and the percentage of systems placed under lease or usage-based arrangements can vary substantially quarter-to-quarter.","Over the past several years, we\u2019ve been working to enable greater access to our products and services. For example, we believe leasing and usage-based models benefit our customers by lowering barriers for them to provide high-quality computer-aided interventions. We anticipate continuing to expand access and lower cost for our customers as our business progresses into different procedures and geographies.","Turning to expenses. We believe we are still in the early days of computer-aided surgery and acute interventions. As a result, we\u2019re investing in building our capability in several important ways, including deepening internationally, launching our new platforms, strengthening our computational capabilities, and executing projects that support future scale and provide leverage opportunities as we grow.","Our spending for the quarter and for the year was within the upper-end of spend guidance we shared with you in 2019. It is supported by solid procedure growth, capital placements and product cost reductions.","Financial highlights of our fourth quarter results are as follows: Procedures grew approximately 19% over the fourth quarter last year. We placed 336 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 290 in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our installed base grew 12% from a year ago. Revenue for the quarter was approximately $1.3 billion, up 22%. Pro forma gross profit margin was 72.2%, compared to 71.8% in the fourth quarter last year.","Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $671 million, up 24%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $896 million, growing 24% over Q4 of 2018 and representing 70% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $506 million in the quarter, up 23% from the fourth quarter of last year, and pro forma net income was $417 million, up 18%.","Highlights for the full-year of 2019 are as follows. Procedures grew approximately 18% over 2018; we placed 1,119 systems in the year, growing the installed base 12% over 2018; revenue for the year was approximately $4.5 billion, growing 20% over 2018; and pro forma net income was approximately $1.5 billion, up 17% over 2018.","Turning to progress in our innovation pipeline, I\u2019ll start first with systems. We\u2019re in our Phase 1 launch of da Vinci SP and we are working to expand its clinical clearances and build SP products at scale. In the quarter, we installed six systems to bring our installed base of SP to 244. Customer response and early clinical results using SP remain encouraging, with over 50 peer-reviewed clinical articles on SP to date.","With regard to additional indications for SP, we\u2019ve been in discussion with FDA regarding data requirements for a colorectal indication. We expect this to require an IDE trial that includes follow-up analysis. This implies, we do not expect the third indication for SP in the U.S. in 2020. While I would like a faster launch of SP, the combination of additional indications for SP and our readiness for deployment at larger scale, will pace the speed of our SP commercial expansion.","In flexible diagnostics, our Ion platform is focused on the need for accurate and timely biopsies to support definitive early diagnosis of suspicious lesions. As of the end of the quarter, there are approximately 16 systems in the field, some commercial and some clinical trial sites with several hundred procedures performed.","To date, the roll out is meeting our expectations and user feedback during this initial launch period has been strong. We expect several publications reviewing the performance of Ion to be presented during 2020.","Turning to instruments and accessories. Our team has been making great progress in building out our instrument portfolio with high-quality products. Our experience has shown that procedure adoption occurs when holistic \u2013 when the holistic needs of the care team are met, when the right system and imaging products come together with the right instruments and accessories.","Our team initiated our first phase launch in the quarter for our SynchroSeal sealing and transection device, along with our first integrated energy controller called E-100. SynchroSeal seal provide surgeons with wristed precise and fast sealing and transection ability often used in general surgery. Early feedback on its performance has been outstanding. SynchroSeal seal joins our portfolio of advanced instruments, stapling instruments and advanced energy instruments that customers are now adopting in their da Vinci cases.","Turning to imaging and analytics. We\u2019re working on imaging, computing and real-time cloud techniques that allowed for capabilities from big data analytics to telementoring to augmented reality. Here alone, Intuitive Surgical simulators have been used for over 17,000 hours by more than 5,800 surgeons.","Our IRIS augmented reality system entered clinical use in the fourth quarter of 2019, and we\u2019re pleased with our first customer responses. Over the past several years, our analytical capability has increased, and we now routinely engage our customers to help assess the performance of their robotic-assisted surgery programs relative to other surgical modalities.","Armed with local comparative analysis of robotic-assisted surgery within their institutions, hospitals with active programs have been building access to da Vinci systems in growing their programs. We expect continued investment and progress in these areas in 2020.","As we move into 2020, let\u2019s step back and review the da Vinci surgery universe. In the past several years, general surgeons have increased their adoption of our offerings, underpinned by improvements in the quadruple aim and procedures they perform from hernia repair, cholecystectomy and colorectal surgery to bariatric surgery. These surgical procedures span a broad range of complexity and economics. At the same time, Intuitive continues to deepen our capability in key countries to support the adoption of robotic-assisted surgery in their healthcare environments.","We are flexing our company to better serve these customers, with the launch of new systems, new instruments and updates to our software, along with changes to our sales and support models and pricing structures.","Given the large global opportunity to pursue the quadruple aim, I believe the next few years for the company will be dynamic. We will guide the company to meet our customers\u2019 clinical and economic needs across this wide range of procedures and geographies. Doing so will involve continued investment in innovation in both technology and business models, and we see a path to do both.","Moving into 2020, we are focused on the following First, supporting adoption of da Vinci in general surgery, including hernia repair, colorectal procedures and bariatrics; second, launching our SP Ion imaging instruments and analytics platforms; third, extending our depth in OUS markets, particularly Asia and EU with growth beyond urology; and finally, supporting additional clinical and economic validation in our focused procedures and countries.","Lastly, we are pleased to publish today our inaugural quarter sustainability report, which you can find on our website, outlining our multi-year efforts in these areas.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marshall, who\u2019ll review financial highlights.","Marshall Mohr","Good afternoon. I would describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website.","Revenue and procedures are consistent with our preliminary press release of January 9. Key business metrics for the fourth quarter were as follows. Fourth quarter 2019 procedures increased approximately 19% compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 and increased approximately 11% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth continues to be driven by general surgery in the U.S. and urology worldwide. Calvin will review details of procedure growth later in this call.","Fourth quarter system placements of 336 systems increased 16%, compared with 290 systems last year, and increased 22%, compared with 275 systems last quarter. We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems by 12% to approximately 5,582 systems. This growth rate compares with 12% in the last quarter and 13% last year. Utilization of clinical systems in the field measured by procedures per system grew approximately 6%, which is the same as the 6% growth last quarter and last year.","Our revenue overview is as follows. Fourth quarter 2019 revenue was $1.3 billion, an increase of 22%, compared with $1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of 13%, compared with $1.1 billion last quarter. Instrument and accessory revenue of $671 million increased 24% compared with last year, which is higher than procedure growth, primarily reflecting customer buying patterns and increased usage of our advanced instruments.","Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure was approximately $1,980, an increase of 5% compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 and was consistent with last quarter. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure has grown in the low single digits over the past couple of years, reflecting increased usage of our advanced instruments, partially offset by higher growth and benign procedures, where revenue per procedure is lower than the overall average.","While adoption of benign procedures has been a major contributor to the overall I&A revenue, to the extent, benign procedures grow faster than complex procedures, I&A per procedure may decline. In addition, over time, as we achieve greater penetration of our advanced instruments in da Vinci procedures, the growth rate for advanced instruments will slow and align with the growth rate of underlying procedures in which advanced instruments are used.","Systems revenue for the fourth quarter 2019 was $416 million, an increase of 22% compared with the fourth quarter of 2018, and an increase of 23% compared with last quarter. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2018, systems revenue reflected higher system placements, higher ASPs and higher lease-related revenue.","We completed 126 operating lease transactions, representing 38% of total placements, compared with 84% or 29% of total placements in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 92% or 33% of total placements last quarter.","As of December 31, we have 658 operating leases outstanding and realized approximately $34 million from revenues related to these arrangements in the quarter, compared with $16 million last year and $27 million last quarter.","Operating leases create a future source of recurring revenue and reduce the volatility of system revenue, while the increased number of operating systems, operating leases placed in the quarter dampens short-term revenue growth for the quarter in which they are placed.","Operating leases include usage-based financings that we provided to certain hospitals with advanced robotics experience. We believe that our lease financing alternatives align with customer objectives and have enabled faster market adoption.","Relative to systems purchased over the lease period, we earn a small premium, reflecting the time value of money. And in the case of usage-based arrangements, the risks that those systems may not achieve anticipated usage levels. The proportion of operating lease and usage-based arrangements will likely increase long-term and will vary quarter-to-quarter.","We recognize $34 million of lease buyout revenue in the fourth quarter, compared with $20 million last quarter and $17 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly from quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. 138 or 41% of current quarter system placements involved trade-ins, reflecting customer desire to access or standardize on our fourth generation technology, contributing to an Xi installed base growth of 39% year-over-year. This is an increase compared with 81 or 28% of system placements in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 116 or 42% last quarter.","Trade-in activity can fluctuate and can be difficult to predict. However, given prior product trade-in cycles, we expect the proportion of the installed base traded in in future quarters to decrease over time. 81% of the systems placed in the quarter were da Vinci Xis and 16% were da Vinci X systems, compared with 79% da Vinci Xis and 17% da Vinci Xs last quarter.","Six of the systems placed in the quarter \u2013 fourth quarter were SP systems. Our roll out of SP Surgical System will continue to be measured, putting systems in a hand of experienced da Vinci users, while we optimize training pathways in our supply chain.","We placed seven Ion systems in the quarter. Ion system placements are excluded from our overall systems count and will be reported separately. Procedures and other information associated with Ion are excluded from our prepared remarks and will be reported separately when it become more substantive.","Globally, our average selling price, which excludes the impact of operating lease revenue and lease buyout was approximately $1.61 million, compared with $1.46 million last year and $1.57 million last quarter.","Our fourth quarter ASPs reflect a favorable geographic mix, as we sold 39 systems into China and 26 into Japan, where ASPs are higher, given the higher cost of doing business in those geographies. Excluding geographic mix, ASPs for the quarter declined slightly relative to the third quarter, reflecting pricing arrangements associated with a higher mix of multisystem contracts. System ASPs will fluctuate with geographic consistent mix and may decline relative to the average total 2019 ASP, reflecting increased multisystem arrangements.","Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. OUS procedures grew approximately 22% compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 and increased 9% compared with last quarter. Fourth quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $422 million, increased 37% compared with fourth quarter of 2018 and increased 27% compared with last quarter.","The increase compared with the prior year reflects increased instruments and accessories revenue of $47 million, or 39% growth and increased systems revenue of $58 million, or 42% growth. The increase in instrument and accessory revenue was primarily driven by procedure growth and stocking orders associated with China system sales. The increase in systems revenue is primarily the result of increased placements and increased ASPs, reflecting favorable geographic and product mix.","Outside of the U.S., we placed 140 systems in the fourth quarter, compared with 115 in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 90 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 54 into Europe, 26 into Japan and 39 into China, compared with 55 into Europe, 31 into Japan and two into China in the fourth quarter of 2018. 71% of the systems placed in the quarter were da Vinci Xis and 24% were da Vinci X systems, compared with 55% da Vinci Xis and 30% da Vinci Xs last year. 32 of the system placements in the current quarter were operating leases, compared with 15 last year and 21 last quarter.","The 39 systems into China included customers who had begun their tender processes and we believe expedited their purchase cycles to avoid a tariff increase that was expected on December 15. The proposed tariff was suspended on December 13. We would expect remaining purchases under the quarter to be completed consistent with historical timelines. And therefore, we expect placement \u2013 placements to be lower in the first quarter and skew more towards the end of 2020 and into 2021.","While overall European system placements were relatively flat in the quarter and for 2019, shipments by country fluctuate significantly. Placements into the four largest European markets increased 29% in the fourth quarter and 19% for the year. Overall, placements outside of the U.S. will continue to vary as some of the OUS markets are in early stages of adoption; some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns; and sales into some markets are constrained by government limitations.","Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 72.2%, compared with 71.8% for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 72% last quarter. The increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 and last quarter, primarily reflects higher system ASPs and product cost reductions. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, mix of systems and instrument and accessory revenue, system ASPs and our ability to further reduce product costs and improve manufacturing efficiency.","Pro forma operating expenses increased 23% compared with the fourth quarter 2018 and increased 19% compared with last quarter. Spending is consistent with their plan and includes an order of magnitude of increase, costs associated with expansion of our OUS markets, spending on our imaging and analytics capabilities and investment in our infrastructure in order to scale the business.","We believe we have a unique opportunity to expand the benefits of computer-aided surgery and acute interventions around the world and have been and will continue to invest in the business accordingly.","Our pro forma tax rate for the quarter was 21.1%, compared with our expectations of 19% to 20%, reflecting geographic mix. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of one-time items.","Our fourth quarter 2019 pro forma net income was $417 million, or $3.48 per share, compared with $353 million, or $2.96 per share for the fourth quarter 2018 and $409 million, or $3.43 per share for last quarter.","I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $358 million, or $2.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with GAAP net income of $293 million, or $2.45 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018 and GAAP net income of $397 million, or $3.33 per share for last quarter.","The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation and IP charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition-related items and legal settlements.","We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $5.8 billion, compared with $5.4 billion at September 30, 2019. The cash generated from operations was partially offset by investments in working capital and infrastructure during the quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter and year are higher than historical averages as we invest in our infrastructure. We expect investments in our infrastructure to continue into 2020.","In the quarter, we grew inventory by approximately $16 million to $596 million, representing approximately 142 days of inventory, which is slightly lower than at the end of the third quarter. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter and have approximately $1.7 billion remaining under the Board buyback authorization.","In summary, I want to highlight certain business dynamics that may impact your models. First, as I noted, we will grow operating expenses appropriately, as we see the substantial opportunity to expand the benefits of computer-aided surgery and acute interventions. Calvin will provide you with operating expense growth guidance.","In addition, as we align to our \u2013 with our customer needs, we believe the percentage of leasing and alternative financing arrangements will increase over time. We also believe the number of trade-in transactions will level off in the short-term and then decline over time.","System ASPs will fluctuate with geographic and system mix and may decline relative to the average total 2019 ASP, reflecting increased multisystem arrangements. While adoption of benign procedures has been a major contributor to overall I&A revenue, to the extent, benign procedures grow faster than complex procedures, the I&A per procedure may decline.","Lastly, it\u2019s likely we will see elongated negotiation timelines and possibly price pressures as competition gets closer to launching their products. We will continue doing to manage the business for the long-term, as we believe that the fundamentals of the business are strong.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Calvin, who go over procedure performance and our outlook for 2020.","Calvin Darling","Thank you, Marshall. Our overall fourth quarter procedure growth was approximately 19%, compared to 19% during the fourth quarter of 2018 and nearly 20% last quarter. Our Q4 procedure growth was driven by 18% growth in U.S. procedures and 22% growth in OUS markets. Overall, procedure growth for the full-year 2019 was approximately 18%, equal to 18% of 2018, comprised of 17% growth in the U.S. and 21% growth in OUS markets.","In the U.S., Q4 procedure growth was consistent with recent trends and was largely driven by continued strength in general surgery, with substantive contributions from gynecologic and urologic procedures. In U.S. general surgery, fourth quarter growth and leading procedures, hernia repair and colorectal remain solid at rates consistent with last quarter.","Cholecystectomy growth continued to accelerate in the fourth quarter and now represents a significant driver of incremental procedures. While da Vinci cholecystectomy adoption has been robust, given the high-level of lab penetration, it is difficult for us to predict the extent and pace of future chole adoption. Bariatric procedures also showed continued solid growth in Q4 and will become an increasing area of field focus for us in 2020.","For the full-year 2019, approximately 421,000 U.S. general surgery procedures were performed, up 29% from 2018, representing approximately 48% of overall U.S. da Vinci procedures.","Q4 U.S. gynecology procedure growth was largely consistent with the first three quarters of 2019. For the full-year 2019, approximately 282,000 U.S. gynecologic surgery procedures were performed, up 6% from 2018, representing approximately 32% of overall U.S. procedures. In U.S. urology, fourth quarter dVP growth rates continue to exceed our expectations, although growth did moderate from Q3.","For the full-year 2019, approximately 138,000 U.S. urologic procedures were performed, up just under 10% from 2018, representing approximately 16% of overall us da Vinci procedures. As a highly penetrated procedure category, we believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes should track to the broader prostate surgery market and will likely grow more modestly in 2020.","Fourth quarter OUS procedure volume grew approximately 22%, compared with 24% for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 23% last quarter. Fourth quarter 2019 OUS procedure growth was driven by continued growth in urology procedures and earlier stage growth in general, gynecologic and thoracic surgery.","In China, as in Q3, procedure growth accelerated modestly, as new systems installed under the latest system quota began to provide capacity for incremental growth. In Q4, the China procedure growth rate slightly exceeded the overall OUS metric.","As Marshall mentioned, 39 systems were shipped into China in Q4. Note that 35 of these 39 systems went to new hospitals. Teams in these hospitals will need to move through training pathways and establish da Vinci procedure processes before these new systems contribute meaningfully to procedure growth in China.","In Japan, procedure growth was again strong at just over 40%, reflecting growth in procedures granted reimbursement status in April 2018 and continued later-stage growth in urology procedures. Our emphasis in Japan remains on surgeon and team training and building proctoring networks.","Overall, European procedure growth was largely consistent with prior periods with variation by country. German results were particularly strong, while results in the UK lag.","Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years.","A recent article by Drs. Wexner and Emile et al in the Journal of Techniques in Coloproctology provided results from a systemic review and meta analysis of intracorporeal versus extracorporeal anastomosis in minimally invasive Right Colectomy. This study analyzed data from 25 studies and 4,450 patients.","Intracorporeal anastomosis was associated with significantly shorter length extraction site incisions, earlier bowel recovery, fewer complications and lower rates of conversion anastomotic leaks, surgical site infections and incisional hernia, as compared to extracorporeal anastomosis.","This study highlighted the many clinical outcome advantages associated with intracorporeal anastomosis. da Vinci systems, instruments and smart stapling technology enabling performing an anastomosis of the bowel inside the body. And it is our hope that more patients can benefit from intracorporeal anastomosis with continued adoption of our technology.","Intuitive investment in a prospective multicenter intracorporeal versus extracorporeal anastomosis study comparing robotic versus laparoscopic approaches, called the ANCHOR study, is timely. And the enrollment for this study is expected to be completed this year, with results expected in 2021. The details of the ANCHOR study are available online at clinicaltrials.gov.","I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2020. Starting with procedures. As described in our announcement earlier this month, total 2019 da Vinci procedures grew approximately 18% to roughly 1,229,000 procedures performed worldwide.","As communicated previously, during 2020, we anticipate full-year procedure growth within a range of 13% to 16%. We expect 2020 procedure growth to continue to be driven by U.S. general surgery and procedures outside the United States, where we\u2019re at earlier stages of adoption.","We expect similar seasonal timing of procedures in 2019, as we have experienced in previous years, with Q1 being the seasonally weakest quarter as patient deductibles are reset. Q1 and full-year 2020 will benefit from one extra working day attributable to leap year.","With respect to revenue. As we have mentioned previously, capital sales are ultimately driven by procedure demand, catalyzing hospitals to establish or expand robotic system capacity. Capital sales can vary substantially from period-to-period based upon many factors, including U.S. healthcare policy, hospital capital spending cycles, reimbursement and government quotas, product cycles, economic cycles and competitive factors. Within this framework, we\u2019d expect 2020 capital placements seasonality to generally follow historical patterns by quarter.","During the fourth quarter of 2019, 126 of the 336 systems shift or 38% were under operating leases. We expect the proportion of systems placed to be operating leases will vary from quarter-to-quarter and could trend up in the future.","During Q3 and Q4, 42% and 41%, respectively, of systems placements were upgrades to our Gen 4 platform. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect the proportion of trade-in transactions to generally trend downwards in 2020.","Turning to gross profit. Our full-year 2019 pro forma gross profit margin was 71.7%. In 2020, we expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71% of net revenue. The slightly lower gross profit margin anticipated in 2020 reflects higher sales of newer products and infrastructure investments. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter, depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions.","Turnings to operating expenses. In 2019, our pro forma operating expenses grew 27%. In 2020, we expect pro forma operating expenses to grow between 15% and 20%. We expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $400 million and $440 million in 2020, compared to $336 million in 2019. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $100 million and $115 million in 2020.","With regard to income tax. In 2019, our pro forma income tax rate was 19.5%. As we look forward, we estimate our 2020 pro forma tax rate to be between 20% and 21% of pre-tax income, with the increase primarily reflecting the anticipated geographic mix of pre-tax income.","That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Lewis","Great. Good afternoon. Just two questions for me. Gary, I want to start with you first on chole. It\u2019s probably your largest procedure set in terms of volume, two sequential quarters of acceleration within chole, obviously, still very low penetration.","Historically, that was tied to sort of trainings, physicians would use chole as a way of training a broader general surgery procedures. But can you just talk about the last two quarters\u2019 acceleration in procedure? Do you think that\u2019s simply training, a leading indicator of general surgery, or do you think something is going on in distinct from that within broader chole? And a quick follow-up.","Gary Guthart","Okay. On the first one, just I\u2019m going to put a posted note on the assumption of its size relative to everything else. I\u2019ll let Calvin come back and put it in context size-wise in terms of current run rate. But the underlying question of what are we seeing in cholecystectomy? We think there\u2019s a segment there, where we\u2019re bringing differentiated clinical value could be underlying clinical elements like obesity, comorbidities, state of disease of the gallbladder.","So while it\u2019s a large category as a whole, generally well-served by minimally invasive surgery today. There are segments in it that are difficult and for which we think current product sets do really well. There\u2019s also a set of training or people deepening their experience as they go through it.","So there\u2019s a mix of those two. We think there is a durable component segmenting out how big that is over time. We\u2019re still working through, where we think those endpoints are. We have seen it both grow in the last few quarters and appear to be sticky, not to have be a transient. Calvin, in terms of kind of setting in context relative to other procedures.","Calvin Darling","No, I mean, the size of the market, you can tell from our commentary, it\u2019s gotten to the point where general surgery is a meaningful enough category. It\u2019s a more and more significant contributor to growth within the general surgery category that\u2019s growing overall. Again, as we mentioned, the commentary, it\u2019s hard for us to gauge given the high lab penetration there to what extent and what pace it may ultimately adopt.","David Lewis","Okay. And then just curious, second question for me is just on the capital environment. Your fourth quarter U.S. net placement growth was a little lower and Europe in 2019 was little lower on a net placement basis. Maybe just comment an underlying demand for systems in the U.S. and the European markets. And also curious if has, in any respect, has competitors introducing new systems or talking about their new systems more publicly? Has it in anyway impacted demand or changed the conversation you\u2019re having with large IDNs in the U.S. or European customers? Thanks so much.","Gary Guthart","On the outline of the first question, you sort of think about what the installed base growth was. So if you think about capital demand underneath, there\u2019s what\u2019s happening to installed base. So opening additional capacity in various places or trade-ins of older generation systems.","I\u2019ll let Marshall speak to the quantitative nature of your question with regard to the U.S. and in Europe. But I\u2019d say, there is something \u2013 there\u2019s some trade-in dynamics that I think the team has been discussing with you the last couple of quarters. In general, I think, we\u2019re feeling like it\u2019s reasonably stable.","On the second piece of what will competitive advertising and conversation do. From time-to-time, we see delay deals. We definitely see increasing conversations as they get closer to market with what they want to do or other companies are starting to get some clearances in other regions.","In general, our teams have handled that pretty well. But I think the noise level will increase. I think that customers are interested in listening to other pitches. I think we\u2019re pretty well-positioned to have a conversation about that. But I do see delay from time-to-time. It kind of comes in waves and then it\u2019ll settle as the world figures out kind of what they\u2019re offering.","But Marshall, maybe a little bit on \u2013 a little more quantitative answer than that.","Marshall Mohr","Yes. First, the capital environment has been approximately the same. There haven\u2019t been much in terms of change in motives and so forth over the last several quarters. The number of systems that we placed in the U.S., which is disclosed on the \u2013 in the web \u2013 website is what is healthy in our view. In fact, what you \u2013 the other way we measure honestly, how well we\u2019re doing is the utilization of systems and utilization of systems growth, as I said, was 6%, which is consistent with where it\u2019s been.","And in Europe, we saw, as I said, maybe flattish number of systems place, both in the quarter as well as compared to the previous year in total. And just be aware of averages and it\u2019s going to be lumpy. When you\u2019re in earlier stages of adoption in less mature markets, you\u2019re going to see a lumpiness to placements of capital. When we look at the four largest markets, we saw nice growth, which, again, as Calvin commented, procedure growth in Germany was strong, and we saw nice placements in Germany, for example. Does that help?","David Lewis","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tycho Peterson","Hey, thanks. I\u2019ll start with SP. Just curious following your discussions with FDA, any color you can provide on just when the trial is going to start size and what\u2019s expected for follow-up analysis? And then outside the U.S., you\u2019re obviously generating data on SP and thoracic and OSA and Korea. Can just talk about some of the data generations outside the U.S. as well?","Gary Guthart","Sure. On the first one, I think, we\u2019re settling in on what the trial will look like in and I\u2019m not ready yet to answer that, but I think we\u2019re getting close. So in future quarters, we should be able to answer that question.","With regard to what we\u2019re seeing elsewhere, we\u2019re starting to see in terms of Korea, where we have more regulatory room and clinical indications. We\u2019ll start seeing a whole series of publications coming out talking about where there\u2019s opportunity. And it\u2019s, I think going to be quite interesting and shows real potential for us. It\u2019s the thing that drives our underlying commitment and excitement.","I don\u2019t have them at the tip of my fingers. I do know that in future quarters, we will start describing to you what the substance of some of these publications are as they start to release.","Tycho Peterson","And then just sticking with pipeline for a minute, can you just comment on IRIS, where we are in the roll out, it\u2019s obviously early days? And then also if you could just comment separately on the Scholly Endoscope acquisition and have you worked the supply chain headwinds there?","Gary Guthart","Great. I\u2019ll do so. IRIS, first couple of accounts up and running, we expect more this quarter. It\u2019s really testing the whole order to delivery pipeline. Think of that as a digital pipeline that has to go through. Feedback is really encouraging. So this early part of \u2013 it\u2019s one of these things that\u2019s easy to describe, but to do well is hard, making sure all your cloud connections are right, making sure you have all your security protocols done, getting the turnaround times, right, getting your all your machine learning algorithms right.","Feedback has been really good about its ability to help surgeons visualize pre-case, which is fantastic, using other kinds of ways in terms of patient consultation and then access during the case. So the kind of the core idea, I think, is being vetted nicely. We have said before, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a significant revenue driver in 2020.","I think I would encourage people to think about this as baseline core technology that kinds of things that as you develop systems like this in the future that customers will come to expect a little bit like our Firefly product. It is additive in the way that it \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 the system itself becomes greater than the sum of its parts. So IRIS, I think looks quite strong.","On the Scholly acquisition, the team is doing a really nice job. We were right to bring it in. We were right bring it in when we did. That is doing a couple of things for us. It\u2019s giving us a little more alignment around next gen products, which is exciting for us. It\u2019s helping us double down on some investments in terms of capacity and efficiency that goes with that capacity. And it will, in the medium term, start releasing some profitability and financing with regard to the way we produce our endoscopes that can be turned around and reinvested in the business.","So far so good. It is real work. They are in a very good team. I think we knew what we were bringing in and acquiring. I\u2019m really pleased with the leadership of the group and our team members that have joined us in Germany and in Boston or in Massachusetts. It\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t work to be done, but so far, so good.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then one last clarification from Marshall. You called out a china pull forward dynamic around the tariff. Can you just \u2013 in the context of the 39 systems, are you able to quantify how much of that was tied to the tariff?","Marshall Mohr","Well, not \u2013 I can\u2019t quantify specifically. I would just tell you that there were a number of systems that the customers decided to expedite the process and we were the beneficiary of that obviously.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","All right. Our next question will come from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Robert Hopkins","Great. Thank you. Just first quick question on the I&A [Technical Difficulty] case, you highlighted some tailwind, potential headwinds that called out that revenue per pace could decline next year?","Gary Guthart","Hey, Bob, we\u2019ve heard some \u2013 you got yourself broken, yes, kind of broken up on the call. So could you reask the question?","Robert Hopkins","Sorry about that. Just on instrument and accessory, I just want to make sure I hear the messaging, because there\u2019s some positives and positives. I probably thought it could decline [Technical Difficulty] stapling. I just want to share the messaging on the I&A line for the next 12 months?","Gary Guthart","Yes. So what I said, Bob, was, we\u2019ve really seen good contribution to I&A revenue overall from benign procedures. But as we\u2019ve described before, the increase in the I&A per procedure is really a reflection of additional advanced instrument revenue and then a per procedure, offset by benign procedure growth.","So all I\u2019m calling out is if we\u2019re successful in growing benign procedures much faster than complex procedures, then you will see \u2013 then it will win the tug-of-war and therefore, your I&A per procedure might decline.","On the advanced instruments, we\u2019ve enjoyed further penetration into the procedures in which advanced instruments are used. And as that has occurred, then our revenue associated with procedures, our revenue per procedure has grown disproportionately to the number of procedures.","Over time, as you penetrate that, then you will revert to your advanced technology growth will be consistent with the number of additional procedures you add versus adding also incremental procedures that were previously not including it. So all we\u2019re saying is that, there\u2019s the potential that the growth rate will decline. We still expect growth just a lower rate.","Robert Hopkins","Okay, thank you. And then quick question on U.S. capital. Over the last couple of years, the growth in procedures per average system has been remarkably consistent at about 5%, especially in the U.S. Is there a reason in your view why that number might change meaningfully in 2020, or is that a \u2013 that trend line expected to continue?","Gary Guthart","No. I think, directionally, continued growth in procedures per system is something we would expect. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re actively working with customers, sharing analytics and data to help them to make their practices programs as efficient as they can be. So I think, the trend, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to continue in exactly at the same rates, but increasing utilization is something we would expect.","Robert Hopkins","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Larry Biegelsen","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Hopefully, you guys can hear me okay. Just one on Ion and then one on the P&L. How should we think about the ramp of Ion in 2020? Is it still going to be a controlled launch? Should we just expect a steady increase in placements? And I had one follow-up.","Gary Guthart","As we\u2019ve said in our prepared remarks, Ion is in the early stages of a measured launch. And so you should expect that it will grow slowly over time.","Calvin Darling","And slowly through 2020 and\u2026","Gary Guthart","Yes.","Calvin Darling","\u2026and then more rapidly thereafter.","Larry Biegelsen","I got it. And gross margins came in better in 2019 versus your original guidance. What are the puts and takes on the gross margin in 2020? And separately, Gary, R&D as a percentage of sales has been increasing steadily. It\u2019s almost 10% of sales in 2019. Where do you see that going over time? Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Gary Guthart","Okay, sure. So for gross margins, the gives and takes are, as I outlined in my prepared remarks, pricing on systems, reductions in cost, manufacturing efficiency and mix, mix of both customers and types of product. And I think that what we\u2019re messaging for next year is that, the gross margins will decline slightly, reflecting primarily product mix and a shift \u2013 the effect of new product and investments in the infrastructure.","Larry Biegelsen","And R&D, Marshall as a percent of sales? Maybe I\u2019m just curious if you expect that to continue to increase? Sorry, Gary?","Gary Guthart","Yes. I know I can jump in and take that one. I think about \u2013 we haven\u2019t grown R&D as a percentage of sales pretty consistently over the last three years. And our messaging to you has been, we\u2019re going to bring a couple of new platforms to market in parallel with some of our multiport efforts SP and Ion being those two that we think that next gen imaging and non-optical imaging is important, non-white light imaging is important, and we\u2019ve been investing in that domain.","We have been investing for scale. We\u2019ve talked about the fact that, I think, there\u2019s a virtuous cycle here, which is, as utilization goes up and volumes go up, it allows us to start taking advantage of automation opportunities and changing the way we manufacture. That has taken the company to be a little more capital-intensive than in years past.","But some of the things you were just talking about, the linkage to your prior question on gross margin are enabled by these capital investments on multi-year timelines that allow us to get production scale advantages. And that allows us to share some of that cost savings with our customer and be able to be into lower complexity procedures at good economics and good economics for the company, as well as the customer. So we\u2019ve been doing that as well.","And then lastly, it\u2019s been building in digital infrastructure. So those are the major buckets that have been taking the R&D spend side. I think we are not thinking that number will leap going forward. But we also think we\u2019re still in the early innings of a baseball game here that that have real opportunity long-term for growth of the market. And we think that we can position ourselves really well by making sure that those four buckets are adequately staffed. Marshall\u2026","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks for taking the question.","Gary Guthart","Okay.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Rick Wise","Good afternoon, Gary, everybody. You talked \u2013 Marshall mentioned it, I think, Calvin mentioned it that system trade-ins may slow, may trend down. I just want to make sure that I\u2019m understanding the reasons why. Is it the lack of a major new next gen system launch? And so you\u2019ve seen the trade-ins that quote, the easy trade-ins.","And maybe just as part of that, Gary, just reflecting back on R&D and innovation, obviously, you\u2019re launching a lot of new products and innovation. But should we be thinking that there you don\u2019t need to launch next gen big Ion, or how do we think about that those two aspects of trade-ins and the pipeline?","Gary Guthart","So trade-ins, we\u2019ve been in the middle of a fairly strong cycle of trade-ins and you\u2019ve seen it go up quarter-over-quarter, last two quarters kind of flattening out. And what we commented on at the end of the third quarter, Rick, was that the total population of SIs that are out there that can be traded in obviously is decreasing as customers trade-in their systems. And so the population is decreasing.","And when we look back at historical patterns for previous generation products, we think that we\u2019re at the peak of how much of that remaining days will be traded in in any particular quarter. And so the two of those things lead us to the conclusion that you\u2019ll see a decrease in the number of trade-ins as we go forward.","The second-half of the question, I might quibble with the description is big Ion, so I\u2019m not going to own that. But I will talk to innovation in multiport. We\u2019re not done any innovating in multiport. We\u2019re often asked, are you \u2013 I see SP, I see Ion, is that it? The answer is categorically no. We think there\u2019s room for additional innovation beyond our gen 4 multiport products and we\u2019re working on those things.","Rick Wise","All right. And just two other quick ones. I\u2019d be curious to hear more about sales force productivity. You highlighted, Gary, the improved productivity in the third quarter, it seems like that\u2019s part \u2013 has to be part of the equation, I\u2019m guessing in the fourth quarter. How do we think about that factor as a driver in 2020?","And I\u2019ll just ask my second one. Your competitors are \u2013 or potential robotic competitors are talking about digital surgery, and we\u2019ve talked about this before. But I just wonder if you have competitors marketing something called digital surgery, how do we imagine intuitive answering that kind of a functional or marketing push? Thank you so much.","Gary Guthart","Okay. On the first question, the sales force productivity, we saw a move in the right direction in the fourth quarter, some of the underlying dynamics in terms of rapid procedure growth or healthy procedure growth driving the need for new territories still exists.","So I credit our sales leadership team is doing a really nice job, both managing growth and helping the organization become more productive while thinking through territory opportunities, as well as efficiency opportunities. That\u2019s a long way of saying we made a step in the right direction. I think they have opportunity to keep moving in the right direction in terms of productivity. So far, so good.","With regard to some of the commentary around digital surgery, I \u2013 the short answer is welcome to the party. I think that we\u2019ve been working these issues for more than a decade. As I said before, my initial response is, it\u2019s a valuable thing to be working on, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been doing it. We\u2019ve been the Internet of Things in surgical robots for a decade, cloud-enabled for a decade. We are quite deep.","As you go out and talk a little more than the tagline, you talk about what tag lines are, what\u2019s the substance? So dig down a little bit and the substance comes down to, I think, four opportunities. One opportunity is in the use of big data for analytic power. And that says that, as you look across large sets of customers doing various things, can you help establish benchmarks that people can improve upon, and we have done that. It\u2019s been something we\u2019ve been working on. So I think we\u2019re becoming quite skilled and will become more so. That\u2019s one category.","Another category is the use of computing power in real-time to aid the surgeon or interventionalist during a case to get a better outcome. And absolutely interesting. There are many, many companies in the world that are thinking about that and making progress and we are one of them. Ion is fundamentally powered by computing to help you make good decisions. IRIS is fundamentally a real-time computing capability in addition to big data. So that\u2019s one.","The next bucket is around education and the reduction of variation team to team. We know that care team variation in any acute intervention, be it surgery, robotic surgery, laparoscopy is highly variable. And the use of computing and analytics to help that process is clear.","And I talked to you a little bit about how much we have in simulation 200,000 simulated tasks done by surgeons this last year, 17,000 hours of simulation capability. These are things that we can help turn into better learning environments and reduction in care team variation.","And the last bucket is efficiency improvement. The use of computing technologies and networking to help hospitals become more productive and to help our company become more productive, and we\u2019re leveraging those opportunities on both of our customers and otherwise.","So I look forward to the conversation. I think it will win. The winner won\u2019t be the tagline. I think the winner will be those who deliver real value that\u2019s validated against those four categories.","Rick Wise","Thank you so much.","Gary Guthart","We\u2019ll take one more question, operator.","Operator","Okay. That final question, one moment please. That final question will come from the line of Richard Newitter with SVB. Please go ahead.","Richard Newitter","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two quick ones. The first, I\u2019ll ask them both just right upfront. The first one, the comments on cholecystectomy as a training procedure and kind of what you\u2019re seeing there as a spillover to, again, a couple of other general surgery. Are you seeing that same dynamic increase in the usage or the utilization within hernia as kind of a like a training ground for other types of general surgeries, or is hernia kind of also equally as sticky?","And then the second question, just, Marshall, on the I&A per case, if the benign growth does accelerate relative to the advanced type cases, what\u2019s the impact to gross margin there? Thank you.","Gary Guthart","Well, I\u2019ll take the first one. I\u2019ll let Marshall take the second one. One thing I would just to be clear on general surgery is, general surgery is a quite a diverse set of procedures with quite a diverse set of practice patterns amongst general surgeon practitioners or practices.","I \u2013 first of all, I think they choose procedures to do not simply to be trained, because \u2013 but because they think they and the patient can be benefited by that procedure. So I don\u2019t think they run off and train for the sake of training, I think they decide that there\u2019s some value here. They will sequence their way into a practice and that would make sense, both by patient selection and by the type of procedure they do.","You would ask, does the same kind of effect of, well, let\u2019s start with the right patient population for cholecystectomy also apply to something like hernia? The answer to that is yes. Some surgeons will elect to go into a hernia set first. Then if they find value in the product, find value in the process, they may elect to move from there to a different procedure. Interestingly, we found that there is not a one size fits all way that a practice adopts. They may choose a different entry point depending on their interests and experiences.","Second question, Marshall?","Marshall Mohr","I&A per case, if benign procedures were to grow faster than more complex procedures, it\u2019s a very slight improvement in gross margin. And the advanced instruments have just a slightly lower gross margin than our other instruments.","Gary Guthart","Okay, that was our last question. In closing, we\u2019ll believe \u2013 we believe there\u2019s a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions.","Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of our customers have termed the quadruple aim: better, more predictable patient outcomes, better patient experiences, better experiences for care teams, and ultimately, a lower total cost of care per patient episode.","We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and the environment in which they operate. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months.","Operator","Again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference. I want to thank you for your participation.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Senior Director of Finance, Investor Relations, Calvin Darling. Please go ahead.","Calvin Darling","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's third quarter earnings conference call. With me today we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Patrick Clingan, Vice President of Finance and Sales Operations.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 2, 2016, and 10-Q filed on July 20, 2016. These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's EDGAR database. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.","Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website.","Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our third quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Marshall will provide a review of our third quarter financial results, Patrick will discuss procedure and clinical highlights, then I will provide our updated financial outlook for 2016, and finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.","With that, I'll turn it over to Gary.","Gary Guthart","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on the call today. Our company performance in the quarter was solid with increasing customer adoption of procedures and growth in system placements. Global procedure growth was over 14% year-over-year in the quarter.","Drivers of growth centered on U.S. general surgery and growth in the use of da Vinci surgical systems outside the United States. In the United States, year-over-year growth in ventral and inguinal hernia repair continues to be strong. U.S. colon resection and lung resection also contributed to solid growth.","As we've stated in prior calls, we are expecting growth rates in mature procedures in the U.S. to moderate and U.S. dVP is starting to follow this pattern, driven by the macroeconomic environment for prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment.","In Europe, procedure growth tempered in the quarter, with some countries posting solid performance while growth softened in others. We're pleased with growth in procedures in Asia, with Korea and China in particular demonstrating continued strength. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call.","We placed 134 da Vinci systems in the quarter, up from 117 in Q3 of 2015. While we offer a range of models and price points, our most capable model da Vinci Xi again represented roughly three quarters of new capital placements. As we've said on previous calls, capital placements are lumpy and this quarter was no exception.","Healthy placement stood out in the U.S. while placements in our European region softened relative to a year ago. Capital placements in Asia are particularly unpredictable given environmental constraints like reimbursements in Japan and quotas in China. Placements in Asia were in line with prior quarters.","Turning to revenue and gross margin dynamics, we experienced some one-time tailwinds in the quarter that contributed to higher-than-expected net income. Marshall will take you through these events and our general finances in greater detail later in the call.","Turning to highlights of our third quarter operating results. Procedures grew approximately 14% over the third quarter of last year. We shipped 134 da Vinci surgical systems, up from 117 in the third quarter of 2015. Revenue for the quarter was $683 million, up 16% from the prior year. Pro forma gross profit margin was 73.1% compared to 69.3% in the third quarter of last year.","Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $348 million; up 17%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $478 million, representing 70% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $308 million in the quarter, up 28% from the third quarter of last year and pro forma net income was $246 million, up 23% from Q3 of 2015.","As we discussed with you on our last call, as our businesses strengthened, we have increased our mid- and long-term investments in creating our next generation of products and services. We've been increasing these investments based on our belief that substantial opportunity exists to enable better outcomes and to expand access to our technologies globally. We continue to enhance features and expand access to our Xi suite of instruments, accessories, and imaging products. In the third quarter, we added the ability to ship Xi Single-Site, Xi 30-millimeter stapler, and Firefly to several countries.","In addition, intraoperative Table Motion uptake and performance is meeting our expectations. We are continuing to invest in expansion and refinement of our base instrument stapling and vessel sealing products for our Xi platform.","New system platforms continue to make good progress. Our da Vinci single port is progressing in its in-house clinical evaluations and preparations for human clinical trials expected later this quarter.","As we've discussed on prior calls, we plan first markets to include head and neck surgery, urology, and colorectal surgery. Sp is a platform technology that allows high dexterity access with great 3D vision to confined surgical spaces. Commentary by surgeons after in-house evaluations have indicated strong interest in the clinical potential of this platform.","In the quarter, we also announced the creation of a joint venture with Fosun Pharma owner of our current da Vinci partner in China. The JV\u2019s first objectives are to work with ISI and Fosun to produce products that address an acute need in the diagnosis and cost-effective treatment of lung cancer, one of the most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer in the world and for which early detection and treatment are important.","The technology underpinning the system is based on computer-controlled catheters, advanced image processing, and sophisticated sensing. It incorporates a substantial set of proprietary intellectual property developed, owned, or licensed by Intuitive over the past several years. This system is in its early stages of our human clinical experience, and final clearance and launch targets are not yet set. That said, the raw capability of the technology is compelling, and it has the potential to perform as a broader diagnostic and treatment platform over time.","Bringing new platforms to the market represents a significant investment. We have added approximately 400 employees year-to-date and expect increased fixed investments and some lumpiness in spending in future quarters as these platforms move through design, validation, data collection, and early launch.","As we close 2016, we are focused on the following. First, expanding the use of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair; second, advancing our ecosystem, including new clearances, additional clinical and economic validation, training centers and the expansion of our product offerings; third, driving our organizational capabilities and markets in Europe and Asia; and finally, assisting our customers in their efforts to maximize the comprehensive value of their programs.","I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will review financial highlights.","Marshall Mohr","Thank you, Gary. I'll be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes specified legal settlements and claim accruals, stock-based compensation, and amortization of purchased IP. We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there is no confusion.","Third quarter 2016 revenue was $683 million, an increase of 16% compared with $590 million for the third quarter of 2015, and an increase of 2% compared with the second quarter revenue of $670 million.","Third quarter 2016 procedures increased 14% compared with third quarter of 2015 and decreased 1% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth relative to last year has been driven by general surgery in the U.S. and urology worldwide. The decrease relative to the prior quarter primarily reflects seasonality.","Revenue highlights are as follows. Instrument and accessory revenue of $348 million increased 17% compared with last year and increased 3% compared with the second quarter of 2016. Growth in instruments and accessory revenue generally reflects procedure growth and increased sales in stapling and vessel sealing products.","Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,870 per procedure compared with $1,840 last year and $1,810 last quarter. The increases relative to the third quarter of 2015 and last quarter reflects increased sales for stapling and vessel sealing products. The increase compared to the second quarter of 2016 also reflects the impact of customer buying patterns.","System revenue of $205 million increased 18% compared with the third quarter of 2015 and increased 1% compared with last quarter. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect higher system placements and higher revenue associated with lease buyouts partially offset by lower average system selling prices.","We generated approximately $13 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with $3 million in the third quarter of 2015 and $13 million last quarter. While lease buyouts are difficult to predict, we expect the level of fourth quarter lease buyouts to be below those of the third quarter. 134 systems were placed in the third quarter of 2016 compared with 117 systems in the third quarter of 2015, and 130 systems last quarter. 15 systems wereplaced under operating lease transactions in the current quarter compared with 15 last quarter and 13 systems in the third quarter of 2015. As a reminder, revenue on operating lease transactions is recognized ratably over the life of the lease.","As of the end of the third quarter, there were 74 systems out in the field under operating leases. We generated approximately $4 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter compared with $2 million in the third quarter of 2015 and approximately $4 million last quarter.","We exclude the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts from our system ASP calculations.","Globally our average system price was $1.53 million compared with $1.61 million last year and $1.56 million last quarter. The decrease is compared with prior periods; primarily reflect a lower mix of dual console systems partially offset by a lower mix of trade-in systems in the third quarter of 2016.","Service revenue of $130 million increased 10% year-over-year and increased approximately 1% compared with the second quarter of 2016. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect growth in our installed base of da Vinci systems.","Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. Third quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $189 million increased 25% compared with $151 million for the third quarter of 2015 and increased 2% compared with $185 million for the second quarter.","The increase compared with the previous year is comprised of the 26% growth in recurring revenue, which is driven by procedure growth of 25%, and increased systems revenue of 24%. The increase compared to the second quarter reflects systems revenue growth of 2% and recurring revenue growth of 2% in a seasonally slower quarter.","Outside the U.S. we placed 49 systems in the third quarter compared with 37 in the third quarter of 2015, and 51 systems, last quarter. Current quarter system sales included 18 into Europe, two into China, 11 into Japan, and 18 into rest of world markets. System placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of the OUS markets are in the early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal reflecting budget cycles of vacation patterns and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations.","Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2016 was 73.1% compared with 69.3% for the third quarter of 2015 and 71.9% for the second quarter of 2016. The pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2016 included $7.8million of medical device tax refund. Without the medical device tax refund, our pro forma gross margin would have been the same as the second quarter or 72%. Compared with the third quarter of 2015 the higher gross margin reflects reduced product costs, the medical device tax refunds, and manufacturing efficiencies. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of system and instrument and accessory revenue, cost associated with our scope exchange program, our ability to further reduce product costs and improve manufacturing efficiency, and in the long-term the potential reinstatement of the medical device tax.","Pro forma operating expenses increased 14% compared with the third quarter of 2015 and increased approximately $6 million compared with last quarter. The increases reflect increased headcount, increased product development activities, and investments in our OUS commercial organization. We added over 400 employees primarily into product operations area over the past year. The increase compared with the prior quarter primarily reflects increased headcount costs.","Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 22.7% compared with an effective rate of 18.4% for the third quarter of 2015 and 27.8% last quarter. The pro forma third quarter of 2016 tax rate reflected $16 million of tax benefits or $0.40 per share realized as a result of the statute of limitations of expirations in various jurisdictions.","The third quarter of 2015 tax rate reflected $29 million or $0.77 per share related to a favorable tax court ruling involving an independent third-party. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of OUS and U.S. income and with the impact of one-time item.","Our third quarter 2016 pro forma net income was $246 million or $6.19 per share compared with $199 million or $5.24 per share for the third quarter of 2015 and $220 million or $5.62 per share for the second quarter of 2016.","Excluding one-time income tax and medical device tax benefit pro forma net income would have been $225 million or $5.65 per share.","As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends.","I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $211 million or $5.31 per share for the third quarter of 2016 compared with $167 million or $4.40 per share for the third quarter of 2015 and $185 million or $4.71 per share for the second quarter of 2016.","We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $4.6 billion, up from $4.2 billion as of June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises. As our cash builds, we will continue to evaluate our approach to capital allocation.","And with that I would like to turn it over to Patrick who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights.","Patrick Clingan","Thanks, Marshall. Of our third quarter procedure growth of 14% U.S. procedures grew approximately 11% and outside of the United States procedures grew approximately 25%. During the first three quarters of 2016 global procedure growth was nearly 16%. In the United States taken together growth in our mature procedures slowed in the third quarter compared to the first half of the year. General and thoracic procedure growth remained healthy.","In U.S., urology third quarter growth in da Vinci prostatectomy slowed to low-single-digit growth a level that we believe to be similar to the overall rate of diagnoses of new prostate cancers. We believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market.","In U.S. gynecology third quarter procedures grew modestly year-over-year with growth led by malignant and complex benign hysterectomy. Continuing the recent trend, we estimate a larger proportion of da Vinci hysterectomy procedures were performed by gynecologic oncologists during the third quarter. Procedures for benign gynecologic conditions grew modestly during the third quarter, continuing a trend from the first half of the year.","Third quarter U.S. general and thoracic surgery procedure adoption remained strong led by solid growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures. Hernia repair continues to contribute the largest volume of new procedures in general surgery and existing surgeon retention and utilization remains encouraging.","Cholecystectomy procedures declined in the quarter, with growth in multi-port procedures being offset by declines in single site procedures. Early-stage adoption of Lobectomies and other thoracic procedures is encouraging.","Last month at the Global Symposium on Robotic assisted in minimally invasive hernia repair, several new datasets comparing da Vinci to open and laparoscopic hernia repair were presented. Among the most notable presentation, Dr. Rosen from the Cleveland Clinic presented new data on retro muscular ventral hernia repair from the American Hernia Society's Quality Collaborative or the AHSQC. In a perspective cohort of more than 400 patient's case match between da Vinci and open surgery, da Vinci surgery was shown to reduce the length of hospitalization by 2.5 days compared to open surgery with similar levels of wound outcomes, readmissions, and re-operations.","Intuitive is a founding partner of AHSQC and we're supporting its expansion to include data for inguinal hernia repair.","Turning abroad procedure growth outside of the United States was approximately 25% in the third quarter led by the global adoption of da Vinci prostatectomy with solid contributions from kidney procedures. Total procedure growth in Europe and Asia was similar to the first half of the year, though procedure performance varied by country.","Strong growth continued in China, South Korea, Japan, and Germany. While adoption of da Vinci and urology is the primary driver for procedure growth outside of the United States, we are seeing multi-specialty adoption in certain countries. In China, roughly half of the year-to-date procedure growth has come from categories outside of urology. In South Korea approximately 60% of the year-to-date procedures have come from categories outside of urology.","We're investing in the development of clinical evidence to support the adoption of da Vinci surgery in markets around the world. Globally, we support several evidence initiatives and registries including AHSQC, gynecologic oncology societal registries in the U.S. and Europe and the colorectal registry in Europe.","In the U.S. we are also supporting several comparative perspective and retrospective multicenter studies on hernia repair, colorectal surgery, and thoracic surgery. Outside of the United States, we are sponsoring clinical studies in Japan to support reimbursement submissions from malignant hysterectomy and hysterectomy. In Europe, we provide support for studies in colorectal, thoracic, and gynecologic oncology. We are committed to developing local evidence in key markets to support the adoption of da Vinci surgery, where our technology can bring value to hospitals, surgeons, patients.","Third quarter was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications evaluating da Vinci surgery. Of these, I've selected a few studies which you may find interesting. Dr. Delush [ph] and colleagues from Indiana University published a study in surgical endoscopy comparing da Vinci to laparoscopic colorectal procedures captured in the American College of Surgeons, National Surgical Quality Improvement Project or NSQIP database from 2011 through 2014 including over 27,000 procedures across a range of colon and rectal resections, in exchange for approximately 45 longer operative time, da Vinci low anterior resections and right colectomies showed a reduction in conversion rate.","Left colectomy is trended towards a reduction in conversion rates without statistical significance. Low anterior resections also show a lower rate of subsets with a higher rate of diverting ostomy. Across all cohorts, da Vinci surgery generated a reduction in length of hospital stay.","The next study was published by Dr. Ozben and colleagues from the Acibadem University in Istanbul, Turkey, in the Journal of Surgical Laparoscopy, Endoscopy and Percutaneous Technologies. In a small case series, the authors compared their experience in performing rectal resections on da Vinci Xi to da Vinci Si. They found that da Vinci Xi was associated with an approximate 40 minutes of reduced operative time. The reduction in operative time was attributable to an elimination of double docking and hybrid surgeries in the da Vinci Xi cohort.","The surgeons also found that da Vinci Xi patient population experienced an increase in lymph nodes harvested and quicker return of bowel function with a one day longer length of hospital stay. The authors concluded \"The Xi generation appeared to allow shorter console times, and its broader capabilities promise to make it a lot easier for surgeons to perform this complex robotic procedure.\"","While this study highlights the enhanced portfolio capabilities of da Vinci Xi per multi quadrant surgery such as rectal resection, our da Vinci SI installed bases remained stable in 2016 as customers continue to find value in its utilization. Taken together, procedures performed on da Vinci Si and Xi platforms represented over 95% of our third quarter procedures.","This concludes my remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Calvin.","Calvin Darling","Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2016. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full year 2016 procedure growth of 14% to 15% above the approximately 652,000 procedures performed in 2015. Now as we enter the fourth quarter, we continue to forecast full year procedure growth of 14% to 15%, likely towards the higher end of the range.","With regard to Q4 2016 system placements, we directionally expect system placements for the quarter to follow recent seasonal trends. However, we anticipate system placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of our U.S., OUS markets are in early stages of adoption and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations. Recall, we placed 13 systems into China and seven systems into Brazil in the fourth quarter of 2015.","As the quota in China expired in 2015 and a new quota has not yet been issued, and as we are in the very early stages of adoption in Brazil, we do not expect comparables and placements into these markets in the fourth quarter of 2016. Also, we believe that the flexibility we have offered customers in the form of operating leases has been well received. As a result, as compared to prior periods, we expect a higher proportion of Q4 2016 placements to be under operating leases, with revenue recognized in future periods.","Finally, we expect to see a lower number of lease buyouts in the fourth quarter compared to the previous two quarters, given the lower number of short-term leases that are outstanding at this time.","Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71% of net revenue. We now expect our full year 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be approximately 71.5% of net revenue. As Marshall indicated, the third quarter benefited from a $7.1 million medical device tax refund. Excluding that benefit, our gross profit margin would have been 72%. We expect our fourth quarter margin to be directionally lower than the third quarter, primarily due to product mix.","Turning to operating expenses. Based upon investments we are making in key areas of the business, we expect expense growth will continue to accelerate. On our last call, we forecast pro forma 2016 operating expenses to grow between 12% and 15% above 2015 levels. We are now refining this range to 13% to 14%. Consistent with our last call, we expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2016 compared to $168 million in 2015.","We expect other income to total approximately $33 million in 2016, higher than the $30 million forecast on our last call, due primarily to higher interest income. With regard to income tax, consistent with previous guidance, we expect our Q4 2016 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5% and 28.5% of pre-tax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits.","That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","That will come from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bob Hopkins","Hi, thanks good afternoon. Can you hear me okay?","Gary Guthart","We can.","Bob Hopkins","Great. So I had two questions. First for Marshall, just to clarify a couple of things that were mentioned relating to the fourth quarter, and then a question for Gary on the Fosun agreement. But Marshall, I'll start with you just two quick clarifications. One, on the medical device tax that\u2019s in $7 million, could you explain why that is one time? And then on the system sales guidance that you're providing, is that essentially suggesting that systems will be globally roughly flat in Q4? Thank you.","Marshall Mohr","Yes, sure. So the medical device tax is the result -- refund is the result of when you originally compute the tax, there is some subjective areas and we modified what we have previously filed. So we get a one-time refund, and it's over. And they have -- we've received the money, and there has been an audit. So we're all done with that.","Second question had to do with the level of systems. No, I think that what Calvin said was that the systems are seasonally stronger in Q4. What he was trying to set up, however, was that relative to the prior year, there's some hard comparables given that we had some markets that are rather lumpy like China and Brazil.","Bob Hopkins","Yes, the second question on Fosun.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David --","Gary Guthart","I think Bob had a question on Fosun before he got to it, if you still have him, if not we will come back around in queue.","Bob Hopkins","I'm here. Can you hear me?","Gary Guthart","I can, go.","Bob Hopkins","Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you very much for that. So I just, I was wondering if you could give us some perspective on the biopsy platform and the joint venture because it seems to me like this is an entirely new platform that you're announcing here. So I was wondering if you could just give us a little more color on what this is. Like, is this a new -- totally new system or just an add-on to Xi? Just should we think about it as being a couple of years away from commercialization? Or is it really a longer-term project? I'm just sort of wondering if you could provide some perspective.","Gary Guthart","Yes, I'll give you a little bit of an overview. We'll, of course, give you additional detail in coming quarters. It is not currently designed as an add-on. The technology is based, as I said in prepared remarks on computer-controlled catheters, along with some special sensing technologies and some image analysis. Currently, the current configuration it's in, it's a standalone. Those types of technologies in the future could be integrated into other things, and we won't preclude ourselves from doing that. We do conceive of it as a way to access the body through natural orifices and other means, where you want to follow a prescribed pathway to get to some deep place in the body and do something.","Our first clinical interest is in biopsying lung cancers or biopsying suspicious lesions in the lung. We think that, that is important globally and particularly important in China. And as a result, the partnership with Fosun, who we've known through their Chindex Company for many years, made a lot of sense to us. And we're excited about it. We're not ready to give you commercial timelines yet. The technology is mature enough that we're in our initial kind of human clinical experience. That's really the very beginnings for us. And as we get greater clarity on our launch timelines and thoughts, we'll share them with you.","Operator","Now we'll go to the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Good afternoon. Gary, I want to start with a strategic question and maybe have two follow-up boring questions. But it occurred to me on this call, actually, the Intuitive story is sort of poised for pretty significant change. I really think Intuitive has always really been about one system. I know you have multiple configurations, but in this quarter alone, Xi was still 75% of new placements. But if I think about the next two years, right, you're still going to have Xi and all those multiple Intuitive prior systems, you will have XSP, and you're also now going to have this catheter-based sensing system. So I wonder if you could help us understand, are we right to think about this company as morphing these next two years? And how does supporting sort of multiple platforms now, impact the addressable markets you can serve, your ability to accelerate growth, and obviously just flat out R&D spending across these platforms? I know it's a big question, but I think it's an important one.","Gary Guthart","Yes, fair enough. I think, as you think about SP, SP shares a lot in architecture and in kind of underlying technology with the Xi platform. We do think it branches us into places that are hard to reach otherwise, literally hard to reach with conventional technologies, open surgery, conventional laparoscopy or with Xi.","So we think SP can broaden clinically what surgeons can do. I think that will start in niches and then will move out into broader applications as we gain clinical experience. It does increase our support load a little bit in terms of complexity with regard to the SP just because it's a new set of instruments and add-on accessories. But it's not an entirely new set of computational platform and things like that.","As you start thinking about the catheter-based technologies, again, that's a new set of technologies. You had kind of framed in a two-year horizon. I would stretch that horizon out a little bit. I wouldn't anchor us there. I do think that takes us to different places. I think it allows access to parts of the body that you may not think of surgically. It may be more around diagnostics. And I think it will open up to practitioners' ways of approaching tissue that they just haven't thought about before. And that's why we're doing it. That you've seen us increase our R&D spend and we've been both talking about it and doing it, and part of it has been investing in these technologies. And I think it matters. I think as people look, as we look from the bottom of your feet to the top of your head and look for opportunities to get better outcomes, we think of a variety of technologies from access technologies to imaging technologies to computational technologies that can really make a difference, and that's we're putting our money where our mouth is.","David Lewis","Okay, thanks Gary. And then Marshall, the company has always been hesitant to talk about margins on a go-forward basis. Obviously, margins this year is a huge part of the story and, frankly, kind of extraordinary. So as you head into 2017, some of the spending comments you made, I don't think it's realistic for investors to expect 200 basis points of margin expansion in 2017. Based on your comments on spending in which you're going to have to just support these platforms, I mean, how should we sort of calibrate our thinking next year between sort of an extraordinary 2016 expansion and a more moderate 2015 margin expansion? Should we be thinking about something between those two poles as more appropriate than what we are seeing this year, which seems very outsized?","Marshall Mohr","Clearly, we'll give you guidance in January on what 2017 is going to look like. But some of the variables that can occur, obviously, had to do with product mix. And as you introduce new products, new products have, by their nature, lower margins than existing products. And so if there were -- as we introduce stapling, for example, we saw decline in margins initially. As we improved the manufacturability and efficiency of the manufacturing processes we see improvements in margins.","So I'm not going to predict what we're going to do next year. I'd just say that there are a lot of moving parts. Mix geographically also has an impact. Mix between systems and instruments and accessories has an impact. There's just a lot of variables that go into it. I think what you've seen this last year, though, is outstanding performance by our manufacturing group to reduce the cost of newer products that were lower margin a year ago.","David Lewis","Okay. And then just really just quickly lastly, on the ex-U.S. business on systems, I think the commentary in Brazil and China, those seem kind of very short-term in nature. Eventually, those tenders will get raised. But in terms of the European business, did you see any impact from Brexit? Or do you just think this is a lumpiness that always occurs generally in your business? Thank you.","Gary Guthart","Yes, I think, the dynamics in UK in particular, I -- it's hard for us to segregate what's Brexit and what isn't. The capital acquisition pipelines are pretty long relative to these things. And it's been clear that in the UK, that there, NHS anyway, that NHS England has been looking at how to spend their money and trying to cover budget shortfalls. So there's been pressure there for some time of Brexit likely doesn't help.","With regard to Europe more broadly, it really is varying country-by-country. Some places, we see reasonable growth and support; other countries have been a little bit more of a struggle. And the response to that really has been to increase our local presence, increase local data generation, and be in close contact with government payers and private payers.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.","Tycho Peterson","Hey thanks. I actually want to follow-up on Dave's question early on margins. If we think about the Xi experience and the impact that had on gross margins, as we think forward to SP, is that a fair proxy in terms of magnitude of the impact on gross margin when that does rollout?","Marshall Mohr","We're not at the stage where we've introduced the product and we're manufacturing them in bulk. But I think it's fair to say that SP's margins will be lower than our existing product portfolio. And we will work on it as we come out over time and try to reduce those costs.","Gary Guthart","But in terms of magnitude, Tycho, when you look at the Xi, that was our next-generation, multi-port system, and it quickly took off to a very high proportion of the sales. What we're talking about with SP is a more controlled type of launch, lower overall quantities. So just based on magnitude, it's probably not going to have as big an impact on the overall margin.","Tycho Peterson","Understood. And then can you comment on trade-ins? I know you called out in the footnotes. You've had 58 in U.S., highest number ever. Was this kind of a one-time thing, where you kind of went back and scrubbed systems in the field?","Gary Guthart","Yes, there was a footnote within our data table that we referenced in the beginning. During the third quarter, we actually implemented a new system and some processes for tracking our da Vinci systems out in the field. As part of the transition process, we performed a verification audit out of our installed base records and which identified 43 systems, mostly older standard and S models, which had been retired.","So we went and removed those retired systems from our installed base during the quarter. So I think the trade-out number was 33 and then most of the rest here was just kind of this adjustment, we made to the base. So the trade-ins were pretty, I think in line with previous periods.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Last one, I'll just ask the obligatory capital deployment question because you're over $4.5 billion now. Obviously, you're stepping up your own spending curve but maybe just talk a little bit about capital deployment at this point.","Marshall Mohr","Yes, sure. I think, we think about capital deployment consistent with how we've talked about it before. We're in a period where there is now -- we're facing future competition and we want to have the ability to expand and to deal with competition. And we're also going to see additional opportunities as companies get into this game for acquisition of technologies that may expand our marketplace and enhance our products.","And those technologies, it's nice to do tuck-ins and small licensing arrangements that we've done in the past and we'll try to do those. But may be that we have to buy to pay a greater dollar to get some of that technology in the future. So we want to have money for those things. Beyond that to the extent that we have the right opportunity to buy back stock and return shares, money to shareholders, we'll take that opportunity. But we'll do that opportunistically as we had in the past.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair.","Ben Andrew","Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Gary, looking at the Fosun relationship, does this give you a demonstrably closer relationship over in China that may influence the tender process? And kind of a second piece of that, from a regulatory perspective what sort of timeframes would you be looking at to get something through once you've finished developments and you've done some human testing to approval? Is it quicker there or is it similar to the U.S.?","Gary Guthart","Yes, on the first question, I think, in the long-term, I think it deepens our relationships with customers and regulators in China. I don't -- I wouldn't assume that it's a magic switch in the near-term.","With regard to regulatory approvals for various products in China, typically, in our past, it's been a little bit longer process than it has in the U.S. What that looks like going forward in particular, for the new products we're talking about, I can't speak to it at this time. We just don't have enough information on it.","Ben Andrew","Okay. And then you talked about international procedures being up about 25%, which is a strong number. But I thought I heard you say that parts of Europe were weaker than a year ago. Was there a particular geographic pattern there? Was China demonstrably or that plus the ROW placements sort of got my attention relative to some emerging opportunities overseas.","Patrick Clingan","Hey Ben, this is Patrick. In certain international markets, we're pretty deeply penetrated in urology. And where you have seen those penetration rates increase over time, the rate of growth has decelerated and emerging procedures things like colorectal and gynecologic oncology are still fairly small. So countries like the Nordic countries places like UK, where we are pretty deep, you see those growth rates slow.","Ben Andrew","Okay. And then there's may be for Patrick as well, but a competitor this morning talked about saying seeing some of their general surgeries cases and calling out hernia being down something like 10%. Kind of give us your state of the state in terms of where you are in hernia and kind of the trajectory of adoption relative to some of the historical past adopting procedures, if you would.","Patrick Clingan","Yes, hernia continues to be encouraging. The rates of both procedure adoption, surgeon retention, and utilization within the existing surgeon population as they continue to do more procedures has been a strong point and the way in which the technology is going to be adopted. Now hernia repair though is not one thing. So there is a variety of patient's subsets within variety of different physician perspectives around the value that our technology can bring into the procedure. And so it's probably not quite like DPB in terms of the way you would think of it is been adopted, may be a little more benign hysterectomy, given the alternative therapies and the heterogeneous landscape out there in terms of how they address these patients.","Ben Andrew","Okay. And then last question for me, I guess, is the question, it's around the INA, the revenue beat there with the procedures being roughly in line with our target was quite noticeable. And Marshall, you did go through some of the math there. But was other than stapling and vessel sealing, was there anything in particular in there that caught your attention relative to mix?","Marshall Mohr","Yes, just kind of giving a little historical perspective. If you look at prior to Q2 of 2016, our INA revenue per procedure has been running within our really tight, narrow range, $1,830 to $1,840 per procedure. You probably recall last quarter, it actually dropped down to $1,810, and we talked about timing of orders being the main factor here. So as expected here in Q3, we saw orders rebound to offset Q2. And if you take the average of Q2 and Q3 you're right back at the $1,840, kind of in line with those trends over the past couple of years.","As we said, though, we continue to see increasing utilization of the advanced instruments, including those stapler and vessel sealer. And moving forward as we anticipate continued growth in the procedure volumes in colorectal and thoracic surgery, areas where these products are more widely used. We would anticipate a slightly higher contribution to revenue per procedure on an organic consumption model, if you will.","But it is important to remember that a variety of factors impact revenue per procedure, including the type of procedure performed, the efficiency of use and optimization, use of advanced instruments, stocking orders, timing and distributors. So there is a lot of factors here. So as a result, INA can be lumpy, and future trends can be difficult to forecast in the end.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Amit Hazan with Citi.","Amit Hazan","Thanks. Good afternoon guys. Let me may be start with prostate, just kind of thinking through the trend this year, just going from low-double-digit growth in the first quarter for GDP, all the way down to low-single-digits, it sounds like, for this quarter. It seems like a pretty fast change in what otherwise would seem to me to be something that would be slower trend line. Any more color you can add as to what's happening now, why it's happening and may be, more importantly, just the confidence you guys have that this quarter kind of marched that bottom and that incident rate growth is kind of your right way to throw for prostate?","Gary Guthart","Yes, Amit, as you know, predicting how the patient treatment trends across prostate cancer in a mature procedure like DPB is difficult. We've highlighted for period of time the rates of growths that we've seen with our rates of growth that we thought were consistent with the rate of diagnoses. It's hard to say in the quarter where the rate at which we've seen growth change over the course of this year. The specifics behind it that data typically comes to us years that down the road. But we feel that what we saw in the quarter is probably more consistent rate of diagnoses than perhaps what we've seen over the past handful of quarters.","Amit Hazan","Okay. Let me kind of -- let me move to gynecology. It sounds like there things are still kind of like you described in the first half of the year may be slightly better than what we've seen in the past. And I wanted to may be ask this in a while, so I'll just throw this question out, just as one possible avenue. Just thinking about outpatient centers, ambulatory surgery centers, is there to what extent or is there kind of any increase in the success that you're having in being able to place da Vinci outpatient centers? Is that becoming more of a focus for you at all? Or is that at all a part of may be the slightly better rate of growth we're seeing in gynecology in the U.S.?","Gary Guthart","Yes. So I think you're connecting two things I'm not quite sure I'd connect. So the relative health of the gynecology business seems to me to be driven by a few factors, among them concentration of patients into higher volume surgeons and higher volume centers. Separately, there is a trend toward a more outpatient work. We do see utilization of our systems in outpatient environments that tends to be more in existing integrated delivery networks, hospital loaned outpatient departments as part of a integrated plan. It's not something I'd call out as a major trend at this point. I'm not sure that I would quite link to GYN. It's possible, but I think there are a lot of factors there that sorting them is not possible yet.","Marshall Mohr","If you look at GYN overall and you look at the history of benign hysterectomy adoption, the entrance of da Vinci surgery in the benign hysterectomy has enabled the majority of patients to now be treated on an outpatient basis. So when minimally invasive surgery is adopted with the technology, it will enable hospitals to manage these patients in a more outpatient oriented way.","Amit Hazan","One last question for me on the system side. Just thinking through not just the fourth quarter, but just a little bit longer-term may be call 2017 if you want. But thinking about the installed base, it's been really consistently growing out 10% a year almost every quarter seems like it grows about 10% -- on that 10% rate on an annual basis. Can you may be just talk through the key drivers and may be pressure points as we think about that number and the sustainability of that 10% growth in the installed base growth figure as we think through the next year or two?","Gary Guthart","A couple of -- the way I think about it kind of puts and takes. So the major factor is anticipated procedure growth by the customer. So customers are making capital placements based on what they think will happen in future procedure trends. So that is the biggest driver and where they see growth, I think that they move forward.","The places where that can be a little bit different or disconnected is in a very early market where you're just getting started. So a new reimbursement clearance or a new quote or a new procedure clearance doesn't follow the more mature trend. So those are the two things that are rolling around. I think the biggest one for us is customer belief and utilization for future procedures as the best predictor of capital.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Rick Wise from Stifel Nicolaus.","Rick Wise","Good afternoon everybody. Hi Gary, just may be just going back to Fosun briefly. Obviously, you have alluded several times to this notion of building out the ecosystem and how important and valuable it is to Intuitive. Are there other similar opportunities to Fosun, whether it would be geographic or technology? Or I mean is this a direction we should expect Intuitive to push looking for other technologies to bring into the ecosystem? Is that the right way to think about it?","Gary Guthart","I think the idea that if there are technologies or other assets that we can bring that we think will increase the value of robotic surgery program or a minimally invasive surgery program based on a competition to one of our customers, is that an opportunity for us, yes. They tend to develop in time. The underlying catheter-based technologies that we're talking about now as you know, having followed us for some time were really first acquired by us years ago. So the answer to that, yes, we're outlooking. Fosun has been a good partner. They have built a relationship with us through Chindex, but they also understand the healthcare space extremely well in multiple dimensions. And so the short answer to that is we've been doing it and expect to continue to do it.","Rick Wise","Thanks. A couple more, just a general question about the general surgery adoption particularly in the U.S. May be just can you talk a little bit more about where we are just in terms of that adoption process? I mean are these still earnings or early innings rather? And may be particularly on colorectal, how do you accelerate colorectal adoption? Do we need more clinical data? Can you talk through some of those issues?","Gary Guthart","Sure. So as we said in the past, adoption is really per procedure, and per procedure is really segmented. So for example, colorectal is probably really four or five underlying procedures that are a little bit different. And adoption goes quickly when there's large value, distinct value for the procedure relative to alternatives and when the procedure is pretty well concentrated in the hands of well-trained surgeons.","So take colorectal and separate it a little bit. In the case of rectal cancer, that's a complex set of procedures. Oncologic, of course, in nature has been growing steadily. Not a super rapid rise relative to some prior adoptions but a steady adoption for us and data collection has been occurring. Data publication has been occurring. And we're doing okay there. I think in other parts of colon, sometimes it's for benign, sometimes its oncology. Those are typically done by different surgeons and so they adopt at little bit different rates.","You look at hernia again, it's sub-segmented, ventral hernia versus inguinal in some segments within inguinal. So we look at it. Ventral hernia and inguinal hernia, as we define the available markets for procedures for which we bring value, have adopting pretty nicely relative to past trends. Rectal has been on a slower adoption but a steady one. And colon is in the middle.","Rick Wise","And just last for me on the procedure side. I mean, obviously, a lot of moving pieces here. Urology may be now a little more slow growth now the rebounded gynecology recovering, general surgery continuing to grow dramatically. We wrote that math with what we're seeing internationally. Should we feel reasonably optimistic that something like mid-teens procedure growth, again with some variation, is that the right sustainable growth rate from here, given the growing installed base, given the geographic penetration and given the continuing evolution of Intuitive technology? Thanks Gary.","Gary Guthart","Yes, we're not ready to give of our 2017 forecast yet. And we'll see how we close here in the fourth quarter and roll up our estimates and answer that very question in our next call in January.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So I'm new to these calls, so just may be a couple of basic ones here. So SG&A as a percent of sales was relatively low. I apologize if I missed it any reason for SG&A to be relatively low this quarter? And the R&D spending of about 7% of sales, is that sounds like is that a good rate to use going forward? And I had a couple of follow-ups.","Patrick Clingan","Yes. There's going to be variability quarter-to-quarter, lumpiness, if you will, between SG&A and R&D. We talked a lot about our R&D investments. Gary went through them on the SG&A side. I think we're investing a little heavier disproportionally for international to support the earlier phase growth there. So you look at it overall, we're within our guidance range. We refined our full year guidance to that 13% to 14%. So again, there'll be some quarter variability, but I think we're tracking to the overall plan.","Marshall Mohr","And Larry, given the lumpiness in some of our capital revenue from period-to-period, we typically talk about operating systems in terms of growth rates, which Calvin walked you through.","Larry Biegelsen","Got it. Thanks. And when we think about the pipeline and potential launches in new products and functionality, should we be expecting any meaningful product introductions later, either later this year or in 2017, excluding SP?","Gary Guthart","Well, we've been launching a fair number of instruments and accessories various things in various markets. We tend to tell you when they came out. We have not tagged a launch date either for SP or other kind of major systems at this time.","Larry Biegelsen","And then lastly for me. Gary, you talked about the growth you've seen in hernia, and you talked about ventral and inguinal. Are you seeing anything different in terms of the penetration or ramp in ventral versus inguinal or both of them equally strong? Thanks for taking the question.","Gary Guthart","It's a good question. I think the dynamics are a little bit different in them, both in terms of kind of procedure complexity and a little bit of practice patterns. But they don't track exactly the same. Having said that, I don't think there's anything about adoption I'd call out strongly at this time. I think both of them are moving through that first set of adopters, generating additional data. We're seeing more data now generally supportive and looks pretty good. I think that technique refinement and data generation is what the next round of surgeons rely upon to evaluate. And so we're seeing that kind of transition right now, clearly, in both those hernia domains. We just take one more question for one more caller please.","Operator","Our final question will come from Brandon Henry with RBC Capital Markets.","Brandon Henry","Yes, thanks for taking the question. So Intuitive again posted strong growth and operating margins this quarter. Can you discuss some of the product and cost initiatives that are driving these better margins and in what inning you're in with some of these cost initiatives? And then separately, the company's headcount has increased meaningfully over the last couple of quarters. Can you discuss where you're making the investments in headcount and then how much of that increase in headcount can be attributed to the Fosun JV versus some other initiatives? And then I have a follow-up.","Gary Guthart","That was two questions already, and I gave you one. I think I'll choose one. No, we'll go fast there. On the first one in terms of cost reductions, it's a careful and long list of activities that goes on. So you shouldn't so much think of it as one thing as it is a routine discipline of scanning through both operating processes and manufacturing processes and parts cost and working them down as they come.","You do get the first -- the greatest help on those things in the first few years of a platform release, and then after that, it starts getting increasingly hard. Suffice it to say that it isn't possible to do it.","In terms of headcount growth, it's a mixture of commercial growth little bit more weighted outside the U.S. than U.S., some manufacturing growth to cover volumes of things like instruments and accessories and other things that have been increasing as well as some design help. The headcount growth as it relates to Fosun that we're not really ready to break out at this time. We have certainly made headcount investments over the last few years into the technologies that have underpinned that relationship. But it's not -- I wouldn't call it out as Fosun just yet.","Gary Guthart","With that, I'll go ahead and close the call and then we'll catch your next question on the next conference call. So that was the last question. As we've said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits, and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing value by enabling surgeons to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma.","We've built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference.","This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery, and we look forward to talking with you again in three months."],"12435":["Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) Q3 2012 Earnings Call October 16, 2012  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Calvin Darling","Gary S.

[Operator Instructions] Also as a reminder, today's teleconference is being recorded. And at this time, we would like to turn the conference call over to your host, Senior Director of Finance Mr. Calvin Darling. Please go ahead, sir.","Calvin Darling","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's Third Quarter Conference Call.","With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Aleks Cukic, our Vice President of Strategic Planning.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.","Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Intuitive's archives on the Audio Archives section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release has been posted to our website.","Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our third quarter's results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our third quarter financial results. Aleks will discuss marketing and clinical highlights, then I'll provide an update to our financial forecast for 2012. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.","With that, I'll turn it over to Gary.","Gary S. Guthart","Thank you for joining us today. The third quarter highlighted both market's strengths and headwinds. Our procedure performance came in below our expectations, driven by challenging conditions in Europe and changes in prostate cancer detection and treatment. On the positive side, acceptance of da Vinci surgery in general and gynecologic surgery continues to grow, in complex cancer procedures, benign procedures and in single port robotic surgery.","In the third quarter, procedure growth was challenged by a continuing weakness in Europe and acceleration in the decline of our U.S. da Vinci prostatectomies. The prostatectomy decline appears to be driven by a combination of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation against PSA testing and a change in treatment recommendations for low-risk prostate cancer away from definitive treatment. European procedure weakness appears to be driven by 3 underlying conditions: broad economic pressure in Europe, sentiment behind the PSA testing recommendation from the U.S. reflecting into Europe and the need for increased depth in our commercial organization. As we have mentioned on prior calls, we expect economic pressure in Europe to persist for the near future. We have been investing in our European commercial organization over the past couple of quarters and anticipate doing so for the next several.","Moving to general surgery. We experienced continued strong growth, which was multifaceted, including growth in colon and rectal surgery for cancers, as well as cholecystectomy, the latter following the introduction of Single-Site earlier in the year. Gynecology performance was solid. And like general surgery, gynecology was broad based, including hysterectomy, sacrocolpopexy and myomectomy. Aleks will provide additional procedure commentary later in the call.","In Japan, system sales and procedure performance have both continued to growth, led by dVP. Two da Vinci training centers have opened this year, one at Fujita Health and one at Tokyo Medical University, to increase in-country capacity for training Japanese surgeons.","Turning to our operating performance for the third quarter. We sold 155 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 133 during the third quarter of last year. Procedures grew approximately 22% over the third quarter of 2011. Instrument and accessory revenue was $218 million, up 24% over Q3 2011. Total revenue was $538 million, up 20% over last year. Total recurring revenue grew to $306 million, up 24% from prior year and comprising 57% of total revenue. We generated an operating profit of $259 million before noncash stock option expense, up 21% from the third quarter of last year and representing 48% of Q3 revenue. Net income was $183 million, up 50% over last year. We ended the quarter with $2,701,000,000 in cash and investments, up $70 million from last quarter.","Turning to recently launched products and those in development. In the third quarter, we continue to focus on our launches of Single-Site for cholecystectomy and Vessel Sealer. This quarter, we submitted our 510(k) for Single-Site instruments and indications for use in benign hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy. We have received FDA's questions and are encouraged by the conversation for this expansion of Single-Site. We will work over the next few months to gather the data they have requested.","We mentioned on our last call that we expect applications for the da Vinci Vessel Sealer to be centered on general surgery and gynecologic procedures. Uptake in customer response for the Vessel Sealer has been positive in both of these disciplines. Lastly, with regard to our da Vinci stapler, we have submitted our responses to FDA and believe that we have answered their questions. We are awaiting their response.","As we enter new surgical markets and drive into new product arenas, we continue to invest in building our team and expanding partnerships and in acquiring technology that can make a difference to robotic surgery. Given the uptick of da Vinci in general surgery, we expect to increase our sales force for emerging general surgery procedures and to increase customer training capacity. Furthermore, we plan to continue investment in our sales and marketing team in Europe and our overall organization in Japan. This quarter, we added 92 people to our team predominantly in sales, manufacturing and R&D, bringing our total team to 2,192 employees.","I'll now pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer.","Marshall L. Mohr","Thank you, Gary. Our third quarter revenue was $538 million, up 20% compared with $447 million for the third quarter of 2011 and up slightly compared to the $536 million last quarter.","Third quarter revenues by product category were as follows. Third quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $218 million, up 24% compared with $176 million for the third quarter of 2011 and down 3% compared with $224 million in the second quarter of 2012. The year-over-year increase in I&A was driven by procedure growth of approximately 22% in sales of our new instrument and accessory products, including Single-Site, Vessel Sealer and Firefly. The year-over-year procedure growth was led by U.S. gynecologic procedures and U.S. general surgery growth, partially offset by lower growth in Europe and a decrease in U.S. dVPs. Third quarter 2012 U.S. dVP procedures decreased 20% compared to the prior year. The decrease in I&A revenue compared to last quarter was primarily driven by the timing of stocking and distributor orders.","Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,980 per procedure, which is higher than the $1,950 realized in the third quarter of 2011, though lower than the $2,020 realized in the second quarter of 2012. The sequential decrease was driven by the timing of instrument and accessory stocking orders associated with new system sales and the timing of distributor orders.","Third quarter 2012 systems revenue of $232 million increased 17% compared with $199 million for the third quarter of 2011 and increased 1% compared with $229 million for the second quarter of 2012. We sold 155 systems in the third quarter of 2012 compared with 133 systems in the third quarter of 2011 and 150 systems in the second quarter of 2012. Our third quarter average sales price per system was $1.48 million, an increase from the $1.46 million realized in the third quarter of 2011 and a decrease compared to the $1.53 million realized in the second quarter.","ASPs include all da Vinci models, all simulators and Firefly when configured with the system and exclude upgrades. The decrease in ASPs compared with the second quarter of 2012 was driven by a lower proportion of dual console and simulator configurations and lower revenue recognized on euro-denominated sales. We sold 87 simulators during the quarter, mostly in conjunction with new system sales compared with 121 last quarter. We sold 20 dual console systems compared to 28 in the second quarter. 34 of our third quarter 2012 system sales involved trade-ins comprised of 26 of da Vinci Ss and 8 Standard models. 35 of our second quarter 2012 system sales involved trade-ins comprised of 23 da Vinci Ss and 12 Standard models. ASPs will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on product, customer and trade-in mix, as well as foreign exchange rates on direct sales to foreign customers.","Service revenue increased to $88 million, up 22% compared with $72 million last year and up 5% compared with $83 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was primarily driven by a larger system install base.","Total third quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue increased to $306 million, up 24% compared with the third quarter of 2011 and roughly equal to the second quarter of 2012. Recurring revenue represented 57% of total third quarter revenue compared with 55% in the third quarter last year and 57% last quarter.","International results were as follows. Third quarter revenue outside the U.S. was $115 million, up 22% compared with revenue of $94 million in the third quarter of 2011 and up 14% compared with revenue of $101 million in the second quarter of 2012. Our international revenue growth was primarily driven by higher system sales into Japan. 16 da Vinci S Systems were sold into Japan during the third quarter of 2012 compared to 6 during the third quarter of 2011 and 7 during the second quarter of 2012.","International instrument and accessory revenue grew approximately 9% year-over-year and decreased 17% sequentially. The changes in instrument and accessory revenue roughly followed the procedure volumes and reflect summer seasonality, a difficult European economic environment and distributor buying patterns. We sold 41 systems outside the United States compared with 34 in the third quarter of 2011 and 26 last quarter, reflecting higher Japanese placements. We sold 13 systems in Europe this quarter compared with 18 in the third quarter of 2011 and 13 last quarter. The decline in year-over-year European system sales reflects the difficult macroeconomic environment. Aleks will provide additional details of international system sales.","Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the third quarter was 72.5% compared with 72.9% during the third quarter of 2011 and 72% last quarter. Our slightly higher gross margin percentage compared to last quarter resulted primarily from cost improvements made to our new products. Third quarter 2012 operating expenses of $179 million were up 22% compared with the third quarter of 2011 and up 11% compared with the second quarter of 2012. Our higher third quarter 2012 operating expenses resulted in a large part from the timing of noncash stock option expenses. Beginning in 2012, we changed our stock option granting pattern so that employees are now granted options at both February 15 and August 15 compared with only at February 15 in prior years. Although approximately the same number of options were granted in each year, we recognized a higher proportion of stock option expense in the third quarter of 2012 relative to the first 2 quarters of 2012 and the third quarter of 2011. On a year-to-date basis, the stock option expense in 2012 is comparable to 2011. Our higher third quarter 2012 operating expenses also reflect higher R&D project expenses and increased headcount.","We added 92 employees in the quarter, including 44 employees in our commercial operations and 36 employees in product operations. Third quarter 2012 operating income was $211 million or 39% of sales compared with $179 million or 40% of sales for the third quarter of 2011 and $225 million or 42% of sales for the second quarter of 2012. Third quarter 2012 operating income reflected $47 million of noncash stock compensation expense compared with $35 million for the third quarter of 2011 and $33 million last quarter.","Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 15% compared with 32% for the third quarter of 2011 and 32% last quarter. Our lower third quarter tax rate resulted from the release of reserves specific to tax years where the statute of limitations has now expired and adjustments to our 2011 provision as we have now finalized and filed the related returns. Excluding onetime benefits, our third quarter tax provision would have been approximately $38 million higher.","Our net income was $183 million or $4.46 per share compared with $122 million or $3.05 per share for the third quarter of 2011 and $155 million or $3.75 per share for the third quarter of -- for the second quarter of 2012. Excluding the onetime tax benefits, our third quarter net income would have been $145 million or $3.54 per share.","Let me quickly summarize our results for the first 9 months of 2012. Procedures grew by 25%. Total revenue was $1,570,000,000, up 25% compared with $1,261,000,000 last year. The revenue increase included recurring revenue growth of 27% and an increase in systems revenue of 21%. Year-to-date operating income was $630 million, up 27% compared with $495 million last year. Operating income included $115 million of stock-based compensation charges compared with $102 million in 2011. Net income was $482 million or $11.72 per share compared with $344 million or $8.55 per share last year. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $597 million compared with $464 million last year.","Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash and investments of $2.7 billion, up $70 million compared with June 30, 2012. The increase was driven by $246 million of cash flows from operations plus $38 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $170 million in stock buybacks and $17 million of capital and IP purchases. We bought back 343,000 shares at an average price of $495 per share, and we have $383 million board-authorized buybacks remaining.","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks, who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights.","Aleks Cukic","Thank you, Marshall. During the third quarter, we sold 155 da Vinci systems, 114 in the United States, 13 into Europe and 28 into rest of world markets. As part of the 155 system sales, 8 Standard da Vinci systems and 26 da Vinci S Systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si Systems. We had a net 121 system additions to the installed base during the quarter, which brings to 2,462 the cumulative number of da Vinci systems worldwide, 1,789 in the U.S., 400 in Europe and 273 in rest of world markets. 79 of the 155 systems installed during the quarter represented repeat system sales to existing customers. In total, 139 of the 155 systems sold represented da Vinci Si or Si-e Systems, which included 20 dual console systems. The 41 system sales internationally included 16 into Japan, 4 into Australia and 3 into Belgium. The 16 systems placed in Japan establishes it as our second largest da Vinci market worldwide with 70 placements. With the exception of Europe, our da Vinci system performance remained very solid.","Clinically, we do not meet our procedure expectations for the quarter, achieving year-over-year procedure growth of approximately 22%. The shortfall can be attributed to 2 factors: a larger-than-expected decline in our U.S. dVP business and procedure underperformance in Europe. The pressure we face within our U.S. dVP business can be traced to both conservative PSA screening protocols and a change in treatment recommendations for low-risk cancer patients away from definitive treatment. Our EU procedure business shortfall is a bit more complex to define as it appears to be both macroeconomic and structural in nature, as Gary stated. With the exception of these 2 areas, procedure performance was solid.","Growth during the quarter was led by the categories of general surgery and GYN. Procedures, which included da Vinci Hysterectomy, Cholecystectomy, Colon and Rectal Resections, Lobectomy, Endometriosis Resections, Sacrocolpopexies, Myomectomy, Mitral Valve Repair and Nephrectomy all displayed solid growth. Recently released new products continue to do well, most notably Single-Site. Early customer feedback has been positive, and our initial sales have been strong. Clinical awareness for da Vinci Single-Site Cholecystectomy was very apparent at the recent American College of Surgery conference held in Chicago, the clinical presentations that were delivered drew large audiences with both U.S. and international surgeons participating.","Through the third quarter, we sold Single-Site instrument and accessory kits to over 350 U.S. customers. Our recently launched Vessel Sealer product was also favorably received at this conference with most of the interest coming from colorectal and advanced general surgery clinicians. This product is performing well in the field, and the feature set, specifically the articulated risk design, appears to be satisfying a strong market need. The customer adoption for both da Vinci Simulator and Firefly continues to expand with 87 customers purchasing a da Vinci Simulator and 64 customers purchasing Firefly systems as part of their initial system purchases this quarter.","During the quarter, several hundred robotic abstracts and papers representing a variety of surgical specialties were published within various peer-reviewed journals, while quarterly conferences produced several live da Vinci procedure transmissions, postgraduate robotic courses, podium presentations and clinical poster sessions. Much of our early general surgery success has been within procedures that are deemed difficult to perform. Near the top of that category is low rectal cancer surgery.","In recent edition of the Annals of Surgery, a prospective study entitled Impact of Robotic Surgery on Sexual and Urinary Functions After Fully Robotic Nerve-Sparing Total Mesorectal Excision for Rectal Cancer described the results of 74 da Vinci Rectal Resections completed at the European Institute of Oncology in Milan, Italy. Urinary and sexual functions are recognized as -- dysfunctions, excuse me, are recognized as serious complications within rectal surgery but have yet to be reported on robotically, which was the aim of the study. 74 patients undergoing fully robotic resection for rectal cancer were prospectively included in the study.","Urinary and sexual dysfunctions affecting quality of life were assessed with specific self-administered questionnaires in all patients undergoing robotic total mesorectal excision, and the results were calculated using validated scoring systems and statistically analyzed. The analysis showed that the sexual function and general sexual satisfaction initially decreased 1 month post surgery for erectile function and general satisfaction in men and for arousal and general satisfaction, respectively, in women. Subsequent testing showed that both parameters increased progressively. And at 12 months post surgery, the values were comparable to presurgical baselines. Concerning urinary function, the grade of incontinence measured 1 year after intervention was consistent to presurgical measurements in both sexes.","The study conclusion was, and I quote, \"Robotic total mesorectal excision allows for preservation of urinary and sexual functions.\" The authors went on to say that this is most likely due to their ability to perform superior wristed movements, fine dissection, coupled with a stable magnified 3D view when working around the inferior hypogastric plexus.","Consistent with the theme of difficult to perform general surgical procedures is a paper out of the University of Pittsburgh Medical center, which recently published in the Annals of Surgery. The paper entitled Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Distal Pancreatectomy is Superior to Laparoscopic Technique described the technical limitations of the laparoscopic approach and how it may limit patient eligibility and require conversion to open or hand-assisted surgery to maintain patient safety. The study compared the perioperative outcomes, 90-day morbidity and mortality of their first 30 robotic distal pancreatectomies to a historical control of 94 consecutive laparoscopic distal pancreatectomies. They reported that the postoperative length of hospital stay and rates of pancreatic fistula blood transfusions and readmissions were not statistically different between the groups. However, for patients in the robotic group, the conversion rate to open surgery was 0 as compared to the lap group of 16%, which significantly reduced the risk of excessive blood loss. Also of note was that more pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas were approached robotically than laparoscopically, 43% compared to 15%. Oncologic outcomes in these cases were superior for the robotic-assisted group with higher rates of margin negative resection and improved lymph node yields for both benign and malignant lesions.","The author's conclusion, and I quote, \u201cRobotic distal pancreatectomies were equivalent to laparoscopic distal pancreatectomies in nearly all measurements of outcome and safety but significantly reduced the risk of conversion to open resection despite a statistically greater probability of malignancy in the robotic cohort. We concluded that robotic assistance may broaden indications for minimally invasive pancreatectomy.\"","From time to time, we will read critical reviews relating to the cost of robotic surgery where the underlying comparator is usually laparoscopic or laparoscopically assisted surgery. Some comparisons have lumped several procedures into the same analysis, labeling them all as robotic, while others have looked at each procedure individually. While it would be presumptuous to dismiss all previous analysis as incorrect, it would be accurate to point out that every procedure has its own economic profile and can only be compared accordingly.","In a recent edition of the Journal of Endourology, a study entitled Cost Analysis of Robotic-Assisted Versus Hand-Assisted Laparoscopic Partial Nephrectomy reviewed the economics for one of our largest and most successful procedures, partial nephrectomy. The aim of the study was to perform a cost comparison of 3 approaches to partial nephrectomy, those being open, partial nephrectomy, hand-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy and robotic partial nephrectomy. The retrospective analysis evaluated cost and clinical data from 89 patients who had undergone the 3 surgical approaches. Baseline demographic data, patient comorbidities, nephrometry score and perioperative outcomes were assessed. Costs and subcosts from the operating room and hospital were evaluated using nonparametric statistical analysis. Since the patient comorbidities and tumor characteristics were different in the open partial nephrectomy cohort, it was excluded from the cost comparison, thus allowing for an apples-to-apples comparison between hand-assist laparoscopic partial nephrectomy and robotic partial nephrectomy.","The study found no difference in overall costs between hand-assist and robotic partial nephrectomy. OR costs were higher for the robotic partial nephrectomy because of the higher robotic capital and reusable equipment cost that outweighed the cost of disposable product for the hand-assist laparoscopic partial nephrectomy group. OR time-related costs were similar between the groups. Robotic partial nephrectomy patients had a shorter length of stay, which decreased postoperative hospital costs. They concluded by saying, and I quote, \"No difference in overall cost was found between robotic partial nephrectomy and hand-assist laparoscopic partial nephrectomies. Robot allocation, OR equipment used and length of stay are important determinants of total cost. Further study regarding recovery and quality of life may reveal added benefits to minimally invasive approach and increased use in nephron-sparing surgery.\"","This concludes my comments, and I'll now turn the time over to Calvin.","Calvin Darling","Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing you with an update to our financial forecast for 2012, including procedures, revenues and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates of significant noncash expenses to provide you with visibility into our expected future cash flows.","Starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecast procedures to grow approximately 25% to 27% from the base of approximately 360,000 procedures performed in 2011. Three quarters through 2012, our procedure growth stands at approximately 25%. During the third quarter, we saw further pressure on our U.S. dVP both volumes and upon our overall European procedure business. As a result, we now forecast full year 2012 da Vinci procedure volume to grow approximately 24% above our 2011 total.","Moving on to revenues. On our last call, we forecast 2012 revenues to grow between 20% and 23% above our 2011 revenue of $1.76 billion. As we enter the fourth quarter, we are now able to refine our guidance to the upper half of this range.","Now turning to noncash expenses. We continue to expect noncash stock compensation to fall within a range of between $152 million and $156 million for the year. Through 3 quarters of this year, $115 million of stock compensation has been recognized, and all of the quarterly timing differences related to our revised 2012 employee grant process have cycled through. The Q4 portion of total 2012 option expense should follow historical patterns.","Now turning to other income. On our last call -- operating income. On our last call, we forecast operating income to fall within a range of between 39% and 40% of net revenue. Now based upon the impact of recent material cost reductions and expense timing, we expect operating income to come in at the high end of the range at about 40% for the year. We continue to expect other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income, to total between $16 million and $17 million for the year.","With regard to income tax, our Q3 reported tax rate of 15% reflected a discrete benefit related to releasing reserves for tax years where the statutes of limitations had expired. This discrete item favorably impacted Q3 but will not impact Q4. We continue to expect the Q4 tax rate to be approximately 31% of pretax income, which has not assumed any reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.","Going forward into 2013, we expect to see a gradual reduction in rate to a range of between 29% and 31%. Also looking into 2013, the medical device tax is scheduled to become effective on January 1. Based upon our 2012 regional and product mix, we would estimate the tax to equate to roughly 1.1% of our net consolidated revenue. We would plan to record the expense as a component of cost of sales. We estimate that our share count for calculating EPS in Q4 2012 will be roughly flat to Q3 at approximately 41.1 million shares.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question in queue from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Gary or Aleks or anyone for that matter, just thinking about the third quarter kind of from the macro perspective, it looks like the third quarter is a lot like the second quarter. We saw significant Japan strength and U.S. de novo system strength offset by Europe, and we saw dVP U.S. and OUS weakness offset, obviously, by dVH, as well as some general surgery improvements. So do you have sort of any sense the fourth quarter guidance sort of implies stable trends on procedures with the third quarter? Do you have any sense of the balance of these positive and negative forces? How many quarters do you think this could persist?","Gary S. Guthart","It\u2019s Gary. It's pretty hard to call U.S. prostatectomy. That's, as you know, more an issue of medical management and watchful waiting than it is a change in da Vinci Surgery versus other kinds of surgery. So we don't have a crystal ball as to where that procedure is going to go over time. The data we look at is probably pretty similar to the data that you look at in terms of where PSA testing is taking us. On the upside, I think the things that are growing, we can measure good interest from our customers. We can measure sales force activity that tends to be a little bit more on our camp versus out in the world. So on the downside, pretty tough to call. On the upside, we can look at the activities that we can influence and feel pretty confident about the things that we can do.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Gary, just following up on one of those key catalysts, which, obviously, is single incision. I don't know if I caught it on the call, but could you sort of confirm whether sales has sort of moved into your third largest procedure for the company?","Gary S. Guthart","We have talked about before that cholecystectomy has a total procedure of all types, multiport and single-site. Together, combined, is the third. Single port on its own is not.","Aleks Cukic","It's important to note that, as a reminder, of course, it's a distant third. I mean, you have hysterectomy, you have prostatectomy and you have cholecystectomy. And so you have other procedures that are sort of in the general neighborhood procedures such as a partial nephrectomy and sacrocolpopexy and others. So it is indeed third, but as a reminder, it is a distant third.","Gary S. Guthart","There's one more difference that's worth pointing out, is that unlike prostatectomy and hysterectomy, cholecystectomy can be an entry point into a clinical pathway for somebody who wants to end somewhere else. And so those procedures can be a little bit more volatile.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then, Gary, just one quick one. I apologize for 2, 3 questions. But you talked about an increase in spending for both U.S. general surgery. And potentially, I would imagine if you're going to go after Europe and change structurally how you're selling that it could be increased expense. Could you help us sort of frame those relative expenses versus other very significant sales investments you've made, perhaps the 2010 significant investment in the U.S.?","Gary S. Guthart","This won't quite be the same scale. It's a little bit more targeted. So in Europe, it's really filling open headcount in the field and investing a little bit more in the back office in terms of clinical trials and other types of marketing investments, economic analyses and so on. So that's kind of what the European side looks like on the general surgery side. It will be general-surgery focused expertise and depth.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Gary, can you break down the procedure growth for us between the U.S., Europe and ROW?","Gary S. Guthart","I'll turn it to Calvin.","Calvin Darling","Right. So the procedure growth -- let me find that. Go ahead.","Marshall L. Mohr","Total procedure growth quarter -- year-over-year was 22%. And then what we said was that the procedure growth outside of the U.S. year-over-year was 9%.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. So was the U.S. close to around 30%? It wouldn't be that high?","Calvin Darling","Yes, I mean, you could probably back into it on your models there. But again, worldwide, we're looking at about 22% for Q3, 25% on a year-to-date basis. And included in those numbers would be a decline in the U.S. dVP volume that Marshall mentioned of 20% on a quarter basis and 14% on a year-to-date basis. And so I think kind of what it implies is that if the U.S. stayed flat from year to year, the worldwide growth would have been about 26% in Q3 and 28% on a year-to-date basis.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Right. I guess what I'm getting at is dVP is down 20% in the U.S. If you were on a base of, say, 75,000 cases for '11, if that's down 20% full year, you're talking something in the low 60,000 cases, negative 15,000 at the most, 12,000 to 15,000. If dVH has grown 60,000 and chole is adding 10,000 and all the other stuff is adding another 30,000, 40,000, 50,000, you end up with robust procedure growth in the United States. And the real evidence of the problem is obviously Europe, which is macro, and some concern about, obviously, dVP. But at some point, dVP has to bottom. And so the question becomes, is there sort of a structural level of prostatectomy that we can think about where this will shake out over the course of, call it, 6, 8 quarters and we\u2019ll end up at maybe a the rate of 50,000 dVPs in the U.S.? Does that make sense?","Gary S. Guthart","The flow of your argument makes sense. I think that Calvin may argue with you about some of the numbers. Just to make sure that you're tie them out right. But the flow, generally speaking, the flow makes sense. Calling that number of kind of what the baseline number of prostatectomies in the U.S. is hard to do. We've seen some analysis out there that's probably similar to the kinds of analysis that you've seen, and I think we're just going to have to see where that base establishes itself. I mean, I think there are a couple of things that argue for a base. One of them is that prostate cancer, the highest cure rate will come from surgery, not from medical management. And the other thing that we know is that over time, watchful waiting patients, some fraction of them, usually a majority of them, will convert to definitive treatment over time. So I think both of those things will argue for finding a floor, and what exactly that floor level is, we're just going to have to wait and see.","Aleks Cukic","Yes. But I think, Ben, the central theme of your thesis there is accurate. And that is if you look outside of those 2 areas, U.S. dVP and the European weakness, the remainder of the procedure business was very strong year-to-date and for the quarter.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And I'll sneak in one more as well, if you look at Japan, we've done some calls recently, and it sounds as though the Japanese government has authorized funding for about 150 systems. And our sources were sort of indicating that, that could come into play by the end of '13, and certainly 16 in the third quarter goes a long way towards that. Is that consistent with sustaining this sort of 16 or pretty substantial rate? And is that a reasonable target for an installed base kind of going out of '13?","Gary S. Guthart","Yes. I don't think we're ready to size the total market opportunity. And I think that system sales by themselves are going to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, and I would expect some lumpiness. Long term, we're really excited about the Japanese market opportunity. The key opinion leaders, the people we talked to on the ground are excited about robotic surgery. And we think it will build, and that's another area of investment. But again, kind of calling the specifics is not something we're prepared to do.","Aleks Cukic","Yes, I think there's just one caveat that's worth mentioning, is as a reminder, we have one national reimbursement, which is prostatectomy. There are ways for it, as evidenced by the activities prior to that national reimbursement, that hospitals can go through that's, call them, a one-off basis or a checklist basis where they can apply for certain levels of reimbursement on other procedures. But from a national perspective, we are really in this environment where we are working within prostatectomy primarily. And then there may be a few other procedures that get worked in on a one-off basis. So that's the environment we're in for a little while.","Calvin Darling","Yes. The next scheduled pass, that procedure being added to the reimbursement list would be April of 2014 for a general system-wide reimbursement.","Gary S. Guthart","Based on the way that MHLW runs the review.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question maybe on chole, wondering if you could just give us a little bit of a breakdown as to how much of the chole uptake is single-site versus multi-arm. And are you starting to see chole drive system placements?","Calvin Darling","I think we're not prepared to break out what that mix is. And honestly, I think the important message here is that -- is to just really look at this structurally. You have general surgeons who don't have a lot of robotic experience going in. And so they are going to work through various procedures to some level to make sure that they have a good understanding of the Xs and Os of the system. And then what is today a general multiport cholecystectomy, the expectation is that those move in to single-site. So there will be a relationship, and I think trying to call it at any given time is probably -- I don't know how meaningful that is. But collectively, as we said, it is the third largest procedure. Now we -- I think the way we would categorize the importance of procedures as they relate to new system placements, it's hard to tease out what is cholecystectomy and what is general surgery because to Gary's earlier comments, sometimes cholecystectomy is not the endpoint which the general surgeons are trying to get to. And so it becomes one of many procedures that they see in our armamentarium over time. And so it's really hard to say what evidence we have at this point that it's chole specific that is driving the system. But there's definite evidence that general surgeons are becoming more and more important to system placements.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then in your commentary, you talked about additional indications for Single-Site, benign hysterectomy and nephrectomy, can you just talk about how you think about those opportunities and then how much you want to push through Single-Site versus -- at some point, is it logical to introduce a new system?","Gary S. Guthart","Yes. On the first side, we think that hysterectomy is a patient population that sets up well for a single port robotic approach. And we've gotten good feedback from customers in Europe and the U.S. that that\u2019s something worth pursuing, and so that's been our next procedure, that and nephrectomy. We'll see in terms of what happens next after Single-Site. We'll continue to invest in instrumentation that makes sense in that platform and in indications. I don't think that will be the last stopping point in terms of an indication for Single-Site as we go forward. And as always, we continue to invest in technologies that can make things more capable, and we invest in tissue interaction technologies. We invest in patient access, smaller ports in different ways to get into the body. And with regard to Single-Site, we'll continue to do that.","Marshall L. Mohr","Yes. I think the way we think about, for example, the Single-Site in GYN or benign hysterectomy is if you think about the way we've always described the market, there is a level of complexity that was inherent in our target for hysterectomy, both benign, complex benign, as well as malignant. And so there's a subsegment of the market that is by definition, if you will, relatively less complex or simple. It seems like a very good area for us to apply some resources and see if this is indeed something we can access with new technology, which is the approach.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just one last one because I'm sure we'll all get the question. In terms of the stapler, I mean, based on your actions with FDA, are you still thinking this could come by year end? Or should we think about SAGES next year? Just how do we think about timing there?","Gary S. Guthart","It's always hard to predict exactly timing on these things, and so I won't -- we've had a healthy conversation with FDA. We've understood their questions. I think that we have provided answers that make sense, and we'll let you know what happens thereafter.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from the line of Lennox Ketner with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Lennox Ketner - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First question, it sounds like you're seeing a lot of good momentum in Japan. I'm wondering if you could just comment on what Japan contributed to either overall procedure growth in the quarter or to the 9% international growth.","Gary S. Guthart","Just in a broad brush, it's growing nicely, out from a very small base. So in-country, we're delighted with the growth rate. In terms of total contribution to the overall, it's probably not a material contribution at this time.","Lennox Ketner - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just to go back to Europe, Gary, you talked about the fact that it's partly the macro environment and partly structural, which it sounds like you're working to address on the structural issues. But I'm wondering if you could just give a little more detail on what those structural issues are. From my conversations with some European physicians, it sounds like 2 of the challenges over there are, one, that in some countries, there are per diem reimbursement systems. To me, it makes the length of stay reduction less valuable upfront, but then also, just the fact that there's less competition among hospitals. Are those kind of the 2 main structural issues? Or is there something I'm missing there that you guys are working to address?","Gary S. Guthart","I think there are a couple of things. One of the structural things is just open territories on our side and making sure we have the right number of salespeople in the various countries, and we can run that against internal metrics. So it's pretty simple one. And the solution there is to make sure that we're fully staffed. The second thing, or more along the lines you've discussed, although I described it a little bit differently. I think it is not really that a single-payer system is not capable or interested in adopting da Vinci Surgery. We've seen Japan single-payer system that's been moving pretty quickly. Sweden as a single-payer system has moved quickly. So it isn't the act of being a single payer. It's more of making sure that the conversations with government-run hospitals around both economy value and clinical data are put into forms that they can accept and we can match their time lines. You're absolutely right with regard to systems that are using per diem, but that's a real challenge for hospitals to adopt da Vinci Surgery. We see per diem systems being challenged in favor of DRGs in a lot of different places, not only for da Vinci. I think the trend is away from per diem, not towards it. And so I don't see that as systemic across all of Europe but really in pockets.","Operator","Our next questions in queue will come from line of Lawrence Keusch with Raymond James.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just to pick up on that question. Could you talk a little bit about perhaps where you are seeing some of the procedure pressures within Europe? Is it more directed at Southern Europe? And just really trying to get a sense of whether anything is changing out there.","Gary S. Guthart","You see capital pressure in Southern Europe, absolutely. Procedure pressure is a little bit less targeted directly with Southern versus Northern, and so it moves around a little bit.","Marshall L. Mohr","So if you looked at -- and again, I think it almost takes even a little, perhaps, a derivative deeper. So if you looked at environments like public hospitals in France, let's say, versus clinics in France and\/or private clinics in other parts of Europe, it becomes, probably, more akin to those comparisons than it does just individual countries. And we've had strength in Germany over -- not this particular quarter, but in the past 2 years, we've called out Germany as having a lot of strength. This is the first time we've called out Belgium in probably a few -- probably 1.5 years. So it seems like it's rotating through various countries, but it's probably more consistent with the public versus private.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just 2 other quick ones. As you noted, benign hysterectomy and oophorectomy for Single-Site, how dependent -- in getting into those procedures, how dependent then is it on the need for new instrumentation? And if so, what might be the timing on that? And then lastly, you utilized cash this quarter to buy back stock. You still have a lot. So again, if you could just remind us of the general uses of cash.","Gary S. Guthart","On the issue of Single-Site, as we've said before, we've just submitted and received our first round of questions from FDA on the extension of our indications for Single-Site into hysterectomy and oophorectomy. I think there that we have, as you know, good momentum in hysterectomy, I think it goes into a set of surgeons who are interested in robotic surgery and towards the segment of the patient population that would be interested in [indiscernible] and return to full function. So we're excited about that. I think it will make some sense. We're in the early stages of our interactions with FDA. How long that will take, it's very tough to predict, and so we won't.","Marshall L. Mohr","Yes. As far as the instruments, Larry, I would say the -- which is pretty consistent with the way we've approached new markets and new procedure targets, where we have a good base of instruments, but we're not exactly optimized for perfect performance, if you will, in terms of ease of use and having all of the right instruments. But think of it in terms of adding a few instruments rather than creating a whole new category of instruments. And I think that will be -- that's been consistent and will be consistent as we go into new procedure targets.","Gary S. Guthart","With regard to uses of cash, I'll turn that to Marshall.","Marshall L. Mohr","Yes. So we bought back 343,000 shares this quarter. We have 383 million still authorized by the board. We'll continue to program. We'll buy back stock when it makes sense. It's not a absolutely certain amount every day. Beyond that, the cash is there for investment back into the business over time, particularly if there were to be an extended or deepened economic issue on a macro basis, as well as for investment into IP if the opportunities come up.","Gary S. Guthart","Or other technologies.","Marshall L. Mohr","Yes.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from David Roman with Goldman Sachs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was hoping if I could focus a little bit on the spending side of the equation. Obviously, you had guided to the $20 million sequential uptick this quarter versus the second quarter. But if I just look to the income statement, SG&A still being down as a percentage of sales year-over-year. So if you take out of the options grant this quarter, can you maybe talk about your spending priorities? It sounds like you have a lot on deck here in terms of investing in new procedure categories, trying to fend off the assault on dVP, rebuilding your Europe presence, yet SG&A is still growing slower than revenue. That's -- and then I have a follow-up.","Marshall L. Mohr","Yes. We'll talk just on the numbers side, and I'll hand it over. We've guided towards about $20 million increase in operating expenses quarter-to-quarter. It came in closer to $17.5 million. So a little bit less than that. And I think it had a little bit to do with the timing here. We called out R&D projects last quarter. Some of those you're going to see probably spilling into future quarters. And then I think the timing on SG&A that you alluded to, David, we're starting on some things that we thought we might be -- it might have been a little further along here in Q3 in terms of building the organization and the training capacities and so on. So in terms of the numbers, that, I think, the grow -- you're going to see some growth in the OpEx going forward into Q4, and that's inherent in the 40% operating income guidance we gave.","Gary S. Guthart","I think we've laid out for you the things that we think are deserving of differential or additional investment. We've typically been thoughtful about how we invest. And we don't trend to mad dash one direction or another. And so we'll be building it out, but we'll build it out against the plan.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then Japan, which has obviously been very successful for you particularly since you got the reimbursement in April, can we maybe talk about the sustainability of that business you referenced, I think, in your prepared remarks that there is some spillover of the dVP concerns of the U.S. into Europe? And obviously, Japan has had a much more nascent stage in its ramp, so you probably wouldn't have seen it at this point. But any concerns on that transpiring Japan? And how we should think about growth in that business over the next 12 months or so?","Gary S. Guthart","On the dVP side, actually the uptick has been significant in terms of dVP in Japan relative to the number of prostatectomies that they do. We do dominate it in prostatectomies based on what they've been doing there. We haven't heard a reflection of this set of concerns into Japan. It's not to say that it might not happen in the future, it might. In general, I think that Japanese surgeons have expressed interest in da Vinci for a pretty broad variety of procedures. So even where that's to be pressured over time, I don't know that it would dampen enthusiasm for a long period for other procedures as we go. Quarter-to-quarter performance can be lumpy there.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sure. And then maybe just one really quick clarification question. From an EPS perspective, this quarter, the $4.46 you reported includes the tax benefit that you discussed. Are you pointing people toward the non-GAAP number or the GAAP $4.46 in terms of the ongoing earnings number for the quarter?","Marshall L. Mohr","So we give you the $4.46, which is the GAAP number. But we also said that if you excluded that, we would have been at $3.54. So we're trying to provide you with all the information so that you can do your own comparisons.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from the line of Jeremy Feffer with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","I wanted to come back to your comments on this sales with simulators, Firefly, dual consoles. It seemed like sequentially, those were down even though total da Vinci sales were up sequentially. Is there anything to read into that? Are some customers looking at more defeatured units? Or is that just a complete coincidence?","Gary S. Guthart","Yes, it's definitely trended down. I think on the Firefly side though, it's pretty similar. We've been saying about the last 3 quarters that about 1\/2 of the U.S. systems have gone out with Firefly configuration, and that held through in Q3. As it relates to the dual console and the simulator, those kind of go together in some respects as they're, in large part, training tools and applications. And a slow downward trend there is something that we would have predicted internally here as maybe a fair number of sites have invested in these technologies for training. And then as you know, a lot of systems we sell now are to existing customers, and some of those existing customers already have simulators and dual consoles. So it's maybe less obvious value in those situations. So a little downward trend there is probably something we would expect, but very gradual.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And quick follow-up on revenue per procedure. I heard the comments on timing of stocking and distributor orders. Is this a run rate that we should be expecting now going forward? Obviously, you've been trending up with a lot of the new instruments. But with a lot of those now in there, is this more of a comfortable run rate?","Gary S. Guthart","Yes. I mean, we've been seeing the run-up, as you say, in recent quarters due to the impact of the new products. And what we've been saying, there are a lot of factors that can serve to move that metric up or down. And in this particular quarter, as Marshall called out in his commentary, we saw some of the timing of those initial stocking orders with system sales and distributor orders kind of serve to drive it slightly down here. But I'd say going forward, it could go up or down, depending -- we also some of the product -- the procedure mix, right? So the more Single-Sites and benign hysterectomies have a lower revenue per procedure for us, kind of pushes it down. So again, I'd say going forward, it could probably go either way from where we are right now.","Calvin Darling","That was the last question. As we have said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma.","We hope the following experience from Susan of Ohio gives you some sense of what this means in the lives of our patients. \"I was diagnosed in August of 2011 with adenocarcinoma. I'm a mom of 5, grandma of 11 and 52 years old. I quit smoking years ago. Wow, I had a lot to think about when, by God's grace, I was introduced to a super surgeon. At the time, he thought I would be a really great candidate for the da Vinci robotic-assisted surgery. I figured it sounded really great. We did the surgery in December of 2011. At first, when I started reading about it on websites and talking with people, it sounded really scary. But after reading testimonies like mine, I realized it was the only way to go. And so we removed the top lobe of my left lung in December of 2011. I was home in 2 days. The nurses at the hospital could not believe the type of surgery I'd had. Wow, how the robot changed my life. In no time, I was back to a normal life. My surgeon is one of the best around and I am living proof. He saved my life, saved me from a grueling recovery and saved me from a horrific scar. I had a few little holes and a small incision where they removed the lung. While they were in there, they took lymph nodes, which, by the way, are great. No cancer and a 20% chance that this cancer comes back. If you're considering this type of surgery, I urge you to really think positively about this. Just absolutely amazing what modern medicine is all about. I would welcome the chance to have the surgery versus the old-fashioned way. Recovery was 2 weeks, and I was back to work in 3. It's a miracle that they can do these things with a robot, but they do.\"","Patients like these are our strongest advocates for da Vinci Surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We've built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference.","This concludes today's call.

With me today we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Patrick Clingan, Senior Director of Finance.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 2, 2016. These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's EDGAR database. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.","Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website.","Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our first quarter financial results, Patrick will discuss marketing and clinical highlights, and I will provide our updated financial outlook for 2016. And finally, we will host the question-and-answer session.","With that, I'll turn it over to Gary.","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on the call today. Our first quarter company performance was strong with excellent global procedure growth, solid capital placements, improving product margins and important new product launches.","Turning first to procedures, global procedure growth for the quarter was nearly 17%, led by growth in general surgery, growth in the use of da Vinci Surgical Systems outside the United States, continued growth in U.S. urology and modest growth in U.S. gynecology.","Trends in U.S. general surgery growth continued with strong growth in inguinal hernia repair and ventral hernia repair followed by continued growth in colorectal surgery. Customer feedback and commitment to the use of da Vinci in performing inguinal hernia repair for complex conditions has been encouraging in the quarter, increasing our confidence in its long-term acceptance.","Procedure growth was variable by country in Europe, with solid performance in the United Kingdom and Germany offsetting slower growth in the Nordic countries. Performance in the quarter was helped by an extra procedure day in some regions relative to Q1 of 2015. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call.","We placed 110 da Vinci Systems in the quarter, up from 99 in Q1 of 2015. Customers continue to purchase our Xi Systems over less expensive and less capable Si models by a factor of approximately three to one. Capital performance was strong in United States, offsetting capital softness in Europe and the exploration of our quota in China.","Lastly, customer leasing and lease to own arrangements are making up a greater percentage of new system placements. Marshall will take you through our finances in more detail later in the call.","Our operations teams remained focused on optimizing our manufacturing, design and supply chains for our newer products. Our teams continued to execute against their goals with steady improvements in reducing product costs for our new systems, advanced instruments in the quarter.","Product cost reductions exceeded our expectations, and we expect them to continue to improve in 2016 and 2017. Our offerings make up an ecosystem designed to meet our customers' needs in building and running outstanding robotic surgery programs.","This ecosystem includes systems and instruments and accessories, training technologies and peer-to-peer course work, service offerings, and program optimization and analytic support. As a result of the set of products and services that surround our systems, recurring revenue in the quarter comprised 75% of total company revenue.","Highlights of the first quarter operating results are as follows. Procedures grew nearly 17% over the first quarter of last year. We shipped 110 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 99 in the first quarter of 2015. Revenue for the quarter was $595 million, up 12% over the prior year. Pro forma gross profit margin was 70% compared to 65.6% in the first quarter of last year.","Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $322 million, up 16%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $447 million, representing 75% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $229 million in the quarter, up 24% from the first quarter of last year, and pro forma net income was $170 million, up 27% from Q1 of 2015.","We continue to enable our Xi platform with new product launches. Our launch of intraoperative Table Motion is proceeding well with order flow that has met our expectations and with strong customer feedback on its utility, particularly in general surgery. In the quarter, we also launched our 30-millimeter Xi stapler designed to facilitate stapling in thoracic procedures and our Xi Single-Site instrument and accessory kit. Both are 30-millimeter stapler, and our Xi Single-Site instruments have started clinical use with positive feedback on their utility. Our Sp program remains on track.","As our business has strengthened, we have increased our mid- and long-term investments in research and development. We have been increasing our investments in imaging, analytics and new product architectures based on our belief that substantial opportunity exists to enable better outcomes and to expand our access to our technologies globally. Calvin will take you through our projected spending later in the call.","As we move forward in 2016, we're focused on the following: first, expanding the use of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair; second, advancing our ecosystem including expanding our Xi line and taking our Sp product into initial clinical use; third, driving our organizational capabilities end markets in Europe and Asia; and finally, assisting our customers in their efforts to maximize the comprehensive value of their programs.","I'll now turn the call over to Marshall who will review financial highlights.","Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Gary. I will be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis which excludes legal settlements and claim accruals, stock-based compensation, and amortization of purchased IP. We provide pro forma information because we believe the business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion.","First quarter revenue was $595 million, an increase of 12% compared with $532 million for the first quarter of 2015 and a decrease of 12% compared with the seasonally stronger fourth quarter of $677 million.","First quarter 2016 procedures of approximately 176,000 increased nearly 17% compared with the first quarter of 2015 and decreased slightly compared with the fourth quarter procedures of approximately 177,000. Year-over-year procedure growth was driven by general surgery procedures in the U.S., in urology worldwide and otherwise likely benefited from an additional calendar day associated with leap year.","Revenue highlights are as follows. Instrument and accessory revenue of $322 million increased 16% compared with last year and decreased 1% compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. These changes generally reflect changes in procedures. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial staffing orders, was approximately $1,830 per procedure. This metric continues to fluctuate in a tight range from approximately $1,830 and $1,840 per procedure. Relative to the first quarter of 2015, the current quarter reflects higher sales of advanced instruments, offset by the impact of customer buying patterns and foreign exchange.","System revenue of $148 million increased 5% compared with last year and decreased 36% compared with last quarter. The increase relative to the prior year primarily reflects increased revenue associated with operating lease activities and slightly higher average system selling prices. The decrease relative to the fourth quarter primarily reflects seasonally lower unit sales and slightly lower ASPs, partially offset by increased revenue associated with operating lease activities.","110 systems were placed in the first quarter compared with 99 systems in the first quarter of 2015 and 158 systems last quarter. Approximately 77% of the systems shipped in the quarter were Xi's, which is comparable to prior quarters.","Hospitals financed approximately 37% of the systems placed in the first quarter, up from 17% last quarter. We directly financed 31 systems, including 19 operating leases. As of the end of the first quarter, there were 62 systems out in the field under operating leases.","We generated approximately $4 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter compared with $1 million in the first quarter of 2015 and $3 million in the fourth quarter. We also generated approximately $6 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with $2 million of revenue in the fourth quarter and no lease buyout revenue in the first quarter of last year.","We excluded the impact of operating leases from our system ASP calculations. Globally, our average system price of $1.500 million was approximately $30,000 higher than the first quarter of 2015 ASP and approximately $50,000 lower than the ASP last quarter. Relative to the prior year, the increase reflects a proportionately lower trade-in volume and favorable geographic mix, partially offset by an unfavorable product mix. The decrease relative to the fourth quarter reflects proportionately higher trade-in volume and lower mix of Xi dual consoles, partially offset by favorable geographic mix.","Service revenue of $125 million increased 9% year over year and increased approximately 4% compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect growth in our installed base of da Vinci Systems.","Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. First quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $164 million increased 9% compared with $150 million for the first quarter of 2015 and decreased 25% compared with a seasonally stronger fourth quarter of $219 million. The increase compared with the previous year is comprised of a 14% growth in recurring revenue, which is driven by procedure growth of 22%, and increased systems revenue of 2%. The decrease compared to the fourth quarter reflects seasonally strong fourth quarter systems placements, partially offset by a 5% growth in recurring revenue.","Outside the U.S., we placed 36 systems in the first quarter compared with 36 in the first quarter of 2015 and 75 last quarter. Current quarter system sales included five into China and eight into Japan. System placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy, as some of these markets are in their early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns, and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulation.","Moving on to the remainder of the P&L, the pro forma gross margin for the first quarter was 70% compared with 65.6% for the first quarter of 2015 and 69.6% for the fourth quarter of 2015. Compared with the first quarter of 2015, the higher gross margin reflects reduction of product and product repair costs, improved manufacturing operations efficiencies, the elimination of the medical device tax, lower costs associated with product field actions and related inventory charges, and a higher mix of instrument and accessory revenue.","The medical device tax has been suspended for the next two years and reduced our 2015 gross margin by approximately 70 basis points. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, our ability to further reduce product costs, manufacturing efficiency, costs associated with product field actions, and in the long-term, the potential reinstatement of the medical device tax.","Pro forma operating expenses, which exclude legal settlements and accruals for legal claims, stock compensation expense and amortization of purchased IP increased 14% compared with the first quarter of 2015 and increased 5% compared with last quarter. The increases over prior periods reflect increased investments in advanced imaging, advanced instrumentation and next-generation robotics, increased head count, and higher payroll taxes associated with stock option exercises.","Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 27.4% compared with an effective tax rate of 28.9% for the first quarter of 2015 and 24.9% last quarter. In late December 2015, Congress retroactively approved the 2015 federal research and development credit and made the R&D tax credit permanent going forward. The entire 2015 R&D tax credit was included in the fourth quarter, while no benefit was reflected in the first quarter of 2015 and a proportional benefit is reflected in the first quarter of 2016.","Other than the impact of the R&D credit, fluctuations in our tax rate between this quarter and the first and fourth quarters of 2015 primarily reflect changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income.","Our first quarter 2016 pro forma net income was $170 million or $4.42 per share compared with $135 million or $3.57 per share for the first quarter of 2015 and $224 million or $5.89 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015.","Note that fully diluted shares outstanding increased by approximately 400,000 shares relative to the fourth quarter resulting primarily from the increase in our share price. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends.","I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $595 million for the first quarter of 2016 compared with $532 million for the first quarter of 2015 and $677 million for the fourth quarter of 2015.","GAAP net income was $136 million or $3.54 per share for the first quarter of 2016 compared with $97 million or $2.57 per share for the first quarter of 2015 and $190 million or $4.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015.","We ended the year with cash and investments of $3.8 billion, up from $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by proceeds from stock option exercises and cash generated from operations. As our cash builds, we will continue to evaluate our approach to capital allocation.","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights.","Patrick Clingan - Finance Director","Thanks, Marshall. Of our first quarter procedure growth of nearly 17%, U.S. procedures grew approximately 15% and OUS procedures grew approximately 22%.","In the U.S., even though growth benefited from favorable operating days in the quarter, procedure growth outpaced our expectations. First quarter growth in our mature procedures continued at levels similar to the second half of 2015 generating majority of the procedure outperformance relative to our expectation. General surgery procedure growth also exceeded our expectations.","In U.S. urology, first quarter growth in da Vinci Prostatectomy and kidney procedures continued at similar rates at the second half of 2015. We continue to believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market, and we expect the prostatectomy group to return to levels similar to prostate cancer incident rates over time.","In U.S. gynecology, first quarter procedures grew modestly year-over-year, with growth led by malignant and complex hysterectomy. Continuing the trend from 2015, we estimate a larger proportion of da Vinci Hysterectomy procedures were performed by gynecologic oncologists during the first quarter. Similar to the fourth quarter, U.S. Single-Site gynecology procedure growth declined compared to the first quarter of 2015.","First quarter growth in U.S. general surgery procedure adoption remains strong, led by a robust growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures. Cholecystectomy procedures were roughly flat in the quarter, with growth in multi-port procedures offsetting declines in Single-Site procedures.","Q1 was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications evaluating da Vinci Surgery. Of these, I have selected a couple studies that you may find interesting. With the launch of our 30-millimeter stapler, surgeon interest in the use of da Vinci for thoracic surgery is growing. A new study comparing open video-assisted thoracic surgery, or VATS, and da Vinci Surgery for pulmonary lobectomy was published by Dr. Yang and colleagues from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in the Annals of Surgery.","Using a prospective database including 2,400 surgeries to treat stage 1 non-small cell lung cancer patients, the officers' propensity matched 470 patients across da Vinci, VATS and open surgery. The study found that da Vinci and minimally invasive VATS approaches enabled a shorter chest tube duration and length of hospital stay compared to open surgery.","Da Vinci Surgery was also credited with improved lymph node yields as compared to both open surgery and VATS, an important clinical outcome for determining next steps in the patient's treatment pathway.","As related to the expansion of da Vinci lung resections, the authors highlighted that nearly 57% of pulmonary lobectomies in the U.S. are treated with open surgery, and they see promise in expanding patient access to minimally invasive surgery through da Vinci technology.","Turning abroad, procedure growth outside of the United States was approximately 22% in the first quarter, led by the global adoption of da Vinci Prostatectomy with solid contributions from kidney procedures and colorectal resection. Compared to the second half of 2015, procedure growth slowed in both Europe and Asia during the quarter, in part due to the timing of the Easter holiday. Historically, our OUS procedure growth rates have been lumpy and less predictable in the short-term. We are focused on improving our OUS procedure performance.","In Japan, there were positive developments relating to reimbursement in the quarter. The MHLW approved for reimbursement of partial nephrectomy at a premium rate relative to open surgery and also approved clinical trial enrollment to begin supporting a sensionary OB (20:42) submission for da Vinci malignant hysterectomy.","A recent study funded by Intuitive and published in BJU International by Professor Hughes and colleagues from University of Chester collected data from the United Kingdom health episode statistics database, including more than 20,000 prostatectomy patients and 2,000 partial nephrectomy patients, to assess health resource utilization and cost, following da Vinci, open and laparoscopic procedures. The database showed that from 2008 to 2013, the use of da Vinci Surgery increased from 15% to 50% of prostatectomies and 1% to 22% of partial nephrectomies by displacing open surgery.","During the first year after the operation, da Vinci Surgery was shown to reduce inpatient admission, hospital bed days and total costs for both prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy compared to open surgery. At three years, post operation, the study showed similar outcomes for prostatectomy and was insufficient to draw conclusions for partial nephrectomy.","Laparoscopic surgery outcomes were at the approximate midpoint between da Vinci and open surgery on resource utilization and costs for both procedures. The authors concluded \"our analysis suggests that there are substantial savings associated with robotic-assisted surgery when compared with open and laparoscopic interventions.\"","This concludes my remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Calvin.","Calvin Darling - Senior Director-Finance, Investor Relations","Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2016. Starting with procedures, on our last call, we estimated full-year 2016 procedure growth of 9% to 12% above the approximately 652,000 procedures performed in 2015. Now, based upon favorable U.S. dVP and gynecology macro trends, and U.S. general surgery growth, we are increasing our estimate for 2016. We now anticipate full-year 2016 procedure growth within a range of 12% to 14%.","Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 68% and 69.5% of net revenue. We are now increasing our estimate. We now expect full-year 2016 pro forma gross profit to be within a range of between 69% and 70% of net revenue.","Turning to operating expenses. As we have described, we will be increasing our investments in key areas that will enable and drive the future of robotic-assisted surgery. On our last call, we forecast to grow pro forma 2016 operating expenses between 9% and 13% above 2015 levels. We are now increasing our estimate for operating expenses to a range of between 12% and 15% above 2015.","Consistent with our last call, we expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2016 compared to $168 million in 2015. We expect our 2016 other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to be in the upper end of the $20 million to $25 million range forecast on our last call.","With regard to income tax, we continue to expect our 2016 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5% and 28.5% of pre-tax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and OUS profits.","That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We have a question from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you. Two questions. But first of all, congrats on the great momentum in the business. I have a question on U.S. procedure volume growth and then on your comments on OpEx spend. First, on procedure volume growth, one, can you give us a sense of what you think you grew in the quarter on a same day selling basis? But then much more importantly, just give us a sense as to specifically which surgery types accelerated in the U.S. And what drove the growth? What caused the acceleration? Why did things get better?","Patrick Clingan - Finance Director","Hey, Bob, thanks for the question. From a same day selling perspective, estimating the impact of operating days is anything but an exact science. From a tailwind at leap year, that benefited the quarter and some modest benefit from the timing of new year's being on a Friday rather than a Thursday. And from a headwind perspective, you had the timing of Easter which moved from the second quarter into the first quarter. But that has more of an impact on the OUS geographies.","From what accelerated, the mature procedures sustained pretty strong growth in the quarter, as they saw throughout 2015, which was a little bit of a surprise to us relative to our initial expectations. And general surgery continues to be strong and growing off of a larger base which has more impact on the U.S. procedure growth number.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, well, for the follow-up, I wanted to ask Gary a question on OpEx spend because I think it's an important comment from you guys. Your spending in the quarter was high exactly as you said it would be. And now, you're raising that spend level even further. So can you just talk about where the incremental spend is going. What kind of new incremental technology announcements could that lead to? You mentioned a couple on the call, but I'm just really curious as to where the spending is going and when we could expect to get more visibility on the output from that spending.","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. So on the spend, I think the acceleration is really borne of confidence, confidence in the long-term viability of some of the markets and some of the things we're pursuing. You'll see it really cut into a couple of buckets. Some of it is investments in OUS markets where we think that we can do more by investing more, and we've been talking to you about that. The other side is on R&D.","And in terms of categories, we've talked about it before, but we believe in them deeply: advanced imagining, the ability to see beyond what you can just see with your naked eye; new robotic architectures that allow surgeons to get into and out of the body in different ways and to different places than they could reach prior; as well as analytics and over-the-shoulder guidance, all things that we have been investing in, some things that we're accelerating.","So we won't do product announcements on this call. As we get deeper into those things and are ready to share them more broadly with you, of course we will.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then lastly, just to get a sense, I thought I heard something about positive hysterectomy in Japan. It went by pretty quickly. Is there some positive momentum on hysterectomy in Japan from a reimbursement perspective?","Patrick Clingan - Finance Director","Yeah, Bob, the MHLW approved for a clinical trial to begin enrollment supporting malignant hysterectomy under the sensionary OB (28:17) process.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, it's been requested if you can limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, and we'll take additional questions as time permits. Our next question from Tycho Peterson, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thanks. I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about Table Motion, how many systems are installed that are capable, what percentage of systems I guess have the option included, and if you could just talk a little bit about how it flows through to gross margins as well. It's mainly a software upgrade from your perspective, right?","Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, we're pretty pleased with the level of adoption for Table Motion, where the information we're getting back from surgeons is they're pleased with its usage and its performance. We're not going to be disclosing every quarter just how many tables we've delivered, so I won't go there. I'll just tell you that, again, we're pretty pleased with the level of adoption.","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Obviously, the revenue and the margin side.","Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, the margins \u2013 so what we're providing is a software update to the Xi that enables the Table Motion. The table itself is being purchased from Trumpf.","Unknown Speaker","(29:37).","Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","(29:39). And so, our billing is 100% margin.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And I guess maybe what I was getting at is the degree to which this is going to drive a bolus of demand for Xi now that you have that, plus the full instrument set. Could you maybe just talk a little bit about how you see that flowing through to Xi demand?","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think that it \u2013 each one of these steps, the 30-millimeter Xi stapler, the integrated Table Motion now, the Xi instrument kit is rounding out that Xi platform. And we have some more to do. It's not all complete, but it's definitely becoming a much fuller and richer ecosystem. We think that helps. It's very hard to forecast how much it is, how many people sit and wait until the next step, but we think those things add clinical value.","For sure, a 30 millimeter stapler in thoracic procedures is a big win, likewise Table Motion for a lot of the more complex procedures. So we think that's strong. And there are a group of hospitals that use Si with Single-Site that if they're a single system hospital, they only own just one and they have a robust Single-Site program. This allows them to consider Xi as an upgrade. So it's hard to quantify, but we think directionally it's really strong.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then a follow-up. Can you just comment on Europe? It looked like that was a little soft. Maybe just talk about the outlook there for the year.","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Europe was definitely variable, both in procedures and in systems. On the procedure side, we had some strength in some countries where they're moving along, and we think there's opportunity to do that and better. There are some other countries where it's going a little slower. Sometimes, it's a local economy issue. Sometimes, it's more where we are in maturity. In some of these countries, we're pretty well adopted in the mature procedures and they're really at the beginnings of emerging procedures. So it depends country-by-country.","On the capital side, I think there's two things going on. A little bit of environment is one, and a little bit of wait-and-see on competitive offerings as they come out, and we're navigating that pretty well. In terms of head-to-head comparisons with our technology, our systems are coming out great. But it can put a delay in the pipeline, and we're seeing a little bit of that in Europe.","Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","The only other thing I'd add is that Europe has become very seasonal. And so if you look at Q4, it was extremely strong relative to the previous couple of quarters, and Q1 is more comparable to the previous year Q1.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Just two quick ones here. Marshall, just coming back to gross margin guidance, so GMs have been stronger for five consecutive quarters, and the guidance sort of implies no improvement throughout the year which seems, I guess, less likely to us, just given the cost improvements you've already discussed. So can we just talk through gross margin progression throughout the balance of the year and why you think 70% here in the first quarter is the high water mark?","Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. So one of the biggest factors we see going forward is product mix. So know that we have higher margins on instruments and accessories than we do on systems. And Q1 tends to be seasonally a lower quarter for capital. And also, we see growth in the new product, particularly energy product, stapling and vessel sealing going forward. And those also have lower margins than the base. So I think just based on product mix alone, we don't expect to sustain 70%.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then Gary, obviously, people have asked about spending already. And I note that the R&D spend is the highest we've seen in four years. So you're obviously clearly going to continue to invest. I've no expectations you're going to talk to us about future instrumentation and system announcements, but I think the enigma for most shareholders actually is advanced imaging, because that's sort of more future looking. Is there any chance we get incremental updates or at least even any update on the strategy for advanced imaging this year? Thank you.","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. It's a fair question. In general, we have been making early investments in advanced imaging. And what I'd tell you there is it's not one thing. As you know, we have Firefly which is a molecular imaging based product. We also have invested in raw imaging hardware capabilities which we'll continue to do. What we like to do is, as we have milestones that make sense, whether it's talking to regulatory bodies or engaging in clinical work, those tend to be good anchors to discuss with you. And as those arrive, then we'll share with you what we're thinking.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And could those arrive potentially in 2016 for advanced imaging or unlikely?","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think when we get there, we'll let you know.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, sir. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. I wanted, Gary, just to come back to some of the early part of your prepared remarks where you discussed the continued momentum that you're seeing in hernia. And it seemed like at stages this year, there was sort of a positive, I would say, tipping point but just incremental enthusiasm from the position community around this procedure. Can you maybe sort of talk about what you think specifically is stimulating that demand and why you're confident in that continuing on a go-forward basis?","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","There's two ways that our confidence has been building. One of them is around the clinical outcomes and anecdotes that we hear. And that comes to, as we've talked about before, inguinal hernia particularly is a segmented market. Not all patients are suffering the same level of disease and in the more complex cases, if it's bilateral or prior abdominal surgery, obese patients, a large herniated sac. The raw clinical capability of our products is being touted as and supported by surgeons as being important to them, a better quality of intervention, consumable costs in line with what their expectations are. So there, I think that we're feeling pretty good.","The second thing we can do is analyze kind of the reorder rates from surgeons as they go forward. So as you get through the trial periods, seeing kind of where as they learn it and get deeper and deeper into it, where do they apply it and how often do they keep buying our products. And that has been supportive as well. So as those two things come together, we start feeling better about it. And that's what's behind that set of comments.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. Thank you. Then just for my follow-up on the operating lease side, it looks like this is sort of a higher quarter for percentage of total coming from operating leases. So I guess, A, can you just talk sort of through some of the dynamics underpinning that? And then, B, based on your disclosures, it looks like people are buying out these operating leases relatively quickly. Maybe help us understand is that true and why that's the case.","Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. So, the operating leases is our way of being able to be flexible with the customer and meet the customers' needs in terms of financing. Some of the leases are shorter term and basically bridge their ability to get to a capital approval process, and those are a couple of the ones you've seen bought out in this quarter. Most of the operating leases are longer term being four- and five-year terms. And we'll drive a recurring revenue going forward. Like we said, this quarter was around $4 million.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question from Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","Gary, a question on the ecosystem. One of the most material competitive advantages you guys have is kind of the embedding of the technology and your training and all the other things throughout the healthcare system. What investments can you guys make? And are you planning to make it different than what you've done before to try to lever that because you did specifically call that out?","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thinking a great robotic surgery program is really the integration of all of those things, and there are multiyear efforts to build that set of programs from peer-to-peer networks that do advanced course work and teaching to validated learning pathways and simulation. Those validations are multiyear efforts to get right to the full instrument kit from vessel sealing to stapling and so on.","And so, we're pretty thoughtful about balancing that set of investments. The thing that has gotten really stronger and interesting in the last couple of years have been our ability to analyze data, look at national benchmarking, look at regional-based benchmarking, and share that information with our customers so that they can make good decisions.","Sometimes, those decisions are good for them and not great for Intuitive in the near term. If they optimize their program, we may get revenue per procedure in the near term. But we think long term, it's better for everybody. And so, we've been making those analytics in those investments and then communicating with hospitals. So we really have been plugging in in each of those settings. And I do think it makes for an ecosystem that creates a lot of value for the customer and builds our relationship with them.","Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you. And Patrick, a quick one for you. Can we think about the extra selling day as maybe 1.5 percentage points of procedure growth? I know there's some offsets with Easter, et cetera. But is it in that range of what the bump was net?","Patrick Clingan - Finance Director","Yeah, Ben, I'll let you kind of do your math on the specific percentage. But as it relates to the benefit, it really is just think of it more as in the U.S. because the favorability of leap year and new year gets mostly washed out by Easter, particularly in Europe.","Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And we have a question from Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon, Gary. Good afternoon, everybody. I wanted to talk a little bit more about U.S. urology and U.S. gynecology. I was really intrigued with the modest growth on the gynecology side. I mean that's a significant turnaround from the headwind you faced over the last couple of years; also urology acting better. Have we worked through some of the challenges in each? And are we actually going to return to more sustainable growth in U.S. gynecology after a year or more or two of training and education, et cetera?","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me speak to a couple other factors, and then I'll let Patrick take it from there. As we look at urology, you've got it right, three main procedures in urology: prostatectomy, partial nephrectomy and cystectomy; the biggest one being prostatectomy. We know there was a bolus of patients that went into watchful waiting, some of whom will have disease progression and come back to definitive treatment. How long that bolus lasts is a little bit hard for us to predict.","The second thing are the possibility of share changes between some of the treatment modalities, surgery versus radiation, versus watchful waiting. That data tends to lag. It's hard to get it in real-time. There may be some share change, although if there is, it's probably modest. And then there's just demographics. As demographics changes, you have more folks getting diagnosed with prostate cancer over time. So those are the three things that are rolling through, and sort of projecting how they balance out is what the challenge is.","On the gynecology side, the thing that we're seeing in our experience is that you're seeing more surgery being done by high volume gynecologists in general, not just robotic surgery but laparoscopy and others. We're seeing a consolidation in the marketplace into folks who are either GY (41:53) oncologists or more routine surgeons. We think that's good for the world, and we think that's good for Intuitive.","Those more dedicated surgeons tend to be our customers. We see them tackling more procedures in concentrated fashions, and so that's kind of what's happening in gynecology. Likewise, I think there's a demographic element here that's likely to find the bottom and then start to drift up. The unknown is nonsurgical approaches and in-office approaches. Those are kind of the factors at play.","Patrick, I'll let you go from there.","Patrick Clingan - Finance Director","Yeah. No, I think you described the urology situation well. The other thing to bear in mind in the GYN market is while Single-Site procedures have been declining, some of the other benign procedures have been stabilizing and are creating less of a headwind to us on a year-over-year comparison basis, things like myomectomy.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And I guess my follow-up question, and it might have been you, Patrick, who mentioned it, I think somebody described OUS procedure growth as it can be lumpy and \"we're working to improve the performance there.\" Can you talk a little about how you're going about that? What kind of initiatives are underway? And what you would hope or we should expect might come from those initiatives? Thank you.","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I'll take that one, Rick. The opportunity in Europe tends to be country by country. So, where we're looking to do something different or better, it tends to be making sure that we have staff that is supporting local efforts and local needs that they're working in local language, that they understand the healthcare systems in intimate ways that are specific to that country. And so where we see opportunity, we'll invest there and build that out; we have been. Where we've made investments, we've seen growth. And so, where we see some areas of opportunity, we think we have a playbook. Now, we have to go execute against that playbook. That's been our perspective there.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we have a question from Matt O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I was hoping to start on the general surgery side. And it sounds like again very good quarter, but I'm just curious if either of the various ventral \u2013 or I'm sorry, the various hernia cases are really leading the charge in some of that growth. Are you seeing any kind of divergence or inflection in either ventral or inguinal? And are those procedures at this point getting sizable enough to start to sway hospital decision making as to adding additional systems in order to meet that demand?","Patrick Clingan - Finance Director","Hey, Matt. Thanks for the question. Certainly, both ventral and inguinal hernia procedures continue to exhibit robust growth. Inguinal hernia is just a bigger overall procedure category. It's just more commonly performed. But the rates of adoption that we're seeing in both procedures is encouraging, and the surgeon populations that are performing them are continuing to increase the volumes of procedures that they're doing. So it looks promising.","And certainly, from an overall volume perspective, it had some influence because just the numbers are getting to the point where it matters to create access for these surgeons to be able to continue to perform procedures that they are absorbing systems worth of activity at some of their institutions.","Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Okay. That's very helpful. And then, Gary, your commentary about the delays that we saw in Europe as hospitals are evaluating some competitive systems that are hitting those markets is curious to me. Do you think that's something that will linger here throughout 2016 as those systems are fully rolled out? Or do you think it'll be a fairly quick process of kind of taking a peak, and maybe they're doing that now and we could see a snap-back in terms of the number of systems placed? I mean specifically, did you see 10, 15 hospitals kind of delay as they were evaluating both systems, and then out of those 10 hospitals, 9 of them ended up buying da Vinci either late last quarter or even early his quarter?","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think that it's a little bit hard to predict how fast it will go through. I guess our anecdotal experience has been, some have been quick looks, and make an evaluation and come sign up with us, and others are going through a little bit longer process. So with regard to a \"snap-back,\" I wouldn't bake that in. I think it will play out a little longer than that.","Having said that, the response of our customers after they have evaluated the other offerings and come back to talk to us has been fantastic. So our confidence that we have good offerings and we can meet these customers' needs is very high. They'll go through that process. And I think as new and different technologies come to market, not just the ones that are there today, I think this will be part of the new normal a little bit for Europe, is people cross shopping and making decisions. And our goal is to make sure that they find our products to be a very high value. So far, so good.","Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And we have a question from Larry Keusch, Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon. I wondered if we could just, first question, start with the trade-ins. I think there were 42 as you mentioned this quarter, and I think the prior quarters it's been sort of averaging closer to 30. So I'm just trying to understand perhaps what is driving the higher trade-in. And then what's the ultimate opportunity to drive trade-ins in your older system base?","Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","There's nothing specific about this quarter that I would call out as it relates to trade-ins. I think you have the numbers right. It came off of our \u2013 the detail we provided with the press release. I wouldn't call anything out specifically. I think last quarter, it was around \u2013 in the high 30s, and it's been there for a little while. I don't know that \u2013 it'll probably fluctuate in that range. So I don't have any specific comments on it.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then for Gary, maybe just an update on SB (48:01). You mentioned some in your prepared comments. But where are we in getting those evaluations going? And is it conceivable that we could see commercial units perhaps by the end of the year?","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So we are in discussions with FDA on a trial type and end points, and we have clinical sites that are getting prepped; the product from the engineering and design and validation point of view is right on track. It looks really good. We're not expecting anything of substance in terms of revenue this year. We do expect them in clinical use in the second half, and that's what we're working towards.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","And we have a question from Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys, for taking the question. Congrats on a great quarter. My first question has to do with just trying to understand better your dogma as it relates to managing the P&L. So what obviously we're getting here is higher procedural volume guidance and higher operating expense guidance. What we seem to be seeing is some leverage to the operating line. But I'm just curious, Gary, if you could talk about \u2013 Marshall, talk about your dogma over the next couple of years. And sort of are you looking for operating margin expansion? Is that what your objective is? Are you managing the business to top-line growth and trying to manage expenses the best you can to get there? Could you just talk about your dogma as it relates to managing the P&L?","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So my first statement is kind of a caution of, beware of averages. So there are places in the business where we're seeking high operational efficiency and leverage. You see that in product cost reductions and some of the things we're doing in manufacturing. There are other places in the operation where we think we can find leverage. At the same time, we want to turn around and reinvest those savings in opportunity. And we see a lot of opportunity. And I think that that opportunity should be pursued.","So it'll be a little bit lumpy. We're trying to be balanced. I wouldn't say that our approach is hard over one or hard over the other. It's not revenue above all else, and it's not profit above all else. We're trying to be balanced in that approach. And it may be a little bit lumpy. I think opportunities happen when they happen. You can be overly cautious and miss them, and so we'll maintain a fiscal discipline. That's been part of our history and we'll keep it. Having said that, we want to make sure that we reinvest some of the benefits that the company has gained into expanding the opportunity we see in front of us.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","That's helpful. My second and final question, having to do with your cash balance and use of cash, you've been very proficient at buying back stock in the past. Given where the share price is juxtaposed to a significantly expanding cash balance, would it be fair to assume that you'll do maybe modest to moderate share repurchases going forward? Or will we see maybe less over the next two years than we saw in the last two years? Thanks.","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In terms of just how we think about capital allocation, we are thoughtful and serious about it, as you'd expect. We think buybacks are one leg or one tool in capital allocation. We really start with, can we reinvest in the business and drive long-term growth and opportunity, buybacks if \u2013 there are times we've been typically patient and opportunistic. And we think because of the volatility of our stock, there are times that that makes a lot of sense for us.","And in conversations with shareholders, where we are thoughtful and listen, then we have considered dividends, and we will consider them in the future. So, we look at those three things and try to trade them off. And we think for the long term; when we're thinking about capital allocation, we're not trying to do signaling or messaging. We're trying to build value for the business and for the shareholders in the long term.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thank you, guys.","Operator","And we have a question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So maybe one on the OUS placements. I know China, I think on the last quarter, you said they had about eight systems. Can we expect sort of renewed, I guess, a contract from the government, right (52:46)? How should we think about OUS from a systems perspective given that China, they're probably at the end of the amount of systems that they can import?","Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So, I'll speak to China first and then to other locations next. As far as China goes, when we left last quarter, there were about six systems left on the quota. We sold five this quarter. There's still one out there. I don't know if it'll happen. And we're going to have to go through a tender process, and that tender process had to have already begun.","As far as additional quotas, it's a part of the overall budget, government budget process in China. And so when that gets completed \u2013 and I don't have a magic ball that tells me when it will be completed \u2013 then we'll know whether we're still under the quota system and we'll know, if we are under the quota system, how many will be awarded. And there's no way to predict that in advance.","As far as the rest of the world goes, in my remarks, I mentioned that the fourth quarter is a seasonally strong quarter. If you look at where we came out for this quarter, it was pretty comparable to last year for the first quarter. But it's going to be lumpy market-by-market depending on the circumstances.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Great. And then maybe one follow-up for Gary. I know that clinical trial \u2013 I mean R&D expenses were up 25% in the Q. Does that number include any clinical trial expenses, because I'm just trying to get a sense for \u2013 and as you talked about Japan, starting clinical trials, sort of any potential impact on that number?","Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. There's some \u2013 we've said before, we're in the middle of gathering data or evidence for gastrectomy in Japan. That doesn't go into R&D. That's actually in our SG&A numbers. And if we were doing \u2013 I mean, as far as other clinical trials, we'll tell you about them when we think it's appropriate.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Thanks, guys. Congrats on a strong quarter.","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question from Tao Levy with Wedbush. Please go ahead.","Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Yeah, hi. Good afternoon.","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Tao.","Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","So, we've talked a lot about the sort of hernia colorectal surgery, but you mentioned a couple times thoracic surgery and the benefit that, particularly, the Xi might bring to that procedure. Can you sort of maybe summarize some of the key opportunities within thoracic? Should we think of it as colorectal type opportunity where it's moving in the right direction, but it's a little bit slower? Or could it potentially be more like a hernia or hysterectomy opportunity?","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Just I'll start, and I'll ask Patrick to join in. Just from the starting place, these are typically cancer procedures and typically complex, mediastinal cancers, lung cancers. The product set that we have, Xi moves us in the right direction. Some of the instrumentation we're bringing along moves us in the right direction in terms of providing surgeons with the tools they are looking for for efficient procedures. And I think we're at the beginnings of that.","The way to think about the market is there are some minimally invasive surgery done manually, video-assisted thoracic surgery. Some institutions do a lot of it with good results. Others do very little of it. If you look at national averages rather than institutional numbers, you see a lot of open surgery done, and we think that that's the opportunity.","I'll let Patrick characterize it sort of.","Patrick Clingan - Finance Director","Yeah, Tao. It's still pretty early days. We're in the foundation. We've got a small team in the U.S. focused on it, but our focus continues to be on driving general surgery growth and hernia and colorectal resections. And internationally, we're still highly focused on driving dVP adoption and some emerging procedures in countries where urology is deeply penetrated. And when you look around internationally, it is a cancer that is very common in Asia and other parts. So it's very big opportunity for us, so perhaps a little bit around the corner from what we're currently focused on.","Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And as my follow-up, you mentioned focusing on urology internationally. And I understand that it's still relatively under penetrated, but it is just the same procedure that you keep on going after internationally. Should we be worried that some of the other procedures that are catching on here in the U.S. over the last few years aren't moving the needle yet internationally? Thanks.","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Tao. That'll be our last question. I'll answer that, and then we'll move on. I think it depends by country. So we see, for example, nice adoption of thoracic surgery in China. We see a pretty different mix of procedures in Korea than we see in the United States. So you have to answer it country-by-country. I don't think there's a systemic worry here that somehow we're stuck at prostatectomy and won't be able to move any further. I do think that it's important for folks on the phone to realize that the profile of procedures at each country is going to differ based on disease state, based on how the reimbursement system works and the relative priorities of their healthcare system. So we see that reflected. We do see multiple procedure adoptions in different countries. It just differs on what they're after.","Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Tao.","Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That was our last question. As we've said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flows during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing value by enabling surgeons to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma. We've built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference.","This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery, and I look forward to speaking with you again in three months.","Operator","Thank you.

Welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Q2 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And then later we\u2019ll conduct the question-and-answer-session. Instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, the conference is being recorded.","I'll now turn the meeting over to our host, Calvin Darling, Senior Director of Finance and Investor Relations for Intuitive Surgical. Please go ahead.","Calvin Darling","Thank you. Good afternoon. And welcome to Intuitive Surgical's second quarter earnings conference call. With me today we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO and Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 02, 2018 and 10-Q filed on April 18, 2018. Our SEC filings can be found through our Web site or at the SEC's EDGAR database. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.","Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our Web site at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our Web site.","Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our second quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our second quarter financial results. Then I will discuss procedures and clinical highlights, and provide our updated financial outlook for 2018. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.","With that, I'll turn it over to Gary.","Gary Guthart","Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us on the call today. Our second quarter of 2018 was a strong one in pursuit of our mission to improve the availability and quality of minimally invasive surgery. Customer use of our systems and procedures exceeded our expectations in the quarter with good performance in new system placements and increased system utilization at existing customer sites.","We believe acceptance of da Vinci in general surgery in the United States, growth internationally and appreciation of our generation-four platform by surgeons underpins our recent growth. That said we\u2019re neither satisfied nor comfortable. There is substantial opportunity for improvement in surgery, and our customer base has demonstrated sustained interest in our new approaches to old problems. Global procedure growth was approximately 18% in the second quarter of 2018 compared with the second quarter of 2017, accelerating from our Q1 growth rate.","Regionally, the United States showed particular strength with healthy growth in hernia repair and colorectal procedures. Mature procedure growth in the United States, including prostatectomy and hysterectomy, continue to top our expectations. Our first quarter aggregate procedure growth in Japan, after reimbursement listing, was in line with our expectations. European procedure growth was generally in line with our expectations with particular strength in the UK and mix performance elsewhere. Calvin will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call.","Our capital placement performance in the second quarter of 2018 accelerated relative to 2017 with growth in total placements rising 33% from 166 to 220. Net of trade-ins and retirements, our da Vinci install base grew 12% over Q2 of 2017. The mix of system placements between our flagship Xi systems, our [Value-X] system and refurbished X SI systems, align with our strategy regionally. Capital placements have historically been lumpy and we anticipate volatility in placements for the remainder of 2018.","Turning to operating performance. Our teams execute its plan with manufacturing and quality cost meeting our goals, and average selling prices within our expected ranges. On the investment front, we are building our organization and making targeted infrastructure investments to deepen both our technological and regional capabilities. Fixed costs spending in the quarter was slightly lower than we anticipated, largely due to timing issues that we anticipate will catch up in the back half of the year.","Highlights for our second quarter operating results are as follows; procedures grew approximately 18% over the second quarter of last year; we placed 220 da Vinci surgical systems, up from 166 in the second quarter of 2017; our install base grew 12% from a year ago; revenue for the quarter was $909 million, up 20%; pro forma gross profit margin was 71.1% compared to 71.4% in the second quarter last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $476 million, up 20%.","Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $643 million, representing 71% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $389 million in the quarter, up 23% from the second quarter of last year. And pro forma net income was 327 million, up 42%. Marshall will take you through our finances in greater detail shortly.","Delivery of substantive technology and service improvements are core to continued progress in surgery. We measure our innovations by their ability to positively impact outcomes in the hands of our customers to be used efficiently, while lowering the total cost of treatment per patient episode and for their positive impact on the experience of surgical patients. With increased interest in da Vinci from general surgeons, we have added our 60 millimeter SureForm surgical stapler to our product portfolio, with 510 (NYSE:K) clearance this month joining its prior CE Mark.","Our second-generation cut and seal instrument, Vessel Sealer Extend, is in its first quarter of U.S. launch with outstanding customer feedback. And we have submitted our 510 (k) for enhanced grasper for hernia repair. As we've said in the past we design our product systems, instruments and software to work together seamlessly as an ecosystem, to enable a holistic approach to a surgical procedure. These latest instruments and software releases are optimized for our generation-four platform and general surgery.","We obtained FDA clearance for our da Vinci SP surgical system for neurologic surgical procedures in Q2 this year, and we are finalizing our transoral clinical IDE for SP this quarter. We plan to launch the da Vinci SP surgical system in the United States in phases with first customer shipments expected to begin late Q3 or early Q4 this year. Our first access sites will focus on clinical data generation and customer feedback. Surgeon interest in SP is high and we believe SP to be a platform technology with potential application in a number of surgical specialties.","Consistent with our history, we will engage surgeons and regulators in clinical assessments for new applications of SP and anticipate filing additional 510 (k) applications over the next couple of years. Our team is progressing to plan on our flexible robotics platform, initially targeted to address the acute need in diagnosis of lung cancer, one of the most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer in the world and for which early detection is important. Feedback from physicians evaluating our technology relative to existing and recently announced alternatives remained strongly supportive of our efforts. We anticipate submitting our 510 (k) in this back half of 2018, and are working through final design validations and to bring up of our supply chain.","As our approach to surgery has gained traction, organizations large and small, are hurrying to participate in the market. Their entry is an inevitable reaction to positive change in the operating room. Customers appreciate options from Intuitive and others, and we anticipate customers will evaluate alternative as they appear. At Intuitive, we are sharply focused on understanding our customers\u2019 world and providing them with products and services they value highly.","To take a simple example, our systems are available to start and able to complete cases with remarkable predictability, considering their use of a wide range of sophisticated technologies. This is a consequence of our holistic design and integration principles, the capability of our staff and our deep commitment to understanding the surgical team\u2019s world. We believe this sets a high bar for new entrants in the eyes of the thousands of surgeons who use da Vinci weekly.","For the balance of 2018, our focus remains in completing the tasks we set for ourselves; first, continued adoption of da Vinci in general surgery; second, continued development of European markets and access to customers in Asia; third, advancing our new platforms, imaging, advanced instruments, da Vinci SP and our flexible catheter platform; and finally, support for additional clinical and economic validation by global region.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marshall who will review financial highlights.","Marshall Mohr","Good afternoon. I\u2019ll describe the highlights of our performance on a GAAP and non-GAAP or pro forma basis. Our results are also posted on our Web site. Second quarter 2018 revenue of $909 million grew 20% compared with second quarter 2017 revenue of $759 million, and increased 7% compared with first quarter revenue of $848 million. The year-over-year revenue growth benefitted by approximately 100 basis points from the weaker dollar. Second quarter 2018 procedures increased approximately 18% compared with second quarter of 2017, and increased 8% compared with last quarter.","Procedure growth continues to be driven by general surgery in the U.S. in neurology worldwide. Kevin will review details of procedure growth later in this call. Instrument and accessory revenue of $476 million increased 20% compared with last year, which is higher than procedure growth, reflecting increased usage of our advanced instruments, partially offset by customer buying pattern. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure was approximately $1,850, an increase of 1% compared with second quarter 2017 and a decrease of approximately 4% compared with last quarter.","The increase compared with last year reflects increased advanced instrument usage and the impact of weaker dollar, partially offset by customer buying pattern. The decrease relative to last quarter primarily reflects customer buying patterns, partially offset by an increase in advanced instrument usage. Systems revenue of $277 million increased 25% compared with the second quarter 2017, primarily reflecting higher system placements and increased lease related revenue, partially offset by lower ASPs and an increased number of operating leases. We placed 220 systems in the second quarter 2018 compared with 166 systems in the second quarter of 2017, and 185 systems last quarter.","44 operating lease transactions, representing 20% of total placements, were completed in the current quarter compared with 16% of total placements in the second quarter of 2017 and 23% last quarter. While the number of leases is difficult to predict in the short-term, we expect the proportion of these types of arrangements to increase in the long-term. 34% of current quarter systems placements involve trade-ins, reflecting customer desire to access or standardize on our fourth-generation technology. This is an increase in the proportion of trade-in transactions compared to 20% in the second quarter of 2017 and 31% last quarter; however, trading activity to be lumpy and difficult to predict. 72% of the systems placed in the quarter were da Vinci Xi and 21% were da Vinci X systems compared with 76% da Vinci Xis and 16% da Vinci Xs last quarter.","Our install base of da Vinci systems increased 12% year-over-year and our average system utilization grew in the mid-single-digit range. Globally, our average selling price, which excludes the impact of operating leases, lease buyout and revenue deferrals was approximately $1.42 million, which is lower than $1.46 million last year, and $1.49 million in the first quarter. The decrease primarily reflects a higher mix of trade-in transactions.","Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. Second quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $265 million increased 28% compared with the second quarter 2017, and decreased 4% compared with last quarter. The increase compared with the prior year reflects increased systems revenue of $25 million or 32% growth, and increased instruments and accessories revenue of $27 million or 31% growth. The increase in systems revenue was driven by an increase in the number of systems placed, partially offset by lower ASPs, reflecting an increase in the number of trade-in transactions.","The increase in instrument accessory revenue was primarily driven by procedure growth and customer buying pattern. The decrease in our OUS revenue relative to the previous quarter reflects the higher number of systems leased transactions, lower system ASPs reflecting increased trade-in transaction and customers buying patterns related to INA. OUS procedures grew approximately 22% compared with the second quarter of 2017. OUS procedures were positively impacted by the timing of holidays in 2018 compared to 2017.","Outside the U.S., we placed 82 systems in the second quarter compared with 63 in the second quarter of 2017, and 73 in the first quarter. Current quarter system replacements included 39 into Europe, 13 into the Japan and nine into Australia. 30 of the 82 systems placed in the second quarter were X systems. Placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of the OUS markets are in early stages of adoption some markets are highly seasonable, reflecting budget cycles or vacation pattern. And sales in the sub-markets are constrained by government regulations.","Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. The pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of 2018 was 71.1% compared with 71.4% for the second quarter of 2017 and 71.6% last quarter. The decreases primarily reflect lower system ASPs and revenue mix. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of systems and instrument and accessory revenue, system ASPs and our ability to further reduce product cost and improve manufacturing efficiency.","Pro forma operating expenses increased 14% compared with the second quarter of 2017, and decreased 1% compared with last quarter. The decrease relative to the first quarter primarily reflects the impact of payroll taxes. Overall, our spending was below our annual guidance, reflecting the timing of expenditures. We expect spending to increase in the last half of 2018 consistent with our guidance. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 19.7% compared with our expectations of 20% to 21%.","Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of one-time items. Our second quarter 2018 pro forma net income was $327 million or $2.76 per share compared to $230 million or $2 per share for the second quarter of 2017, and $288 million or $2.44 per share for the first quarter of 2018.","I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $255 million or $2.15 per share for the second quarter of 2018 compared with GAAP net income of $223 million or $1.94 per share for the second quarter of 2017, and GAAP net income of $288 million or $2.44 per share for the first quarter of 2018. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our Web site, and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee equity and IT charges and legal settlements, including the previously announced second quarter 2018 charge of $42.5 million.","Note that the IRS has not issued final tax regulations associated with the recent U.S. Tax Legislation. Therefore, impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reflected in our results and our projection of future tax rates represent our best estimates of the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and could change as tax regulations are finalized and further interpreted.","We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $4.3 billion compared with $4.1 billion at March 31, 2018. The increase reflects cash generated from operations of $220 million. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter and have approximately $718 million remaining under board buyback authorization. In the quarter, we repatriated $1.4 billion of cash to the U.S. since the earnings have previously been taxed under the U.S. tax reform act of 2017, and there were effectively no foreign taxes assessed under repatriation. We\u2019ve not changed our capital deployment strategy or plan.","And with that, I would like to turn it over to Calvin who will go over procedure performance and our outlook for 2018.","Calvin Darling","Thank you, Marshall. Our overall second quarter procedure growth was 18% compared to 16% during the second quarter of 2017 and 15% last quarter. Our Q2 procedure growth was driven by 17% growth in U.S. procedures and 22% growth in OUS markets. In the U.S., procedure performance across general surgery, gynecology and urology, all exceeded our expectations with Q2 year-over-year growth rates accelerating modestly across these largest categories.","Q2 procedure performance was again driven by growth in general surgery. Hernia repair and colorectal procedures continued to lead the way as these categories, again, added the most incremental cases. As usage of da Vinci in the U.S. general surgery expands. Other general surgery procedures contributed larger numbers of incremental cases than previous quarters. In U.S. gynecology, second quarter 2018 growth was consistent with 2017 and Q1 2018 trends as procedures in this mature category grew modestly year-over-year with growth led by hysterectomy.","We hypothesize our growth in gynecology to be driven by favorable surgical consolidation trends. As our da Vinci surgery data indicate, an increasing proportion of U.S. gynecology procedures are being performed by higher volume physicians that specialize in complex benign and cancer surgery. Q2 U.S. urology procedures also had growth rates consistent with 2017 and Q1 2018, driven by prostatectomy volumes. As a mature procedure category, we believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate market, which has benefited from recent macro trends. In U.S. other procedures, adoption of lobectomies and other thoracic procedures was again solid during the second quarter.","Utilization of our da Vinci Xi systems and surgical staplers, which helped to optimize robotics thoracic procedures, has been increasing. Second quarter OUS procedure volume grew approximately 22% compared with 22% for the second quarter of 2017 and 18% last quarter. Second quarter 2018 OUS procedure growth was driven by continued growth in dVP procedures and earlier stage growth in kidney cancer procedures, general surgery and gynecology. As expected, Q2 OUS procedure growth was higher than Q1, benefiting from more operating days, resulting from the timing of holidays, including Easter.","Procedure growth in Japan accelerated as initial cases were performed within the set of 12 additional procedures approved for reimbursement effective April 1st. Procedure growth in China again moderated in Q2, as da Vinci system capacity expansion is constrained by system quota requirements, the most recent of which expired at the end of 2015. In Europe, procedure results vary by country with particular strength in the UK.","Over the years, the discussions surrounding da Vinci surgery has been centered around the clinical patient benefits. In addition, we believe there is substantial opportunity to create surgeon value as well by improving the ergonomic characteristics of surgery. In 2017, in the annals of surgery, Dr. Chantal, CJ Alleblas, et al, published an analysis entitled, prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders, MSTs, among surgeons perform minimally invasive surgery, a systemic review. This metastudy reviewed 35 articles, including over 7,000 surgeons. The authors characterize the risk factors associated with lab surgery to include, static body posture, repetitive upper extremity movements and forced exertion from adverse positions.","Moreover, the workload has increased by the high level of task precision and time pressure. Physical demands defer between open and laparoscopic surgery and comparative studies have reported higher prevalences of physical complaints for laparoscopic surgeons. Recent studies report MSD prevalence rates of 73% to 88% among specialists in MIS. Relative to the general population, these numbers are excessively high. In their study, the authors found, a 74% prevalence of physical complaints among laparoscopic surgeons. However, the low response rates and the high inconsistency across studies leave some uncertainty, suggesting an actual prevalence of between 22% and 74%.","Fatigue and MSDs impact cycle motor performance. Therefore, these results warrant further investigation. While pain ratings are subjective, we think there is opportunity to improve ergonomics for surgeons. With our recent bariatric surgery indication and SureForm 60 millimeter stapler 510 (k) clearance, we are better positioned to serve bariatric surgeons. I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2018, starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecast full year 2018 procedure growth within a range of 12% to 15%. We are now increasing our forecast and estimate full year 2018 procedure growth of 14.5% to 16.5%.","Turning to gross profit. We continue to expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71.5% of net revenue. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade and mix, and the impact of new product introductions.","Turning to operating expenses. We continue to expect to grow pro forma 2018 operating expenses between 16% and 18% above 2017 levels as we follow through on investments in several strategic areas intended to benefit the Company over the long term. We continue to expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $245 million and $255 million in 2018 as forecast on our last call. We expect other income, which is comprised of mostly interest income to total between $70 million and $75 million 2018, up from $55 million to $60 million forecast on our last call.","With regards to income tax, on our last call, we forecast our 2018 pro forma income tax rate to be between 20% and 21% of pretax income. We are now shifting our estimates slightly lower to a range of between 19.5% and 25.5% of pretax income. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tycho Peterson","I want to start with the U.S. procedure growth. You\u2019ve had about 300 basis points sequential acceleration. Can you maybe just talk a little bit more about that? I mean, hernia has obviously been doing well for a while, but you really seem to have an inflection here. So can you talk to maybe the sustainability of what you saw here in the quarter?","Marshall Mohr","We approach procedure enablement by designing system, instruments and imaging and software elements with surgeon feedback, and with the introduction of our Xi systems and our next-generation advanced instruments and refinements imaging software. Our customers are seeing real value in general surgery, particularly with the gen-four systems. And you mentioned hernia repair and colorectal, they\u2019ve been leading adoption. And we\u2019ve seen organic interest from bariatric surgeons as well as our SureForm 60 stapler comes to market and with the addition of gen-four labeling in bariatric so far to serving those opportunities as well.","Gary Guthart","One of the things we look at, as you know, is stick rates to reorder rates, and just to see our people trialing or are they staying with it. In hernia repair and colorectal, we\u2019re seeing nice stick rates on those side. So we feel like we're building momentum here. You also have sustainability, and I think prostatectomy -- urologic increases, as well as gynecologic increases in U.S. have surprised me. And I don\u2019t have much confidence that those are sustainable.","Tycho Peterson","And then thinking a little bit ahead on pipeline. Can you talk a little bit about the data roadmap for flex cath? Obviously, you\u2019re doing a lot of the optimization work in the manufacturing side. But how should we think about incremental data coming out ahead of the launch?","Gary Guthart","Nothing new to report for you there. Certainly, as it starts coming into the market, you'll see early site start to take broader data collection and so on. With regard to what regulators want to see, we\u2019ll see what happens with regard to their feedback to our submission when that occurs. So I don't have anything to point you to at this time.","Tycho Peterson","And the last one. Gary, you mentioned interest in SP beyond the initial opportunities that you\u2019ve talked about. Are you willing to comment on some of those areas? It seems like there is some interest in cardiology based on -- others have done. How prevalent is that in some of your early discussions?","Gary Guthart","I have been pleased so far with the interest that SP is generating our customers to explore where it can create real value. The things we\u2019ve talked about with your earlier quarterly some interest in urology, we think there\u2019ll be really interest just and colorectal surgery, in transoral surgery as well. There are -- we've had early discussions in several other specialties. I think it\u2019s very early to start pointing our investor base, I think, towards one or the other is probably too soon. That said, it provides access to the body that comes in fundamentally differently than an Xi brings instruments into the body. And we did that because we think it will provoke interest and value creation in other places, as we get more experience, as these come out into the world then we\u2019ll keep you up-to-date.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Amit Hazan with Citi. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Jamie on for Amit, can you hear me okay?","Calvin Darling","Yes.","Unidentified Analyst","So first the question is just on system features. When you think about the benefits and challenges of an open console and also separately the benefits and challenges of a system with arms mounted on a table. How do you guys think about those types of features that your competitors are starting to talk about?","Gary Guthart","Just zooming out for a minute, I think the way we think about it for customers is what allows for smooth operations across a population of patients and a broad set of procedure types from neurology, to gynecology, to general surgery, to thoracic surgery and so on. And as we think about those things, we've been at this for a long-time. The idea of mounting things to tables, the idea of mounting them to floors, of having them to be modular of using open consoles versus consoles that have immersive viewers, have been around quite a bit. And we have evaluated and tried a lot of them.","We came to these decisions not based on white board analysis, but on building things and talking to our customers and working through it. So it doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re right, it could absolutely mean that somebody else did something slightly different and they evaluated it differently, but we were not casual about this. And we did it with serving a population of patients, the population of surgeons across procedure set in mind. With that I'm comfortable where the Company has made its investments.","Unidentified Analyst","And then a question on the imaging side, with what you guys are working on for the first generation launch of that. Is that basically going of be pretty off images only, or is there a possibility to do real time imaging in that first generation launch? Just help us understand the technology roadmap from here and timing expectations.","Gary Guthart","I'm not quite sure when you say first gen imaging. We have done a lot of things in imaging for a lot of years, so perhaps a little clarity on what\u2026","Unidentified Analyst","For the imaging only side of things\u2026","Gary Guthart","With regard to this -- I think you\u2019re talking a little bit about image fusion and the idea of using preoperative images like CT scans or MRI with endoscopic images and fusing those two together. Again, I guess they have been around for many years. Today, in existing shipping systems, customers can use, something called to bring preoperative images and compare them in real time to what you\u2019re using. There are some other things in the works that allow for tighter integration of those images and fusion. We have not set expectations on timelines nor on future content yet.","We have a lot of technology capability there. We will bring something out when we feel like it really makes a difference in surgeons\u2019 lives, and enable them to either create different outcomes, or be more efficient. There is potential, nothing to update you in terms of timing.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Lewis","Gary or team, I want to start with systems momentum in the first half of the year. So last quarter, we saw increased trade-ups and again this quarter. So I just wonder how are the dynamics in your mind different this quarter than last quarter, what are your thoughts of sustainability of these systems trends? And maybe concerns on driving SP here in the back half of the year as you\u2019re also aggressively driving customers to the gen-four platform? And then I have a quick follow-up.","Gary Guthart","We don\u2019t see a real change in terms of momentum from one quarter to another, in our first quarter and second, other than as you indicated. You see a higher percentage of trading. The fourth generation products has some features in it, I think that we\u2019re seeing an excitement from the general surgeons about utilizing for the procedures we talked about earlier, colorectal procedures, thoracic procedure. And I think hospitals and surgeons want to avail to that technology, so we're seeing trade outs. We're also seeing some desire to have standardization within the hospital where they only have one set of instrumentation to manage rather than two. And so tradings are difficult to predict as to where we are in a particular cycle or how much will happen in any particular quarter. But what we have seen is a slight increase in those trades.","Marshall Mohr","Two things on that, one is customer use and efficiencies with the generation-four platform is quite good. So we are pleased to see their interest and to the extent that we\u2019re going to be flexible and help them move in the gen-four we will. With regard to SP, our initial thought here on the phase one of launch is not to do an enormous placement capital placement of SP. It\u2019s really to establish local data centers and build out the value story as we go and to really begin the early collection for next indications.","Over time as we build out that experience base, our interest in expanding the SP footprint will increase but that's a multi-quarter conversation, not a really quick turn. SP long-term and I think we\u2019ve talked about it. In beginning, SP will go out as full systems. But as we build out the evidence-base, it will be part of the gen-four platform that will be easy to upgrade and configure as part of gen-four, and that\u2019s been part of our thought process for some time.","David Lewis","And then Gary or team, just on Asia-Pac strategy broadly, didn\u2019t hear much about Japan in this particular transcript. How are you encouraged by the early traction in Japan? Is that on plan or ahead of plan, maybe comments there? And then Gary, you\u2019ve talked about before I think you made some statements that, at a certain point of the year, the absence of the China quota obviously reduces the likelihood this year. Any updated thoughts on the likelihood of China this year and any impact on just tariff rhetoric on getting that deal done? Thanks so much.","Gary Guthart","On Japan, first quarter here after the listing, we\u2019re pleased with the interest of the customer base. Our train facilities are busy, we\u2019re pleased with that. We are really testing the capabilities now of our new reformed or newly grown team in Japan to really execute. So I think a little early to tell the ultimate performance there, first steps looks fine. I think there's more to do. And so our team and we are focused on really execution, it\u2019s not a big strategy question it\u2019s getting the training pathway, the factoring pathway, the follow-up pathway, the support onsite really built and operating well. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve asked the team to focus on and we will be focused on. The first step of demand generation looks really good.","So moving to China, I\u2019ll speak briefly to the quota. I\u2019ll ask Marshall to speak briefly to the impact, potential impact of tariffs. On the quota side, we have no real update to supply with. We are awaiting an initial quota. No news there. Overall, I think the atmospherics that are going on globally do not help that conversation. I don't have anything specific to tell you there. But generally speaking, I think the atmospherics of those conversations are not helping the quota generation.","We do see, as we have told you in last calls that a procedure upside is going to require additional capital if we think the demand is there. And so there is a problem we need to solve. China is important to us, as a market and for joint venture. We are committed to it. And we are going to have to work through current macro challenges that are out there. Marshall, you might speak too?","Marshall Mohr","Tariff situation is obvious for dynamic. The first run of tariff have been imposed do impact some of the components that our suppliers use to supply us. We\u2019re under the -- we're studying that as we speak. We think that the estimated impact will be modest in terms of the increase in product cost for our systems. That's not a cost or a level that we're going to pass in those costs on to customers at this point in time.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bob Hopkins","I want to start with SP. Gary you characterized interest in SP as high. I was wondering if you can just go in a little more detail and comment maybe on which types of accounts are expressing initial levels of interest. And will you restrict a center -- if they\u2019re interested in SP, will you restrict them. So I just want to get a little more color on how you\u2019re thinking about SP?","Gary Guthart","In terms of accounts, there is a fair amount of interest that's I think broad across the segments. For us -- first of all, we have a set of clearances that we have that will allow access to get started, and then subsequent data collection to do for additional clearances. So that will determine the early access strategy there as is really around what clearances we have and the ones we want to pursue in the future. We will be supply limited for the first few quarters here. So the answer there is there will be a bit of a line to put these first set out as we go. And as we get the additional clearances and master the technology then I think that gets a lot easier. But it will be a design rollout to start.","Bob Hopkins","Also you made a comment in prepared remarks about the potential for volatility and capital for the rest of 2018. Is that just because there can always be volatility in capital, or is there something specific that you\u2019re referring to?","Marshall Mohr","No, nothing specific, it's really the -- just in general, it\u2019s hard to predict capital given budget cycles, given government regulations, in the case of China and just seasonality. And so it's just hard to predict when hospitals will actually purchase, and so you can see it be lumpy overtime.","Gary Guthart","What happens also is the aggregate reporting of course averages a lot of lumpiness that happens underneath. So even if the aggregate looks smooth, regional variances can be reasonably high. And so it's just as Marshall properly said, nothing specific but the general dynamics that are out there.","Bob Hopkins","Particularly on stapler and vessels sealing. If you\u2019re successful with those launches, should we start to see upward momentum in your revenue per procedure? I realized there is lot of things that affect that line, but those are two pretty chunky products. And just curious if you\u2019re successful with those launches, should we expect that line item to start to move higher?","Marshall Mohr","When you look at revenue per procedure overall, there is clearly some variance quarter-to-quarter. We talked a lot about customer timing, order timing and things like that. So quarter-to-quarter, you see those things. And we are seeing an increase in contribution from advanced instruments, including our stapling products, which are getting more usage, as well as vessel sealing. We introduced a new version of our Vessel Sealer Extend in the last quarter.","And now the 60 millimeter stapler that we\u2019ll be rolling out here in the third quarter with expanded access available in the fourth quarter. That's just serves to expand this category further around our product line a little further for stapling and provide a more optimized tool within the category of bariatric. So the simple answer is yes that that will just be more on our advanced instrument side of things that that element will serve to be a tailwind for revenue per procedure.","Operator","We we\u2019ll go to Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Larry Biegelsen","You did I think 16.5% procedure growth in the first half of the year, if I\u2019m doing the math right. So just my question is the second half, the guidance implies about 12.5% to 16.5% in the second half of the year, again, if I\u2019m doing the math right. But the question is, Calvin, what gets you to the low and gets you to high and what are some of the assumptions that would get you to the high and low end there? And I have one follow-up.","Calvin Darling","You\u2019re sitting six months into the year now. Year-to-date, procedures are actually rounding up to 17% as you described. And so it\u2019s pretty straight forward. I think you look at it right now at the high end of the range. We are talking about a continuity of the trends we saw in the first half across geographies and procedure sets. Then at the lower end of the ranges, we are talking about moderation, Marshall talked a little bit about the mature procedures. And we continue to beat our expectations in these categories, urology and oncology, in the U.S. But some moderation in those categories would be considered at the low end. And even in general surgery, where we\u2019ve been performing very strong just somewhat less robust growth in now our largest category in the U.S., contemplating the lower end.","Larry Biegelsen","And then for my follow up, I think bariatric has been tough to convert because of good lab outcomes. What\u2019s your strategy to penetrate this market, how meaningful is 60 millimeter stapler driving adoption? And what should we expect from an uptake standpoint? Thanks for taking the questions.","Gary Guthart","On bariatrics really, our customers have pointed us here. This is one where, as you\u2019ve said, there is a fair amount of penetration of laparoscopy. And outcomes are generally good. And so you\u2019re going to ask why are they asking here, what\u2019s the organic interest? Like all things we said to you in earlier procedure adoptions, in the early days, there are clearly sub-segments of a particular procedure. In the case bariatrics, sleeve gastrectomy, gastric bypass, revision procedures all underlying segments.","And that where we find value as an entry point, I think we\u2019ll have to develop over time. Clearly, in regional surgeries in complex co-morbid cases, we see real interest on the part of surgeons. And so that appears to be a place that they are finding some entry point. There is a wildcard here as Calvin alluded to, which is there is an ergonomic benefit for laparoscopists. And bariatric surgeons tend to be high volume surgeons and it tends attempt to be a challenging -- physically a challenging procedure and there may be some value there too.","So we\u2019re not ready yet to call what the market sizes of those sub segments and where exactly all the value creation will be, but the organic interest is pretty high. And so we\u2019re going to engage our customers and follow their lead here. And short answer is stay tuned.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Rich Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Richard Newitter","The first one, Gary or team. We picked up on a couple of institutions who have said that they\u2019re looking at new ways to get increased systems into their in to their hospitals, just given the demand from general surgeons that don\u2019t have enough time on their existing footprint. And I'm just curious, what are some of the ways that we can think you might get creative on placing the systems beyond operating leases? Would you do minimum volume commitments for some upfront system statement model? Whereby as the volumes aren't met over some predetermined time, you take the system -- you have the right to take the systems back. And that was one model we had heard discuss. I was just curious, is this happening or there are other creative ways that you\u2019re potentially going to accelerate your footprint ahead of competition coming?","Marshall Mohr","First of all, the objective is to get systems out there and to get them productive and to provide improved surgery to patients. I think we've been flexible with leases. And when I say flexible we've structured those very short term leases almost rentals that we get them at the budget cycle to what you would call [plain vanilla] leases that have five year term with the piece of equipment staying with the customer at the end of the lease. We're willing to be flexible even further. And so although, we have talked about different models, I don\u2019t think that we've rolled anything out that it is important to the results at this point, but we will be flexible. We\u2019ll think about different models to get to -- eliminate the barrier from a capital expenditure perspective.","Gary Guthart","The major things we're looking for when thinking about flexibility here, really on the customer side, is that they have a long-term commitment in terms of access to the system that the access matters to them. We have confidence in our systems such that we're not too worried about a right of return and things like that. I think that if -- this is a group that understands robotic surgery, understands the value of robotic system surgery relative to other forms of surgery then we\u2019re willing to take some financial risk, if they really are committed in terms of how they want to implement the program, how they want to train their surgeons and so on.","Richard Newitter","And then just a quick follow-up, I think Calvin you had mentioned that SP and the phased rollout is initially only going to be sold as a standalone console, but then it eventually will be worked into entire fourth-generation package. How should we think about the ASP on SP as we model out maybe the initial placements, is it like 20% to 30% premium to what SP will be as we move out beyond 2019? How should we think about that?","Calvin Darling","As a standalone systems there should be a slight premium to our Xi less than 20% to 30% more or like in the 5% range.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Isaac Ro","Just another question on Asia, I'm curious in Japan with the new coverage there. You talked about an acceleration, I'm wondering how you think that accelerating curve will play out over the balance of the year as it relates to your guidance. What's embedded in the Japan part of your outlook?","Gary Guthart","Let me do a just little bit of qualitative and then you can speak to the quantitative. Qualitatively, while we had I think 12 traditional procedures some of which are sub- procedures of each other, added in terms of reimbursement listing. They will not all drive at the same rate concurrently. Some will take precedence over others in terms of priority for training and priority for development. The team is working through that now. So as we do our forecasting model, it's not a simultaneous event, its focus, and deliver, and really drive high-value through our teams to the customer. Calvin?","Calvin Darling","Just quickly as we move beyond the urologic dVP and prostatectomy into this broader set. As we described in the earlier comments, it\u2019s a foundational building period. We\u2019re very pleased and satisfied with one quarter\u2019s activity is focused on training and new programs and all the support that they require on the field. But in terms of the pure numbers, this is not a big factor in terms of the high-end and low end of guidance that where we may project overall. The overall proportion of procedures in Japan relative to the worldwide is something in the two percentage range. So it's a phenomenal opportunity in the long run in Japan. But in the near term, it\u2019s really more building programs and less of the impact that will have on full year procedure growth for the Company.","Isaac Ro","Follow up is on the hernia market, I think that\u2019s obviously huge potential opportunity for you guys. And I think the thinking there has evolved over the years. And now that you\u2019ve got I think a little bit of accelerated traction there. It would be helpful if you could maybe provide for us price some updated buckets or maybe chapters of market development that we can think through in terms of the types of procedures that you think are really driving the near-term adoption versus those that might be intermediate or long-term opportunities. Just anything help us segment what is clearly a very heterogeneous and larger opportunity for you guys. Thank you.","Gary Guthart","I think it\u2019s a good question it\u2019s not something we\u2019re prepared to do on this call. And it is true just frankly that our view of these opportunities and markets evolves overtime as surgeons start to explore the capabilities of these systems, find value in different places, and as we get to understand really the sub-segments of markets better. We do -- our view does progress. We will think about it to what has changed where it is. I don\u2019t think here we\u2019re ready to tell you that we\u2019re ready to forecast something differently. But it is moving to a different phase and it's worth thinking through that phase.","Operator","And we go to Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Larry Keusch","Gary, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that in the U.S, I think its 87% of the systems placed where Xi, which obviously suggest hospitals continue to go after the most capable system despite the availability of the lower priced X. So could you talk a little bit about the trends there between Xi and X in the U.S.?","Gary Guthart","I think in a sense it comes down to how people think through this trade-off between clinical value and economic value, and where they see value relative to capital entry price. And in many, many places as we you look at this deeply the capital price, the capital component is not the driving determinant of cost. If you look at total cost to treat per patient episode, which is in my opinion the most relevant economic question here, the total costs of caring for that patient are absolutely dominated by outcomes and dominated by human labor.","And so the material costs that flows through tiny fraction of all of it. And for those folks capital access and who see that who\u2019ve done analysis, I think what they really ask themselves is what\u2019s going to give us the best outcomes and the highest efficiency and standardization. And they make that out of commitments and so that's what we see. And I think that results in acquisitions of excise. If folks are capital constrained, and by the way that said of criteria can vary a little bit region-to-region.","I do think total cost to treat per patient episode translates well across country boundaries. But different organizations have different approval processes and capital allocation processes. They may choose to get started with lower capital cost system. If they want to do that, we're happy to support them and that's the next. So in our prepared remarks, we had talked about our allocation of these systems, fitting our view of the world regionally and that's why.","Larry Keusch","And then I guess the other question is, I know the SI is certainly around for a period of time. And there has been ability to offer refurbished systems at a discount for those that are really looking for less expensive capital equipment. But is there a place in the portfolio for a more de-featured system that would have even a lower capital cost. Do you think about that as also potentially part of the portfolio at some point?","Gary Guthart","We will listen extremely carefully to our customers\u2019 needs, and recognize that customer needs are three A, triple A, that outcomes efficiencies, workflow, standardization, and return on investment and the high responsiveness to patient need, a high patient centricity. Those needs we\u2019re going to look for really carefully if in that set of analysis a further de-featured system make sense of course we will pursue that, and we're always looking. I don\u2019t think that it is obvious right off the back that less capable systems at lower capital prices make those three aims a lot better, but we are constantly asking ourselves.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question will be from Brandon Henry with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Brandon Henry","One of your robotic flex cath competitors has recently partnered with a division of J&J for its latest technology. Can you spend some time discussing how you see the future direction for the flex cath platform beyond lung biopsies? And specifically, what do you think is the right modality for ablative technology. And is this technology that Intuitive already has internally, or is it something that Intuitive will need to acquire in the future?","Gary Guthart","First thing as we have said before, we\u2019re excited about flex catheter technologies, particularly in lung. I think it can make a big difference there. But it's a platform and we think it will have applications beyond the lung. We are focused on creating value in the lung to start that does not say that our vision will not extend further, that's step one. Step one, with regard to the idea of see entry. If you can go and do detection and then be in a position to treat it, things are very compelling in vision. And it's a vision we share, we think that's interesting.","There are many different ablative technologies and approaches within technologies. Ablation has been around for quite some time. It's not a trivial or obvious therapeutic approach. It will take serious design and serious clinical validation to really understand where those things are. That's going to be a multiyear pathway for anybody. So we\u2019re not surprised to see others\u2019 interest in it that is not new to us, not a new thought for us. We think there are opportunities there. We think there are multiple pathways to get the good solutions. We are investing in those. Some of that is organic. Some of it is partnered. Ss we evolve, we will share more of that with you.","Brandon Henry","Thank you.","Gary Guthart","All right. Well, thank you very much. That was our last question. As we\u2019ve said previously, while we focus on financial metrics, such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing value by enabling surgeons to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma. We have built our Company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you we\u2019ll remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference.","This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery. And we look forward to talking with you again in three months.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your teleconference. We thank you for using AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may disconnect."]}}
