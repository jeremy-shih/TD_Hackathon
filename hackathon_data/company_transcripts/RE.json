Welcome to the Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call of Everest Re Group Limited. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Elizabeth Farrell","Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, President of North American Insurance Operations.","Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks.","As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements.","Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.","Dominic James Addesso","Thanks, Beth, and good morning. Let me begin by first extending our sympathies to all those affected by the recent events. Community at large has responded to the relief efforts, but still there is more that can be done. I'm especially proud of the way our organization has responded on both the business and personal front.","We have advanced moneys to our Reinsurance clients, so they in turn can quickly settle with their insurers, allowing them to start the process of rebuilding our lives and businesses sooner. On the insurance front, our claim staff is working diligently to do the same.","These events teared us with many personal stories, but also remind us of the value that our industry and company can bring during times like this. We protect against volatility and therefore expect the periodic loss that we will discuss this morning. This means, of course, that during times of limited catastrophe loss activity, we should be able to produce strong results. It also means that after a series of events that claimed $100 billion from the system, there needs to be a reset in the market as we reevaluate pricing, terms and conditions, and the impact the recent years softening has had on the industry's risk-adjusted returns.","For this reason, we believe that these recent events will lead to a general market firming across all lines and territory. In non-loss affected areas, the push will be to achieve adequate return levels over a reasonable timeframe. Events like these create a greater awareness in the market around the cost of capital and the price of risk. For those regions affected by loss, the price reaction will be more pronounced. This will start with the retro market since it is heavily supported by the collateralized market, whose capital is in large part locked up. This may very well create some unique opportunities for us, especially given our capital position coming out of these events. The firming of the retro market will also have a beneficial downstream impact on the rest of the property catastrophe market, and may very well push into other lines. We anticipate that well rated capacity will be in demand, and this will drive better rates, terms and conditions across the spectrum.","Given our strong risk management practices, and laddered protection mechanisms, the losses from these events remained well within our expectations. One important factor, that is often overlooked is the tax benefit that is used to offset the loss. We manage our PML on a net basis, meaning net of tax and reinsurance hedges, despite many publications that only highlight our gross PMLs.","Considering the reinsurance and tax recoveries against the third quarter events, our net operating loss for the nine months stands at $180 million. This suggests that with a normal operating result in the fourth quarter, inclusive of our cap cat load, we could achieve a profit for the full year. This would be an excellent outcome in a year with an unprecedented level of catastrophe losses. We managed to these types of scenarios and measure our success over the long term, as we recognize there will be periods of volatility.","Over the last five years, including results so far in 2017, our average return on equity is 12%, which we consider exceptional relative to the industry. This is a testament to the long-term value of our strategy. The emerge from these events with a strong capital base and ample reinsurance capacity with our growing Mt. Logan facility, multi-year cap bonds and other third-party regions. And are therefore ready to respond to the new market demand. While I recognize, that the cat events are deservedly getting the focus.","Let me now turn your attention to the underlying business trends, that support our long-term success. On the reinsurance front, our effective use of third-party capital has allowed us to grow the book and profits during periods of low cat active.","But yet during one of the highest cat years in recent times contained the loss within full year earnings. Using alternative capital for U.S. cat exposure has allowed for expansion and diversification to other regions as well as other lines of business. Another expansion opportunity we have leverage with this essentially expanded capital base is our insurance business. For the past two years, we have experienced growth of over 20% in a balanced and well-diversified fashion.","With that growth and repositioning has come an improvement in the underlying attritional ratios. A $2 billion of annual premium and growing, we are now in a known market that brings capacity and ratings to meet the needs of the commercial and specialty marketplace. The underpinnings of our collective organization have never been stronger. While this year is challenge from an income perspective over the long-term we are delivering what we promised, higher ROEs that the industry with our disciplined expense model and cat losses that on an average are within our expected outcomes. But I continually remind people, there are never any losses than we don't have a business. The goal is to produce an above average ROE through the cycle. And we believe we have thus far delivered and we'll continue to do so.","Thank you. And we'll now have Craig for the financial report.","Craig Howie","Thank you, Dom and good morning everyone. Everest had a net loss of $639 million or $15.73 per common share for the third quarter of 2017. This compares to net income of $295 million dollars for the third quarter last year or $7.6 per diluted common share. The operating loss for the quarter was $16.43 per share reflecting the catastrophe losses in the quarter and the foreign exchange losses of over $1 per share, which is the primary difference from the consensus.","The operating loss excludes realized capital gains and losses. You will note that 2017 earnings per share calculations utilized basic common shares instead of diluted shares, due to the loss in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. The group had a net loss on a year-to-date basis of $102 million compared to $623 million of net income in 2016.","These results were impacted by a series of major catastrophe events that are driving both the quarter and the year-to-date figures. In the third quarter of 2017, the group saw $1.2 billion of net pre-tax catastrophe losses, with a net economic impact of $900 million after taxes.","The breakdown on the pre-tax loss by event is as follows. Hurricane Harvey was $270 million, Hurricane Irma was $475 million, Hurricane Maria was $400 million, and the earthquakes in Mexico were $85 million. There is considerable uncertainty in these estimates, and we expect it will take several months before relative clarity emerges from the multiple events.","However, the company has significant unused retrocessional capacity, including aggregate protections, which would provide coverage above these estimated levels.","On a year-to-date basis, the results reflected net pre-tax catastrophe losses of $1.3 billion in 2017 compared to $143 million in 2016. Excluding the catastrophe events, the underlying book continues to perform well with an overall current year attritional combined ratio of 85.6% through the first nine months compared to 8.52% for the same period in 2016.","Our year-to-date expense ratio remains low at 5.3% due to higher earned premium, including reinstatement premiums after the catastrophe event this quarter. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $137 million for the quarter and $394 million year-to-date on our $18 billion investment portfolio. Year-to-date investment income was up 10% from one year ago. The result was primarily driven by the increase in limited partnership income, which was up over $20 million for the first nine months of 2016.","We've been able to maintain investment yield without a shift in our overall investment portfolio. However, we have gradually shifted allocations within our alternative investment bucket by reducing exposure to high-yield debt and public equity while committing more towards limited partnership investments all while maintaining a conservative well-diversified high credit quality bond portfolio. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3% and the duration remained at just over three years.","Foreign exchange is reported in other income. Foreign exchange losses were $43 billion in the third quarter or over $1 of earnings per share. Year-to-date foreign exchange losses were $48 million compared to $29 million of foreign exchange losses in the first nine months of 2016. The foreign exchange impact is effectively an accounting mismatch since its offset in shareholders' equity mismatch since its offset in shareholders equity through translation adjustments.","Overall, we maintain an economic neutral position with respect to foreign exchange matching assets with liabilities in most major world currencies. Other income also included a $6 million loss from Mt. Logan Re in the first nine months of 2017, compared to $10 million of income in the same period last year. The decline essentially represents the higher level of catastrophe losses during 2017. On income taxes, the tax benefit is based on the actual year-to date-loss, not the annualized effective tax rate. We would expect any fourth quarter income to be taxed at an effective rate of about 10%.","Stable cash flow continues with operating cash flows of over $1 billion for the first nine months of 2017, compared to $961 million dollars in 2016. We expect this will decline as we pay claims for the recent catastrophe events, but still remain positive for the year. Shareholders equity for the group was $8 billion dollars at the end of the third quarter leaving us well-positioned to take advantage of business opportunities. Thank you.","Now, John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations.","John Doucette","Thank you, Craig. Good morning. As a leading global reinsurer, we have consistently achieved industry-leading results in periods with low catastrophe loss activity. But the true test of our franchise and business strategies is our ability to demonstrate resilience in a quarter in any year with several major catastrophe losses or other large unusual shock losses. While some characteristics of the recent property loss activity were unusual, the magnitude of insured losses was well within our expectations, owing to our proactive and comprehensive risk management efforts.","Learning from other large catastrophe and sharp loss years such as 2001 World Trade Center, 2005 Katrina Rita and Wilma hurricanes, 2008 Global Financial Crisis and 2011, a string of losses including earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand, floods in Thailand and Australia and severe convective storms in the U.S. We have continually enhanced and refined our group-wide enterprise risk management framework. This includes our large risk and catastrophe strategy, across all underwriting areas within the company.","And now, both our reinsurance and insurance portfolios, each are expected to benefit from the post loss market condition. This applies across our underwriting risk spectrum, from property insurance to facultative, to proportional treaty, to property catastrophe access of watch treaty and ultimately, to retro. We believe it is essential that a global industry leading specialty reinsurer and insurer, such as avarice.","Truly understand its risks and develop a comprehensive resilient business strategy that allows us to stand with our clients, while protecting our investors capital, a proactive, farsighted approach is critical to the continuity of an enduring franchise. Expect the unexpected, as every loss is different and unique. This includes relentless preparation for Black Swan and other tail events for an accumulation of varying losses across multiple lines of business.","Everest continues to be well-positioned to bring tailored solutions and value to our reinsurance clients. We pride ourselves not just on paying our clients losses quickly and efficiently, but also maintaining our financial strength in a quarter with unprecedented catastrophe loss activity. More importantly, we provide continuity to our clients going on the offense and providing additional support and capacity when it is needed most.","With our global geographic and line of business diversification across our underwriting portfolio, strong earnings power and substantial capital resources. We have once again demonstrated the success of our business strategies, which insulate the balance sheet from larger events such as those just experienced.","As we head into the one-one \u2013 1\/1 renewals and onward into 2018, we will continue to harness capital whether in the form of traditional equity and debt, Kilimanjaro catastrophe bonds, Mt. Logan or other forms of traditional and nontraditional reinsurance capital. Across the spectrum, our Accordion-like capital structures provide ample dry powder to deploy commensurate with market opportunities.","We remain very well positioned today and our existing hedges remain substantially intact with the vast majority of our $2.8 million of cat bond still in force and unexhausted, coupled with a growing Mt. Logan capital structure both of which help Everest efficiently manage its overall net risk appetite.","Uniquely, we manage alternative capital in a fashion that believes our clients around the globe from the complexities and structural weaknesses of collateral, lock-up and release mechanism from unrated reinsurers, while delivering to our clients, our evergreen promise to pay from our highly rated balance sheet as we have proven over the last 45 years.","Additionally, we have a significant portfolios of business across the entire P&C opportunity set, including meaningful books of business in mortgage, casualty, professional liability, structured reinsurance, international property, specialty, and other short tail lines throughout the world that have been unaffected by recent cat loss activity. Thus, our global geographic and business line diversification decreases volatility from any one line of business. Profits from these diversifying lines and territories offset losses such as those recently experienced in the U.S. and Caribbean.","Going forward, we are ready and eager to capture market opportunities that convert the value we provide to our clients in the returns for our shareholders. We are especially pleased that we will one of the few reinsurers immediately deploying capital post-event as we actively quoted backup covers in all loss affected areas to meet the needs of our clients, whether they were U.S. regional clients, large U.S. national clients, retro clients, Lloyd's syndicate or Caribbean reinsurance clients with financial strength and resilience, we are headed into the January renewal with the clear message that Everest is open for business.","However, that does not mean we will write reinsurance business at any price. As we have supported our core clients through hard and soft market cycle, the recent losses are reminder of the value that we deliver. As in the past, we will deploy our capital where that value is most recognized while reducing our positions on business with less attractive pricing terms and conditions.","Our clients can rely on us to offer our reinsurance capacity whether the same or a higher amount of capacity needed as long as it meets an appropriate return on capital, and the cost of that capital has gone up with the industry.","Now turning to specifics on our results. Excluding reinstatement premiums, gross-written premiums for our reinsurance operation increased 13% for the quarter and 15% year-to-date with broad-based growth in our U.S. and Bermuda operations from crop reinsurance, mortgage, strategic quota shares, [indiscernible] (00:21:00) business, international surety and property and structured reinsurance. Growth was offset slightly by lower international premium volume in the third quarter due to the renewal of certain structured deal that ran their course.","This underscores our ability to not only seize opportunity in property cap business, but to continue to write and expand our franchise in diversifying and value-added lines for our client. While this quarter's reinsurance underwriting results were heavily impacted by the catastrophe losses in the quarter. The underlying trends in these businesses remain solid.","The reinsurance operations overall attritional loss ratio was up 2.6 points on a year-to-date basis against the comparable period of 2016. This was due to growth in pro rata and crop business, both with naturally higher loss ratios, offset by some favorable loss trends in our international operations. Our year-to-date attritional expense ratio dropped over two points benefiting from a business mix with naturally lower commissions.","Despite this year's loss activity, in the long-term, the reinsurance market will continue to trend towards more efficient capital management and scale with better operational and expense management. We believe we are very well positioned both now and into the future. Our ability to execute on these key drivers provides value to our clients and our shareholders in both hard and soft markets. Our strategy remains nimble and dynamic, and enables us to thrive in this ever-changing market.","Thank you. And now, I'll turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations.","Jonathan Zaffino","Thank you, John, and good morning. As catastrophic events unfolded in the third quarter, particularly of the magnitude at scale that occurred across North America, the resulted impact to the primary insurance market has been predictably quite significant. While the Everest Global Insurance operations were not immune to the impact of this widespread devastation, the performance of our various books of business, notably our U.S. property portfolio were in line with our expectations.","Further, we are pleased with the continued growth and development of our global insurance platform. We are increasingly confident that our vision to organically build a world-class diversified insurance organization that is relevant within the global specialty P&C industry is being realized. Our leading gross written premiums, our enhanced operating platform, the many new product launches, our successful talent acquisition strategies and our growing relationship with a diverse group of trading partners is a testament to this approach.","Progress on our journey is also fairly measured by an increasingly resilient underlying combined ratio, which again was solidly profitable for the quarter. Notably in the quarter, we were pleased to receive conditional approval from the Central Bank of Ireland for our newest European operating platform Everest Insurance Ireland. This is another example of the thoughtful organic build of our franchise and the expansion of our global underwriting operation. Our Irish operating companies will be an important component of our overall international insurance strategy, and is an excellent complement to both our North American and Lloyd's operation.","I'll turn now to the financial highlights in the quarter, following this I'll provide some comments on the cat activity experienced within the insurance operations along with our views of the operating environment forward. As in prior quarters, due to the divestiture of Heartland in late third quarter of 2016, I will discuss our comparative results excluding this business. For the third quarter of 2017, the global insurance operations produced $480 million in gross written premium, an increase of $109 million or 30% over third quarter 2016. Another tremendous result and a recognition of our growing relevance in the specialty P&C market. On a year-to-date basis, we achieved $1.5 billion in gross written premium, again another solid performance. This represents growth of $349 or 31% over the comparable period in 2016.","As in prior quarters, contributions remain balanced across the diverse group of underwriting \u2013 underlying divisions within the Everest insurance global platform. This also represents the 11th consecutive quarter of growth for our global insurance operation.","Turning to net premium, as we have shared in the past. Net premium slightly lagged gross written premium growth, due to the marginally more conservative reinsurance position we have taken to support the growth across our underwriting divisions. Net earned premium in the quarter was $376 million, an increase of $63 million or 20%.","For the year-to-date period net earned premium of $1.1 billion, increased by $181 million or 21 or excuse me 20% over the prior year period. Our GAAP combined ratio for the quarter was 141.4%, clearly impacting by the catastrophe activity in the quarter, which contributed 43.5 points to this result. The attritional combined ratio however was 98% in the quarter, which compares favorably to the third quarter's 16 attritional of 99.5.","The underlying loss ratio for the third quarter of this year was 68.4%, a 1.4 point improvement over last year's 69.8%. On a year-to-date basis, the GAAP combined ratio was 113.9, was again nearly 17 points of cat included in this result. The year-to-date attritional combined ratio for the global insurance operation is producing 96.5%, which also compares favorably to the 97.1% for the comparable period in 2016.","Again the underlying loss ratio shows 1.2 points of improvement on a year-to-date basis coming in at 67% from the prior year 68.2%. Year-over-year, we are seeing a downward drift in the attritional loss ratio. This is a result of improved mix of business, the benefits from the many new businesses launch and strategic underwriting actions of the past two years.","Our expense ratio in the third quarter was 29.5% essentially flat from the 29.7% from the same period last year. For the year-to-date period, the expense ratio remains 29.5%, up slightly from the 28.9% in the comparable period of 2016. As we have stated in prior calls, an expense ratio of roughly 30% remains very competitive in the specialty insurance segment.","Turning now to the cat picture for the quarter. As you heard from Dom and John, Everest as an organization deploys a proactive and multifaceted approach to risk management. The insurance organization is deeply ingrained in the same processes and hence adopt many of the same views and strategies. The third quarter of 2017 certainly tested the efficacy of these strategies and the insurance operations results were consistent with our expectations and well within our tolerances.","In addition to measuring our performance against modeled assumptions, we also gauge our performance against industry loss and market share analysis, and of course from a fundamental of bottom-up view of our underwriting decisions with a keen focus on any outliers that may emerge from these underwriting strategies and assumptions. Again, again for all of these measures, the various books of business performed well and has anticipated and consistent with our global view of Everest.","And to put this in further perspective, we estimate roughly $160 million in net pre-tax losses from the three large cat events of Harvey, Irma and Maria. With the concentration of loss emanating for Harvey and Irma. The majority of this exposure was originated from our U.S. property underwriting division, covering the wholesale, retail and in the Marine markets, with some minor contributions from our Lloyd's platform.","This loss is against roughly $450 million in annualized worldwide property insurance premium, and roughly $2 billion of similarly annualized premium within the overall insurance operation. Together these data points suggest that these events are in proportion to our portfolio, and again within our various models of expectations.","One final comment on the cat side. It is important to remember that we are in the middle innings of a significant transformation of our insurance platform. As we have stated previously, this has caused a temporary lag in our earned premium and several of our new underwriting divisions have yet to achieve critical mass.","As these new units continue to grow, as we are demonstrating quarter-after-quarter. We expect that our short tail property exposure will be even more balanced against the larger non-property base. This will further allow us to drive the consistent profitable results, we have been experiencing more recently in our attritional combined ratios.","As for the question on market conditions, it is a very fluid situation and will take some months to find a balanced view. In fact, the current market is evidencing a fair amount of pricing volatility across lines. As we work through this adjustment process.","Overall and as we stated we do believe there is a need for rate firming. Certainly within the property market cat and non-cat like and also in other markets. It is our sense that general farming will continue to occur across property line to different degrees and other major lines of business are likely to experience positive rate movement.","Remember certain casualty lines of business mainly commercial auto have been experiencing rate increase for many quarters and based on underlying loss cost trends, that need to continue. Other lines of business likewise need to adjust proper technical pricing. And I believe the industry at all levels understands that we can perpetuate in an environment where pricing persist below these technical levels. Again each market, each geography in each line of business are different; however, they need to achieve adequate technical pricing remains universal, that is our focus.","In conclusion, despite the impact of the cat event in the quarter, we remain pleased with the continued progress we are making and the establishment of a world-class specialty insurer. The underlying performance of our diverse books of business are encouraging and we feel we are well-positioned to create value for all of our constituents and the evolving market ahead. We look forward to continuing our momentum and reporting back to you on our progress next quarter.","Now, back to Beth for Q&A.","Elizabeth Farrell","Thank you, Jon. Jennifer, we are open for questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll have our first through Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning. My first question just going back to your introductory comments, when you pointed to marking farming across all lines in territories. I just, if we can get more color on you know, I mean, if \u2013 is this depending on alternative capital, reloading or not reloading following the events, I guess, how do you see the dynamics underlying the market firming as we get closer to the January 1 renewals?","Dominic James Addesso","Well, there's a number of factors, Elyse, that lead us to believe that there is an [ph] opening market (33:42). First of all, starting with the various industry events that clearly we have been attending throughout the past month starting with Monte Carlo and moving on to PCI and Baden and the CIAB. The strength of the market in terms of [ph] its resolve (34:01) continue to increase based on our assessment and various talking with customers, brokers, [ph] and other markets (34:09). So, that's number one.","And underpinning all that has been what I've been saying for some time is that the returns on capital, return on equity of the industry in general, as you all know, has been in the mid single-digit for a period of time. And therefore, these types of events are unsustainable with mid single-digit ROEs in times of low to no cat activity. So, clearly, the market has been below technical pricing adequacy. So, that's number one.","With respect to alternative capital coming back in, start off with a good portion, a significant portion of alternative capital is locked up. And it's our belief that certainly some new capital will come back in, but it's not clear yet that 100% of that, at least in the short term, is ready to move back in. And frankly, alternative capital is not going to come back in unless it sees some price improvement. So, that's my fundamental belief as to why I think there will be a market firming. I don't think it's dependent on alternative capital. There's technical pricing needs across many of our lines of business, not just property, and there has been a reassessment of cost of capital [indiscernible] (35:49)","Elyse Greenspan","What level of rate do you think we could see on both loss and potentially non-loss impacted accounts?","Dominic James Addesso","I knew we would eventually get to that question, and I'm not necessarily going to say that we're expecting X percent by this timeframe. I think we will see in the retro market a very, very strong double-digit rate increases early on, and perhaps that would last into a second renewal season. That of course, as you know, with firm retro pricing that has a waterfall impact on the rest of property cat. We're already, as Jonathan somewhat alluded to, on the primary side. It's mixed, early days, but we are seeing \u2013 beginning to see some price movement upward, but that will take a longer period of time to get to what we believe will be rate adequacy.","So, at the primary level, ultimately, it's in the early days, it's high single-digit, but that might take several months to really play out. On the reinsurance front, straight up property cat, I think will start in the teens, again in loss affected areas and perhaps that will take multiple years to play out. But it is \u2013 we don't know for sure, but clearly, we are approaching the January 1 renewals with the anticipation that rates are going up.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Great. I appreciate the color. And then, also if you could talk about the potential implications on the tax side if [ph] the NIL bill (37:34) is included within tax reform?","Dominic James Addesso","Potential implications to the industry to us? What is \u2013 where is the...","Elyse Greenspan","For Everest, sorry. For you guys specifically.","Dominic James Addesso","There is many derivations of that. We have various companies that are in place obviously in the U.S., in Bermuda, in Ireland, in other jurisdictions and we have capital in most of those locations. So, depending on what the final shape of that bill is, we'll dictate where we position our capital and what companies we will be running business on.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate the color.","Dominic James Addesso","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan","Thank you, and good morning. First question, just a follow-up on Elyse's question on alternative capital. How much was the total losses for Mt. Logan and what's your investors sort of risk appetite after those events?","Dominic James Addesso","Let me ask Craig the total loss for Mt. Logan.","Craig Howie","The total loss for Mt. Logan was almost $200 million. And then, of course [indiscernible] (38:57) income as well. So, you'll see that there, AUM is down about $116 million for the quarter.","Dominic James Addesso","And then, I'm sorry the second follow-on to that, Kai, was?","Kai Pan","What are the sort of your \u2013 the investors in Mt. Logan, what's their risk appetite following these events?","Dominic James Addesso","We have and have had actually before the events but even after the events, we have investors that are ready to put capital in. Some reload, some new investors that are interested in going forward with the Logan platform, all with an expectation that rates are going up. That kind of relates back to my earlier response to Elyse.","Kai Pan","Okay. My second question is that [ph] you sit at about (39:48) 10% of your reinsurance premiums, about 20% of your insurance premiums. I just wonder if the retro or reinsurance rates going up [ph] some (39:56) double-digits, how would that impact your sort of underwriting strategy [ph] in term of net growth (40:02)?","Dominic James Addesso","John?","John Doucette","Good morning, Kai. It's John. So, I think there's a lot of dials that we look at both in terms of absolute and relative rate adequacy. So, we'll look at it both on the growth side in terms of how we're going to deploy the capital to which area, which product line, which territory, and then how much we want to deploy. So, how much we want to deploy and how much we want to retain, that will be a function of what we think would be overall rate adequacy is.","And then, yes, we will look to the different hedges whether it's additional hedges of reinsurance and retro. But remember, we have a lot of dials to turn on how we get the business, as I mentioned, from insurance, reinsurance, all the way to retro. And we have a lot of different dials to turn in terms of how we manage our net risk appetite and net risk exposure.","And those include Mt. Logan that takes shares of different pools of risk and stand with Everest on whatever the rates are that we get, and as well as the catastrophe bonds that we have where we have $2.8 billion of multi-year aggregate catastrophe bond, most of which [indiscernible] (41:27) vast majority of that is still intact going forward into January 1 and later.","Dominic James Addesso","To add to that, to pick up on something that John has alluded to there, keep in mind that what we have been doing through the market cycle here is the market had been softening over the past couple of years, we've been moving attachment points, and deploying our capital to where we felt was the best risk-adjusted returns. And where we will be going forward, perhaps we'll be changing that again so that where the market is getting the appropriate rate increase and where the best risk-adjusted returns are is where we will be deploying our capital. So, that could change over the next 12 months.","Kai Pan","Okay. If I may, the last question is a quick one on the tax rates. So, what's the expected tax rate for the first quarter, will it be normalized like 11%, 12%?","Dominic James Addesso","I mentioned in my script, Kai that I believe the tax rate for the fourth quarter, any income earned in the fourth quarter should be at an effective rate of about 10%.","Kai Pan","Great. Well, thank you so much.","Dominic James Addesso","Thank you, Kai.","Operator","We'll go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb","Thanks very much. I know you mentioned the view that the third quarter catastrophe losses were within your risk parameters. Was there anything coming out of your after \u2013 accident reports in the third quarter that ever possibly could have done different or better, looking back on these catastrophe losses?","Dominic James Addesso","There is always things around the edges that you can improve upon. There's nothing material, but stands out. I guess in the very extreme and the absurd, could have been no property cat. That's obviously not a realistic scenario. I have to be honest with you, I think what we have done and the way we've managed our portfolio I think has been pretty much spot on, as again during the \u2013 over the last couple of years, as you know, we've been earning very, very good returns on our capital. We've been leveraging the retro market, the capital markets, and allowed us to maintain our writings while not diminishing our returns on capital. And the loss, frankly, has come out well within our parameters.","So, there's not really \u2013 I suppose the only other thing that we could have done is again Monday morning quarterback, buy more reinsurance for our insurance portfolio. But looking at it from this vantage point, I'm certain we would make the same decisions.","Jay Gelb","Thanks, Dom. And using that is kind of as a starting point for the next question. The combined \u2013 [ph] the account of your (44:50) combined ratio in the third quarter in the insurance business, over 140%, is \u2013 what can be done differently there to bring this to obviously not in 2017, but in 2018 and beyond, bring this to a calendar year underwriting profit for the business?","Dominic James Addesso","Well, I mean that combined ratio that you cite includes the catastrophe losses. So, are you talking attritional, are you talking all-in?","Jay Gelb","All-in. I mean, looking out into next year, it's been a number of years I think since the insurance business has generated underwriting profit.","Dominic James Addesso","Well, on an attritional basis, it is generating an underwriting profit and we see the improvement in the attritional combined ratio year-over-year. So, we are moving in the proper direction.","We view our cat book, we view on a corporate or global basis. So, when we are allocating capacity, when we're looking at the marketplace, we're looking at our cat exposure globally and I should say corporately. So, that was well within our risk appetite. To the extent that it is, then we could certainly entertain some intercompany reinsurance opportunities that would, in effect, manage that combined ratio perhaps to the point that you're describing. But overall, we are very confident and very pleased with the attritional performance of our book.","Jay Gelb","That's helpful. And then two final quick ones. One, any perspectives on exposure in the fourth quarter from the California wildfires? And then separately, since the company is more focused on deploying capital in the business, should we kind of zero out the potential for share buybacks going into next year?","Dominic James Addesso","As you know, we don't \u2013 let me answer the wildfire question first. At this point, it's fairly still early, but the losses we've modeled it and what we're hearing from customers and underwriters is that it is well within our normal quarterly cat load. So, we're not concerned about that event at least at this point.","Relative to share buybacks, as you know, we don't give an indication of what our appetite is. We are in the process of just reformulating, if you will, our plans for next year and we'll have perhaps more to say on that in the weeks and months ahead.","Jay Gelb","Appreciate it. Thank you.","Dominic James Addesso","Thank you, Jay.","Operator","We'll go next to Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker","Yes. Good morning, everybody.","Dominic James Addesso","Good morning, Josh.","Josh Shanker","So, I want to square if talks about improving pricing was also your appetite for growth. Compared to many of your peers, you have found opportunities in this marketplace where others haven't and you grew very nicely in this third quarter as well. If someone says look, if there's attractive opportunities, prices maybe doesn't need to go up or how do I square those two things?","Dominic James Addesso","Well, is your question on the reinsurance front or the insurance front?","Josh Shanker","Well, you can [ph] talk both (48:13) I mean, clearly, the insurance book is obviously growing faster, but you're also finding I guess in financial lines, you found opportunities in reinsurance which is obviously not property. But there's a lot of \u2013 not just you [indiscernible] (48:27) pricing has to go up. But here's Everest and I respect your work and whatnot, and you guys are finding opportunities very helpfully, I think, or maybe I'm not reading it correctly.","Dominic James Addesso","No. So, in part, the reinsurance growth is \u2013 remember we took on a crop reinsurance portfolio, so the growth is coming from that. Mortgage has been growing as well. And then, few property \u2013 or few pro-rata deals have added to that as well. And some our structured products there, our structured solutions group has been adding some premium as well. Our straight up property cat business has not really grown all that much year-over-year and that's frankly because of softening market, moving attachment points, all those things in the mix have kind of capped out kind of our appetite on property risk, cat risk.","Josh Shanker","Yes. Yes.","Dominic James Addesso","Does that \u2013 I don't know if that...","Josh Shanker","And so, as you're adding on business in the primary insurance book, is that business dependent on the industry having cheap reinsurance on the property side to allow you to grow there?","Dominic James Addesso","Absolutely not. And as Jonathan pointed out in his opening comments, we expect the non-property lines actually to grow a little faster in the coming quarters. So, you'll see even a better balance between property and non-property.","Josh Shanker","And, okay, I will try and dig a little deeper on that. The other question, obviously you guys bought more protection throughout the year, lowering your PMLs, but we never really got any numbers to that. Is there any color you can give us on where your PMLs stand now versus where they stood at the beginning of this year?","John Doucette","Josh, it's John. Yeah. I mean, I think they were basically materially similar. There was a decrease due to the cat bonds that we issued in the March and April time period. But part of that, and we continue to use third party capital as a way to think about managing our portfolio, managing the overall risk appetite, shaping it.","And so to the extent that we had some additional capacity through the aggregate catastrophe bonds that we purchased that covered Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico among other areas, that helped us in terms of then as we went into June 1 and July 1 in terms of the renewal period to maintain a net PML position that we were comfortable with.","Josh Shanker","Okay. Well thank you for all the color and good luck with this renewal season.","Dominic James Addesso","Thank you, Josh. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research Group.","Amit Kumar","Thanks and good morning, and thanks for the questions. Just two questions. The first question is the discussion on the catastrophe bonds, and I think what I heard was they didn't kick in. Can you remind us, and I know they all have different attachment points, what do the industrial losses need to get to for your cat bonds to trigger?","John Doucette","Good morning. So the catastrophe bonds, some of them we purchased, so across the $2.8 billion there was several layers, different [ph] parallel (52:14) covers. They all cover North America in some fashion and Puerto Rico, several of them. And then some of them are on an occurrence basis and including the most recent $1.25 billion as well as some of the previous ones are on an aggregate basis.","So these bonds that we purchased are typically done tied to industry losses, and then there is different market shares that are applied as per the bond. There are different market shares based on territories that are exposed, so there's not really a simple answer to that question. So the market shares in each of the bonds in each of the territories will vary as we try to shape the bond to then best hedge our overall portfolio.","So the most latest catastrophe bonds of the $1.25 billion that we issued, they are done on an industry basis so people such as yourself can do your own research on whether you think they're expected to be penetrated or not. There had been some markdowns in the bonds that reflected that there may be some potential penetration to the lowest layer, but that really is going to end up being ultimately up to what the final industry losses are going to be.","Amit Kumar","Got it. That's a fair point. Yeah, it's a bit tough to figure out with the weighted index attachment. The second question I had was, I guess, a discussion on the missing industry losses, and we've sort of raised this topic on other calls as to how do we get to the industry loss of $100 billion-plus versus the current addition of the disclosed losses. If the industry loss were to move downwards, does your net loss move up? Can you just help us understand that metric a bit better?","Dominic James Addesso","No. As the industry loss moves down, you're expecting our loss to go up? Is that what you asked?","Amit Kumar","No, I was thinking about the recoveries, at what level they trigger in. That's what I was asking, sorry.","Dominic James Addesso","Our net loss contemplates recoveries from the various instruments that John has just kind of outlined. Which does mean that if the industry loss goes down, our net loss position really doesn't change a whole heck of a lot.","Amit Kumar","Got it.","Dominic James Addesso","There is some movement that could occur, but it all depends on industry loss, where the loss is coming from, what the weightings are. So it's a little difficult to give a precise answer to that, but my point is that there shouldn't be \u2013 within a band, our net loss position doesn't change a whole heck of a lot. It's really...","Amit Kumar","And, Dom, just to your point...","John Doucette","And staying on the other side, which is if the losses go up because of the various protections, including the aggregate catastrophe bonds I was just talking about which are very close to the aggregate retention being exhausted or slightly into the first layer, it also means that if the industry losses go up then our net loss position won't change materially.","Amit Kumar","Fair point. And Dom, any view on this, I guess, the missing billions of industry losses. I mean, obviously we're talking about rate firming. You're quite positive on the market scenario. [indiscernible] (56:06)...","Dominic James Addesso","Now all you smart folks have been exploring this and asking managements on all the calls and have been looking at it for weeks and you can't find it, I don't know how you expect us, a simple man like me to figure that out for you. But if there was a place to look, I would look in the capital markets piece. That's my expectation of where kind of the missing numbers are.","Amit Kumar","Yeah, that's a fair point. That's all I have. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.","Dominic James Addesso","Thank you, Amit.","Operator","We'll go next to Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields","Thanks. I had to two big picture questions and then one more number-specific. So Dom, I was wondering, one, if you could give us a sense of third party investor elasticity, in other words how various levels of rate changes might affect the supply of third party capital And secondly, whether based on your experience it makes sense to hold back some capital from 1\/1 renewals in anticipation of better rate changes later in 2018?","Dominic James Addesso","Two great questions. Third party capital is looking to come back into the space where what I would call reload if it can get meaningful rate increases, and the definition of meaningful can vary by company, it can vary by investor. Do I see a material increase in third party capital if we have some level of market firming? I do not.","I think first, the capital has to be reloaded, and I think what your question was implying was is the third party capital going to increase materially if there is some material increase in pricing. We don't see that just yet. I also think that the other side of the equation is that, and what we've heard from some clients, is that they're more interested in potentially increasing their purchases from rated paper as opposed to third party capital. The whole issue of reinstates are always a problem there, and so there does seem to be an increased interest in rated paper.","Now, that doesn't mean by the way that reinsurers like ourselves, which utilize third party capital and see it as an opportunity to expand our capital base, wouldn't increase. But to the extent that it does allow reinsurers to perhaps increase the participations of clients directly as opposed to have those clients buy from third party capital, we think that might represent an opportunity certainly in the medium-term.","In terms of holding back capital, we're in a marketplace. We have customers and we have sufficient capital and\/or access to capital that, well, we can trade forward or trade in a bigger way if rates are even firming more into the year. I think that the fundamental question is we won't be deploying capital unless it meets our risk-adjusted return hurdles, so that's the first test. And if it meets our hurdles, and we would anticipate it would probably even, in some circumstances, exceed our hurdles, then we would deploy the capital, and there isn't a need to hold back capital in that regard. Does that answer your two questions?","Meyer Shields","It does, certainly well. Thank you. Follow-up, or not follow-up, but within the insurance segment, I guess, both last year and this year the attritional loss ratio was higher in the third quarter than it was in the preceding two. And I was wondering is there some element to seasonality or is that just a lucky draw?","Dominic James Addesso","In any one particular quarter, there's adjustments we're making to pick loss ratios. Our A&H book of business for example has been growing which, by definition, carries a little bit higher attritional loss ratio. We think it's more appropriate to look at the year-to-date performance since it takes out some of those quarterly anomalies which makes the business \u2013 where we're pegging loss ratios in any one particular quarter, we make adjustments in a quarter. But it's the year-to-date number that really is what we think and what we look at predominantly, and that's improving year-over-year. That's trending in the right manner.","Meyer Shields","Yeah. Absolutely. Thank you very much.","Meyer Shields","Thank you, Meyer.","Operator","And we'll go to our final question from Brian Meredith of UBS.","Brian Meredith","Yeah. Thanks. A couple of quick questions here for you, Dom. The first, I'm just curious. At Mt. Logan, how much collateral do you expect to be tied up at the 1\/1 renewals and do you plan on kind of replenishing that with new money here on that?","Dominic James Addesso","Do it, John.","John Doucette","Yeah. It's John. So the amount that would be tied up would be consistent with the expected losses that are there plus a buffer that would be on top of that against the ceded losses. And then in terms of how much we would look to raise or redeploy, we're in the process of talking to Logan investors, both existing and new ones, and we would expect \u2013 we don't know what the final number will be, but we would expect it to be up.","Brian Meredith","Got you.","Dominic James Addesso","And those investors, to make it clear, are looking also for rates to be up, and they're not looking to deploy capital in a flat to down market.","John Doucette","Right. And it allows, as Dom said earlier, there clearly is a trend in the buyers both in the reinsurance and retro market looking for rated paper because there are some fundamental structural problems which we're going to see it's going to play out in real time because with the collateralized products. In terms of collateral release mechanisms, forced collateral release, people may realize they thought they had cover and then they don't have as much cover as they thought or they don't have continuity of cover from one year to the next as collateral gets trapped.","So there's a clear demand for rated paper. And with our balance sheet, our ratings, and kind of our 45-year trading relationship with clients the around the world, expect to be in a good position to capitalize on that. And so part of that would be to make sure that we get the right net risk position to be able to use our different capital structures, such as Mt. Logan, to help. But basically, if Everest gets raised, the Mt. Logan investors will benefit from that, so we stand pari passu with them.","Brian Meredith","Right. That's great. And then I'm just curious. Given history has kind of shown that on the property cat line rate increases tend to be fairly short-lived. Not sure if you expect that this time around. But given that, would you expect to potentially disproportionally put more into Mt. Logan or some type of a soft capital facility to kind of help manage that risk?","Dominic James Addesso","I think, we have demonstrated over the last couple of years that we deploy our capital in the best risk-adjusted areas. We have used third party capital. We will write the business on the basis that we think is best for the organization and use the capital that's out there in the most highly efficient manner possible. So it's difficult to answer that question precisely, but I think what we've demonstrated is that we're flexible and we tend to be within ranges, opportunistic, and we move our capacity around. And we will continue to do that as we trade forward if what you're suggesting is that the firming would be short-lived.","Brian Meredith","Great. That's great. And then one last one. I'm just curious. So John and Dom, I appreciate your point about the industry, kind of cost of capital going up here. But do you think that the kind of cost to goods sold for property cat reinsurance based upon models and stuff is also going to rise here and it's going to drive some of this rate activity or do you not see that happening?","Dominic James Addesso","I'll ask John to address that.","John Doucette","Yeah. So I think a lot of times \u2013 every time a loss happens there's always something that the different vendors learn from, something different than before and they adjust it. That typically takes a few years to ripple through the system as they update their models to kind of fit the historical events set or the different events that happen.","So certainly, I think take what happened in Houston, I think there's going to be a heightened awareness to flooding risk in different ways than people. Certainly, some of the vendor models had thought about it before. But this is true with the different earthquakes, whether it was the New Zealand earthquake or the four zones on the Japanese earthquake. It's been a long time since a catastrophe of that size hit, Maria, and I think the modeling agencies will think that through.","And for a little while there, we were looking at a Cat 5 hitting Miami, and I think that will both change some customers' views of their risk management as well as potentially change some of the vendor models with that as they think about the possibilities with the different storm tracks. But a lot of that takes a \u2013 the customer views may be more \u2013 happen in real time as people think about what board of directors for some of our clients think about what their risk position is and how much they want to keep net, and that may put some upward demand on reinsurance. But in terms of the modeling agencies, it usually takes a little bit to go through the system.","Brian Meredith","Great. And then...","Dominic James Addesso","Bottom line, Brian, I think the models are great. Everyone in the industry uses them. Events like this I think caused all managements to take them with a little bit of grain of salt and recognize that there is risk that is not evidenced through the models, and that in fact will have some impact on pricing, will have some impact on buying behavior as well.","Brian Meredith","Great. And then kind of just one quick numbers question for Craig, let him do some talking here. In the operating expense line, was there any kind of reversal of maybe variable incentive comp that happened?","Craig Howie","Yes. We did that this quarter as well, Brian, just because of a matching with the events. But that'll be determined again in the fourth quarter depending on where we stand with respect to income in the fourth quarter.","Brian Meredith","Great. Thank you.","Brian Meredith","I'm glad Craig was able to be able to respond.","Craig Howie","That's right.","Dominic James Addesso","That's it. Okay. So we've had all our questions, and thanks for those. In summary, I think what you heard this morning is that our risk management practices have contained the losses within our expectations, and that kind of permits us to trade forward and participate fully in what we believe, and I think the market believes, there will be firming.","We think this is true not only because of what markets in general are saying but also because there will be some dislocation of capital which, as I said before, will benefit highly rated papers such as ours. So this is the business we're in but this does create some opportunity for us going forward.","Well thank you for your participation on the call and I look forward to our continued dialog. Happy Halloween.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."],"8438":["Everest Re Group Ltd.

As a reminder, today\u2019s presentation is being recorded.","And now for opening remarks and introductions, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Beth Farrell","Thank you, Catherine. Good morning. And welcome to Everest Re Group\u2019s third quarter 2012 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Joe Taranto, the company\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dom Addesso, our President; and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today\u2019s call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements.","Now let me turn the call over to Joe.","Joe Taranto","Thanks, Beth. Good morning. As we enter 2012, I indicated that I was optimistic about generating quality earnings for the year. So far through nine months, it's clear that optimism was warranted.","Through nine months we have generated $1 billion of comprehensive income for our shareholders, resulting in growth and book value per share, adjusted for dividends of 17.4%. The reasons I was positive continue and accordingly, I remain upbeat about our future. Let me go through that reasoning.","First, the global reinsurance market in reaction to $100 billion plus of 2011 catastrophic losses, increased rates and tightened terms and conditions, our strategy was to benefit from these changes by increasing our potential profit margins without meaningfully increasing our PML\u2019s in our peak zones. Our team did a superb job of executing the strategy.","Now we have seen alternative capital sources entering the market, also looking to benefit from these improved terms. This additional capacity has stabilized the market at a reasonable level, so I continued to expect quality opportunities for 2013.","Second, we have a very clear underwriting philosophy that is solely focused on profit, not volume. It is also focused on portfolio management, looking for the best deals on which to deploy our capital.","Third, we continue to pursue opportunities where we possess the specialization to achieve superior results. For our insurance operation, this includes, crop insurance, medical stop-loss business, financial institution D&O and California workers comp.","Of course, the drought in the U.S. has produced losses for our crop book. We expect in any given year we will have losses on some portion of our book. But just as 2011 catastrophe losses, increased rates and demands for catastrophe reinsurance, going forward, we expect we will see increased demand for crop insurance, and the government will include the 2012 results as part of future rate making.","Fourth, our $16.5 billion of invested assets continue to perform well given the current market conditions.","Fifth, our strong earnings will allow us to buyback more stock, which we expect will increase shareholder return. Through nine months, we have bought back $250 million worth of stock or 5% of the outstanding shares as of 12\/31\/11.","We have also paid $76 million in dividends through nine months. In the third quarter, we bought back only $25 million worth of stock, given it was hurricane season, plus we have Hurricane Isaac and the drought conditions.","Nonetheless, we increased our surplus by $368 million in the quarter and by $714 million for the year. What we didn't spend yesterday on stock repurchase is in surplus available for tomorrow's purchases.","Sixth, our management team is the strongest it has ever been. I would stack it up against any company in our space in the world. Working with Dom, John Doucette, Craig Howie and our other senior managers has been great. We\u2019ve never been more focused and energized.","Now, I will turn it over to Dom for the report on operations and then Craig will give you the financial reports.","Dom Addesso","Thank you, Joe, and good morning. As Joe mentioned, the results for the year have been quite positive and the third quarter has added to what was experienced in the first half. In addition, the operating earnings have improved quarter-over-quarter, which reflects the underwriting gain of $129 million this current quarter versus a $46 million gain in the prior year.","Underlying this is a pattern of continued quarterly improvement in the underwriting result. The year-over-year comparisons are complicated by the cat losses in 2011, but what is worth noting is the positive trend this year quarter-by-quarter in the attritional combined ratio, that stands at 84.9% in the most recent quarter.","This improved operating performance is due to the results in the reinsurance segments where the attritional combined ratio dropped to 77.9% and to a reported combined ratio of 80.1% including catastrophe losses.","After the cat losses of $25 million there was $157 million underwriting gain for the quarter. On the year-to-date basis the reinsurance underwriting gain was over $375 million, which includes $85 million of cat losses.","All this points to a portfolio that more recently has been repositioned to more of an excessive loss mix, which has the ability to generate healthy margins. Our year-to-date cat premium is approximately $1 billion, three quarters of which is written on an excessive loss basis.","As a result, the property lines in all regions continue to drive the improved results despite some slowing of the rate increases. Nevertheless, it was positive rate change during the third quarter. In particular, Australia saw improvements of 10% to 15% in rates during the quarter.","Casualty lines on the other hand, while seeing some improvement in rates are still not hard enough or moving fast enough to make any meaningful improvement in results. We continue to remain cautious on casualty reinsurance and while the shift from pro rata to excess in the property lines is improving the bottom line. It has resulted in less premium growth than would otherwise be the case.","Turning to the insurance operations for the quarter, the results were mostly affected by the drought-related crop losses. The impact of these losses on the quarter was $20 million. The remaining portions of the book performed in line with expectations. In fact, excluding crop business, the attritional combined ratio for the year was at 99.2%.","The primary A&H, which is medical stop-loss business, is growing nicely and profitably. The casualty business, which is focused on specialty classes, is experiencing double-digit rate increases. And California workers\u2019 comp also continues at double-digit rate increases.","While the insurance marketplace is currently a challenging environment, the core businesses we are now focused on are trending nicely. We certainly expect the improvements to continue into the fourth quarter with ongoing rate increases, growth in our A&H business and an expected normal crop season for the winter harvest.","Overall, we continue to focus on ways to improve the underwriting margins, as investment income gains are difficult to achieve in this low yield environment. Despite this, we have done extremely well over the last three years in maintaining investment income.","We are pleased with the performance of our invested assets both for the quarter and year-to-date. And while the investment-- while investment grade bonds constitute the bulk of our assets, at 79% of the total, our asset allocation has become increasingly diversified.","This has allowed us to reduce the duration exposure of our assets, maintain an average credit quality for our fixed income securities of AA-minus and add investment income and total return beyond that of our investment grade bonds.","Our allocations to alternative fixed income securities and publicly traded equities have been accretive to investment income. As those assets carry an average market yield that is nearly 250 basis points more than our investment grade bonds.","The total return of invested assets has also been helped with the non-investment bond assets returning 200 basis points more for the quarter and nearly 600 basis points more year-to-date than investment grade bonds.","So while our investment bond portfolio continues to provide principal protection and predictable investment income, our alternatives have added to income and total return, while providing more diversity in our invested assets. While the investment in insurance markets may continue to be a challenge, we will benefit from our financial strength and the unique ability of our staff to seek out creative opportunities.","I mentioned on the last call that we had made some organizational changes, and the benefits are already being felt in the number and type of opportunities we see. Our security and experience has never been more highly valued. The combined ratio of 87.2% for the quarter is just one of those positive signs.","Thank you. And I will now turn it over to Craig.","Craig Howie","Thank you, Dom, and good morning, everyone. We\u2019re pleased to report that Everest had another very strong quarter with after-tax operating income of $210.6 million, or $4.05 per diluted common share. I won\u2019t be comparing these results to last year, given the record catastrophes experienced in 2011.","Net income for the third quarter was $250.9 million or $4.82 per diluted share. Net income includes realized capital gains. On a year-to-date basis, operating income was $673.5 million or $12.78 per share. This represents an annualized operating return on equity of 15.3%.","Net income year-to-date was $770.2 million or $14.61 per share. These year-to-date results reflect a continued improvement in the overall current year attritional combined ratio, which has declined from 86.3% to 86.0%. This measure excludes the impact of catastrophes reinstatement premiums and prior period loss development.","The total reinsurance attritional combined ratio was 81.8% compared to 82.2% in the prior year. The insurance segment attritional combined ratio was 102.8% compared to 101.8% in the prior year. However, eliminating the effects of the primary crop book, this ratio would have been 99.2% compared to 101.3% in the prior year.","These improvements, both on the reinsurance book and the insurance book, should continue as rate increases earn in over time. Also providing better margins is the shift in our reinsurance portfolio from quota share to excess of loss.","Gross written premiums of $1.20 billion for the quarter were up 7% compared to third quarter of 2011. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Heartland. More on the crop business in a moment.","On a year-to-date business, gross written premiums were $3.16 billion. This represents an increase of 2% after adjusting for reinstatement premium and the effects of foreign currency movements.","Earned premiums of $1.01 billion for the quarter did not change significantly compared to the same quarter last year, after adjusting for reinstatement premiums and foreign exchange.","Although we've achieved strong rate increases on portions of our book, especially on catastrophe exposed risks. Year-to-date earned premiums of $3.05 billion also have not changed significantly year-over-year.","However, the shift in capacity, away from proportional risks does mask that effect, as excess of loss business carries lower premium. These increases have provided significant margin improvement on a comparative premium base.","The reinsurance segments reported a year-to-date earned premiums of $2.4 billion, down less than 1% from 2011. The insurance segment reported $219 million of earned premiums for the quarter, which was up 1% over third quarter of 2011.","On a year-to-date basis, insurance earned premiums are $611 million or down 5% year-over-year. This is primarily due to the runoff of certain program business and lower crop earned premium in the current year.","Last year, the crop premium was earned evenly throughout the year as reinsurance premium. The insurance segment reflects $45 million of seasonal earned premiums from crop business in the third quarter, with $84 million now earned year-to-date. We expect full calendar year net premium from this book to total about $150 million.","We booked the primary crop business at 145% combined ratio for the quarter and 120% on a year-to-date basis. This represented a $20 million pretax underwriting loss for the quarter but there is still some uncertainty as crop yields and commodity prices are not yet finalized for the year.","However, the company does purchase stop-loss reinsurance coverage for its primary crop portfolio. The MPCI coverage attaches at a 110% loss ratio. Currently, the book loss ratio remains below 100% on a year-to-date basis.","We would need to see additional pretax losses of more than $16 million for the 2012 crop year before we would attach this cover. The insurance segment reported a $28.2 million underwriting loss for the quarter and a $22.8 million loss year-to-date. This reflects the crop loss I just discussed.","All reinsurance segments reported underwriting gains for both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. Total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $157.1 million for the quarter and $375.8 million year-to-date.","The overall underwriting gain for the Group was $129 million for the quarter and $352.9 million for the year so far. Our reported combined ratio was 87.2% for the quarter and 88.4% year-to-date.","The commission ratio for the year is up 1.1 points compared to the prior year. This increase relates to a number of one-time adjustments and settlements and the change in accounting for deferred acquisition costs.","The 21.9% commission ratio for the quarter is within our normal range. The expense ratio for the year is up 0.5 points compared to last year. This increase primarily relates to the increased accrual for personnel costs and incentive compensation.","For the quarter, we reported $25 million of current year catastrophe losses. These losses are primarily related to hurricane Isaac in the U.S. this quarter. This brings our year-to-date gross cat losses to $85 million for 2012 or 2.8% of earned premiums.","Regarding 2011 catastrophe losses we allocated another $15 million of the $50 million cap IBNR established at the end of last year to cover higher estimates on several 2011 events. We still have $15 million of this catastrophe IBNR remaining.","On reserves, our overall quarterly internal reserving metrics continue to be favorable. We are in the process of completing our annual loss reserve studies. The outcome related to these studies, if any will be booked in the fourth quarter.","For investments, pre-tax investment income was $152 million for the quarter and $453.8 million year-to-date on our $16.5 billion investment portfolio. Year-to-date investment income declined $40 million from one year ago. This decrease was primarily driven by lower limited partnership income, which was down $19 million this year and by declining reinvestment rates.","Despite the declining rates, our investment portfolio continues to perform well. It is a conservative, well diversified portfolio with high average credit quality. The quarter reflected $62.7 million of pre-tax realized capital gains and $40.4 million of gains after tax. On a year-to-date basis, we had $144.9 million of pre-tax realized capital gains and $96.7 million of gains after tax. These gains are mainly attributable to fair value adjustments.","On income taxes, the 17.9% effective tax rate on operating income for the quarter reflects higher than expected income. And the impact of the realized capital gains this quarter on the annualized effective tax rate calculation. The 11.0% year-to-date effective tax rate on operating income is within our revised expected range for the year.","Turning to other miscellaneous items, the $703,000 derivative gain for the quarter relates to the rise in the equity markets offset by the change in interest rates during the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we reported a derivative loss of $9.4 million compared to a loss of $19.3 million in the prior year.","Other income largely reflects foreign exchange losses for both this quarter and the quarter one year ago. On a year-to-date basis, we reported foreign exchange gains compared to foreign exchange losses a year ago.","Operating cash flows were $175 million for the quarter, compared to $208 million in the third quarter of 2011. Higher underwriting cash flows were offset by lower investment income receipts and higher tax payments in the current quarter.","We earned $407 million of comprehensive income this quarter. This primarily reflects $251 million of net income for the quarter, plus unrealized appreciation on securities of $118 million and foreign currency translation adjustments of $36 million. We now have $997 million of comprehensive income year-to-date.","Turning now to capital management, in addition to dividend payments to shareholders of $25 million, we repurchased 229,000 shares this quarter during wind season, at a total cost of $25 million.","For the year, we've repurchased 2.6 million shares at a total cost of $250 million. The company has 4.7 million shares remaining under our share repurchase authorization from the Board of Directors.","Shareholders equity increased to $6.8 billion this quarter, up 12% from $6.1 billion at year end 2011. This is after taking into account, the $259 million of stock repurchases and the $76 million of dividends paid so far this year.","Book value per share increased 16% to $131.22 from $112.99 at year-end 2011. Our strong capital position leaves us with capacity to maximize our business opportunities as well as continue share repurchases.","Thank you. And now I'll turn it back to Beth for Q&A.","Beth Farrell","Catherine, we are now open for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we'll hear first from Gregory Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. Good morning and congrats on another great quarter. Wanted to just pursue the capital deployment side of things, can you comment on buybacks in the fourth quarter to date or have you been blacked out so far?","Joe Taranto","No, we haven't bought anything so far in the fourth quarter, Greg.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And what is your -- I guess you've said you're interested in doing it. It looks to me like between dividends and the repurchases to date, that's about $325 million or so. Yet, your after-tax op income for the year could approach $800 million if you do sort of consensus numbers in the fourth quarter.","So that's even just not building a lot of excess, you need to do an awful lot of buyback this quarter. How do you think about sort of your appetite to buyback, and how should we be modeling that in this quarter?","Joe Taranto","Well, your numbers are correct, Greg. And likewise, we see this as a very good year so far and with a good fourth quarter and it will be an excellent year. And you're right, that will give us great capacity to buyback more in the future and certainly in the fourth quarter.","Third quarter is basically hurricane season that should be over in a couple of weeks. And I guess, I'm just going to the same place that I believe you're going that there should be ample available earnings and surplus that frankly we can buyback a fair amount in the fourth quarter and beyond.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley","Okay. I guess it just, it keeps building up. Is there any other way to deploy it organically and maybe perhaps, the question would be around the January 1 renewals, what are seeing? What do you anticipate on the underwriting side in terms of organic growth going forward?","Joe Taranto","Well, let me first say the fact that it keeps building up in a big way is a good thing. That means that we are having very good earnings and our capital is increasing and we're very, very happy about that. ","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley","Absolutely.","Joe Taranto","And that's the main thing. And of course, that does mean that we have more available to buyback. As far as the future and January 1, we're not looking at it as if the market is going to change all that much from where it is now. It will continue to be ample opportunity on the property side and the cash side. We certainly are looking into some other areas.","Our management team, as we noted is very energized and we do expect to find some opportunities beyond the cat side. Casualty, Dom talked a bit about that where we're still in more of a wait and see approach than putting a lot more capacity into growing that end of the book.","But many others are getting much more optimistic about it. We hope they're right. We hope rates continue to go up and frankly that we ultimately will be able to grow our casualty business in a very, very meaningful way.","So, I look at 2013 as if it will be a good year. There'll be a chance for us to deploy, certainly the capital that we have, maybe some additional opportunities. But I don't look at as if the world is going to change so much that we won't, especially in today's prices continue to be very keen on buying back the stock as well.","Dom Addesso","And I think that's, it\u2019s about balance. And we look at our capital management as a long-term issue. We certainly will be looking at the opportunities in the fourth quarter. But also as you point out, Greg, we'll soon be approaching 1\/1 and actually some of our underwriters are already into that.","So we'll begin to access what 1\/1 opportunities will be like in the next several weeks. And we do think there are opportunities to expand our presence, whether it would be in the U.S. or I mentioned some changes we've made in our management that will allow us to do some new and different things in Asia and Europe. And so there are some unique opportunities that we can pursue, but it will be a little bit of both.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Great. Thanks and congrats again.","Joe Taranto","Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go to Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","I want to ask some questions about the investment side of the story. There's been some movements as you mentioned that you don't think you're taking more basis risk. But it does suggest that from a rating agencies standpoint, there's a little bit more credit risk going on. And in terms of the balance of taking money out of equities, what is your market view for investment over the next 12 months, interest rates wise, marketwise what not?","Joe Taranto","No. I don't know, but we're all about trying to predict investment rates. We tried, as they try to portray and\/or mentioned in my comments, we want to maintain some balance. We think what we've achieved in our portfolio to-date with an average credit quality of AA, represents a good credit quality. Even in the spaces in the alternative fixed income space, our average credit quality there is just one notch below investment grade.","So it's overall still a high quality portfolio from a credit perspective. And as I've mentioned in previous calls, I tend to believe that corporate credits just as an overall market condition are generally underrated if you will. Corporates are well positioned with cash and in fact, one might postulate that they might be better credits than some of the sovereign exposures.","So it's not a risky bet. We're generally -- right now we are, as I said earlier, we've got investment and 75% of our portfolio is investment grade. We've got 13% of our portfolio in equities, including our limited partnerships. That's certainly within reason in terms of how the industry has invested over the long-term.","And our alternative fixed income portfolio is just slightly in excess of $2 billion, comprised of a mix of high yield, bank loans and emerging market debt. So it will maintain that relative position or at least our current thinking is that that's a reasonable allocation and how to think about our position going forward. That doesn't mean that next quarter, we won't modify that slightly.","But I'm not anticipating any major shifts at this point. And from a rating agency perspective and that also gets into the capital management discussion. We maintain a sufficient level of capital to carry this kind of an asset allocation. So it is all part of the entire balance sheet management.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","So, Dom, I'm not really trying to uncover. I was trying to understand, if we went back in time three months ago, you might have said the same thing about corporate versus sovereign. Is there anything different that happened in the past quarter, or merely you just had more cash deployed that cause the weight to move?","Dom Addesso","The weight actually hasn't moved all that much, Josh. It really hasn't. The only thing that we've seen is obviously, the movement in interest rates. Obviously adjusted the back of market value of those securities, so that maybe what you\u2019re referencing, I'm not sure.","But that's really the only market movement that I can comment on. We actually have seen obviously a high yield, for example, certainly a compression in rates there. And we actually think that any additional allocation in the high yield space is less likely than not just given the fact that where rates have come in the high yield sector.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Thank you.","Joe Taranto","The acquisition is something that's evolved over the last two or three years, no sudden changes in the last quarter.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","All right. And then on the derivative mark, on the equities, I'm surprised it was marked down this quarter. It\u2019s obvious because of very difficult calculations. Can you walk us through a little bit, this is a good quarter for equities, when did the market gone up or the interest rates overrode that, what exactly happened there?","Dom Addesso","It is a complicated formula that we have to follow to come up with the result. And yeah, you saw the stock market rise this quarter. So that you would suggest that it would have increased more than it did. But a big part of the calculation is interest rates which went down a bit. Now, interest rates in terms of settlements of these instruments ultimately don't come into play whatsoever.","So as far as we're concerned, the stock market going up is far more important. But nonetheless, there is a set formula that we\u2019ve been following for years, continue to follow and that's why you saw little change even though the stock market went up, because one offset the other.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you very much for the time.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll continue on to Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Thank you very much. Sorry about that. Just one question I guess. There was some movement. Second quarter looks like U.S. Reinsurance grew this quarter, but shrunk last quarter on a year-over-year basis, International, Reinsurance was down last quarter -- down this quarter, but grew last quarter.","Just trying to understand kind of, is there some strategy involved or some tactical reason for that, or is it just have to do with renewals and just kind of the movement of your book and then just one follow-up. Thanks","Dom Addesso","Yeah. Michael, this is Dom. ","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Hi, Dom.","Dom Addesso","There is a mixture of things going on. Let\u2019s take the International, which is comprised of Middle East, South Africa, Latin America and our Asian portfolio. Most of what we\u2019ve seen going on there is the shift from pro-rata to excess of loss. So that's what driving the results there.","And in the U.S. we see -- we have some adjustments in our subject premium base on certain clients, which give rise to increased estimates as well as some increased shares on certain clients. For the quarter, it's a little bit of an anomaly and that should smooth out into the fourth quarter. And then in Bermuda, it's a reflection of some weakening and some casualty opportunities and so lessening of our cash portfolio in that space.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Okay. Thanks. And then -- so I guess, I mean and maybe building on Greg's question a little bit from before. So you\u2019ve got little bit -- it sounds like a little bit more cat exposure this year than last, more excess of loss, a bit of a move in the investment portfolio.","Just trying to understand, what is the capital intensiveness of your book today versus a year ago? Is that -- have the changes subtle and maybe not and maybe less subtle? Have they had an impact on the capital that you need to hold in the business that maybe, we just can't see so well from our perspective?","Joe Taranto","The answer is no. You mentioned our cat book. Really in terms of the peak zones, it really has been no meaningful increases. We may have expanded in some of the non-peak zones. But when you get back to the capital that we need, especially since we\u2019re looking at more rate and tighter terms, I wouldn't tell you that we need anymore today than we needed a year or two ago, which kind of gets you back to the fact that especially with surplus building quite nicely, we have a substantial amount of excess capital.","Now, whether we can deploy that going forward into other opportunities, well we'll see what 1\/1 brings. We do have some ideas for 2013 and beyond. Right now, I would probably say that those ideas don't take up all the extra that we have and that's why it gets back to stock buyback, particularly at today's prices as a very, very attractive alternative. So we'll do both.","But it's not what that we need a great deal of extra capital today. I would say virtually none relative to a year or two ago. The investment side, yeah, there are some things that we've done that we think will produce and have produced better returned.","But frankly, I look at it, at least from a company management point of view is that, not putting all your rates into -- in corporate bonds and taking 20%, and putting it into other items is frankly making it less risky as you diversify your portfolio. Could be some additional charges in the rating agency models, but nothing significant and again, we get back to the fact that we have plenty of extra surplus at this point.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And I guess building on that, I mean, with yields where they are I mean another option certainly is to take advantage of that on the debt side your leverage is lower. Is that a lever that at some point if your capital builds this way, or even if not, is that a lever that you're interested in pulling or is there a reason why you want to maintain just a bit lower financial leverage?","Joe Taranto","I'll take that one and as it was mentioned in the past relative to that question, it\u2019s -- we view this as really an arbitrage issue and it's a negative arbitrage. We\u2019ve raised additional debt, where would we invest it. It would be dilutive to earnings.","We're already dealing with an excess capital position, so adding debt doesn't help that. It doesn't mean that we like having that we wouldn't in the future and that's always for discussion. But we like the flexibility of where we're at. And we don't have any immediate plans on that front.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then just last one quick one. I didn't understand Heartland the acquisition was accomplished, completed a while ago. The lift in gross premiums this quarter, I was just trying to understand just kind of the reason for that, did it have something to do with reinsurance or some other legacy relationship associated with that acquisition? And thank you for all your answers.","Craig Howie","Mike, this is Craig. Basically what happened with the Heartland premium was you may recall in 2011 that premium was treated as reinsurance premium and that was earned in evenly throughout the year. So, in 2012, when it moved over to the insurance segment, it's now the gross written premium, is now premium before sessions to the government or third party reinsurers and now that premiums earned in on a seasonal basis. So, that's really the difference in the gross premium.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","I see.","Craig Howie","If you look at the net premium for that business, it's relatively flat year-over-year.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","That makes perfect sense. Great. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners","Hi. Congratulations on a very strong quarter. The first question is on the margins this quarter, they were very strong. The accident year loss ratio ex-cats some was about 54.1 of the exclude the crop. Did this quarter benefit from abnormally low sort of non-cat weather?","Joe Taranto","Absolutely Vinay. I mean its and the shift again from a movement from pro rata to excess of loss contracts is what's driving that.","Dom Addesso","Vinay, I take your question to be if you take catastrophe is out, whether everything was so good beyond that, that there was just a benefit to property beyond losses\u2026","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners","Yes. Yes.","Dom Addesso","The small losses were unusual. I don't think that's the case, no.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners","Okay. So, these quarters, I mean a true pro forma number that you had for the quarter.","Joe Taranto","Yes. That's the way we look at it, yes.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners","Okay. That's interesting. And in terms of cats, what sort of cat loads should we be looking at normally for this business?","Joe Taranto","We generally have given guidance that our cat losses at least for this -- for the past year or two have been around 9 points.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners","Right. Great. And do you think that to move the excess of loss would mean that it would be slightly higher now than the past?","Joe Taranto","Not, not. No. Not that in and itself would not drive that number.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners","Okay. All right. And the last question is on margins actually for next year. You had rate increases for workers compensation come through, the transition to excess of loss, which has helped to your margins. So, as you go into next year and there'll probably be some pricing pressure on prop cat excess of loss. How do you see margins next year versus this year?","Joe Taranto","I'll start. I mean on the cat side, I kind of said, I -- there is some leveling that's taking place and I do think you'll see that into 2013. I don't know if there is so much pressure that you will see rates come down in any sort of meaningful way. I am not anticipating that.","Again, I think when you get back to our position with A plus paper and the security and the clients that we have around the world, I kind to look at our portfolio at least in terms of rate quality on the cat side it will be about the same as it has today. We are hoping on the casualty side and for other pockets that there is continued improvement. You mentioned California comp, where we continue to get rate increases. But our GL business we continue to get rate increases.","Some pockets of the casualty we're not getting as much as we would like. But we are hopeful that again some pockets of the casualty continue to do well into 2013. So again, just forecasting a year out, I'm not thinking that margins will be a whole lot different than they are today when you put it all together.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question from Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Thank you. I wanted to touch base on prior year reserve development. It's been notably absent for the past three years and I'd like to better understand, how your reserving process is somewhat different from what we\u2019re seeing from other companies in the rest of the industry that have been releasing a lot of reserves?","Dom Addesso","Jay, its Dom. I really can't speak to how other companies reserve. But obviously, the mission and the objective is to have an adequate reserve position, not to be deficient or redundant. Of course, the reserve estimation process is difficult as you know. And I do think we've done a great job historically. I mean the reserve charges that Everest had prior to three years ago were really one-time unusual events and I think it points to the fact that our core reserves development has been frankly, favorable over time.","And so I don't know if it's much different than many other folks. We attempt to reserve conservatively and what goes into that is an attempt to pick the current year ex your loss pick is so very important to that. As I've de scribed many times on calls, we have a multi-pronged process for going through that, which involves the prior year loss reserve review and baking on top of that loss trend.","And as well as taking note of any rate increases or decreases that are going on in the marketplace. And we think that has given us the opportunity to have an appropriate and adequate loss reserve position. And I think that's demonstrated itself as you point out over the last couple of years and frankly even prior to that, but certainly for sure over the last three years.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","And then on a separate topic, the U.S. insurance underlying combined ratio excluding cats and prior development ticked up again in 3Q now running in about 101 and that excludes the impact of crop as well. What would it take to get that back well into profitable underwriting territory?","Dom Addesso","Well, as I pointed out it was running at a 99.2 for the quarter ex those items. And so it's trending in that direction. And so as I pointed out in my comments earlier increased growth in our NH portfolio, continued double-digit increases in work comp, you are seeing rate increases on casualty and continued deployment of our professional lines which is also tracking nicely. So, all of our core portfolios are moving in the right direction and that so it is trending towards that currently.","Joe Taranto","And of course crop has become a big part of that book. So clearly, we're hopeful for a very good year in 2013 as opposed to what we've had this year.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Right. And on a normalized basis, the net to gross premium percentage in U.S. insurance, it looks like it was mainly influenced by the crop result in 3Q. What's the normalized result going forward since it's been kind in that 80 to 85 range in the first half?","Craig Howie","That's about right. But you have to realize that historically that number has moved around a bit in the insurance operation, because of some of our program business that was a much bigger influence in the portfolio a couple years ago. So, if you're looking at it historically, you've to recognize some of those differences in the portfolio.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Right. Fourth quarter a year ago, net to gross of 77%, is that a seasonal issue or is that should we expect it to be more in the 80s going forward?","Craig Howie","I don't know, but I can answer that precisely for you right now, Jay. It\u2019s call 80.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Matt Heimermann with J.P. Morgan.","Matt Heimermann - J.P. Morgan","Hi. Good morning, everybody. The first question I have is just with the remixing of the portfolio from (inaudible). Can you give us a sense of where you think we are in that process both respect to the U.S. and international?","Joe Taranto","Well, I'll put it in terms of cat premium, okay. We've -- as I mentioned again in my comments. We had $1 billion of cat premium through the nine months and 75% of that was XOL. And that's I would think we're probably about where we're going to be in that regard into next year.","Matt Heimermann - J.P. Morgan","Okay. So, no further shifts one-one even on the international side then?","Joe Taranto","No. And that could change modestly from year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter depending on what opportunities we see. I mean don't get me wrong, we're not necessarily opposed to a pro rata business, but it has to be at the right terms and conditions.","Matt Heimermann - J.P. Morgan","And then how about like just qualitatively on some of the other property exposed lines, things like marine or energy or aviation has that bias kind of spilled over into those lines too or that\u2019s you're not seeing any noticeable trends one way or another.","Joe Taranto","We're not huge market participants in those lines of business. Yes, we do have marine and aviation business. But we've been relatively conservative given rates and experience frankly in the marine and energy space.","Matt Heimermann - J.P. Morgan","Okay. And then just with respect to I guess Joe or Dom when you think about I guess how would you -- if casualty does get better how would you think about how the demand for might kind of play out from the ceiling perspective. There's obviously quota share that you do on companies XOL portfolios for them to manage, they are not which I would assume would pass through.","But more from kind of historical surplus relief just capacity to expand, do you foresee a lot of that? I just ask because it doesn't -- from a balance perspective the industry nobody seems to be starving for capital at least as a generalization.","Joe Taranto","I think that's a good point. And I will agree with that and as casualty improved dramatically to the point where most of the world thought it was doing quite well. I would imagine at least some of the bigger companies might not be looking for more quota share reinsurance, maybe some more XOL. Some of the smaller companies might be looking for more reinsurance as their capital might get tested. So we might see some more opportunities that way.","But I think a lot of the opportunities might be on the insurance side. We've been talking about things like California comp where there was a time a few years back when we wrote four times what we're writing today. And we'd love to have the opportunity to do that again. But we don't think the market is positioned for that right now. But so I think a lot of the areas on the casualty side if they improved dramatically where we could do more. I think it would be as important for our insurance operation as it would be for our reinsurance operation.","Dom Addesso","Well, also Matt, we're not totally dependent upon a market expansion, if you will for us to expand our casualty writings. In the U.S. for example, it certainly leverage our property opportunities and where we write a meaningful portion of property business for students into a casualty opportunity. Especially, if they want to improve the credit quality of their panel of reinsurer, so those are where the opportunities might lie.","Europe, might be some opportunities portion side in casualty as companies are having difficulty with their capital positions. But it doesn't necessarily require terrific expansion of demand, if you will from a market perspective for us to increase our casualty.","Matt Heimermann - J.P. Morgan","That sounds a little bit more like -- I mean that seems very company specific though in terms of kind of -- I will put it another way. It sounds like your outlook for your own prospects is probably different answer than you might gave for the industry overall, when demand and opportunities for say.","Joe Taranto","Perhaps, yes.","Matt Heimermann - J.P. Morgan","Okay.","Joe Taranto","Yes.","Matt Heimermann - J.P. Morgan","All right. That's helpful. That was it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Amit Kumar with Macquarie Capital.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital","Hi. Thanks and good morning. I guess just two quick follow-up questions to the prior questions. First of all just under discussion on capital management. I'm somewhat curious what is your view on possible special dividend, since you're approaching the fiscal cliff?","Joe Taranto","Well, up until now we certainly have preferred stock buyback over increasing the dividend or special dividend. Now, we're focused on what's going on. And if indeed we start to believe that the taxes on tax treatment of dividends will change dramatically then clearly I think we'd have more conversations amongst ourselves with our board as to whether or not special dividend might make more sense as a way to give back to shareholders. So, our eyes on what's going on and again if we see that as be in the case then we'll talk quite a bit about it.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital","Got it. That's actually quite helpful. The only other question I had is I think in the opening remarks you mentioned about an impending reserve study. And I was curious, does that -- I'm sure you look at the best of reserves to in other areas. Do you have sort of an early view on that or is it I guess too early?","Joe Taranto","Well, in terms of the study, this is the study that we do every year-end. And we do a study every quarter but most companies like ours tend to do a more comprehensive study if you will at the end of the year. No, I wouldn't say that we have anything to report to you unusual at this stage, but really those studies will be taking place between now and the close of the year.","Dom Addesso","And we have other metrics that we follow during the year, before we actually have reserve studies on some of our major lines. And we do reserve studies on the smaller lines throughout the year and they have all been favorable. But we also have other metrics we look at and those again are all pointing to no surprises.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital","No surprises. Okay. That's what I was looking for. Thanks for all the answers and congrats on a quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that's all the time we have for questions today. I'll turn things back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Beth Farrell","I'd like to thank everybody for participating on the call. And if you have any questions, please feel free to call. Thank you.","Joe Taranto","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Elizabeth B. Farrell","Thank you, Tim. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group\u2019s first quarter and 2013 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Joe Taranto, the company\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dom Addesso, our President; and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today\u2019s call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations, and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations.","Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements.","Now, let me turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph V. Taranto","Thanks, Beth, good morning. In the first quarter we have 13% growth in premium, 25% growth in operating earnings, and an annualized net income return on equity of 25%. I\u2019m extremely pleased with our underwriting portfolio was positioned and our investment portfolio was positioned. We are finding growth opportunities in both our reinsurance and insurance operations, and I expect strong top line growth to continue this year. Dom will provide more detail on this shortly.","During the quarter we repurchased $239 million of our shares. After the quarter, we repurchased another $11 million of our shares for a grand total of $250 million. Even though we bought back a quarter of $1 billion worth of stock and paid $24 million in dividends, our earnings powered an increase in shareholders equity from $6.7 billion to $6.8 billion. Recently, we notified noteholders of our 6.2% junior subordinated debt securities that we will be calling the bonds.","Accordingly, we expect to redeem $320 million of debt in late May. We are presently investing new money, it\u2019s slightly over 2% in corporate bonds. So we expect to have roughly a 4% benefit of these funds on an annualized basis going forward. That means we expect to increase pre-tax earnings by approximately $13 million annualized going forward from June.","Craig will later provide additional detail on this transaction. Repurchasing a quarter of a billion dollars of stock and redeeming $320 million of our bonds underscores the strength of our company and our confidence in our future."," Frankly, we\u2019ve never been stronger and we\u2019ve never been better positioned. I am very proud that Everest has increased shareholder value for over 17 years at a compounded rate of 13%. I am pleased that we beat our historical average last year including shareholder value at 18%, and I am pleased that we beat our historical average again in the first quarter of this year as we grew shareholder value at an annualized rate of 18%. We continue to see opportunities and are very excited about our future prospects. Dom?","Dominic J. Addesso","Thanks, Joe, and good morning. The first quarter reflects \u2013 results reflect an improving market in certain areas, lack of any major tax, and most importantly, a number of initiatives, which are beginning to yield benefits. Starting with reinsurance, the quarter produced a $210 million underwriting gain or 76.4% combined ration. Each of our major segments within reinsurance experienced combined ratios less than 80%. The quarterly trend in the attritional combined ratios has been improving as a result of the shift from pro rata to excess.","This has not only had a dramatic impact on the loss ratio, but also the expense ratio. In addition, we have capitalized on favorable market condition in certain regions and introduced new product offerings in both existing and new classes of business, which have increased our writings and resulted in greater diversification both in product and geography. These factors were most evident in the U.S. Reinsurance segment, where premium growth was close to 18%.","In addition to new business opportunities, this segment benefited from rate increases on existing business with noted improvements in the casualty classes as well as those accounts that were affected by Sandy losses.","In the International and Bermuda segments, growth in total premiums were slightly in excess of 6%. Here, we also experienced some new business growth, which accounts for most of the increase. Rate activity varied depending on class and geography, which overall can be characterized as flattish in terms of its impact.","Looking forward into the second quarter for all reinsurance segments, we expect casualty rates to continue to improve. This favorable trend in overall casualty rates is also a positive for our insurance operations as I will discuss shortly. Rate increases were also a factor for the marine book, which has grown in excess of 8% for the quarter, due to both rate and new business. Property continues to be mixed depending on geography. The loss affected accounts in the northeast U.S. have seen increases, while Asia and Europe have been relatively flat.","Nevertheless, we continue to deploy new capacity in product and layers, which provide returns in excess of our hurdle rates. Our portfolio continues to be well positioned. Actions taken over the last few quarters have resulted in a well balanced and diversified book, which has steadily improved the profitability. This diversification also means that the portfolio is better positioned to absorb cat events.","Turning to the Insurance segment also reveals an improved result with a combined ratio below 100%. However, this include a 136% combined ratio in the crop insurance book, which was due to the seasonality of the premium in that business and the impact on the expense ratio as well as adverse development from last year\u2019s draught conditions.","When looking at the Insurance segment without the crop business, it results in a 96% combined ratio. This highlights the underlying improvement expected as a result of continued double-digit rate increases and workers comp and general casualty in addition to the elimination of certain program businesses.","These rate increases along with growth particularly in the specialty classes as a result of the new initiatives referenced last quarter should continue to move the insurance operations forward in a positive direction.","In addition, the previously announced transition regarding our non-standard auto business will allow that business to grow with an improving margins. Primary medical stop loss product continues to yield over 12 points of margin and our U.S. professional liability book is at nine points of underwriting profit.","In both cases pricing is generally flat, so near-term growth is expected to be purposefully slow. Primary property rates continue to show a sign of firming, so selective growth is expected.","Finally, as we move into the remainder of the year, the crop writing will emerge. We had a successful renewal season as new territories were opened which will result in growth, in gross premiums year-over-year.","In addition, the net account will become much more significant to the segment with the elimination of reported share in force last year.","The combination of crop, A&H,, DIC, specialty casualty and property, professional liability, non-standard auto, and California workers\u2019 comp, all with continuing or improving fundamentals to translate into a positive trend for the combined ratio below the previously mentioned 96%","I\u2019ll conclude by touching on investment income, the other major component of our operating results. For the quarter, investment income was as anticipated down over the prior year. While this was due to lower reinvestment rates, it was better than forecast due to the strategies deployed over the last several quarters. Diversification is the high yield bond and dividend paying stocks has helped to stall the decline.","In addition, our limited partnerships continue to perform well. The increased allocation to equities has also been a benefit to net income this quarter as realized capital gains were $127 million.","These investments and underwriting strategies that have been emerging over the last several quarters produce record earnings for the quarter. The headwinds of investment rates or reinsurance or insurance rates or whatever else the markets can throw at us always be a factor in varying degrees in a different times.","Nevertheless, the acquisition to our resources and our portfolio to be able to respond effectively to the challenges and to take full advantage of the opportunities that the markets present to us. These are the benefits of a well diversified in global platform.","Thank you. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over Craig for further detail on the financials.","Craig W. Howie","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report that Everest had a record quarter of earnings with after-tax operating income of $301.1 million, or $5.88 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2013. This is a 25% increase over after-tax operating income of $239.9 million, or $4.48 per share for the first quarter of 2012.","Net income for the first quarter was $384.3 million or $7.50 per diluted share, compared to $304.7 million or $5.68 per share in 2012. Net income includes realized capital gains and represents an annualized return on equity of 25%. These results were driven by $100 million increase in the underwriting result, offset by higher income taxes and slightly lower net investment income compared to the first quarter of 2012.","The results reflect the continued improvement in the overall current year attritional combined ratio, which has declined more than 5 points from 86.4% to 80.7%. This measure excludes the impact of catastrophes, reinstatement premiums, and prior period loss development. The total reinsurance attritional combined ratio was 76.8% compared to 83.2% in the prior year. The Insurance segment attritional combined ratio was 98.5% compared to 101.2% in the prior year.","However, eliminating the effects of the primary crop book, this ratio would have been 95.9% compared to 98.2% in the prior year. All segments reported underwriting gains for the quarter and all segments reported improved underwriting results compared to last year.","Total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $210 million for the quarter, compared to $112 million underwriting gain last year. The first quarter of 2012 was impacted by $30 million of catastrophe losses.","The Insurance segment reported an underwriting gain of $193,000 for the quarter, compared to an underwriting loss of $2 million last year. These results reflect a crop loss of $7 million for the quarter primarily due to the seasonality of crop premiums, but also including a $3 million true up from the 2012 crop year.","The overall underwriting gain for the Group was $210 million for the quarter, compared to an underwriting gain of $110 million in the same period last year. Our reported combined ratio was 80.7% for the quarter, compared to 89.0% in 2012.","The commission ratio of 21.4% for the quarter is down 2.4 points compared to the prior year. This lower ratio reflects the shift in reinsurance from pro rata to excess of loss contracts which generally carry a lower commission. It also reflects the shift away from program business to direct business in the Insurance segment.","Our low expense ratio of 4.9% continues to be a major competitive advantage. Our recent industry analysis showed that we had the lowest overhead expense ratio in the industry for 2012, a full 2 point advantage.","On reserves, our overall quarterly internal reserving metrics continue to be favorable. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $146 million for the quarter are now are $16.6 billion investment portfolio. Investment income declined $7 million from one year ago. This decrease was primarily driven by declining reinvestment rates, partially offset by higher limited partnership income for the quarter.","Despite the decline in rates, our investment portfolio continues to perform well. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.7% with a duration of just over three years. The quarter reflected $83 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $65 million last year. These gains are mainly attributable to fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio.","On income taxes, the 12.3% effective tax rate on operating income is in line with our expected rate for the year. Also, recall the 2012 income tax expense benefited from favorable one-time adjustments.","Strong cash flow continues, with operating cash flows of $226 million for the quarter compared to $166 million in 2012. This is despite the high-level of catastrophe loss payments over the last two years.","Turning to capital management; as Joe mentioned, we have decided to call our 6.2% junior subordinated debt that was due in 2034. The noteholders have been notified and the redemption will occur on May 24. This will save about $20 million of annualized interest expense and we will use cash that would have been invested at about 2%, and net savings of about 4% will increase annualized earnings by approximately $13 million beginning in June.","Shareholders equity increased to $6.8 billion this year, up $83 million from $6.7 billion at year end 2012. This is after taking into account capital returned for $239 million of stock repurchases and the $24 million of dividends paid in the first quarter of 2013.","Book value per share increased 4% to $136.43 from $130.96 at year end 2012. Our strong capital position leaves us with the capacity to maximize our business opportunities, as well as continued share repurchases. Thank you.","And now I\u2019ll turn it back to Beth for Q&A.","Elizabeth B. Farrell","Tim, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from Amit Kumar with Macquarie Capital.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","Thanks and good morning and congrats on a strong quarter. I guess two or three questions; my first question relates to the upcoming renewals. We\u2019ve heard a lot about the third-party capital entering this marketplace and some other companies have alluded to a tough renewal at 71. I was curious, what\u2019s your thoughts are on that, I guess in conjunction with Mt. Logan Re? Thanks.","Craig W. Howie","Let me start with at least the [6\/1s] that are coming up, which I guess are more the Florida renewals.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","Yeah.","Craig W. Howie","First of all, looking to the Florida market, and I do expect more demand but as you noted, there probably will be more supply as well. I won\u2019t predict how that collectively moves the entire market, but overall, I still expect it to be quite a good market. I anticipate, we will have a very good June 1 renewal and we will be renewing business in healthy rates.","We concluded a few deals so far for the 6\/1 season and we\u2019re reasonably far along on a few others and what we\u2019ve put to bed so far is at similar rates to last year. On top of that underlying homeowner rates continue to improve, which will make quota share opportunities healthier and commercial property rates continue to improve making for better environment for our insurance operation, our property insurance operation in Florida and have facultative reinsurance operation. I expect XOL reinsurance to be well rated as well.","Going beyond that to 7\/1, again, it gets even a little fussier if you get into some of the international renewals. What we saw recently in April in Japan is that was a relatively flattish renewal, so we\u2019ll see what happens when we get to July and beyond. But I don\u2019t expect the world to change all that dramatically for cat business for provisional reinsurers.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","Got it. The other question I had was on crop. Do you have the percentage breakdown of your crop book, I think in terms of what percent is corn, what percent is soybean, and what percent is winter wheat? That would be very helpful","","Craig W. Howie","Our portfolio was about 40% corn, 25% wheat, 17% soy and then remaining mixture between cotton and another grains and beans. Now the most of the wheat is fall crop, if that helps.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","Yeah, and I guess final question related to that, the corn planting is meaningfully behind, I guess, the long-term trend and it seems that the window is closing very quickly. I was curious if you had any thoughts on the corn planting and how that would play into the results going forward? Thanks.","Dominic J. Addesso","Well, I think last year my recollection was that the, was really a relatively early planting season and I think this year\u2019s planting is along the expected calendar. So I am not sure of that we view at the same way as what you might be suggesting. Certainly, farmers need to get their crops on the ground before the middle of May and we still think that, there is plenty of opportunity to do that. There has been some floodings in certain areas of the Midwest that might delay some of the plantings, but much of the flooding does not affect farm lands and then to the extent that those areas that we designated as flood prone, we have the ability and have actually exceeded those risks through the assigned risk pool.","Craig W. Howie","Yeah, let me add to that. Really and it\u2019s early days for the crop business, but at this point, we have no reason to expect anything other than a normal season. Time will tell, but we have no indication otherwise at this point.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","I was just looking at a USDA report, which shows that if you look at Illinois or Indiana, I mean, if planting was 50% last year, right now is at 1%. And so you are saying that it should still be fine even though the numbers telling another story, okay. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks for all the answers.","Joseph V. Taranto","Thank you.","Operator","","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.","","Thank you. Just one question on the \u2013 our investment portfolio. So are you pulling down duration kind of in an anticipation of the potential rise in interest or potential rise in interest rates or is that something that you are not really kind of positioning for at this point?","Dominic J. Addesso","We, as I made some reference to, the investment strategies really began with us several quarters, and we pulled down duration dramatically over the last several quarters. What we\u2019ve done more recently has been relatively stable. Our duration is under 3 right now, and that hasn\u2019t moved much last couple of quarters. So we\u2019ve been stable in that regard. But we\u2019ve done a lot of work in terms of moving that to where it is today over the last several quarters, which began as I mentioned a few quarters ago.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.","","So I mean, I just\u2026","Joseph V. Taranto","Some of the thinking is to be protected in the event there is a big rise in the interest rates.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.","Okay. I guess, the question I would have is along those lines, and you mentioned calling some debt, I mean, you\u2019ve got relatively high interest debt, I mean, you\u2019ve got obviously low interest rates, I mean, what is the \u2013 how do you reconcile the decision to call those bonds instead of kind of replacing the leverage that you, very low leverage that you currently have?","Craig W. Howie","Michael, this is Craig, and there were many options that we evaluated when we went through this process and frankly all the options were good options for us. This was the most accretive to our earnings and especially since it\u2019s a risk free return to us, our capital position is strong enough to absorb this transaction where we didn\u2019t have to replace it with other debt. And it really should have no impact on our share repurchases for the year.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.","Right. So the savings from, just want to make sure I understand, so calling the 6.2% debt would be more accretive to per share earnings than reissuing and repurchasing $300 million stock.","Craig W. Howie","","That\u2019s correct.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.","Okay, and then one question I had on the insurance, Craig, I feel I like I\u2019m kind of going back, it seems like it\u2019s a book that has been in some transition whether it\u2019s the crop book, the quota share program, program book, the re-rating on the comp side. How should we think about this? I mean, I still kind of, I look at it, I am not really sure the crop versus the non- crop, how big is it. What\u2019s the impact of this quota share program and how should we think about this books going forward? I mean, I appreciate the commentary about the combined ratio drifting downward, but I just \u2013 I don\u2019t have a good feel for what\u2019s in there and whether or not there are more potential changes to come other than opportunistic moves on the margin, is this book, is the corpus now mostly in place?","Craig W. Howie","Well, there are lots of moving pieces and you\u2019ve got in excess of \u2013 will be in excess of $200 million of premium in crop for the year. Likewise, we\u2019ll have well in excess of $200 million for the California comp, our primary medical stop-loss business is just under $100 million. We\u2019ve got the non-standard auto business, it was at $30 million, expected to grow to $80 million and from there.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Dominic J. Addesso","So it\u2019s pieces of that, our elements that we expect to grow, we\u2019ve got an excess cash in the facility, we\u2019ve got an environmental facility. We just formed this specialty insurance group which I\u2019ve mentioned in previous, I think in the last quarter to focus on some unique classes of business and niche business. By the same token the program business is coming down, moving more to a direct broker model and all of those things are having the positive impact on our business. Also, our California DIC business has performed nicely and we have a property E& operation that could experience some growth in and strengthening property insurance market in particular.","Joseph V. Taranto","Adding a little bit more to that, I mean the crop business will probably be roughly speaking, 25% of our business. And as I said we\u2019re expecting a normal year, normal year means a very reasonable profit. Workers\u2019 comp is probably another 25% of our business and rates continue to go up there quite nicely. Frankly, in the course of the last four years, we\u2019ve achieved compounded 60% of rate. So if you put those two together, which are trending nicely, and you are up to a half of the book.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.","","Right.","Joseph V. Taranto","","After that as Dom noted, professional liability making a portion, which is running very well, medical staff loss making a portion, which is running very well. the non-standard auto portion, D&O and property rates are going up and that\u2019s a portion. So, you can kind of, that helps quantify for you, but everything is moving in the right direction. and frankly, if you take out the blip from crop in this quarter, it\u2019s 96 when you put it all together even this quarter. So \u2026","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.","All right.","Joseph V. Taranto","That\u2019s what we feel good about it.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.","Got it. And so, you\u2019ve got about 2.5 point of underlying combined ratio improvement ex crop in the segment year-over-year? So as we kind of look is you\u2019ve got crop, which is anomalistic from rate environment, you\u2019ve got workers comp where it sounds like you\u2019re saying that rate is running at a healthy clip ahead a loss trend. And then, if we\u2019re look at the other 50% of book, how should we think about the migration there in terms of where your \u2013 is there an amalgamated rate versus loss trend where you are aiming or targeting for that we can kind of think about as that book moves ahead? And thank you for all your answers.","Craig W. Howie","Well, let me talk about the other 50%.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Joseph V. Taranto","I already, I think I mentioned in my opening comments, the margins that we\u2019re experiencing in our medical staff loss book of business and professional liability book. We\u2019re obviously pleased with those margins, but as I said, rates appear to be flattish in that environment. So we\u2019re not expecting huge amounts of growth, but we\u2019re certainly \u2013 those two classes of business if you will are easily meeting our hurdle rates. As the casualty rates for us are going up double-digit and certainly, we would expect that trend to continue above, certainly above loss trend. And so we expect to see growth casualty space in the primary market.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.","Great, Thank you so much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great. Thanks, guys, and awesome quarter. I wanted to just follow-up on your commentary that mid-year or at least the last couple of deals were sort of renewing flat year-over-year. Can you be more specific in terms of what type of business is this, what layers, is this Florida, is it not Florida. Can you help us think about, because that\u2019s actually a lot better than what I was thinking?","Dominic J. Addesso","What Joe was referencing in that comment was the 6.1s that we\u2019ve already put to bed or about to put to bed in Florida.","Joseph V. Taranto","Yeah, we put to bed probably close to half of the premium that we\u2019ve done on XOL business that we did last year, we put that to bed this year and pretty flat rate versus rate. So there is more to come and this will take a couple of months, but that\u2019s what we\u2019ve experienced so far.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, great. And maybe same topic just on the mid-years and specifically Florida, what are you seeing on the unit side, it seems like there is some favorable trends from a de-pop perspective that there might be materializing. Could you help us think about some of those?","Dominic J. Addesso","","Well, there are Greg, I mean, I think that\u2019s one I was saying I expect demands to go up, because you are right since it\u2019s de-popping and that seems to be going to some of the smaller companies more thinly capitalized that are more in need of a traditional reinsurance. So that\u2019s why I kind of said demand is on the rise. But at the same time, I do believe there is some supply on the rise in the sense that reinsurers like ourselves, surplus is building and there is some alternate capital coming in. So I wasn\u2019t going to get into predicting when you put all that together what it means in terms of rate for the industry, but I really already know that we\u2019re going to have a \u2013 we\u2019re going to have a good June first. I mean, I know enough information to see that will be the case.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Okay. Great. So demand is up, and then pricing is flat or maybe jumping back to my last question.","Dominic J. Addesso","","Well, what we\u2019ve done so far is flat. More to come.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, and again, the flat you\u2019re mentioning is price that\u2019s not just premiums that are flat?","Dominic J. Addesso","No, rate relative to exposure, now\u2026","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Perfect. Perfect.","Dominic J. Addesso","I am talking about the XOL business on that, meanwhile, underlying insurance rates, at least homeowner rates continue to go up, and that makes that business healthier. And remember we participated in some quota share as well, and so that business is getting better that we participate via quota share and commercial property rates continue to go up and we do have a commercial property insurance book in Florida, so that\u2019s getting better and facultative book, which does some commercial business in Florida is now going to be dealing with insurers that have gotten better rate on their business. So there are various things going on, but when it all shapes out, at least, for us, I expect it to be quite good at June.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, that is great color, thanks. And then just jumping topics, on the buyback front, again, excellent quarter on that. You bought back half the \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, 4% of the company. So that\u2019s an excellent number. What I am sort of scratching my head on though is why don\u2019t you do more, the buyback\u2026","Unidentified Company Representative","These are billion or two nice quarter [Multiple Speakers]","Joseph V. Taranto","Keep in mind, we not only this quarter are effectively doing the buyback, we are also redeeming $320 million bond. But I think what all of that says as we\u2019re feeling very strong in terms of the portfolio, the current earnings, the future earnings. And frankly, we\u2019re also feeling it, agreeing with you that it\u2019s a good time for us to be buying and to be buying in a very significant way. We look at $0.25 billion as if it was the significant in the first quarter, Greg? I don\u2019t know how many others are going to be buying back 4% of their stock in this quarter.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yeah, no, I actually \u2013 what\u2019s amazing is you actually earned even more, right? I mean, the payout ratio is still, so, yeah it\u2019s great. So hopefully, we can do 4% every quarter for a while to come. Again, great start to the year. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.","Dominic J. Addesso","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.","","Hi, good morning. The first question is on Florida, again. So I hate to beat a dead horse, but just curious as to why your experience is different from sort of what the brokers are seeing on the Florida market?","Dominic J. Addesso","Well, I have to say to begin with, what the many of the brokers are predicting, we\u2019ll see what happens, because they are predicting deals that are our future deals. But there was some uniqueness to the deals that we\u2019ve done so far as to why we had some competitive advantages as to we were able to certainly maintain rates. But I would go beyond that for the deals that we will be seeing. We have no interest if there is some meaningful decline in rates, in participating in those portions of the business where there are meaningful declines.","As I noted, there is pockets of the business were rates are getting better, starting with the primary insurance rates that are helpful with regard to quota shares. So we have a lot of options in terms of how we put down our aggregate in the market. We can put it on quota shares, we can put it on XOL, we can put it on facultative reinsurance, we can put it on commercial insurance and we\u2019re going to go at it the best way whereas the healthiest rate and it makes most sense for us to put down.","So I\u2019m telling what our situation has been so far and I also tell you I think we have some very good options that will take us into 6\/1 that will give us a good portfolio at the end of that. Perhaps when you do put the market at the end of June all together given what the broker said, you may see some decline that remains to be seen, but I\u2019m very happy with our situation.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Second point is on the lower commission expense ratio that was certainly a positive this quarter, how much of the transition from for \u2013 to XOL and the program business, the normal business have you done. So in other words, should we see this same level of expense ratio continuing for the next couple of quarters?","Dominic J. Addesso","Now I wouldn\u2019t expect it to trend this way. I think what you\u2019ve seen here is as a decline over time and this was fairly large impact here in the first quarter, but due to a number of reasons, as I mentioned, it\u2019s both on the reinsurance side from the shipment business. But also on the insurance side, because we\u2019ve moved to more direct rating in set of program business, so what you\u2019re seeing is that benefit coming through. I would expect this to be closer to a normal run rate than we continue on track.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then the last point was on the buyback. this quarter, you bought back about 90% of earnings, so is that fairly a good run rate, sort of excluding the hurricane season that we should be thinking about, and you\u2019ve mentioned before that the debt repurchase will not impact the buyback, correct?","Joseph V. Taranto","That\u2019s correct. we look at that as capital; we didn\u2019t look at that capital before we did, and so it doesn\u2019t affect our mentality for buying going forward. Well, we had never given guidance on what we will buyback going forward. And we won\u2019t at this stage. so I\u2019m not going to give you some formula relative to earnings or anything else. But let us say that it\u2019s clear and what we did in the first quarter that we think it is a very good way to improve results for shareholders going forward for us to continue to buyback a substantial amount of our stock.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.","Sure, fair enough. And just to clarify the top line growth this year has not add anymore capital requirements, correct?","Dominic J. Addesso","It\u2019s correct.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.","Okay, that\u2019s it. Thank you.","Operator","We have time for one more question. We will take our last question from Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian R. Meredith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks, good morning. Dom, just we talked a little bit of about the casualty reinsurance market and particularly, can you tell me you talked about how you\u2019re seeing some rate in casualty. I assume you are talking more on the subject premium base rather than actually reinsurance and what are you seeing with terms and conditions on some of the casualty reinsurance and demand in that marketplace as well.","Dominic J. Addesso","The most of the increase, yes, it\u2019s coming from the subject base. As primary rates, of course, are going up that\u2019s having a positive impact on the subject base. That\u2019s not to say that we don\u2019t have some relationships or contract transactions where the reinsurance rate might be changing as well. So you could be getting it in both spots, but that\u2019s very, very deal-specific. But clearly, the underlying primary trend is what\u2019s driving the casualty market.","I have to say that there is not really any overall dramatic change in terms and conditions relative to casualty deals. And relative to demand, I think demand again, other than the increasing subject base, we\u2019re not necessarily seeing sessions from customers in this space going up dramatically.","So it\u2019s all basically, any growth there is basically being driven by rate, and some new business opportunities. We\u2019re able to grow the portfolio, now that we see margins improving there to entertain plenty of new business opportunities being able to leverage. The relationships that we already have and I don\u2019t mean that in a negative way, but we\u2019re able to expand our casualty relationships, and we\u2019ll be providing property capacity to clients, we see the market improving. we have a much bigger appetite for entertaining casualty business.","Brian R. Meredith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Great, thanks. And then just quickly, could you tell us about what you think the impact of alternative capacity was going to be on midyear renewals, kind of what\u2019s your thought maybe even longer-term and how that potentially could impact traditional market?","Dominic J. Addesso","Well, I mean it\u2019s hard to say, I mean it\u2019s certainly the talk is that it\u2019s having a dampening impact on rate levels. But by the same token, particularly in Florida, we\u2019re seeing citizens continue to depopulate new markets emerging, which will increase demand, property values will continue to go up, which will increase demand, and there is growth in the emerging economies, which allows us to spread our aggregate across the globe and not be so focused on one particular region or part of the world. And of course, we\u2019ll look to potentially participate in some of that through the facility that we\u2019re crafting.","Dominic J. Addesso","I would answer that, that some of these alternative capital providers can\u2019t really offer the same products that we offer where we can kind of tailor our products to the client\u2019s needs. And also, we have relationships with many of our partners, business relationships that go back for many, many years; underwriting facilities around the world. So we have some competitive advantages over these \u2013 over this new capital if you will. But it\u2019s a little bit complex in terms of how this is going to affect everything and further you look at, we\u2019ll see.","Brian R. Meredith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","And that concludes our Q&A session. I\u2019ll turn it back over to our speakers for any closing remarks.","Dominic J. Addesso","I just want to thank everybody for joining us today","Joseph V. Taranto","Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference call. We appreciate your participation."],"8601":["Everest Re Group Ltd. (NYSE:RE) Q2 2015 Earnings Conference Call July 28, 2015 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Beth Farrell - VP, IR","Dom Addesso - President and CEO","Craig Howie - EVP and CFO","John Doucette - EVP and CUO","Analysts","Sarah DeWitt - JPMorgan","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank ","Brian Meredith - UBS","Operator","Good day everyone. Welcome to the Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call of Everest Re Group. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Beth Farrell","Thank you Stephanie. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer; John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting Officer and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements.","Now let me turn the call over to Dom.","Dom Addesso","Thanks, Beth and good morning. We were pleased to report that operating earnings for the quarter were $225 million, which was primarily driven by pre-tax underwriting income of $183 million, and net investment income of $125 million. The tax rate in the quarter jumped to 16.6%, causing some distortion relative to our first quarter numbers. Other factors affecting the first quarter comparison include a $50 million difference in foreign currency adjustments, $30 million of catastrophes, other weather related losses not recorded as Cats per say, and finally a marine loss from the Connex [ph] oil platform. Adjusting for these items, clearly puts our results in line with last year on a quarter and a year to date basis. And while the returns are still quite favorable improvement year-over-year is affected by market conditions. We believe than in an absolute sense we are well above our cost of capital and are near the top of industry performers.","I expect that industry results will bear that out. We achieved above market returns with strong expense controls, innovative and dynamic portfolio management and new products. In these last six months we have continued our expansion of capital market tools to leverage our capital and achieve a net return in access of the growth. Mount Logan is growing to $830 million of assets under management and our purchase of IOWs has increased this year versus last year of this time. These tactics allows increased market capacity on attractive business without increasing net exposure, while maintaining an above average return.","Premiums were down for the quarter and flat for the year with strong growth in the insurance segment, offset by a reduction in our reinsurance premiums. The factors affecting reinsurance were less quota share premium, the impact of foreign currency translation, shift of excess capacity to higher layers, increased corporate sessions to hedge accumulations, market pricing and non-renewed deal due to terms and conditions.","Offsetting these trends have been initiatives on the new product side. We continue to modestly grow our credit and financial assurance business and agricultural lines in the reinsurance segments. In the insurance segment, the growth has been strong, at 20 plus percent as we continue to see momentum in professional lines, excess casualty, contingency, crop and property E&S.","The insurance operation is on an excellent trajectory with an attritional combined ratio of 93% excluding crop. We continue to aggressively build out our insurance platform with the addition of underwriting talent. Market dislocation has made this a bit easier these days and a determined build is our preferred course of action here.","Despite what we all we see swirling around today in the M&A space, we are generally not inclined to take on significant dilution and then still face the generally enormous integration, cultural and legacy challenges, unless of course if it quarterly accretive in some reasonable timeframe.","We have the capital, patience and discipline to build a top tier insurance operation, consistent with our pricing and risk appetite. None of this, whether it's reinsurance or insurance will be easy. Market conditions in the reinsurance sector are challenging, but we appear to be closer to a turning point. Capital market seems to be hitting a floor, but the traditional markets results will be a more important factor. The reality is that there is not much margin for even the small events, let alone larger inevitable catastrophes. ","Based on unexpected second quarter industry results for reinsurers, we\u2019re likely to see that a few small cats and a large risk loss will produce returns on capital below 9%. Along with declining bond values, this begins to feel as if a market turn must happen. Of course markets are not always rational and a quick snapback would be atypical.","We are not waiting however as we continue to leverage our strengths to manage our portfolio smartly and outperform. An element of managing our portfolio will be an emphasis on insurance growth. Furthermore, we will manage capital accordingly. In this quarter our share repurchases were $50 million. This was below our typical pace for a number of factors. Among them were longer-term capital needs, driven by our insurance growth objectives. However, we have demonstrated over the long-term we are committed to returning excess capital when market conditions warrant.","As I sum up the first half of the year, despite some previously mentioned cautions, I'm quite optimistic. We finished the first six months at $554 million of operating income, up from $532 million in the prior quarter and with a 50% ROE; excellent results in such tough times, especially when compared to the industry. We continue to be able to navigate through a difficult reinsurance market while managing risk, staying opportunistic with new products and maintaining our pricing and expense discipline. ","I'm most optimistic about the trajectory of our insurance operations. Excluding crop, our year-to-date growth was 26% or $130 million and continues to produce profitable accident year underwriting results and my expectation is that this will improve over time. ","Thank you. And now I will turn it over to Craig for the financial report. ","Craig Howie","Thank you Dom and good morning everyone. Everest had another solid quarter of earnings, with net income up $209 million or $4.68 per diluted common share. This compares to net income of $290 million or $6.26 per share for the second quarter of 2014.","Net income includes realized capital gains and losses. On a year-to-date basis net income was $532 million or $11.88 per share, compared to $584 million or $12.46 per share in 2014. The 2015 result represents an annualized return on equity of over 14%. ","Operating income year-to-date was $554 million or $12.38 per share. This represents a 9% increase over operating income of $11.35 per share last year. These overall results were driven by a solid underwriting result and sizable foreign exchange gains compared to the first half of 2014.","The results reflect an overall current year attritional combined ratio of 83.0% on a year-to-date basis, up from 82.0% at year-end 2014. The attritional measure includes higher than expected current year losses in the U.S. reinsurance market, including estimated losses for the marine energy market and numerous other related losses that did not meet our $10 million catastrophe threshold.","All reinsurance segments reported underwriting games for the quarter and for the first half of 2015. Total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $177 million for the quarter compared to $181 million underwriting gain last year. For the first half of 2015, total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $382 million compared to a $396 million gain last year.","The Mount Logan Re segment reported a $28 million underwriting gain for the quarter, compared to a $9 million underwriting gain for the second quarter of 2014. On a year to date basis, Mount Logan reported an underwriting gain of $50 million, compared to a $19 million gain for the first half of 2014.","Everest retains $7 million of this income and $43 million was attributable to the non-controlling interest of this entity. The insurance segment reported an underwriting loss of $23 million for the quarter, compared to a gain of $4 million last year. On a year to date basis, the insurance segment reported an underwriting loss of $12 million, compared to a gain of $8 million in 2014.","The insurance segment loss primarily related to a claim review of Umbrella claims on a run off program that was discontinued by the Company several years ago. As a result of the review, we booked an additional $31 million of prior year losses rather than waiting for the reserve study that will be completed in the fourth quarter.","The insurance segment current year attritional combine ratio was 93.4% on a year to date basis excluding crop. This ratio has included compared to 93.9% one year ago. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $183 million for the quarter, compared to an underwriting gain of $195 million for the same period last year. On a year to date basis, the underwriting gain was $420 million compared to a gain of $423 million in 2014.","These overall results reflect $40 million of current year catastrophe losses in the first half of 2015 all recorded in the second quarter. Of the total, $20 million related to losses from slums in Australia and $20 million came from flooding in Chile. The 2015 cat losses were partially offset by $10 million of favorable development on prior year cat losses, primarily from the 2013 U.S storms. This compares with $45 million of catastrophes during the first half of 2014.","Our reported combined ratio was 84.1% for the first half of 2015, compared to 82.5% in 2014. Year to date commission ratio of 22.1% was slightly up from 21.9% in 2014, primarily due to higher contingent commissions. Our overall expense ratio remains low at 4.7%. This includes our industry leading expense ratio of 2.8% for our total reinsurance segment. As for loss reserves, in June we released our fifth annual global loss development triangles for 2014. There were no major changes since the 2013 release. Our overall quarterly internal reserving metrics continue to be favorable. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $125 million for the quarter and $248 million year to date on our $18 billion investment portfolio.","Investment income for the first six months declined only $7 million from one year ago. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 2.9% with a duration of three years. The first six months reflected $22 million of net after tax realized capital losses compared to $52 million of realized capital gains last year. These losses were mainly attributable to impairments on the fixed income portfolio in 2015. ","Other income and expense included $44 million of foreign exchange gains in the first six months of 2015 compared to $15 million of foreign exchange losses in the first half of 2014. On income taxes, the annualized effective tax rate is primarily driven by lower than planned catastrophe losses resulting in higher than expected taxable income for the year. The 13.9% effective tax rate on operating income is in line with our expected rate for the year, given our planned cap losses for the remainder of the year. This rate is consistent with the 14.4% tax rate at the same time last year. Strong cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $683 million for the first half of 2015 compared to $590 million in 2014.","Shareholders equity at the end of the quarter was $7.7 billion, up $276 million or 4% over year-end 2014. This is after taking into account over $200 million of capital returned through $125 million of share buybacks and $84 million of dividends paid in the first half of 2015. Book value per share increased 5% to $174.84 from $166.75 at year-end 2014. Our strong capital balance positions us well for potential business opportunities as well as continuing stock repurchases. ","Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide our operations review. ","John Doucette","Thank you Craig. Good morning. As Dom, highlighted we continued our solid underwriting results into the second quarter of 2015. Our Group gross written premium for Q2 was $1.3 billion, down $157 million from Q2 last year, with decreases coming from each of our reinsurance segments which I will get into shortly. Our U.S. insurance operation gross written premium is up meaningfully in Q2 compared to Q2 last year with growth coming from almost every insurance profit center. ","Our Group net written premium for Q2 was $1.2 billion, which was down 4% compared to Q2 last year. Year-to-date our Group gross and net written premium are both essentially flat year-over-year. Year-to-date 2015 underwriting profits for the Group are $420 million, virtually in line with 2014. For our reinsurance segment, total reinsurance gross written premium including Logan was $900 million for the quarter, down 17% from Q2 last year. This decrease in gross premium for the quarter was driven by several items.","First, exchange rate. The strong U.S. dollar had a meaningful impact on our international operations and our Bermuda operations. On a like-for-like exchange rate, our overall reinsurance segments would have been closer to 13% down compared to second quarter last year. Second, declining, reducing or non-renewing business that had pricing we could not support. These occurred across all reinsurance segments of the Group. Third, in the international segment, a major deal for a strategic relationship was restructured with essentially the same economics and net premiums, but the top-line is down significantly on a gross basis. ","Reinsurance net written premium including Logan was $870 million down 7% compared to Q2 last year. On a constant exchange ratio basis, our net written premium would be down roughly 4% due to increased retrocessional protections, including ILW purchases and other hedges to help us manage our peak zone PMLs. Our reinsurance book including Mt. Logan generated $206 million of underwriting profit in Q2, an 8% increase over last Q2. ","These strong underwriting results despite both in increasingly tougher market and the loss events mentioned by Craig confirm our reinsurance strategy; leveraging our core strengths, expanding our product offering and increasing our opportunity set to achieve profitable growth. In addition, our utilization of alternative capital structures allows us to conservatively manage our net risk position while generating fee income and lowering our cost of capital. Under this strategy we have and will continue to effectively deploy our capital towards achieving some of the best risk adjusted returns in the industry. ","At July 1st Mount Logan celebrated its two-year anniversary. We continue to see strong investor interest with inflows of approximately $80 million of new third-party investments this quarter, raising total funds in Logan to about $830 million. Logan remains core to our overall capital markets conversion strategy to hedge and manage risk across our overall portfolio and earned fees. To compliment this, we also secured more IOW protection heading into this hurricane season, mostly for Southeast USA and Florida Wind. With Mount Logan our cap bonds and IOWs, we maintained our conservative risk position with peak zone PMLs at 71, close to flat compared to 11 PML as a percentage of GAAP equity on a net after tax basis.","Here is some color on June 01 and July 01 reinsurance renewals. Group-wide, our inforce property pro rata GWP is slightly down as we non renewed some treaties and some clients brought less pro rata or inverted their treaties to access of loss. Our worldwide property cat excess of loss gross written premium went up compared to prior periods, but there was more churn compared to other renewals. We cut capacity on non-renewed underpriced business, but we also added meaningful capacity on deals we like, particularly for long standing key clients.","Our average dollar attachment on property treaties went up, as we deployed less capacity lower down and more capacity in higher layers, both in Florida and internationally. This typically consumes more capital, but has better margins. The end result of the mid-year renewals was our expected combined ratio is essentially flat compare to our expiring portfolio\u2019s combined ratio.","On a risk adjusted basis property pricing moderated and was off mid-single digits, although there were several regions around the globe that remained extremely competitive, including China, Australia, some parts of Latin America and U.S pack [ph] business. Other regions however provided opportunity due to a meaningful increase in demand. We therefore continue to build an attractive portfolio overall. On a dollar basis the expected dollar margin in the overall property book increased slightly compared to the expiring portfolio.","Turning to our global casualty and longer tail reinsurance books, reinsurance terms continue to be under pressure for commodity type treaties and seeding commissions on casualty pro rata treaties remains high. Therefore, we deploy capacity to new products and new opportunities, to current and new distribution sources. We continue to receive preferential signing on attractive deal across both long tail and short tail business, and across geographies including the U.S, Latin America, Canada, London, Europe, Singapore and Bermuda markets. Due to our lead market position, financial strength, ratings and longstanding trading relationships with clients and brokers.","Moving to our insurance operations our premium was $344 million in Q2, up 9% from Q2 last year. However, excluding Heartland, which was impacted by changes that delayed timing on premium recognition for 2015, insurance gross written premium is up approximately 20% for the second quarter and up 26% on a year to date basis. This growth is very diversified originating from over 10 separate insurance profit centers including newly launched product line resulting in a very balanced portfolio of both short and long tail lines.","Year to date we are up 41% on what we describe as direct brokerage business which is underwritten internally by Everest underwriters. Program business is up 9% year to date. We expect these trends to continue as we focus on building out our retail books. Also noteworthy, the direct brokerage business has run to about 8 or 9 combined ratio points better than the program business over the last three years. ","As Dom indicated, and you\u2019ve seen from our recent press releases, we have been hiring key leaders in our insurance operations to build out this platform. We are also in the process of establishing a Lloyd syndicate. If approved by the Lloyd's franchise board, we will target an early 2016 launch. Lloyd's will provide access to international business and new products, diversifying our insurance portfolio. We expect that growth in our domestic and international insurance operations will accelerate over the next several quarters, as our new initiatives gain traction. Insurance rates are mixed with most long tail lines of business up expect financial institutions and management liability due to increased capacity and competition, and similar to reinsurance property rates are down in several segments.","Bottom line our overall calendar quarter insurance results were disappointing in Q2, with a loss of $23 million driven by prior year development on the terminated Umbrella program mentioned by Craig. However, the underlying accident year results of our insurance book are profitable and improving both for the quarter and year to date, compared to the same period last year.","Now with some detail on what we are seeing in each insurance market. For California workers comp, the gross written premium was about $80 million in Q2, relatively flat to last year with a mid-90s combined ratio and still getting positive rate. But that has slowed down with increased competition from a few players.","Professional liability premium with financial institution is largest contributor was $55 million for Q2, up 23% compared to last Q2 with some attractive new opportunities. However, we see excess capacity and rate pressure here. Other cash related business is up approximately 22% driven by new initiatives. In the short tail business, including property, DIC, non-standard auto and contingency business, written premium was $84 million for the quarter, an increase over 26% from last Q2, as we've deployed more property insurance capacity. We remain bullish on the property facility in contingency businesses, but we see increased competition in the DIC book with lower rates and looser terms. ","Accident and health premium was up over 35% in Q2, compared to last Q2 to approximately $30 million, benefiting from several new initiatives. Regarding Heartland, crop conditions are favorable and commodity prices are stable. To date it is running at a slight underwriting loss, partly due to the delayed recognition of earned premium. However, we anticipate positive results for the year if prices and weather hold. ","In summary, we believe that our market position, core strengths, and sustainable competitive advantages, coupled with the new growth initiatives for the insurance book will propel bottom-line returns that are superior to most in our industry. We continue to execute successfully in this environment for both reinsurance and insurance.","Thank you. And now back to Beth for Q&A. ","Beth Farrell","Jess, we\u2019re open for questions at this time. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. It looks like we\u2019ll take our first question from Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Sarah DeWitt ","On the M&A that we've seen in the industry, could you just talk about what the implications are for Everest Re from a competitive standpoint as well as on the primary side, does that mean that insurers could perhaps purchase less reinsurance and what that would mean?","Dom Addesso","Sarah this is Dom. We answer that question basically in two sectors. First of on the reinsurance side, we don't necessarily see any major impacts from the M&A activity that are occurring today in that space due to us. As I\u2019ve mentioned in previous call, we certainly feel we\u2019re of sufficient scale and size to maintain a relevance in the market and with approximately $8 billion of capital we feel we\u2019re operating in this market with $10 billion of capital and we managed to get the signings and operate with our clients in the areas that we would prefer to sale. So no meaningful impact that we can see from that. ","On the primary side, the trend of acquisitions there and what that means to the reinsurance purchase, I think that\u2019s just a continuing trend of as capital grows, the larger players in the marketplace have purchased less reinsurance over time. But frankly there are many participants in the market that certainly need reinsurance. And in addition to that, as these entities get larger, they generally look to larger partners and base partners I mean reinsurance partners. They will still continue to buy reinsurance but they\u2019re more likely to look to partner up with larger and stable and meaningful companies. So that\u2019s how we feel the impact of that. Does that answer your question?","Sarah DeWitt ","And then if you were to look at acquisitions, what lines of businesses or geographies would you be interested in? Would it be more on the insurance side or in Lloyd\u2019s to accelerate your growth strategy there? ","Dom Addesso","The only thing that we tend to pay more attention to in the M&A space when presented with a variety of opportunities tends to be on the insurance side. But again as I've mentioned in my comments, our natural preference is to build our own organization, that matches our risk appetite, avoiding the cultural and any legacy issues that could from an acquisition. We don't ignore them. But frankly given some of the premiums that are involved in some of these transactions relative to building our own platform, we don't see the value in the acquisition at this point. Doesn't mean it won't exist in the future but currently that\u2019s not our focus. And we can't rely on that strategy. We can't rely on an acquisition strategy to further our insurance objective, or strategic objective in that space I should say. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Kai Pan ","Just first wanted to follow-up on Sarah's question on the industry consolidation. You sort of like Greenfield in the [indiscernible] and there is some news there is a large syndicate waiting to open to merger partners. Just can you talk little bit more about build versus acquire, and if you build out, would we expect at least initially higher expense as the teams run up?","Dom Addesso","Well, certainly there would be higher expense, but even in an acquisition with any amortizations of intangibles that you\u2019d have to bare, we tend to feel that the expenses frankly would be more economical to build. And as we build and as we\u2019ve been adding resources, we have been growing the top-line as well. So I don\u2019t think you will see any meaningful degradation in our expense ratio. That\u2019s really where we\u2019re going.","Kai Pan ","Okay. Would you just follow up or would you be interested in large scale acquisition in Lloyd\u2019s syndicates or you prefer that goes through like a\u2026","Dom Addesso","No, not at some of the prices that certainly have been bantered around in the press, no.","Kai Pan ","Okay. That\u2019s great. Then on the sort of large non-cat losses, could you quantify what is the impact for this quarter?","Craig Howie","Overall, Kai, this is Craig Howie. The overall losses are coming through our attritional loss pick and what we\u2019ve had were losses that took place in April, May and June through Texas and the Mid-West. Also that\u2019s coming through for the first half of the year are winter storms that took place in the North East. None of those storms rose to our $10 million Cat threshold but we have totaled those numbers to be almost $90 million to $100 million of losses.","Kai Pan ","Is that including the Panamax or the offshore energy losses as well?","Craig Howie","That\u2019s correct.","Kai Pan ","Okay. That\u2019s great. And lastly if I may ask on the capital management, it looks like the pace of buyback have been very slow compared with the earning stream. Your total payout ratio is less than 50%. Given that reinsurance space is slowing down in terms of capital needs, I just wonder, are you saving by capital for potential acquisitions or is it over the long run we\u2019re expecting like a 50% like payout ratio.","Craig Howie","No, Kai as you know we don\u2019t give guidance on our share repurchase program. I think what we tend to do is look this over the very long term, and we have returned a substantive amount of capital over the last 10 years to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We\u2019d look at certainly the long-term objectives in terms of growth, and over the long-term we think clearly insurance and frankly for that matter reinsurance again over the very long term we feel that we can succeed in this space ","So we have to balance that up against our objectives in terms of what we\u2019d like to bring stock in at, and this is a long-term gain. So this past quarter based on what we saw as our future growth objectives balanced up against what the opportunities were to bring additional shares in, we opted to give $50 million this quarter and clearly over the long-term we remain committed to buying shares, consistent with whatever growth objectives that we might have.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Nannizzi ","Quick question on just the reinsurance premiums, maybe [indiscernible], just the stuff that\u2019s purely on your balance sheet. Do you have the constant dollar year-over-year change in net written premiums there?","Craig Howie","Just give us a second.","Michael Nannizzi ","Sure, no problem.","Craig Howie","Year-to-date right, is you\u2019re asking?","Michael Nannizzi ","Just in the second quarter, if that okay.","John Doucette","Michael, its John. It\u2019s a 5% decrease quarter-over-quarter. ","Michael Nannizzi ","Great. Thank you. And then I guess first quarter I think we were sort of looking for a little bit more growth. Should we be thinking about this sort of as the level and just given the sort of challenges that you outlined in reinsurance, is there still an opportunity to grow your sort of piece of the pie here, or would you expect to continue to see areas where you will cut as a result of not meeting your profitability standards or the like. Just trying to get an idea of how we should be thinking about premium production on the reinsurance side here.","John Doucette","Yes, to all of it. And it\u2019s interesting, because some are looking for growth, others are not looking for growth. Some are critical of growth. Some are critical of lack of growth. So it\u2019s an interesting dynamic. And as each of us kind of mentioned in our prepared comments, there\u2019s a number of things going on. So you\u2019ve got FX, you\u2019ve got less proportional business that met our pricing guidelines, you\u2019ve got us moving up an attachment point, which lowers rate online. You\u2019ve got more retrocessional protection that we purchased, which is up significantly year-over-year, all of that kind of leading to a lower net written premium growth. Interestingly on XOL basis we actually did have some growth in our portfolio, gross exit well premium. But again that was offset by some of the retrocessional protections we broker, all with an eye towards improving our net returns on capital as compared with our gross returns on capital.","So we believe that we continue to make headway in being a larger presence in the marketplace and winning and gaining share from other market participants. But that doesn\u2019t mean that we're also not paying attention to things that don\u2019t need our return over hurdles. And I think I mentioned in last quarter's call that there are some things in Florida that will be backed away from, some writings, where others have put down large lines. It doesn\u2019t mean that they are right and they\u2019re wrong and we\u2019re right. It just means that they didn\u2019t quite meet our pricing objectives. So again we still continue to make headway in terms of growing our book, our margin. Our net margin is up year-over-year. It doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t some headwinds in the marketplace, but we think we're doing quite well and we will continue to manage that way going forward, and at some point we certainly believe that there will be a turn in this market and we'll be well positioned to even take greater revenge of that than we are right now. ","Michael Nannizzi ","Craig, you mentioned about nine points of underlying losses. So if I take that into consideration, does that mean that the sort of true underline actually improved year-over-year? So profitability is improving in reinsurance? The 90 million of non-cat large losses.","Craig Howie","On an overall basis I would say on a net basis we think that it's improving and that is the reason if you back out those $90 million to $100 million of losses yes.","John Doucette","Essentially our operating income on a year to date basis year-over-year is up. Yes, this quarter we had a number of things happen, some of which frankly were losses that we weren\u2019t aware of that were winter losses for example that came from the first quarter that got reported to us in the second quarter. So to look at reinsurers results just on quarter by quarter sometimes could be a little bit misleading and so on a year to date basis we are up year-over-year. We think it's a quite a solid year to date so far. ","Michael Nannizzi ","I guess one question would be, the great results, is there a need then for the market to change it all? Because it seems like at these profitability levels, that I don\u2019t know how the conversations happen between insurers and reinsurers but it seems like these levels of profitability are pretty attractive.","Dom Addesso","Well, remember that it depends on scale, it depends on your expense ratio, and we've argued for a long, long time that we have a distinct advantage in the marketplace, given our not only our size and the signing that we can obtain, but also our expense ratio advantage, and our global diversified platform. So compared to many other market participants that don\u2019t enjoy some of those advantages, you\u2019ve seen already I believe and will probably continue to see some return drifting below as I mentioned again my comments below 9%. That doesn\u2019t sound like a completely terribly robust market. And at the same time you see a few losses that come through hit the industry here in this quarter take a pretty good bite out of the apple. So it suggests that there isn\u2019t much margin to handle the larger catastrophe. But notwithstanding all of that, we think we clearly have unique advantages which enable us to continue to expand our offerings. ","Michael Nannizzi ","And then just one numbers question, the negative seeded premium in the international, I'm just trying to think about, should we be looking like the net written line as sort of a good base or starting point? Should we be looking at the gross written line and then assume like normal sessions occur from here. Just trying to sort of square that maybe if just there is some context in terms of what drove that negative number. And thank you all for all your answers.","John Doucette","That was really driven by one large strategic deal that we had done. It's better to look at the net written premium on the international book for that reason. That deal was restructured. So going forward it's at the same margin but the premium will be booked differently going forward. So more appropriate to look at the net written premium.","Dom Addesso","The growth though is still important in the sense of how we're utilizing the capital market opportunity. We have Tampa, Mount Logan, IOW. So again gross is you can't ignore it because that\u2019s also indicating what our reach is into the marketplace. It just that this particular quarter given the adjustments made in some of those transactions that we talked about earlier, that distorted that historical relationship for just this quarter.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Amit Kumar from Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Amit Kumar ","Two quick follow up questions on the discussion on capital. Number one, one question we were getting last night as it pretends to Everest Re is how does -- I guess the forthcoming changes or the upcoming changes to the ARR model, how does that impact your view on capital PMLs and how much of that is actually connected to the capital management pullback. ","Dom Addesso","None of that actually. We\u2019re -- we don't expect any major change to the PMLs. No question there will be some change, there is ups and downs depending on the territories that you write in. And I\u2019ll ask John if he has any additional thoughts but remember that our view of -- the risk positions that we talk about is essentially our view of risk. It is looking at all the markets, whether it's ARR RMS and frankly our own internal model. So to the extent that ARR is changing some of their calculations, it will have some impact but we do not expect it to be a meaningful impact. John, if there\u2019s anything to add to that. ","John Doucette","Yes, just to follow-on that. So net, net we view this as a positive as this will be potentially an increase in demand, a push on demand for some of our clients and that would be good, but just following what Dom said, first we create our own view of risk. We've been spending a substantial amount of time and resources over the last six years or seven years building out Everest Re risk for all zones around the world, all perils, all return periods, and we use many, many things to input this and we\u2019re continually enhancing our views of this and have it very smart capable team of people that are analyzing this around the group. And we think this is one of our core competitive advantages. And it allows us to take all the different inputs, not just the ARR but the other vendors as well as we've been trading for over 40 years in a lot of countries around the globe and so we look at our own results and look at the damageability against losses, we look at external, we look at academic studies that are done around the globe and all that rolls up to our view of risk. ","So our view of risk is we\u2019ll try to enhance it all the time, whether it's tied to ARR changing its results or somebody else or internal studies that we do and we\u2019re always looking to enhance that, but net, net, we think this is a positive for us and positive upward on rating going forward. ","Amit Kumar ","The other question for Dom, and this is sort of a follow-up to Sarah's and Kai's question. It seems that the market is more forgiving in terms of doing dilutive tangible book value deals and I'm curious, looking at that, has that changed your view in terms of how you might look at things going forward or not?","Dom Addesso","Not a bit. Market is more forgiving today. We\u2019ll see would that turns out to be two years from now.","Amit Kumar ","Got it. And final question\u2026","Dom Addesso","We have to pay attention to here is how we feel we can best an economically and also given our strategies are, how we can best out our insurance platform. It doesn't mean that we\u2019re -- we turned a blind eye to any kind of a transaction that might be presented to us. It\u2019s just to date, as we look at the alternatives, our alternative looks a little better. ","Amit Kumar ","The final question is on reserve adjustment. I think it was $31 million in run off book. Can you maybe give us a bit more color? How should we view the $31 versus against the size of that book? Can you put some ranges around it which give us comfort that there is not going to be possibly more noise or maybe just talk a bit more about this?","Craig Howie","This is Craig. This is was a claim review that was done on a run off program book of business for Umbrella. The company discontinued this book several years ago but the program has been running hot if you will. We've had reserve adjustments over the last two reserve study cycles. There were over 300 open claims reviewed. About 195 claims had adjustments. Some of them were down, most of them were up, obviously with respect to add any additional $31 million of prior year losses. We took into account some things like other cases and local and state labor laws when we were going through these claims. But relatively speaking this is $31 million. What we wanted to do was take this charge. The company reacts very quickly to unfavorable type development like this. But keep in mind this is $31 million on a $10 billion book of reserves. So it's a very small number. The rest of our reserves I'm very comfortable with the overall book and that continues around very favorably against our internal reserving monitoring metrics?","Dom Addesso","I would ask that everyone consider, as Craig emphasized it as part of $10 billion of reserves, and look at our track record of calendar year results or reserve development, it's quite strong. And again, as I said many times before, we have some 200 different reserve groups that we analyzed. This half we want subset of one of those and we\u2019re going to get blips in any one of those different reserve groups from time-to-time. What\u2019s most important is the integrity of the balance sheet, and I think we\u2019ve demonstrated that our reserve position is quite strong. Our reserve triangles have been out. We\u2019ve obviously released those over the couple of years. All the analysis on that indicates that it\u2019s very positive and clearly our own internal metric suggests that as well. So I recognize that you certainly want to understand each segment of our business to properly project but I also ask that you consider the overall. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Josh Shanker ","Could we talk a little bit about fronting arrangements and changes in those and how we should think about seeding commissions going forward? Or I should say commission ratios?","Dom Addesso","Sure. Let\u2019s talk about it, what is -- ","Josh Shanker ","I see a big drop off in international premium and the uptick in acquisition expense ratio. I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s one time in nature, how should we think about that going forward?","Dom Addesso","I\u2019ll let Craig take that one.","Craig Howie","In the international book, as we\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times, what\u2019s driving that this quarter Josh is one strategic deal that we have done that changed this quarter for the year and going forward. So while the margin is the same, the premium has been booked differently on a gross basis. So therefore it\u2019s probably more appropriate to look at it on a net basis for this quarter anyway. That will give you a better indication of how that is driving the current result.","Josh Shanker ","And so if I think about going forward for the remainder of the year, is year-over-year the expense ratio higher it was a year ago.","Craig Howie","I don\u2019t think the expense ratio will be significantly higher for acquisition costs even on an international book.","Josh Shanker ","Okay. And so and thinking about 2Q, \u201916, not that I\u2019m asking for guidance or anything, but more interested in this deal, just one time in nature how it was booked this year and we think about next year we\u2019ll be doing that again or have you discontinued the relationship or how does that all play in?","Craig Howie","We have not discontinued the relationship. There have been some law changes in Latin America with respect to how to treat these transactions going forward. So over the next five years we would expect these transactions to decline going forward but that will be over a longer period of time, over five years. ","Josh Shanker ","And just next question, very subjective. You can answer it anyway you want. It\u2019s about the industry. If you were prohibited from writing cat business for some reason just hypothetically, what do you think the combined ratio is in the reinsurance market for non-cat business today?","Craig Howie","Was an option there not to answer your question? ","Josh Shanker ","Whatever you want? I trying to tease out, still you had a higher loss ratio, still very attractive in a non-cat quarter always hard to deduce what the real numbers are?","Dom Addesso","It\u2019s -- I\u2019m going to take a guess at it more than anything at this point, because part of the answer to that question, if that were the case, the whole marketplace will be within the different dynamic. So a transaction that you might do with clients might be done on a different basis but I think the answer to that question would be somewhere in the low 90s kind of a guess. Obviously you\u2019ve got casualty business, you\u2019ve got all of our facultative writings. You\u2019ve got property per risk, you\u2019ve got professional launch treaties, it\u2019s a multitude of things. But the whole mix of the business would change, but I think what you\u2019re really asking is what\u2019s the rest of the portfolio kind of running at.","John Doucette ","Josh, this is John. Just to add some more color to Dom\u2019s answer, it very much would depend on book of business that we have and one of things that Everest has built very intentionally over the last 40 plus years is a very, very diversified book of business and we\u2019re not a one trick pony type of property cat. We keep talking about these 200 plus IVNR [ph] deals. That means we had 200 different segments of business around the group, different lines of business and different geographies. So we\u2019re always looking for profitable business and based on a combined ratio, ROE and other metrics that we look at. So I think it very much depends on what the opportunity set is. We feel very good about our opportunity set and we have for many, many years been a reinsurer in the Casualty market and we are capable to deploy as much capacity there as market conditions dictate place and we desire to given the market condition. We can flip from reinsurance to insurance. We have a lot of dials that we\u2019ve talked about to the earnings call. But we trade in many, many different classes of business that there is margin and not just in the property cat space.","Josh Shanker ","Well thank you for all the answers and let\u2019s hope for quiet hurricane season. Take care.","Dom Addesso","I think we\u2019re probably going go to go over a little bit because I think we do have time for at least for one more anyway.","Operator","We'll take our last question from Brian Meredith of UBS. Please go ahead.","Brian Meredith ","Two questions here. First one, Craig, can you give us a sense of where new money yields are right now versus your current portfolio in new fixed income. We\u2019re getting close to a bottom with respect to book yields.","Craig Howie","I would love to say that we are \u2013 but our new money is just over 2%. We don\u2019t see a bottoming out until probably mid-2016.","Brian Meredith","And then the last question, on the Lloyd\u2019s starts up here, a couple of Lloyd's -- guys in Lloyd's have kind of commented that the price competition at Lloyd's right now is equivalent to where we were back in 1999. So pretty darn competitive. I\u2019m curious, why from a timing perspective now going into Lloyd given the competition.","Craig Howie","First of all, I think some of those comments were related to some very, very specific classes. And that\u2019s number one. Those are not classes that we necessarily have on our radar screen, at least not in the near term. So -- and frankly, just like in our reinsurance lines, if the market is not giving us return, it meets our pricing metrics, then we won't write the business. We don\u2019t necessarily will have the choice is to when we start these projects literally months and at least a year in advance, you have to kind of start thinking about how to get these things running. So you don\u2019t have a choice in terms of timing sometimes. But you do have a choice in terms of what kind of business you put on the books and we will continue to maintain our underwriting discipline and underwriting culture, which will dictate the kind of business we write. And frankly the business plan that we have put forth we believe can generate a very nice underwriting margin for us. ","Operator","I will now turn it back over to the speakers for any closing remarks.","Dom Addesso","I will close it out just to say thanks for your interest. We went a little over today, but my apologies for that and thank you for your interest. Clearly within the industry there is certainly lots of headwinds. We think Everest has demonstrated that we have the scale and the talent to manage through that as I mentioned before, a positive underwriting result, positive operating results for the first half of the year and it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s a long term business and we think we have to look at it on a six-month basis. And we think we've performed very, very well with a 15% return on capital. So thank you for your interest and we look forward to talking with you in the weeks and months ahead.

(NYSE:RE) Q2 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call July 25, 2017 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Beth Farrell - VP, IR","Dom Addesso - President and CEO","Craig Howie - CFO","John Doucette - President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations","Jon Zaffino - President, North America Insurance Operations","Analysts","Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Meyer Shields - KBW","Operator","Good day everyone. Welcome to the Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call of Everest Re Group Limited. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relation. Please go ahead.","Beth Farrell","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's second quarter 2017 earnings call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, President of North American Insurance Operations.","Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that the statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements.","Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.","Dom Addesso","Thanks Beth and good morning to all. We're pleased to be able to report $246 million of net income for the quarter, which was $90 million above last year's second quarter. On a year-to-date basis, net income rose $210 million to $537 million.","These results were primarily driven by excellent underwriting results of $130 million for the quarter and $313 million on a year-to-date basis, which includes $54 million of cat losses in the second quarter and $74 million in the six-month results.","These results are improving year-over-year due to continued growth in premium, along with a lower combined ratio, due in part to lower catastrophe losses in the quarter. More important is the improvement evident in the Insurance segment, where we have an underwriting gain this year versus last.","The attritional combined ratio for Insurance has now reached 93.6 for the quarter. The various growth and underwriting initiatives we have implemented are beginning to take hold.","Overall premium is up $238 million or 17%, with growth coming from both Reinsurance and Insurance. However, on a percentage basis, Insurance is up 25%, while Reinsurance is up 14%.","The growth in Insurance, which Jonathan will discuss in greater detail in a moment, is well diversified, coming from several new business units. We are extremely encouraged by the growth in all of our segments. In the Reinsurance businesses, while due to market condition, there are areas where we are contracting; there remains an array of opportunities in the credit and structured solution areas that are contributing to profitable growth. In addition, as John Doucette will cover in his report, proportional transactions, including crop reinsurance, are presenting profitable opportunities in today's market environment.","The non-U.S. segments has also been a reasonable growth area for us more recently, as we have added resources there and established new locations. While Reinsurance is still a challenged space, we have been successful in achieving better than market returns due to our ability to reallocate our capacity in-scale due to better returning opportunities. Our size and relationships matter in this type of market.","Scale also plays a meaningful role in the success we've been having in the Insurance segment. The ability to operate in sophisticated lines of business, with meaningful capacity and a strong balance sheet with A-plus ratings, matter to customers and brokers. These factors have also enabled us to attract terrific talent and armed with our financial strength, have propelled us to over $1 billion of premium in the first half of the year.","At the same time, we have eliminated a number of underperforming businesses. For example, crop insurance and we have strengthened our reserve position, all these leading to a profitable first half. And as earned premium begins to catch up with the written premium, we would expect this profit picture to accelerate. Our Insurance operation in the best position that it's ever been, and is now a recognized market to brokers and their customers.","On the investment front, there was also positive movement over the prior year as income was up 9% for the first six months. This is a result of some rotation into limited partnerships and public equities and traditional fixed income.","However, our allocations are still quite conservative relative to the industry. Our investment team has done an outstanding job of enhancing performance to the cycle, while maintaining quality.","Overall, our results were excellent, with an ROE of 13% for the first half, our shareholder's equity growing to $8.6 billion, and our market cap reaching $11 billion. These factors have led us to just recently being added to the S&P 500, a great accomplishment and acknowledgment to our shareholders and employees.","Now, I'll turn it over to Craig for the financial reports and look forward to your questions in a bit. Thank you. Craig?","Craig Howie","Thank you, Dom, and good morning, everyone. Everest had a solid quarter of earnings, with net income of $246 million, this compares to net income of $156 million for the second quarter of 2016.","On a year-to-date basis, net income was $537 million compared to $327 million for the first half of 2016. The primary differences were unimproved underwriting result, higher capital gains, higher investment income, lower catastrophe losses, and lower foreign exchange losses compared to the first half of 2016.","Net income included $50 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $30 million of capital losses in the first half of 2016. After-tax operating income for the second quarter was $227 million compared to $134 million in 2016. Operating income year-to-date was $487 million compared to $357 million for the first six months of 2016.","The overall underwriting gain for the group was $313 million for the first half compared to an underwriting gain of $234 million in the same period last year. All segments reported underwriting gains for both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis.","The year-to-date combined ratio for the group was 88.3%, down from 90.7% reported in the first half of 2016, with lower catastrophe losses contributing to this favorable variance.","In the second quarter of 2017, the group saw $54 million of current year catastrophe losses net of reinsurance. Of the total, $25 million related to wildfires in South Africa, $15 million related to U.S. storms in Colorado and $14 million related to floods in Peru. This compares with $124 million of catastrophes during the second quarter of 2016.","On the year-to-date basis, catastrophe losses totaled $74 million compared to $134 million for the first half of 2016. Excluding the catastrophe losses, the current year additional combined ratio through the first six months was 85.6%, essentially flat from 85.7% for the first half of 2016. Our expense ratio remains at 5.8% for the first two quarters of 2017.","For investments, pretax investment income was $135 million for the quarter and $257 million year-to-date, on our $18 billion investment portfolio. Investment income was up 9% from one year ago. This result was primarily driven by the increase in limited partnership income, which was up $14 million for the first half of 2016, primarily due to the turnaround in energy-related investments compared to last year. The pretax yield on the overall portfolio was 2.9%, with a duration of just over three years.","Foreign exchange is reported in other income. For the first half of 2017, foreign exchange losses were $5 million, compared to $31 million of foreign exchange losses in the first six months of 2016. The 2016 foreign exchange losses reflected the weakening of the British pound during 2016 related to the Brexit vote.","Other income also included $4 million of earnings and fees from Mt. Logan Re in the first six months of 2017 compared to $3 million of income in the first half last year. The increase reflects the lower level of catastrophe losses during the first half of 2017 compared to 2016, resulting in a higher profit share to Everest.","On income taxes, similar to the first quarter of 2017, the 9% year-to-date effective tax rate on operating income was lower than the expected range for the year. The 2017 rate is lower than the 10% tax rate for the full year 2016, due to a FASB tax accounting change related to share based compensation and the utilization of foreign tax credits for years 2008 and prior. These two items reduced the effective tax rate by about one point.","The effective tax rate is an annualized calculation that includes planned catastrophe losses for the remainder of the year. Should catastrophe losses come in lower than this estimate, it would be expected that the tax rate would increase.","Stable cash flow continues, with operating cash flows of $634 million for the first half of 2017 compared to $684 million in 2016. The decline reflects a higher level of paid catastrophe losses in 2017 compared to 2016.","Shareholder's equity for the group was $8.6 billion at the end of the second quarter, up $500 million or 6% over year end 2016. This was after taking into account capital return for $103 million of dividends paid in the first half of 2017. Our capital position remains very strong and continues to grow.","Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide a review of the range on its operations.","John Doucette","Thank you, Craig. Good morning. We are pleased to report another strong quarter with $126 million of reinsurance underwriting profit. The second quarter combined ratio improved to 87.4% from 89.9% in the second quarter 2016.","The loss ratio improvement of 1.2 points to 60.2% was driven by lower catastrophe losses, offset by a 3.6-point increase in the attritional loss ratio. This was an anticipated outcome and was mainly due to the crop reinsurance book new this year as well as the increased property pro rata writings, offset by reduced attritional loss ratios on the international book.","Total gross written premium for the second quarter was $1 billion, an increase of 14% compared to the prior Q2. This growth is due to several factors, but largely can be attributed to $54 million of crop premium associated with our strategic crop reinsurance relationship that resulted from the sale of Heartland last year.","In our U.S. Reinsurance segment, second quarter gross written premium was up 17% to $475 million, driven by the new crop treaty and the impact of a large premium portfolio out in Q2 2016.","The second quarter combined ratio in this segment was up eight points, primarily due to the waiting of crops and property pro rata earned premium in the quarter, with higher attritional loss ratios.","While both lines have higher combined ratios, they maintained attractive ROEs due to their low capital consumption. The increased loss ratio was offset by a 1.5 point drop in the expense ratio, mainly due to lower contingent commission in the quarter.","Our international Reinsurance segment second quarter gross written premium was $320 million, down 6% partly due to some large one-off deals with strategic clients written in the prior year. Net written premium for the quarter was down 3%, but up 7% on a year-to-date basis, due to the impact of timing on the receipt of several accounts.","The combined ratio for the second quarter dropped to 93.7% from 115.8% in Q2 2016, due to lower catastrophe losses given the Fort McMurray wildfires and the Ecuadorian earthquake last year.","The attritional loss ratio also dropped 6.2 points to 50.1% due to continued favorable loss trends. The lower loss ratio was offset by a 2.6 point increase on the expense ratio, primarily driven by the higher mix of pro rata premium affecting the commission ratio.","Our Bermuda segment second quarter gross written premium increased 47% to $238 million, or up 51% on a constant dollar basis. The growth was derived from new product opportunities, timing of certain accounts, additional pro rata treaties in property, credit and casualty line, increased writings in U.K. motor, post Ogden rate changes and some large multi-class programs with core clients.","The combined ratio increased to 90.3% from 88.9%, due to a 7.9 point increase in the loss ratio, offset by a 6.5 point decrease in the expense ratio. The loss ratio comparison was affected by a sizable catastrophe reserve release in 2016, a shift in business mix and an increase in the current year loss ratio, due to the change in the Ogden discount rate this year. The drop in commission was caused by a larger mix of business with naturally lower commission ratios.","Turning to the 6\/1 and 7\/1 renewal, Everest continued to dynamically allocate capital to opportunities with the best risk-adjusted returns. Rather than chase the market down on non-performing deal, we reduced or declined these and selectively deployed capacity towards deals that were priced well.","On balance, this approach resulted in similar amounts of capacity deployed with only a marginal deterioration in expected returns. This ability to successfully ship risk capital to the benefit of our overall portfolio was true at 6\/1 in Florida and at 7\/1 in the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Bermuda, London, Z\u00fcrich, Singapore, China, and Australia, highlighting our very diversified portfolio and global origination capabilities.","We also wrote more structured and customized transactions that are somewhat more shielded from market pressures. International property rates were, on average, down about 5% for us this 7\/1, with some isolated pockets of rate increases in loss affected areas.","In the U.S. property markets, June 1st XOL rates continued to edge down. Lower rated, smaller reinsurers and non-traditional players bore more of the brunt of the rate pressure as seasons gravitated to higher rated leading reinsurers like Everest, who received larger lines overall and better signings on the more attractively priced layers.","We also cut participation on poorly performing XOL deals. Despite declining their placements, we typically continue to trade with many of those clients on different products or a different attachment point. We saw ongoing demand for our capacity on higher layers, where we currently find better risk-adjusted returns.","This combination of strategies resulted in a better than market outcome for us, as we saw rates for our Florida XOL June 1st book being closer to down only about 3% and the rest of our U.S. July 1st book being closer to flat.","In addition, having been impacted by Hurricane Matthew and AOB claim issues, Florida exposed pro rata deals saw improved reinsurance terms and we deployed more capacity accordingly to them.","With our strong franchise, we've been able to increased our debt in various U.S. and international markets, continued to expand in areas dislocated by loss activity or grow with existing clients in new lines of business. Repeatedly, we are a go-to market for shortfall covers as market stabilization in these specific lines prevent deals from completing at aggressive firm order terms.","In our casualty book, reinsurance terms are mostly stable, but original rate and loss trends pressure economics. We judiciously deploy our capital and cut back when necessary, favoring lines with healthier returns.","Recently, some large casualty deals were not completed at the firm order terms, resulting in either not placing the deal and the clients retaining at net or the buyer had to improve terms for the reinsurers to get the deal fully placed, both signaling the casualty market is trying to find a floor.","The persistent strength and financial success of the Everest franchise reflect the value that we are constantly trying to deliver to our reinsurance clients. We continually strive to build adorned and strategic client relationships, highlighted by the fact that 75% of our reinsurance clients have been trading with us for at least a decade, and over 50% of our clients worldwide have been trading with us for over 30 years.","Leveraging our leading global franchise, our empowered underwriters nimbly provide customized solutions to our client, earning us a first look at new and unique opportunities. Consequently, we remained optimistic about our future and our ability to deploy capital profitably despite a tough market.","All said, the mid-year renewals continued the macro theme of delivering the most value for reinsurance clients at the best costs. Thus, the reinsurance market continues to sprint towards; one, more capital efficiency through size, scale and diversification; two, alternative risk transfer mechanisms to enhance capital efficiency and best match capital to risk; three, increased focus on distribution to access profitable business, which is becoming increasingly more important; and four, improved operational and expense efficiencies.","Those reinsurers that can execute on these objectives will succeed in both good and bad reinsurance markets, but those that do not could be disintermediated or diminished as the reinsurance value chain compresses.","Everest continues to remain nimble in its approach to this changing market environment, adopting its operating strategies to ensure success today and into the future in the new reinsurance world order.","Thank you. And now, I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations.","Jon Zaffino","Thank you, John, and good morning. Our Global Specialty Insurance operations delivered a solid quarter of performance. The significantly transformed Everest Insurance platform continued to take shape, and the momentum we are generating in the market as a result, remains encouraging.","The second quarter marks the highest level of quarterly gross written premium realized in our insurance operations history. The achievement of this milestone was a result of a highly diversified growth, generated from over 150 specialty products, despite no premium contribution from the now divested Heartland Crop portfolio.","Importantly, this quarter build upon the underwriting profitability achieved in the first quarter of this year. Most notably, when compared to the second quarter of 2016, we achieved an excess of $30 million of improvement of underwriting profit. The many strategic actions executed upon since 2015 are beginning to take hold and evidence themselves in our results.","Turning to the financial results for the quarter and year-to-date period, as in prior quarters, due to the divestiture of Heartland in late third quarter of 2016, I will discuss comparative results, excluding this business.","For the second quarter of 2017, the Global Insurance operations produced $569 million in gross written premium, an increase of $164 million or 41% over second quarter of 2016, a tremendous result considering the challenging market conditions.","On a year-to-date basis, we achieved $1 billion in gross written premium, again, another record performance. This represents growth of $240 million or 31% over the comparable period in 2016.","Contributions were relatively balanced across most underwriting divisions. The significant addition of new products, which continued to gain scale, coupled with strong performance from our many existing product areas, namely accident and health in the quarter, contributed to this excellent result. This represents the 10th consecutive quarter of growth for our Global Insurance operations.","Also in the quarter, our new product launches and recently assumed portfolios contributed 19% to total premium production, along with an additional 4% from our Lloyd's platform, numbers that are consistent for the year-to-date period.","Let me offer a bit more context at the divisional level. Our property portfolio experienced meaningful growth in the quarter and year-to-date period. The U.S. wholesale property book, aided in part by the previously announced renewal rates transaction closed at the end of the first quarter, was a large driver of this growth.","Further contributing was the steady expansion of both our inland marine and newly launched retail property groups. Growth in various other property portfolios globally was balanced and in line with our expectations.","Globally, this line represents roughly 28% of our year-to-date premium production. Everest specialty underwriters, the division focused on professional and management liability and various other specialty products, also grew nearly 25% over the prior year-to-date period.","Growth, however, was not experienced across the Board. Some of our management liability books were down significantly in the same period, as we simply do not find the rating environment to be supportive of our profitability ambitions. We have been able to redeploy our resources to areas within ESU that better meet our objectives.","The Everest Risk Management division, which houses our primary large account casualty operation, our mono line work comp unit, the commercial casualty team, and our multinational group, also achieved meaningful growth in the quarter and year-to-date period.","Overall, premium production increased 41% and 33%, respectively over the prior year quarter and year-to-date period and profitability remained solid. This business is also a strong bellwether of the growth in our brand across the market.","In the case of large account primary, we worked with our brokers and risk managers to design thoughtful risk financing casualty programs, inclusive of the suite of services. There are many hurdles entering this business, yet we find ourselves in a position of growing strength as the operation continues to mature.","Everest Underwriting Partners, our delegated authority operation, was essentially flat in the quarter and in fact, down 3% in the year-to-date period, yet profitability was the strongest we have seen in several quarters. Impacting our growth were various underwriting actions taken to address a few underperforming portfolios, namely nonstandard auto.","Finally, our Lloyd's operation also continued its expansion. The syndicate contributed $24 million to the insurance growth in the quarter and $45 million year-to-date. The steady and cautious build of our portfolio continues with a balanced contribution from several lines of business, including professional indemnity, financial institutions, liability, accident and health, and contingency. Again, we remained deliberate in our growth pursuits and will continue to seek opportunities for profitable expansion.","So, again, meaningful growth coming from balanced contributions across the global portfolio, yet not all divisions are growing as profitability remains our number one objective.","Turning to net premiums, as we've shared in the past, net written premium slightly lags gross written premium growth, due to the marginally more conservative reinsurance position we have taken to support the growth across our underwriting divisions.","Net earned premium in the quarter was $364 million, an increase of $70 million or 24%. For the year-to-date period, net earned premium of $688 million increased by $118 million or 21% over the prior year period.","Earned premium growth has lagged in net written premium growth due to a few factors. First, our growth rate has accelerated in recent quarters, as our new underwriting divisions became fully operationalized in the market.","Second, various lines of business we are writing long-term very profitable lines earned over a period longer than 12 months. As these businesses gain additional scale, we expect earned premium growth to accelerate, which we are confident will lead to growing underwriting profit.","Turning to the combined ratio, for the quarter, the GAAP combined ratio was 99.1%, almost a 10 point improvement from the second quarter of 2016. While we are pleased to have produced an underwriting profit of just over $3 million in the quarter, there were some headwinds from various cat events that distorted the progress we expect to show on a run-rate basis, which I'll get into. On a year-to-date basis, the GAAP combined ratio was 98.8%, a four point improvement over the first half of 2016.","Our attritional results for the quarter and year-to-date period are 93.6% and 95.7%, respectively. This compares favorably to 2016's second quarter of 95.7% and 95.8% year-to-date. So, again, improvement in the quarter and stability on the year-to-date results.","The quarter's loss and loss adjustment expense ratio improved significantly from the prior year period to 70.3% from 80.2%. As you will recall, the second quarter of 2016 was impacted by significant cat activity from the Texas hailstorms and the Fort McMurray wildfires, which combined, had a 13.1 point impact to the loss ratio.","While this quarter was also impacted by a variety of well-publicized cat events, it was not the same magnitude of last year. On an attritional basis, the second quarter 2017 loss ratio improved to 64.8%, three points better than the 67.8% attritional produced for the first quarter of this year and two points better than the attritional loss ratio of 66.9% in the second quarter of 2016.","We are beginning to see the drift down in the attritional loss ratio based upon improved mix, the benefits from the many new businesses launched and the strategic underwriting actions of the past two years.","Looking at the year-to-date period. The GAAP loss ratio improves to 69.3% in the prior year up 74.3%, a five point betterment. The attritional loss ratio also improves a full point to 66.2% from 67.3%.","A few additional comments. First, as I mentioned, the second quarter experienced another elevated level of cat activity in the U.S. PCS cat event 17\/32, the Colorado hailstorms, in particular, impacted our North American results by almost four points.","Second, the significant convective storm event across the first and second quarter added roughly two points to our attritional loss ratios. Certainly, all manageable outcomes, based on the profitable growth in our earned premium base, but nonetheless creating some quarterly pressure on the results.","We also recognized a small amount of adverse prior year development from our non-standard auto book of nearly two points in the quarter. This is an area we continue to deemphasize in our go-forward portfolio.","Offsetting these increases to our loss ratio was a four point improvement in the accident and health division exiting year loss ratio. Our A&H group delivered an outstanding quarter. Our expense ratio in the second quarter was 28.8%, down from the first quarter result of 30.2%.","For the year-to-date period, the expense ratio is 29.5%, up slightly from the 28.5% in the comparable period of 2016. Our operating expense ratio for the second quarter was 12.5% compared to 12.4% for the prior year quarter, essentially flat. Year-to-date operating expenses were 12.8% for 2017 compared to 12.2% last year.","Again, we anticipate the expense ratio to stabilize as we continue upon our growth plan and as earned premium continues to come through. As we have stated in prior calls, an expense ratio of roughly 30% remains very competitive in the Specialty Insurance segment.","Turning to the operating environment, the second quarter trended quite similar to the first quarter. Suffice it to say that it's a competitive market and underwriting excellence is paramount in this environment. Clarity of risk appetite, clear knowledge of the rating environment, and the thoughtful assumption of risks are all key attributes of our approach.","As in prior quarters, the overall level of rate change can vary meaningfully by major line of business. In general, and outside of commercial and personal auto, there are various degrees of rate pressure.","Worker's compensation, particularly in California; professional liability; and various casualty lines are all feeling some degree of mild pressure, generally in the flat to mid-single-digit range, again consistent to prior quarters. Commercial and personal auto remained the outliers and are each achieving low double-digit rate increases across our portfolio.","As discussed in prior calls, we feel the U.S. property market continues to find the bottom. While the rate environment has not turned consistently positive yet, we feel it is flattening out, again, with some caveat between cat and non-cat exposed areas.","So, another quarter of predictable trend for each line, yet with a tone of stabilization across the overall portfolio. In conclusion, we are pleased with our results to-date. As our portfolio continues to gain scale, we are encouraged by the increased resiliency of our platform to achieve underwriting profitability.","Our additional results are a special especially encouraging. Our many new and existing colleagues continue to execute well on their individual underwriting mandates and we look forward to continuing our momentum and reporting back to you on our progress next quarter.","Now back to Beth for Q&A.","Beth Farrell","Thank you, John. Operator, we are ready to take questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","We'll have our first question from Elyse Greenspan.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi good morning. My first question on the reinsurance growth, pretty strong growth again in the quarter. Last quarter, you guys have pointed to about high single-digits growth as the sustainable level that you saw at the time for the book. The second quarter was stronger than that, and I think part of that was probably due to the some of those property pro rata signings you pointed out.","But how do you see -- I mean, the rest of the year trending just in terms of on the growth prospects of your Reinsurance business? Just based off how you so June and July renewals? And how you're thinking things through right now?","Dom Addesso","Elyse, this is Dom. I'll ask John to comment as well. As we mentioned and you mentioned, part of it was due to the shift to couple of new proportional deals which that earned premium and that will have an impact on the remainder of the year, so that will affect premium growth.","And then also, crop the -- crop reinsurance transaction, which will also have similar impact on the remainder of the year. But absent that, the renewable seasons are pretty much over, other than we had in July 1. But again, most of the activities in the first half of the year in terms of renewals and new business opportunities.","The growth areas for us though continued to be mortgage credit, structured solution and that's where -- absent the other items I just mentioned, that's where, frankly, the growth opportunities are and that our previous guidance on that in terms of growth. As you indicated, the high single-digit would still remain unless John has anything to add to that.","John Doucette","No, I agree.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then in terms of the Insurance business, pretty strong growth and a lot of commentary that you guys gave. If the growth remains at 40%, do you think that based off of how you put it all together, that you could maintain an underlying margin in the low 90s?","And one question I had, you did call out, Jon, convective storms of about two points, is that stuff that fell outside of your cat definition in the Q2? Meaning, the margin might have been better adjusting for that, I'm just trying to tie that together. ","Dom Addesso","Yes, the two points that Jonathan referenced falls within the attritional number that he quoted. So, it's not -- in our vernacular, it's not a cat. There are cat events, but they don't get disclosed by us as a cat, where we quoted in our numbers as a catastrophe, it is in the attrition.","And again, in terms of growth, I think we set for some time that we would anticipate an improvement in our attritional and we'll have those levels where we think it is sustainable.","We have great diversification across the entire platform, so we're not dependent on any one line of business or any one product, which not unlike the reinsurance sector, enable us to increase our capacity or increase our appetite and those lines of business that we feel or giving us the requisite profit and return our capital, and deemphasize those class of business that are not. It doesn't mean we totally withdraw, but it allows us to shift our capacity around. So, several new business units and allows for greater diversity across the entire platform. Johnathan?","Jon Zaffino","No. That's [Indiscernible]","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then one last question. Can you talk -- the losses in the quarter, you guys saw some losses in the South Africa and Peru, can you just talk about your exposure there? And what kind of returns are you getting in normalized years in both of those markets?","Jon Zaffino","Good morning Elyse, Jon. So, we write a significant portion of our business outside the U.S. and have been strong in many countries around the world including those and we write -- in each of those countries, we have a strong franchise and an attractive book of business that we've been writing for many years. They would typically run in the 80s across the cycle. So, 80s combined ratio, it could go up or down based on cat activity.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you very much.","Dom Addesso","Thank you, Elyse.","Operator","We'll go next to Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning. The first question is on -- follow- up on Insurance segment. The second quarter topline grows 41% ex-crop and margin improvement of 210 basis points, very impressive. I just wonder, you mentioned it's very competitive marketplace. Could you tell us a little more how exactly do you gain market share in the marketplace?","And why, after improving your margin because I'm assuming if you grow very fast, you probably -- there are certain so-called, I don't know the terms, new business apparently apply to this line of business as well. Can you maintain the margin or even improve the margin going forward?","Dom Addesso","Kai, this is Dom. I don't necessarily agree with your assertion or assumption that growth comes -- with growth underwriting deterioration. As I just kind of described in response to Elyse's question, the diversification across many different product segments allows us to maintain our underwriting integrity and increase capacity to those lines of business getting adequate returns.","We do think that we are improving our traditional, there still some improvement that we think we can garner particularly in the Property segment, remembering that the first half of the year.","So, Property, as Jonathan pointed out, had a number of cat events, but also, as we described in non-cat events, adding two points of the attritional, and we anticipate that, as the year plays out, that we'll some improvement in those areas.","So, we would certainly anticipate an improvement in combined ratio picture on the insurance side, again, coming from diversity, diversification most business unit, and products within those business units.","And remembering that we are a specialty insurer, and we are not commercial. We're not into [Indiscernible] business or those areas that are subject to, in our views, some of the more competitive pressures in the marketplace.","Craig Howie","I would just add to that Kai that there's really a couple of things here to remember. Number one is that we have doubled our underwriting staff over the last two years. So, we had a lot more boots on the ground, seeking profitable opportunities in the lines of business we have chosen.","Secondly, we have launched literally dozens of products. So, to Dom's point about diversification across platform, it significant, it's coming from a number of different areas.","To the point I tried to raise earlier, it's not -- growth is not linear across our platform, it's not all moving in lock step. There are several actions being taken still to try to drive a better attritional result. So, we're seeing now the effects of all those efforts that have happened over the last couple of years.","Kai Pan","Thank you for the expanse answers. My second question on the Reinsurance side. You talked a little bit more about what caused the deterioration, 210 basis points, what are the moving parts? And you mentioned about the crop reinsurance, about property pro rata treaties. How much -- could you quantify how much each basically contributed to the year-over-year deterioration? And do you think that will be a normal stable run rate going forward?","Dom Addesso","Well, what the stable run rate. The attritional that we have on the reinsurance?","Kai Pan","Yes, exactly. Yes.","Dom Addesso","Well, some of that is dependent upon what happens with future rate levels, right? And I don't know that we have all the details that could give you that. So, we do have some of it. So, growth in crop that have 4.6 point impact, we had -- some of the increase due to pro rata had an impact of approximately three points, so that will give you some indications on the attrition. That's what what's driving the higher attrition.","Kai Pan","That's in the U.S. Reinsurance segment?","Dom Addesso","That's U.S., yes.","Kai Pan","Okay, great. Last one--","Dom Addesso","On the international side, we had explained improvement in some of the operations there, Middle East, Africa, showing some improvement in the non-cat loss trend and that we had Bermuda site, we had an increased due to higher ERR on some of the treaty -- higher ERR picked on some of the treaties we've written. So, it varies across the entire portfolio.","And the reason I kind of go through some of these in detail is reflect the fact that, it's what I said before, Everest has -- generally is an operational strategy, moves around various lines of businesses and I can't tell you necessarily what 1\/1, for example, will bring us and we could change our portfolio again. So, it's little difficult to answer.","John Doucette","And Kai, this is John. Just to add a little bit color to that. And a lot of this is -- you also may be better to look at the year-to-date numbers as opposed to the quarter, because there's always going to be quarterly volatility just from large risk losses that happen, non-cat-cat events or weather losses that happen that that move these things around. So, we think the year-to-date attritional combined ratio is more reflective for the Reinsurance operation.","Kai Pan","Great. Thank you so much. I probably back in the queue. Thank you.","John Doucette","Thank you, Kai.","Operator","We'll go next to Josh Shanker, Deutsche Bank.","Joshua Shanker","Yes, good morning everyone. You guys have already surprised [ph] yourselves on expense ratio and expense management were not being much better than peers; to what extent you need to grow the Insurance business to be competitive from an expense management standpoint?","Dom Addesso","What do we need to grow the expense ratio to?","Joshua Shanker","No, the overall volumes for your scale where you think you said that you cannot have a competitive run rate expense ratio better than peers?","Jon Zaffino","Hi, Josh, this is Jon. I think we're there. Generally, I think--","Joshua Shanker","You're there. You're there now.","Jon Zaffino","We're there now. I mean, if you look at where we are year-to-date, I think that expense ratio compared to those who write the lines of business we do across the geographies we write them, I think it will stock up very, very well, in fact well above the pure average.","Secondly, when you look at a lot of the activities that we have pursued, our investments have been all across our platform. We're equally excited about the investments we're making our claims department, our actuarial teams, technology, et cetera. So, I think we have a pretty good feel for the expenses that are coming into the system and against the earned premiums that we're forecasting. I think we feel pretty good about it.","Joshua Shanker","Okay. And as you grow, obviously requires more capital, you're not buying back stock; you're using it to grow your business. Are you growing at the pace of excess capital generation or is that the limiting factor that you had more capital; you could grow faster or you growing faster than you're generating capital?","Dom Addesso","Our capital growth is kind of consistent with our premium growth. Our premium growth is -- we have sufficient capital for the growth that we've had for the first half of the year. If anything, our excess capital position has maybe just inched up a very little bit, but not enough to warrant that we would increase -- go back in terms of the short-term. We've purchased particularly at the levels that are stock of that today.","Joshua Shanker","Okay. That's that. And thank you very much.","Dom Addesso","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","We'll next to Mayor Shields, KBW.","Meyer Shields","Thanks. Good morning. Two really quick questions. One, is it fair to infer with U.S. Reinsurance that the movement to higher attachment point is limiting your exposure to what seems to have been really bad non-catastrophe weather?","John Doucette","Hi, Meyer, this is John. There's certainly some of that, that we -- and I think that you saw that last quarter as well, that some of the noise. So, in general, market losses of certain size are going to be more an Insurance loss than a Reinsurance loss. And I think, directionally, given what we've been doing with the book, it would mean that it would take larger, the real noteworthy headline cat losses and not just the things you see on TV with the good video images. It would really take larger ones to cause larger losses for us.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Thanks. And then broadly, I guess, this would be Insurance and Reinsurance. There's been a lot of commentary about sort of accelerating social inflation, are you seeing that? How are you booking that in your current accident effect [ph]?","Dom Addesso","I'll ask Craig to speak to that.","Craig Howie","I'm sorry could you repeat the question?","Dom Addesso","Social inflation and its impact on our portfolio?","Craig Howie","I think we always take a look at what the inflation is when we look at loss cost trend on the overall portfolio, Meyer. And we look at not only social inflation, but we look at everything that's going on claim inflation, social inflation. We look at the frequency and severity of the claims as they come through as well. But that's always part of our process as we go through picking our loss estimates.","John Doucette","And Meyer its John, just to add a little more. I think also there's no one simple one line answer to that. We have -- across the group, we have 300 IBNR groups in many lines of business, in many territories around it and what -- and how social inflation or claims inflation or other things like that are driving loss cost. It is dynamic, it varies.","I would say though that we have spent a lot of time between feedback loops, between pricing actuaries and underwriters and reserving estuaries and the underwriting and pricing to make sure that we are thoughtful and how we think about that, and are able to respond to what we see as changing market condition.","Dom Addesso","And that's not something that's new to the industry. It's something that all companies have to deal with. And if you look at our reserving history, I think it demonstrates that we're properly taking those factors into account and establishing our reserve position.","Meyer Shields","Right. No, that's very helpful. I'm just -- I'm trying to get a handle on whether on the sort of simplistic trends or aggregate trends that we look at from the outside with anything material going on?","Dom Addesso","No, loss cost trend obviously have been rather tamed for a number of years. And it's a little tough to project when that social inflation for example kicks in, but general inflation, of course, has been relatively modest. Other than healthier trends, of course, which impacts [Indiscernible].","Meyer Shields","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you very much.","Dom Addesso","Any -- I don't think we have any other questions on the call?","Operator","We'll go next to Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan","Thank you for a couple of follow-ups. First one, there's on your Lloyd's business, recently there are some additional interest in the acquisition in the marketplace you're building your own, at this time, do you prefer build versus buy?","Dom Addesso","Across all of our businesses, that's our preference. It doesn't mean, however, that we wouldn't -- if something came across our desk that looked very strategic and could propel us to a different level more quickly and didn't have huge integration issues and\/or legacy concerns, we would certainly consider it.","And of course, if you're pointing to Lloyd's, but I would say that Lloyd's is a platform. It's not necessarily the entire strategy if you will. It's a platform that enables us to execute our Continental European strategy as well as outside of North America and Europe. And we can -- we have other areas that we are pursuing, our other platforms that we're considering again internal build that would enable us to move forward on those ventures.","Kai Pan","Okay. Last one if I may for Craig, it's about tax rates. What's your normalized tax rate if you think about your budget level of catastrophe losses?","Craig Howie","Well, we typically have looked at the range before Kai. When we look at our tax rate, we essentially go and we look at with and without catastrophe losses as you've heard us say in the past.","So, last year for 2016, was a mild year for tax rates, but -- and we had a full year effective tax rate of about 10%. What I would say to you is, if we had no catastrophes in the year, in other words, more taxable income, that rate could go as high as up to 13%. But that would give you a relative range of where I would expect to be.","Kai Pan","Okay, great. Well, thank you so much for your time and good luck.","Craig Howie","All right.","Dom Addesso","Thank you, Kai.","Operator","That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the conference back over to Mr. Addesso for any additional or closing remarks.","Dom Addesso","Again thank you very much. And thanks again to all for your participation this morning in the call and your questions. As we mentioned, the growth in the first half for us has been strong both Insurance and Reinsurance, but our first priority continues to be underwriting profit.","That's why you see us continually optimizing our portfolio on the Reinsurance side, for example, as we change attachment points, increase pro rata, non-renewal certain layers, diversify into various regions, and rotate into other risk classes like mortgage, credit, or structured solutions. So, it is with an emphasis on an underwriting profit.","In the Insurance segment, our underwriting strategy is a product specialty and diversification again, which is, as I said earlier, allows us to provide capacity to the most attractive areas and also clearly minimize the impact of any one line of business to the extent it reaches some difficulty. So, diversification and specialization remain cornerstone of what we do.","And so for the reasons that I just mentioned, we remain optimistic that through the cycle, we can outperform the overall market. Again, thank you very much and I look forward to meeting with many of you in the weeks ahead. Have a good day.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"8797":["Everest Re Group Ltd. (NYSE:RE) Q4 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call February 12, 2019 10:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Jon Levenson - Head of IR","Dominic Addesso - President and CEO","Craig Howie - EVP and CFO","John Doucette - EVP and President, CEO, Reinsurance Division","Jonathan Zaffino - EVP and President, CEO, Everest Insurance Division","Conference Call Participants","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs","Amit Kumar - Buckingham Research","Brian Meredith - UBS","Meyer Shields - Keefe Bruyette & Woods","Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jon Levenson. Please go ahead, sir.","Jon Levenson","Thank you, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Ltd. 2018 fourth quarter and year-end conference call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Dom Addesso, President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, EVP and Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, EVP and President and CEO of the Reinsurance Division; and Jonathan Zaffino, EVP and President and CEO of the Everest Insurance Division.","Before we begin, I need to preface the comments on today's call by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in Everest's SEC filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplements.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Dom Addesso.","Dominic Addesso","Thanks, Jon. Good morning and thank you all for joining on the call this morning.","As you know, Everest's fourth quarter was impacted by catastrophes in the amount of $695 million. This follows a third quarter with a series of events as well. It has been an unusual two-year period, estimated to be the highest on record at almost $240 billion of losses over those two years.","With our global presence, balance sheet and business model, we undoubtedly expect our share of the losses. While the current estimates are consistent with prior market events, the difference from prior years is that despite the significant size of the catastrophes, Everest was still able to generate operating earnings over the two-year period of $603 million.","This is the result of a focused effort to continue to diversify our portfolio by expanding our product set in both our reinsurance and insurance businesses. We would expect that trend to continue as momentum is building rapidly in these initiatives. More on that later from my colleagues.","Turning to our property cat business. Our portfolio over time has produced excess returns, extremely positive on average, but variable over any individual period. Many years are great and others require fortitude.","However, as I have noted in the past, in the short term there may be some adjustments on our portfolio, particularly as we continue to allocate more capital to casualty and mortgage businesses.","To be clear, the cat business remains a core part of our portfolio. However, pricing for risk in many circumstances has not firmed as much as required. On that business we take a pause and allocate our capital elsewhere. January did present some very good opportunities to get better risk-adjusted returns and some renewals were already adequately priced with expiring. Retro pricing, large programs and loss affected accounts, on balance, were strong. Nevertheless, our January 1 business for property cat reinsurance was down due to pricing on some business.","Going forward, we would expect a stronger market as April and June renewals are dominated by loss affected areas, notably Japan and Florida. The market has some repair to do in these areas as industry issues, particularly in Florida around LAE and AOB are factors that have not been well considered in pricing. Couple that with what we see as desire for improved economics by third-party capital, and you have the recipe for positive renewal.","We view the influence of alternative capital as somewhat neutral due to what appears to be at least some slowdown in the rate of growth there due to lockups from last year and perhaps a view on adequacy of pricing. Our conversation this morning should also focus on our strategic objective of building a diversified global reinsurer and insurer.","To that point, you will note the strong performance of our insurance operation this year as highlighted by the fact that for the first time in many years, we produced an underwriting profit. This has truly been a journey as the legacy portfolio required some work. While at the same time, we were expanding into new classes and territories.","We have set the table with an array of product offerings and many new distribution relationships and an international presence in London, Dublin and Toronto. This $2 billion-plus specialty insurer is completely overhauled and now truly represents our go-forward base. We are poised to accelerate from here and insurance will undoubtedly be a larger part of our future.","Similarly, on the reinsurance front, we continue our diversification work. In terms of classes of business, mortgage and other credit-related premium continue to grow and are becoming a more relevant part of our underwriting profits.","Also, as we have mentioned on previous calls, the casualty classes have seen improvement in rates, terms and conditions. As a result, our treaty casualty book is profitable and growing. This growth is mostly in proportional business, which does drive the overall combined ratio up, but nominal margins are increased with a higher premium base. Looking at geography, our new Zurich branch is enabling us to gain increased penetration in the Continental European market.","On the investment front, while we still manage an overall conservative portfolio, we generated very positive returns, mainly due to our strategies around private equity. Rates are inching up. And while that bodes well going forward, it does have the medium term impact of negatively affecting marks on our existing portfolio. As a result, we have an unrealized loss this year which affects book value. But since the duration of our portfolio is relatively short, this will reverse as bonds mature.","From a capital perspective, we did less than we planned in buybacks this past year due to cats. This was mostly due to being in blackout periods during the year as a result of uncertainty around cats and not because of any threat to our capital base, which is solid.","As we go forward on our diversification efforts, there will likely be opportunity to consider additional buybacks as diversification could result in the ability to expand the premium to surplus ratio. This of course is all subject to the opportunities we see ahead as the market is developing.","Before I turn it over to my colleagues where they will go into some detail on the operations, let me say that we have never been more confident about our ability to continue to perform at a high level. As I mentioned, volatility, although likely reduced in the near term given our portfolio expansion, remains a factor in our business.","Nevertheless, Everest's ability to compound book value well above the industry over the long term remains our hallmark. Balance sheet strength remains intact, coupled with significant hedging structures in place and low financial leverage. Our diversification efforts at the Group level are taking hold. The insurance brand is growing profitably as a unique specialty insurer with global reach, achieving record gross written premium and positive underwriting income.","After two challenging years, we find ourselves well-positioned in a changing macro environment. Cat pricing is likely to firm in certain areas given loss activity over the past two years, which could create enhanced opportunities. And insurance growth is in an improved rating environment presents some unique opportunities.","The platforms we have in place are sound and my colleagues across the entire organization are outstanding. Our culture of underwriting and expense discipline, coupled with an entrepreneurial spirit, will enable us to continue to be a market leader. And I look forward to your questions later.","And now over to Craig for the financial highlights.","Craig Howie","Thank you, Dom, and good morning, everyone.","Everest had a net loss of $382 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, a quarter heavily impacted by catastrophe losses and realized capital losses. This compares to net income of $571 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Net income for the year was $104 million compared to $469 million in 2017.","The full year of 2018 was also impacted by catastrophe losses and realized capital losses. For the year, net income included $109 million of net after-tax realized capital losses compared to $102 million of capital gains in 2017. The capital losses were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on our public equity portfolio. Since the end of the year, we've seen pre-tax realized capital gains of over $50 million.","The after-tax operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $237 million compared to $535 million of operating income in 2017. Operating income excludes realized capital gains and losses, foreign exchange and the tax impact related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. For the year, operating income was $191 million compared to $413 million in 2017. The primary difference was higher catastrophe losses booked in 2018.","In the fourth quarter, Everest saw $875 million of net pre-tax catastrophe losses compared to $36 million in fourth quarter of 2017. The breakdown of the pre-tax loss estimates by event is as follows: Hurricane Michael was $400 million; the Camp Fire in California was $300 million; the Woolsey Fire in California was $150 million; and the Australia hailstorm was $25 million, for a total of $875 million in the quarter.","On a year-to-date basis, the results reflected net pre-tax catastrophe losses of $1.7 billion in 2018 compared to $1.3 billion in 2017. These losses were pre-tax figures net of reinsurance and reinstatement premium. As a reminder, the Company uses net after-tax loss estimates when setting its catastrophe loss exposure budget for the year.","Excluding the catastrophe events, reinstatement premiums and favorable prior year reserve development, the underlying book continues to perform well with an overall current year attritional combined ratio of 87% for the year compared to 85% last year.","This increase is due to a change in business mix, with the growth in our pro rata premium during 2018 which carries a higher combined ratio. Our year-to-date Group expense ratio remains well at 5.4%, while our commission ratio of 21.9% remains stable.","On reserves. We completed the remainder of our annual loss reserve studies during the fourth quarter. The results of the studies indicated that overall reserves were redundant and in the fourth quarter we booked $74 million of favorable prior-year reserve development.","This included favorable prior-year prior-period development for both the insurance segment and the reinsurance segments and is in addition to the $100 million of favorable prior year development reported in the second and third quarters of 2018. The insurance segment reported $51 million of favorable prior year reserve development during the quarter and $52 million for the year, which was largely related to its workers compensation business.","The reinsurance segments reported $23 million of favorable prior year development during the quarter and $122 million for the year, which related to the casualty and property business, both in the United States and Bermuda. These redundancies have developed over time but we don't react until the position becomes more mature. We continue to hold our loss reserve estimates for the more recent years.","For investments, pre-tax investment income was $140 million for the quarter and $581 million for the year on our $18 billion investment portfolio. Year-to-date investment income was up $38 million or 7% from one year ago. The result was primarily driven by higher yields on the fixed income portfolio and the increase in limited partnership income, which was up $10 million over 2017.","During the fourth quarter, we made a tactical shift to de-risk the investment portfolio. We reduced our public equity and alternative investment portfolios by over $500 million and reinvested in investment-grade fixed income. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.2% compared to 3.1% one year ago as both investment-grade and alternative fixed income yields were up year-over-year. The rising new money yields will boost future net investment income.","On income taxes. The tax benefit was the result of losses associated with the catastrophes this year. Since the majority of the catastrophe events were written in the United States, the tax benefit primarily reflects the U.S. tax rate. The effective tax rate is an annualized calculation that includes planned catastrophe losses for the year. For 2019, we expect our tax rate to be about 13%, which reflects an annual cat load of less than 7 points.","Shareholders' equity for the Group was $7.9 billion at the end of 2018 compared to $8.4 billion at the end of 2017. The decline in shareholders' equity during 2018 is primarily attributable to the $256 million mark-to-market impact on the fixed income investment portfolio, $77 million of foreign currency translation adjustments and capital returned through $260 million of dividends paid as well as $75 million of share buybacks, partially offset by $104 million of net income. Since year-end, the mark-to-market gain on the fixed income portfolio is approximately $100 million pre-tax.","Our capital position remains strong. The catastrophe losses of 2017 and 2018 were contained within earnings and therefore had no impact on our capital position. During the year - during the quarter, the Company announced an 8% increase in its regular quarterly dividend and paid $1.40 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018.","Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations.","John Doucette","Thank you, Craig. Good morning.","Following the unprecedented back-to-back years of significant catastrophe losses, Everest remains as a solid and stable partner for our clients with the financial strength, experienced underwriters and a full suite of products required in this rapidly changing market.","Although our 2018 earnings were impacted by these catastrophe losses, our capital position remains strong and our willingness to deploy meaningful capacity at favorable risk-adjusted pricing remains intact.","Our resilience is the result of our ongoing strategy to build an extremely diversified reinsurance portfolio by class of business, product type and geography. Although 01\/01 pricing did not reflect a traditional across-the-board hard market, Everest still had a successful renewal.","We were able to allocate our capacity to the best opportunities by proactively utilizing our core skill and our market differentiators. These include: a strong balance sheet and ratings, with meaningful capacity and $13 billion of underwriting capital, including our third-party capital; a full suite of products across all P&C lines of business in most geographies; trust from reinsurance buyers and brokers in the strength, stability and longevity of Everest; we have been trading with many of our customers and brokers around the globe for over 40 years; experienced underwriters in local markets with deep product expertise; and a dynamic culture with a flat, nimble organization that can pivot swiftly to the best opportunities.","Through these strengths, we empower our local teams to execute, unencumbered by internal and external distractions such as M&A, weakening relevance and restructurings that several of our competitors face. Accordingly, during this renewal season we focused on the best underwriting opportunities in support of our core clients.","Everest maintained and increased shares on our clients' most strategic programs and layers that also demonstrated the best prices for the exposures. This focused underwriting meant moving away from some property layers or programs while increasing some casualty or other long tail lines which has further diversified our portfolio.","Now some detail on the reinsurance division's financial results for the full year of 2018. The reinsurance business experienced strong growth in gross written premiums of 22%, with all three segments contributing strongly to $6.2 billion in gross written premium in 2018. Much of the growth across the reinsurance division came from non-property lines, including casualty, motor, mortgage, surety and aviation.","While underwriting profit per dollar of pro rata premium is lower than excessive loss, volatility is also considerably lower, consuming less capital per premium dollar. As a result, Everest had $360 million of underwriting profit in 2018 from nonproperty lines of reinsurance, which is up over $50 million versus 2017.","For the full year of 2018, the reinsurance operations reported a 113% combined ratio, with 33 points of net cat losses incurred. The attritional combined ratio is up about 3 points to 84% from 2017, given the larger amount of pro rata premium and more casualty premiums earned during 2018.","The U.S. reinsurance segment 2018 gross written premiums grew by 16% to $3 billion. The largest contributions were from pro rata casualty, mortgage and pro rata property. With 135% combined ratio, this segment bore the brunt of the catastrophe losses, most notably California wildfires, Hurricanes Michael and Florence and the development on Hurricane Irma.","Total catastrophe losses reported to this segment were 58 loss ratio points for the year. The 2018 attritional combined ratio was 83%, up about 5 points from 2017 due to more pro rata earned premium.","In the Bermuda segment, 2018 gross written premium grew to $1.7 billion, an increase of 38%. This segment had its strongest growth from casualty pro rata, Lloyd's fee-bearing deal and mortgage. In addition, motor, aviation, political risk and trade credit written out of our London and Zurich operations also contributed to the growth in the Bermuda segment.","This segment had an 88.5% combined ratio, aided by 2 points of reduction in prior year attritional losses. The 2018 attritional combined ratio was 88 points, representing a 1.5-point decrease from 2017, despite the larger mix of proportional business.","In the international segment, we grew gross written premium 17% to $1.5 billion in 2018. Growth was broad-based, including pro rata property and casualty in many territories including Canada, Latin America, Asia and Middle East and Africa as well as robust growth in international fac.","The combined ratio was 96.9%, which included 18 points of catastrophe losses. The 2018 attritional combined ratio was 81.1%, with about a 2.6-point increase in the attritional loss ratio from 2017. The amount of pro rata premium affected this metric also.","In 2018, most of our roughly 15 major reinsurance profit centers made an underwriting profit, with the exception of those few which were heavily impacted by large risk losses and the catastrophes in the USA and in Japan.","Now I will give some color on the January 1 renewal. We headed into the 01\/01 renewals with the strategy to push rate, terms and conditions on property where needed, to deploy more risk capital into other classes with improving economics, notably casualty, mortgage and credit.","We also planned to increase support of our global clients and strategic reinsurance partners, areas which continue to develop strongly with meaningful profit opportunities. Broadly, we were successful with this plan.","Now more details about 01\/01. Regarding property reinsurance, the overall market at 01\/01 was mixed. Loss affected business and retrocessional accounts showed rate increases, while much of the remaining market was relevantly flat. In areas unaffected by losses and on small capacity layers that are easier to fill out the required capacity, these were much more closer to flat or even down which was disappointing given recent industry losses. Everest held the line on changes to terms and conditions and reduced our share where economics fell below our expectation of acceptable pricing levels.","We reserved our cat capacity for our best clients and the best price opportunities, while leaving some dry powder to deploy for property business throughout 2019. Altogether, both our 01\/01 property premium and exposures have reduced as we pushed rate, terms and conditions and withheld capacity where we found it prudent.","In terms of pricing at 01\/01, as we have demonstrated in multiple prior renewal cycles, we were able to achieve significantly improved risk-adjusted rates, beyond what was reflected by the average market rate changes mentioned in the headline. This is driven by our leading global franchise and ability to deploy meaningful capacity in all P&C lines for clients around the world. The end result was an overall improvement in expected ROE across our global property cat book, but with a wide dispersion of results. Our growth in - reinsurance more than made up our decrease in property writings.","Our expanded long tail writings have included new deals as well as increased shares on accounts with improving pricing on the original insurance rates, increased reinsurance rates or improved ceding commissions. Furthermore, we continue to expand our product set and capabilities.","We have recently added to our in-force business in lines such as multipara crop in North America and in Asia; mortgage, structured products, aviation, political risk and trade credit and several new product offerings in Canada; and we continue to see improving pricing in broader opportunities in facultative business in the U.S. and internationally, given dislocation in several major markets.","In summary, the market at this 01\/01 renewal is mixed, particularly given the loss activity over the last two years. But overall, we were pleased with our ability to execute our game plan. We pushed rate, terms and conditions on property reinsurance; deployed more risk capital in both a relative and absolute basis in casualty and mortgage; and we expanded relationships with global clients who continue to want to buy more reinsurance across all property and casualty lines from large, well-rated global reinsurers such as Everest.","Our success with the global clients was particularly noteworthy in our London and Zurich operations at January 1st. Given a relative shift to more casualty and more pro rata, we have seen upward pressure on the attritional loss ratio. But the dollars of underwriting margin remain robust and we like the trade.","We expect our Q1 2019 business, which is broader than just 01\/01, to be up on gross written premium compared to Q1 2018, given our strong success and continued opportunities in the segments I just mentioned. We also expect gross written premium booked throughout 2019 and beyond.","This is from large proportional deals where we recognize premium throughout the year slower than some of our competitors as well as from multiyear deals such as mortgage. So we effectively have written but not reported premium coming from these classes.","On the alternative capital side, investors continue to support Mt. Logan as we onboarded some new investors at 01\/01\/19, resulting in assets under management being slightly up compared to a year ago.","Investors in Mt. Logan benefit from Everest's world-class property underwriting expertise and access to broadly diversified business from around the globe. And Everest investors continue to get the benefit of protections from Logan in above-average cat years such as 2017 and 2018.","Given the improvement in our reinsurance portfolio, supported by our organizational resilience, underwriting acumen, relevance and diversified capital structure, we remain bullish on our future and we look forward to our success in 2019 and beyond.","Thank you, and now I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations.","Jonathan Zaffino","Thanks, John, and good morning.","2018 was a pivotal year in the history of Everest Insurance highlighted by several noteworthy achievements. First and foremost, we're pleased to report a full year of GAAP underwriting profit with a combined ratio of 95.3%. This is the first underwriting profit Everest Insurance has delivered since 2006 and continues our recent trend which has produced an underwriting profit in seven of the last eight quarters.","Our $77 million of underwriting income reflects a $146 million swing from the prior year and it's the third-largest underwriting income we have achieved in 20 years. This result speaks to the successful implementation of our strategy, the growing resiliency of our platform and the immense efforts of the talented team we have steadfastly and carefully assembled over the past four years.","Highlighting the year. Our gross written premium achieved a record $2.3 billion, reflecting growth of 9% over 2017. Our growth, while more moderate than the prior three years, reflects both the balanced contributions from our many underwriting divisions and targeted product lines and the impact of continued reunderwriting of some legacy portfolios.","Over the past several years, largely beginning in 2016, we have written $1.4 billion of new gross written premium in high-value, carefully selected lines of business that simply were not part of the product portfolio prior to this time.","Further, over 15% of that three-year premium number or approximately $230 million has originated from outside the U.S. market via our growing international operations and select global product lines. At the same time, we have nonrenewed, divested or reunderwritten portfolios approximating $500 million in gross written premium that simply do not fit with our future strategy.","As a result, we conclude 2018 with the following: solid underwriting profit and risk-adjusted returns; record levels of gross written premium despite offsets from nonrenewed business; the deepest roster of actively underwritten specialty products in our history; the broadest geographic reach, 17 offices across the U.S., Canada, London and Europe for us to execute our business from; and the highest number of engaged insurance colleagues across disciplines around the world for making all this happen. We remain encouraged about our progress to date and look forward to enhancing the value of our platform on behalf of all of our constituents into 2019.","Before moving on to the financials, I want to briefly comment on the transformation process we have been executing on over the past several years. As we have discussed on past calls, we have been planning, communicating and executing on a multifaceted strategic plan. This has been an extremely ambitious and challenging effort, but thanks to the incredible work and contributions from our colleagues, we're now poised for continued profitable growth in the future.","The results I just referenced reflect the remarkable turnaround in a relatively short amount of time. We have grown organically and with discipline, one product at a time, one employee at a time, one office location at a time. And we have grown despite the actions accompanying our significant portfolio repositioning. With each new product, new employee, new capability and new location, we have become stronger and more resilient and I believe better as a specialty diversified insurance company.","As a result, Everest Insurance is at an exacting inflection point. With the majority of the transformation work behind us, we recognize there is much more work ahead to achieve our ultimate vision. We are encouraged by the fact that we've built a strong, diversified well-established company within the specialty insurance market.","We now have the full arsenal of tools we sought to attain, people, platforms, products and services, and we will continue building on the foundation we have established to further enhance our competitive position, profitability and growth.","Turning to the financial results. I'll speak mainly to the full year results. I want to start with a comment on the quarter. The fourth quarter registered an outstanding 87.3% combined ratio despite nearly 4 points of pre-tax cat losses attributable predominantly to Hurricane Michael.","We benefited from 12 points of favorable prior year reserve development in the quarter, the second year in a row we have experienced favorable prior year development as a result of our annual reserve review. In summary, it was an excellent quarter.","Year-to-date, we achieved $2.3 billion in gross written premium, representing growth of $191 million or 9% over 2017. On a constant dollar basis, this growth improves to 10%, recognizing the growing contribution of our international operations. Normalizing for the impact of lines the business where deliberate underwriting actions were taken, the growth rate for the full year more than doubles to 21%.","A solid percentage of this growth is emanating from the new businesses and products accepted over the past four years, inclusive of our increasingly relevant Lloyd's operation which equips $150 million in gross written premium in 2018, a 30% increase over 2017. Each of these products and markets chosen for particular risk return characteristics, is playing an increasingly important role in our diversified portfolio.","Our net premiums were $1.7 billion for 2018, an increase of 5% over the prior year period. Net earned premium of $1.6 billion increased by solid $177 million or 12% over 2017. For the full year, the GAAP combined ratio was 95.3%. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, our reported combined ratio improved to 93.3%.","The global insurance operations experienced roughly $33 million of net pre-tax cat losses, a significant improvement over the prior year period. Net favorable prior-year development had a beneficial impact of 3.2 points, reflecting the continued strength of our reserve portfolio. Again, this is the first full year GAAP profit in the last 12 years.","The year-to-date reported loss ratio was 65%, which is a 10-point improvement to 2017's reported loss ratio of 75%. The majority of this difference is attributable to lower cat losses due to various underwriting actions and effective portfolio hedging. The loss ratio, excluding cats, also slightly improved by 14 basis points to 63% despite 70 basis points less of favorable prior year development. Our combined ratio and underlying results continue to improve as a result of the many underwriting initiatives instituted in recent years, and we expect this trend to continue.","The 2018 attritional loss and loss expense ratio also improved by 80 basis points to 66.2% from 67% in 2017. While this is less improvement than we had anticipated, there were several mix changes and prolonged runoff activity that moderated additional improvement. Nonetheless, the trajectory is undeniable and, again, we anticipate continued improvement in 2019.","Turning to expenses. For the full year 2018, the expense ratio was 30.3%, essentially in line with the 29.8% for 2017. We have maintained this steady, and I'll add, competitive, expense ratio even as we have continued to invest in people, infrastructure and technology. With the overall Everest operating discipline in mind, I certainly have my eye in the expense ratio and we will continue to balance future investments with our expectations of profitable premium growth.","At the same time, we see continued investment in the organization as necessary to maintain an expense advantage and we'll continue to thoughtfully invest in the years ahead. We are particularly excited about several investments we have made in new and emerging technologies that are enhancing underwriting insights, creating meaningful operating efficiencies and improving our speed to market, thus enhancing our client value proposition.","Turning to the operating environment. Overall, rate trends over the first three quarters - and these are pure rate, I'm referring to, gained some momentum in the fourth quarter, particularly in the commercial auto, GL and property lines, both in the North America and the London and European markets.","Excluding our workers' compensation and accident and health portfolios, overall pure rate change for the North American P&C insurance operations where the majority of our renewable book resides, was plus 4.6% for 2018. This was up 3.6 points over 2017 and continues a two-year trend where we have experienced positive aggregate rate in the non-worker's compensation lines of business.","Our workers' compensation portfolio continues to experience high single digit rate pressure yet also continues to deliver solid return. Despite the work comp pricing environment, the improvement in overall price trend is evidence of our growing diversification and resiliency across the portfolio. These outcomes were largely anticipated and factored into our pricing and reserving decisions for the year.","To offer some additional color on the overall rate movements across our portfolio, our commercial auto segment continued to receive corrective rate action, a trend that has now persisted for several years.","Overall, we achieved positive rate across this book in 2018, delivering low double digit increases. As for the primary general liability markets, we also achieved slightly positive rate in the fourth quarter of plus 1.3%, while excess casualty picked up some momentum with roughly 2.2% increases, reflecting our predominantly excess oriented book of business.","Internationally, our rate levels also showed signs of improvement, with our Lloyd's operation delivering a positive 3% change across the portfolio. We expect this to continue and to increase in the months ahead. While financial and professional lines rates appeared to be turning the corner and actually improved in the second half of the year, it was not enough to deliver a full year increase.","As for our property book, we achieved healthy and needed rate increases of just over 10%, and we believe this will continue as well. We do anticipate moderately improving operating conditions across our global portfolio throughout 2019, with some pockets lagging this broader trend as they are in need of further corrective rate action. Further, as our retention ratios steadily improve, we anticipate the stronger rate environment to have an increasingly beneficial impact to our results.","In conclusion, we are very pleased with our results in 2018. We are gratified by the progress we have made and feel energized by the results of our strategic plan. We are well-positioned with our chosen markets and we are improving our organization each and every day.","We expect our relevance among our valued clients to continue to grow as we become an increasingly important trading partner to them. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the future calls.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrea for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kai Pan","First to Dom. You have made a lot of changes over the last five years to make Everest Re a more diversified franchise. I wish you the best on your upcoming retirement. So as the Board is searching for your successor, can you give us updates on what kind of characteristics that you're looking in a candidate and - either internally or externally? At the same time, will the Board consider - also consider strategic alternatives?","Dominic Addesso","Thanks, Kai, for your well wishes. And the Board, as you know, is in the process of looking for a successor in my role. And I think the things that the Board and I will be looking for will be obviously strong leadership characteristics, knowledge of our business.","So it's not - can't preclude anything. But it's more than likely it would be somebody that has experience in the space and some tenure in the space. And more than that, I really cannot talk at this time. I think the process as I mentioned is under way, and it would be the classic qualities that you look for in any CEO.","Kai Pan","Will the Board consider - open to strategic alternatives?","Dominic Addesso","We are not - that is not an option that's part of this process. Obviously, that's something that any Board - you have to consider if presented with strategic alternatives. But that is not part of this process.","Kai Pan","And then back to the reinsurance business, the core margin or the attritional combined ratio deteriorated more than 900 basis points year-over-year. I just wonder outside the business mix, any other factor driven that to the 88.7% attritional combined ratio in the fourth quarter? Is it a good run rate going forward? Or we should be looking probably at 84% for the full year?","Dominic Addesso","I will ask Craig to comment on the - on part of this. But let me just begin it by saying that the mix shift is approximately a 2 point impact. And I'll ask Craig to speak to the third point of it.","Craig Howie","Yes. The other point for the year, Kai, is in the fourth quarter we did see about $50 million of reinsurance attritional losses coming through in the fourth quarter. And what that means is what we would call our non-cat cat losses, in other words, weather or events that were less our $10 million catastrophe threshold.","So we did see weather losses, we saw shipyard fires, refinery explosions and other fires, and they occurred around the world, so Canada, the U.K., Australia, Latin America and the U.S. So that, in itself, is about 3 points in the quarter - in the fourth quarter and about 1 point for the year.","Dominic Addesso","And these would be besides events because these would - as you - I think you heard from other market participants, that there has been some frequency of severity if you will in some of these large risk losses. So we think this is - this has been an unusual year and we're not anticipating that going forward. Clearly, we do have an attritional pick for these lines of business but 2018 was particularly a heavy year for some risk losses.","Kai Pan","Just follow-up on that. As you grow your like nonproperty business faster than your property business, which carry higher attritional combined ratio, which means that your - into 2019, will that attritional combined ratio continue to drift higher?","Dominic Addesso","No. I think what we're saying is that what you saw in terms of the drift, about 2 points, is kind of where we think it will settle out there. It could drift a little bit from there. But I think the important point is not so much to focus on the combined ratio but focus on the underwriting margin.","As John Doucette pointed out, we actually increased our underwriting margin by $50 million from $300 million - just over $300 million to $360 million in this last year and so therefore the combined ratio tick-up is offset by still that underwriting - that margin in the combined ratio applying to a higher premium base. So I think that for us - that's what should be - what you should focus on.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker","You might just read my numbers but I think I'm close. I look at your share of the 4Q '18 events at about 3.7% of the industry's loss. And I look at your experience in 3Q of this year and then the second half of last year at being about 1.5% of the industry's loss. Am I reading that correctly, that your exposure on average was twice what it typically has been? And if there's some difference as you switch to a pro rata book? Or is this an exceptional set of circumstances particularly in 4Q where you had outsized exposure?","Dominic Addesso","All right. Let me, without having done any due diligence on your numbers, let me just give you what our view of market share is. Generally, given our scale in the marketplace, on any one event what we've experienced over the last 10 or 15 years has been - and again, on any one event - somewhere between - and it depends on where - somewhere between 2% and 4% of any particular event. And then generally for a particular year plus a series of events, our market share has been 1.3%, 1.2%, somewhere in that range.","And if you look at the results for the '17 events and the '18 events, we are settling in at about 1.3% market share, which is pretty consistent with - if you go a little way back to 2010 and '11 which is - were the two successive years of pretty heavy cat losses, it's very consistent with that. But again, what you're looking at in the fourth quarter I think is in part reflective of where we placed our cat bets.","So for example, Hurricane Michael, we generally are, as you know, a larger writer of Florida cat. And in particular, we have made underwriting decisions that we, in particular, like the exposure in the Panhandle as opposed to - contrast it with Miami and Dade County, for example. And so we have long-standing relationships with many clients who themselves have made bigger bets in that region of Florida.","So as a consequence where that loss happened to hit tended be an area where we have a little bit more concentration. So I don't know if that - hopefully, that answers your question, but couldn't place what you're asking.","Josh Shanker","I think it does to some extent. So if I take that a little further ,one of your competitors last week said they took a rather large lumpy loss in the wildfires. And they said that if we could do it all over again we would still make the same bet again because we think we got paid adequately to take that loss. If I go back in time a year ago, I think you told me and the investment community that the ROE, all things being equal, in the 2018 book was better than the 2017 book. Do you still feel that way? And do you feel that although it didn't work out in '18 you liked the construction of '18 book? Or are there postmortems that you would do differently?","Dominic Addesso","Well, first of all ,there's always postmortems. There's always things you learn from every cat event, OK? But it still holds up that across the entire portfolio, the returns that we had priced in for '18 relative to '17 and frankly for '19 relative to '18 have improved. Now, I guess the real question is - or maybe underlying your question is, whether or not the way we modeled that exposure, the risk, is that's the way it kind of played out.","And I would say, generally for Florida, yes. It just so happened as I mentioned with Hurricane Michael that where that particular storm hit affected us in that way. I do think though that there's probably for the industry things to learn from wildfire exposure.","Notwithstanding the fact that back-to-back wildfire events of those magnitudes have essentially never been seen in the marketplace. So it's not as if history was telling us that it could happen. But I do think in reflection, it's probably fair to say that the models have not adequately addressed the wildfire exposure.","And so therefore I do think that going forward and certainly we have into our '19 portfolio have addressed that in either pricing or scaling back or terms and conditions to more tightly control the wildfires because I think that's the risk that wasn't quite as well understood as certainly wind. Does that answer your question?","Operator","We will now take our next question from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs.","Yaron Kinar","First, as we look at the large non-cat losses, does some of that have to do with the business mix shift into more attritional? Or was that really what you would consider one-offs that would not really be expected to recur?","John Doucette","Good morning. It's John. So I don't think it really has to do with shift. It really has in some ways to do with our definition of catastrophes. So a lot of, in places around the globe, we may have a lot of these - a lot of these deals. We may only get through a certain - a few clients or a certain territory.","And so a lot of times, as Craig said that $50 million may result in where we have $3 million, $5 million, $8 million of losses tied to these things that the industry would think of as catastrophes. How we classify them? We don't call them catastrophes and that's from kind of a process point of view that we want - in terms of we want to have a materiality threshold for what we track as catastrophe.","So I don't think it has to do with the shift in the mix. A lot of the shift in the mix we're talking about is moving to non-property which frankly wouldn't be exposed to these types of losses. And we also saw in addition to what we call the non-cat caps for us below $10 million, there were also some large risk losses in the industry that also people in the industry - other people in the industry may consider them catastrophes. We don't - a single risk loss, we don't consider a catastrophe in how we articulate the cat losses and the attritional losses.","Yaron Kinar","But I thought that the shift to quota share was on just on the casualty side also, on property itself. And if you do shift to pro rata, wouldn't that necessarily mean that you would be exposed to lower layers?","John Doucette","Yes. Absolutely, that should be the case. A lot of the shift that we're talking about is not necessarily taking place in the international space a lot. And one of the things - for the points that you raised, one of the things when we talk about property pro rata premium and increasing that particularly in the U.S. and the places over the last 2017 and '18 where the losses were hit, a lot of our clients - a couple of things. A lot of our clients are looking for capital relief and quota shares, provide them more meaningful capital relief than cap does in terms of de-levering their premium base. And so that's helpful for them.","But we also spend a lot of time as we decide we want to deploy capacity as on a cat basis, property catastrophe excess a loss or in a quota share basis, we'll look at the occurrence limits that are within the proportional treaties that we have. And we watch the occurrence limits very, very carefully and really try to support our current property quota share deals that have very tight occurrence limits so that it becomes less of - less exposed to the issue that you're raising.","Yaron Kinar","And then two quick clarifications, if I can. Dom, you said that the business mix shift account for about 2 points of the combined ratio deterioration in '18. Was that for the full year or for the quarter?","Dominic Addesso","It's a full year comment.","Yaron Kinar","Full year? Okay. And the other clarification was on the 7% cat load target for '19. Is that on a net of reinstatement reinsurance basis with pre-tax?","Craig Howie","Yes. That is net and it's pre-tax and that - correct, not net of reinstatement - net of reinsurance.","Yaron Kinar","Net of reinsurance, not of reinstatements, and pre-tax. Okay. Thank you very much.","Dominic Addesso","And less than 7 points.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research.","Amit Kumar","Maybe just a quick follow-up to Yaron's question. Going back to the 7 points number, I was looking at the older transcripts and I was trying to recall, what was the cat load you were using for 2018 and 2017?","Craig Howie","So for 2018, that number was just below 9 points. And for 2017, that number would have been about 10 points, Amit.","Amit Kumar","So that was what was built in your expectations, not the actual, correct?","Dominic Addesso","Correct. That's correct.","Amit Kumar","The other question I have is in the opening remarks you talked about the reserve study. And I was looking at, I think it's page -- sorry, Page 6 of the supplement, and under the U.S. Reinsurance, the reserve release number is down materially versus the past. Are there any pluses and minuses in that $1.5 million release number? This is Page 6 of 13 in the supplement.","Dominic Addesso","Amit, there's - and I'll ask Craig to see if he has any additional comments, but...","Amit Kumar","Yes.","Dominic Addesso","As I think probably you realize we've mentioned before, there are some 200 different reserve categories or buckets as we call them and there are ups and downs in reserves all the time. I think no meaningful downs that I can cite, and Craig is hoping to add to that. But I will say that I don't know if we're looking at the quarter or the year-to-date, but keep in mind that we did have some reserve adjustments earlier in the year.","So if you look at the complete year, if you look at the positive reserve margins that have come through, and I will also add that there's always going to be variation in the amount of redundancies that perhaps come through - hopefully come through. But I will point out that this would be the seventh year now of positive reserve development across the entire Group.","And I think in any one particular year, it could be up, it could be down. But to me what's most relevant and important is that seven years of positive development. I think that's something we're all very mindful of and frankly proud of. So anyway, Craig, is there anything to add to that?","Craig Howie","Well, what I would add is - just to reiterate what Dom said is that we would look at the total year as opposed to just the fourth quarter. And as Dom said, we strive to carry an adequate reserve position in each one of these reserve segments. And the Company does react quickly to adverse development and takes its time to react to that favorable development and we do continue to hold in more recent years in each one of these segments.","Amit Kumar","So net-net, there wasn't any adverse development which offset the reserve releases, the $1.5 million.","Dominic Addesso","Nothing major that - that would make you say that now.","Amit Kumar","Perfect. That's what was I was looking for. The last question and I will requeue is, I wanted to go back to Josh Shanker's question and I think that is a philosophical question a lot of us have been asking based on the last two years. Did I understand it correctly in your response where I think what you were saying is we've had two years of back-to-back materially higher losses and hence it's less of an Everest Re risk selection issue, it's probably more attributable to how the models responded? And now that you're putting corrective actions into place that takes care of it, is that how - is that what the takeaway should be that had the models responded differently, it would have been...","Dominic Addesso","No, I wasn't. If I - if you thought I said that, I apologize. I think what I was saying is let's think about these two separate buckets. Let's think about the windstorm, in particular Michael. The models in that particular case are reasonable and fairly reliable. In our particular case, because of where we've chosen to put our capacity tends to be more in places like the Panhandle as contrasted with higher exposure in Miami and Dade.","So I don't necessarily believe that that quote unquote required any corrective action. To the extent that I was thinking or you might have heard me think about corrective action, I think it had more to do with the wildfire exposure and the fact that the models are less reliable as it relates to wildfire notwithstanding the fact that this most recent two years of wildfire losses is something we haven't really experienced ever. But I would still contend that the models aren't as reliable.","Therefore, corrective actions that we have taken relative to wildfire is cutting back some rates, terms conditions, sub limit, et cetera. That's the area I thought I was really trying to suggest that quote unquote any corrective actions required.","John Doucette","And, Amit, this is John. I just want to add a little more color to what Dom said. So Dom and I have been here about 10 years. And during that time, we've seen all - different catastrophe losses, and go down the list, the Japanese earthquake, the Thai floods, et cetera, et cetera - Sandy.","In every loss, we learn, we evolve, the industry learns, the industry evolves, we make our models better, we make our underwriting better. I think part of what Dom was alluding to is, also when you think about like the wildfires. The wildfires have been kind of a secondary risk characteristic for the industry.","And we think given the unprecedented losses that have happened over the last two years, that it's going to move not just in the model but also in the buyers, the rating agencies, the board of directors of the clients. They're going to think about this in a different way. We're already hearing some of our clients are looking to increase their limits that they buy. We think that in the future we may see wildfire exposure split out as a different reinsurance program for some people. But it's all that is how these - or how these evolve in how the industry thinks of the risk.","Clearly, there's an elevated view on buyers, sellers, again board of directors, rating agencies, et cetera, about the wildfire risk. And it's not just in California. We also had the Fort McMurray situation in Canada a few years back.","And I think all of this is going to help move this to be more like hurricane and earthquake as a primary loss that people have - a primary loss component that has to be factored in more explicitly, and frankly that the industry has to do a better job in terms of how it thinks about it, how it underwrites it, and terms and conditions in the contracts for that. And that's part of the natural evolution and we think that's frankly healthy for everybody.","Dominic Addesso","So let me add to that too since John brought up a 10-year window just by way of example. I think it's worth a reminder that we manage - particularly because part of our portfolio was cat business, subject to volatility, we manage for the long-term which you have to do when you're thinking about cat exposure which can be nil in any one year, and as we've seen in the past two years, it can be record-setting.","But if you think about the past 10 years where we have clearly cat as a portion of our portfolio and we think about total value creation over the past 10 years, it's been around 11%. We happened to think that's - and by the way that's before pretty hefty years in terms of cat losses. So you had '10 and '11 and of course the last two which were record-setting.","So that 10-year track record I think speaks to how we price our portfolio, how we think about risk, but again managing for the long term. Another little factoid if you will is over the last 10 years, our profits from our cat business on a net basis have been almost $3 billion.","Amit Kumar","That's fascinating. Might I - I know I've exceeded my time. Just only one quick clarification what you just said. What industry loss are you assuming for that 7 points guidance? Thanks.","Dominic Addesso","I'm not sure that you can equate it to an industry loss. I mean, that's an average estimated annual loss.","John Doucette","That's right. So it would be - we don't think of the world like that. We would look at what our gross in that exposures are and look at what we think what the cat loads that are tied to that and then compare it to our overall premium.","So it's really a function of, again, what we're trying to get at as the diversification of the book and how we continue and frankly doing a tremendous job on the insurance side of growing and building the franchise and we see a lot of runway there to continue to do that. And all that will help and has helped us move the overall - the cat load as a percentage and bringing it down.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Brian Meredith from UBS.","Brian Meredith","Just a couple of quick ones here. First one, I'm just curious what was the impact of Mt. Logan's minority interest stuff in the quarter just to the other income line?","Craig Howie","Roughly a $5 million loss, Brian.","Brian Meredith","$5 million? Right. And then what does Mt. Logan's capacity look like for this year? Is it down? Up? What's going to happen with Mt. Logan as we look at 2019?","John Doucette","So, as I - this is John, Brian. So I said in my script, it's up - slightly up year-over-year. So we - it's down slightly from Q3, but then some of the - because of losses, but then some existing investors have added capacity and we have some new investors and continue to diversify the investor base. And so we would expect that to continue go up over time.","But again, that's something that we look at in terms of as kind of our core strategic securitization vehicle. It's something we look at to make sure how it fits in executing our plan, our overall plan. So we'll factor, do we want to take more money or not. All things being equal, we would expect it's up now slightly compared to a year ago. And we would think that it would continue to go up to potentially increase somewhat but it will be market condition dependent.","Craig Howie","Overall, still assets under management, about $1 billion.","John Doucette","It's about $1 billion - about $1.1 billion.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Meyer Shields from Keefe Bruyette & Woods.","Meyer Shields","I'm just trying to clarify. So I apologize for the repetition. But the cat load for 2019, the expected cat load is down 2 points. Should we assume that there is on a year-over-year basis still some upward drift in the combined ratio? Or was that all contained in the full year for 2018?","Dominic Addesso","Well, again, relative '19 versus '18?","Meyer Shields","Yes, '19 versus '18. The cat load is down and you've explained why I think very thoroughly. But I'm just trying to figure out how to model sort of core ex-cat ex-reserve development margins on a year-over-year basis.","Dominic Addesso","So I think what we said before was that we were expecting our attritional given the current mix, the attritional - again, it depends in part to how much premium you put into your model. But, given the same mix, then the 2-point shift as we've seen in '18 over '17 is approximately correct.","Meyer Shields","Okay. So...","Dominic Addesso","Is that what you were asking?","Meyer Shields","I meant to ask you whether there should be another 2 points in 2019 on an expected basis?","Dominic Addesso","No. We're not saying that at all.","Meyer Shields","Second question, and maybe a little bit related, but - I'm trying to understand the timing of a de-risk investment portfolio when you're moving to longer tail lines of business that could probably absorb more short-term volatility.","Craig Howie","Meyer, this is Craig. I think what ended up happening too is partially the de-risking of the portfolio was to take some - overall, just to take some of the public equity portfolio down at the end of the year, just taking some of the risk off the table. Some of the alternatives that we did was because we shifted capital around in the organization for where the capital was needed and where we're writing the business, to match those two components, and because of that we had the opportunity to de-risk some of the portfolio.","As we go forward, we certainly will determine and look at both the duration and the types of business that we have as far as what our portfolio mix will be going forward.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Elyse Greenspan","I have a few questions. My first question, if we go back to some of your comments on the market, you guys like others seem to be a bit more bullish on the midyear renewals. But I think back, cat rates have really disappointed relative to expectations going back to 2006 really, and you guys already said that Logan is seeing more capital this year than last year. So what gives you confidence that the midyear renewals won't disappoint?","John Doucette","Good morning, Elyse. This is John. So we don't have a crystal ball. All we would say is that when it comes midyear, a lot of midyear is really Florida at June 1, and then different places, U.S., China, Australia, Latin America, at July 1. So a lot of it's going to be loss dependent. A lot of it - I mean, Florida market has seen some pretty active years the last several years and there was a lot of increase in development that the clients, the Florida clients had when it came to particularly Irma.","So I think really we don't know what's going to happen, but I do think that what we saw at 01\/01 and we just touched on it briefly is a lot of the alternative capital we think took a pause. There's a lot of things going on, a lot of concern about some of the losses. There's also some investor fatigue when it comes to some of the losses that we're hearing about in the alternative capital. We would note that - we would note that - sorry, we would note that Logan has had some of the best returns in the industry.","So we think that helps our ability and I think the Logan investors buy into access to the - to Everest's global portfolio and underwriting expertise and that helps. But we also had redemptions in Mt. Logan as well. And we think that overall, there have been redemptions in the alternative capital. So I think a lot of alternative capital has looked and said that they need to understand the risks that they're taking better.","And frankly, we're hearing people that are requiring a higher return. That's just healthier. We think that the entire market, the reinsurance, traditional, and alternative market is evolving with some of the hiccups that have happened recently. And we think that just puts the entire market in a better place for getting an appropriate return. What that means and how the rates, we're not sure.","Elyse Greenspan","And then in terms of going back to your cat load of the less than 7 points, is that due to, I guess, lower writing, lower earned premium? I just kind of want to get a sense of if I could look back over the past 10 years, your cat load sits about 12 points. Obviously, that includes some larger loss years, but what's really driving the expected annual loss down in 2019?","Dominic Addesso","The biggest driver of that going down would be our diversification. So growing in the non-cat areas, growing our insurance operation, growing our cash re book, growing our mortgage book, and some slight downward drift in our property exposure. So - but a big piece of that is diversification and we're getting larger. We're getting larger and not increasing cat - in fact, slightly decreasing it. So those two factors together.","Elyse Greenspan","And then your tax rate, you said, I believe, 13%, which seems about higher. I thought in the past we were talking about kind of high single digits if you were in line with your cat load. Is part of that due to a lower level of cat losses expected over this coming year? Or is there something else I'm missing that's driving up your expected tax rate?","Craig Howie","Part of that is lower cats expected, but it's also more capital allocated to the United States and more business expected to be retained in the United States. So you have to apply the higher U.S. tax rate than elsewhere in the world and some of the changes to our internal reinsurance programs as well.","Elyse Greenspan","And then last question. You guys spoke of kind of expanding in the reinsurance side. It seems like property for the most case mixed at 01\/01, but it sounds like you guys saw some opportunities to grow within the casualty and non-property related lines. But premiums written basis, what type of growth - I know you pointed to growth in the first quarter. As you think about the book that you put together, what type of premium growth do you envision for 2019?","Dominic Addesso","We're not really giving out any guidance at this time on premium growth.","Elyse Greenspan","Do you - can you ballpark it? Would it be lower than what you saw over the past year or you just don't want to give any kind of magnitude?","Dominic Addesso","Let me say that on the reinsurance side, percentage growth is sometimes a difficult metric to really rely on. So a large quota share for example, like some of the newer transactions we did in 2018, gives a percentage growth that we may or may not be able to apply into the following year.","So quota shares are kind of lumpy. More reliably would be - would be the insurance growth and since poor Mr. Zaffino over here, I think he is getting a little bit of a complex not being asked a question, maybe he could at least comment on the insurance side as to its growth prospects.","Jonathan Zaffino","Sure. Thanks, Dom. Yes, Elyse, good morning. The view from our perspective is our growth is probably going to return to sort of a stronger than what you saw in the fourth quarter, probably mid-teens level. And remember, if you look at 2018 full calendar year, property is only roughly across the various underwriting divisions about 15%-ish of our premium writing.","So by default, our growth at a mid-teens, high-teens level or the property book that is less than 15% of the total, you'll see even more impact of the diversifying effect Dom is referring to. So we see a lot of opportunities for growth across many different product areas, many different geographies. And as I commented on based on the underlying market conditions, we think it's an opportune time in many areas to pursue that growth.","Dominic Addesso","The only other thing that I could say is that on the reinsurance side, we would anticipate that the growth would be slightly less than what we'd experience in the insurance side, with the caveat that if we come across a large quota share deal and\/or if we reduce participation on an existing quota share deal, those numbers could change from that. I hope that's of help, Elyse, but that's the best we can do.","Elyse Greenspan","50 million of attritional losses, what you define as the non-cat cat losses. That was a Q4 number. Do you have the full year number? Or the other three quarters kind of offset each other?","Dominic Addesso","Could you begin that question again? Because the beginning part of that question cut out on us.","Elyse Greenspan","So you guys - Craig had pointed to I think in response to a question that there was $50 million of non-cat cat losses within the reinsurance segment in the fourth quarter. I was wondering if what the full year number is, like if there were non-cat cat losses for the first three quarters.","Craig Howie","Elyse, this is Craig. You may recall in the first half of the year, so in other words, in the second quarter, we had taken down our accrual for those non-cat losses because we didn't really see anything in the first half of the year that related to our reinsurance book. We didn't touch the insurance book because they are more exposed to some of those smaller events because of the types of business that they write.","But for the reinsurance book, we didn't see any of those major events in the first half of the year. Primarily what we saw were - was this activity that came through later in the year and got booked in the fourth quarter.","Operator","We will now take our last question from Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Rob, dialing for Mike. Just one question. Our reinsurance market participants have talked about substantial retro insurance pricing increases in 2019. Are you seeing that as well? And if yes, how is that going to impact Everest from a financial standpoint?","John Doucette","This is John. So we did see retro prices at 01\/01 increase particularly on loss affected accounts. And how much they increased varied on the client where it's exposed, things like that. To the extent that your question involves our hedging, I'd remind you that we have kind of a multi-product structure duration, tenure in terms of our hedging. Mt. Logan basically stands [indiscernible] pursue with Everest, taking the same rates, terms, condition, pricing that Everest gets but for fees and profit commissions and things like that.","So it will move accordingly. And then when it comes to things like our catastrophe bonds that are put in place on a multiyear basis, that rate was predetermined before the losses. A lot of these catastrophe bonds were put in place before 2017 and '18's events and those - basically the cost of that hedging is basically zero year-over-year since it's fixed pricing over a multiyear basis.","Dominic Addesso","Thank you. I guess that finish with the calls. Let me just close out with some thoughts. I want to thank you for your participation. And as you heard this morning, underlying our results are fundamentally some very positive patterns emerging. I don't mean to be dismissive of cat losses and their impact, but as I mentioned before, a longer-term view including record cat events still reveals total value creation over the long term in the top quartile.","Furthermore, as we've discussed this morning, our diversification efforts will serve to reduce volatility going forward. Our financial strength and resiliency allows us to respond to market conditions and take advantage of what I think are very - some very unique opportunities in both our reinsurance and insurance platforms. Our success in lines of business away from property cat and our now profitable insurance franchise are just the beginning of what I see as a major transformation endeavor.","So thank you again for your participation, and look forward to our conversations over the weeks ahead. Thank you all.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this now concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"8608":["Everest Re Group, Ltd. (NYSE:RE) Q1 2017 Earnings Conference Call April 25, 2017 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Beth Farrell - VP, IR","Dom Addesso - President and CEO","Craig Howie - CFO","John Doucette - President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations","Jon Zaffino - President, North America Insurance Operations","Analysts","Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","Sarah DeWitt - JPMorgan","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Brian Meredith - UBS","Nicholas Mezick - KBW","Operator","Good day everyone, and welcome to the First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call of Everest Re Group. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I will turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Beth, please go ahead.","Beth Farrell","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, our President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, our President of North American Insurance Operations.","Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements.","Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.","Dom Addesso","Thanks, Beth. Good morning to all, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call, and we have a positive report for you today.","Before we dive into the quarterly results, I would like to touch briefly on the characteristics that have helped the Everest Re Group deliver above average returns. Certainly our size and scope are important differentiators, but more critical to our success is the entrepreneurial and decisive culture that permeates our organization. We are not satisfied with the status quo, but instead, continually seek to expand our horizons for new opportunities as well as increase our penetration to existing clients.","Examples of this would be our expansion into credit opportunities in both our Reinsurance and Insurance businesses. And just this quarter, we participated on the new National Flood Reinsurance Program which represents new business to the market. As governments seek to privatize certain markets, we could see similar additional opportunity. So why is this important? These new market segments allow us to continue to diversify our portfolio away from the more competitive markets and sustain underwriting profitability. This, and a constant focus on expenses, and our expanding use of capital market tools explains why we continue to outperform the market. This now leads me to our discussion on results, which again were quite positive for the quarter.","Operating income increased 17% in the quarter to $260 million, giving rise to $6.29 in earnings per share, and a 13% operating ROE for the quarter. The increase in earnings is a result of an increase in both the underwriting and investment income. Furthermore, the underwriting result improved in both the Reinsurance and Insurance division. While our reinsurance combined ratio was up slightly over the prior year, due to a relatively minor increase in cash, the increase in earned premium propelled us to a higher underwriting result.","Increase in earned premium is a continuing result of broadening our reinsurance product set over the last several quarters into crop, mortgage, and other credit-related opportunity. Entering into credit-related business has contributed to the almost one-point improvement in quarter's attritional combined ratio, 80%. John Doucette will discuss this in greater detail in his Reinsurance operations.","The Insurance segment results improved year-over-year to an underwriting gain position. This was in part a result of the drag in the prior year from the crop operation that we sold late last year. Excluding the Heartland crop business, the attritional combined ratio of 98.1 for the quarter reflects a stable loss ratio, but an uptick in the commission and operating expense ratio. The commission ratio was up on a changing business mix, while operating expenses are trending as planned.","We continue to build out the North America and European platforms, and have had great success with gross premiums written up 21% in the quarter excluding crop. Expenses are still outpacing earned premium thereby putting pressure on the expense ratio. But we would expect this to stabilize as the operation matures. However, despite this more elevated expense ratio, you will find that by comparison we are still quite efficient relative to the market. We are pleased with what the team has accomplished in a relatively short timeframe, which was aided in part by the market dislocation created by a few large players. In fact, given the opportunities presented by this market turmoil, we accelerated our investment in the operation. You will hear more details on all this later in Jon Zaffino's operations report.","Another strong spot this quarter was investment income, which increased approximately $20 million. Our alternative portfolio accounted for some of that improvement, along with a higher asset base. Our strategy here is not much different than the fundamentals principles we use in our total business, conservative yet look for differentiated opportunities that provide good margins relative to risk. As a result, our overall portfolio has a beta of less than one, but yet our returns have been in the upper quartile relative to our peer group. Overall, we continue our optimism in our ability to not only outperform, but also provide above-market returns through the cycle.","I maintain that optimism because of, as I referenced earlier, the well-diversified platform we have built, but perhaps more importantly because of our adaptability to market changes and opportunities. That comes from a corporate culture that embraces new opportunities, and that has the skilled talent to execute. You will hear more about our newest initiatives from my colleagues and how we continue to build our franchise for the future. Thank you and I look forward to your questions later on.","Now to Craig, for the financial report.","Craig Howie","Thank you, Dom, and good morning everyone. Everest had another solid quarter of earnings, with net income of $292 million for the first quarter of 2017. This compares to net income of $172 million for the first quarter of 2016. The 2017 result represents an annualized net income return on equity of over 14%.","Net income included $32 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $51 million of capital losses in the first quarter of last year. 2017 capital gains were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio. After-tax operating income for the first quarter was $260 million compared to $223 million in 2016. The overall underlying gain for the group was $183 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $171 million in the same period last year all segments reported underwriting gains for the quarter.","In the first quarter of 2017, Everest saw $20 million of current year catastrophe losses related to Cyclone Debbie in Australia compared to $10 million of catastrophe losses during the first quarter of 2016. The overall current year attritional combined ratio was 84.5% down from 85.3% in the first quarter of 2016 primarily due to a lower commission ratio in 2017. Our overall expense ratio of 5.8% was down slightly from the first quarter of 2016.","Our reported combined ratio of 86% was flat compared to the first quarter last year. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $122 million for the quarter on our $18 billion investment portfolio. Investment income was 19% above last year; this result was primarily driven by an increase of limited partnership income which was up $17 million from the first quarter of 2016 primarily due to the turnaround in energy related investments compared to last year. Pre-tax year on the overall portfolio was 2.8% with the duration of just over three years.","Foreign exchanges reported another income, for the first quarter of 2017 foreign exchange losses were $4 million similar to the first quarter of 2016. Other income also included $2 million of earnings and fees from Mt. Logan Re compared to $3 million of income in the first quarter of last year.","On income taxes, the 9% effective tax rate on operating income was on the low end of our expected range for the year. First quarter of 2017 tax rate is slightly lower than the 10% tax rate for the full year of 2016 due to a $5 million tax benefit for a size B tax accounting change related to share based compensation. Previously these tax benefits were book through additional paid in capital in the balance sheet. The effective tax rate is an annualized calculation that includes plan to Catastrophe losses for the rest of the year should catastrophe was coming lower than this estimate it would be expected that the tax rate would go up.","Stable cash flows continues with operating cash flows of $382 million for the quarter compared with $375 million in the first quarter of 2016. Shareholders' equity for the group was $8.3 billion at the end of the first quarter up $272 million from year end 2016. This is after taking into account the capital return for $51 million of dividends period in the first quarter of 2017. Capital position remains very strong and continues to grow.","Thank you and now John Doucette will provide a review of the Reinsurance operation.","John Doucette","Thank you, Craig. Good morning. We are pleased to report another strong quarter with a $178 million of reinsurance underwriting profit. Our earnings reflect the continued strength of our reinsurance franchise the stain by product and geographic diversification, underwriting discipline and ultimately relevance to our client. Everest long standing global presence high ratings and nimble execution underpin our outperformance through this part of the underwriting cycle.","Before discussing renewals, here's some color on the first quarter results. Total gross written premium for the first quarter was $1.2 billion an increase of 19% compared to Q1, 2016. There were a combination of growth on existing business and new business opportunities. This included $53 million of crop premium on the new quarter share arrangement done in conjunction with the sale of Heartland as well as new structured reinsurance business. The growth in these profitable, diversifying, and strategic line, fortifies our competitive strength in an otherwise difficult market.","Additionally, these customized transactions require a differentiating breath and skill from a sizeable and strong partner. Our agility in executing these bespoke transactions is highly valued by our clients, and accomplished to attracting best-in-class underwriting actuarial and analytical talent and providing them appropriate resources within a lean and responsive organization conducive to creative solution.","The Q1 loss ratio increased from 55.6% to 53.2% in Q1 2016, driven in part by an increase in the cat loss ratio with losses in Cyclone Debbie impacting the quarter. In addition, the quarter experienced lower favorable prior year loss development and an uptick in the current year attritional loss ratio. The shift in the composition of our book to the higher expected loss ratio on a new crop business accounted for the slight increase in our attritional loss ratio.","In our U.S. reinsurance segment, Q1 2017 gross written premium was up 8% to $579 million. Growth was driven by crop and credit related reinsurance writing, offset by a 9% decrease in property line as we walked away from underpriced pro rata business. The Q1 combined ratio for the U.S. reinsurance segment was up 3.1 point, affected by the new crop writing with a higher attritional loss ratio and non-catastrophe weather-related losses. This was partially offset by a lower commission ratio. Although the crop writing produced higher combined ratios, they consumed relatively little capital.","Our international reinsurance segment, premium was $266 million, up 13% for the quarter and up 8% on a constant dollar basis. We saw growth across most of our territories: Middle East, Africa, Latin America, Singapore, and Canada. Increased property pro rata business and some higher cat XOL business, particularly in loss-affected region coupled with our growth in our worldwide facultative operation provided for this growth; the combined ratio for this segment improved by 1.1 point to 86.6% despite higher cat losses and lower level of reserve release. This was due to an almost 6 point improvement in the attritional loss ratio, driven by better experience in certain region and a lower mix of casualty pro rata business.","Our Bermuda segment written premium increased 57% to $321 million, about 61% on a constant dollar basis. The growth was largely from new business including new credit opportunities and account true ups on financial line treaty. In addition, premium growth also came from both London and Europe, including motor quota shares and new strategic reinsurance deals with large core global client. The combined ratio improved to 83.5% with a lower current year attritional loss ratio, no prior year reserve development, and a lower expense ratio.","Moving on to the 4\/1 renewals; Everest is well positioned in a market that appears to be stabilizing. Rate pressures continue but are showing signs of moderating, as ample capacity is partially offset by increase in demand in some zones. In the Asia-Pacific market, renewal rate in loss-affected area such as New Zealand were up an average of 5% with rates in a range of flat to down 10% in other areas. Japanese renewal decreases were more moderate at flat to down 5%.","In the U.S. property markets, excessive loss rates were flat to down 5% with indications that some early 6\/1 renewals will be flat. We are expecting incremental Florida demand fostering some market stability, but this could be somewhat offset by decreased purchasing by citizen. As Dom mentioned, we did participate on the new National Flood Program that came to the market and we are exploring other potential opportunities around flood coverage.","In our casualty book, reinsurance rates, terms and conditions are stable but reductions on underlying business continue, put pressure on overall economic. Nevertheless, we were able to reallocate our capital to more favorable opportunities, and we see some improvement in certain facultative lines.","Internationally, some of the recent currency movements have allowed foreign-based competitors to report accounting gains, softening the otherwise REIT profitability across major classes and delaying market stabilization. However, rate decreases were smaller than in prior renewal.","In the U.K, augment rate change which has affected the UK model market has caused the market disruption with treaties being extended as insurers reassess their strategy. Large rate increases and program restructurings have been the norm on affected motor programs. Throughout the world, our clients demand multi-faceted solutions commensurate with their expanding scope, complex capital requirements and unique demand. Our clients clearly want to trade with reinsurers like Everest that offers scale, expertise, and a sustainable franchise.","We just completed our latest cap fund transaction with the issuance of $1.25 billion of Kilimanjaro 2 catastrophe bond. That brings our total catastrophe bond capacity to $2.8 billion, which in conjunction with Mt. Logan and our balance sheet elevates every total capacity and capital across those rated and unrated balance sheets to almost $13 billion. This place is among the very largest reinsurers in the industry making us even more relevant to our clients and brokers.","Overall, Everest Reinsurance operations remain well-positioned and diversified by product, distribution, geography, client, and capital, giving us numerous levers to control our market efficiency and effectiveness. We continually enhance our strategic focus to succeed in the new reinsurance world order. Thank you. And now, I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations.","Jon Zaffino","Thank you, John, and good morning. The Everest Global Insurance operations performed well and in line with our expectations in the first quarter. Many strategic actions we have taken will establish a world-class specialty diversified insurance organization by becoming increasing evident in our results; they consistently expand in top line across a balance portfolio, a testament to the relevant we are achieving among our insurance and brokers.","We continue applying opportunities to profitably expand our business across our global platform despite a challenging market environment. As a result, Everest Insurance is firmly positioned in the market landscape as a specialty provider offering a live breadth of product solutions in lines of business that we expect to outperform over the long-term. As in prior quarters, due to the divestiture of Heartland in late third quarter of 2016, I will be discussing our comparative results, excluding this business. For the first quarter of 2017, the Global Insurance operations registered $434 million in gross written premium, an increase of $75 million or 21% over first quarter of 2016.","Another outstanding result and consistent with the growth rate we saw in 4Q 2016; this represents the ninth consecutive quarter of growth for our Global Insurance Operation, each division within the North American segment contributed to this with notable strong performances from our Canadian and accident and health platforms. Each of which grew in excess of 30%.","A further note, roughly 18% of our production in the quarter was derived from our recent new business launches and from our Lloyd's operation, which as you will recall has entered only second year of account. We remain encouraged by this balanced contribution across the diversity of our growing underwriting platform.","Net written premiums for the quarter were $346 million, an increase of $37 million or 12% over 2016. As we've shared in the past, net written premium growth slightly lags gross written premium growth due to the marginally more conservative reinsurance position we have taken to support our many new underwriting divisions. There were notable transactions in the quarter particularly within our teenage group that also contributed to a slightly lower net to gross ratio. We expect this to normalize throughout the year. Net earned premium in the quarter increased by more in line with our gross written premium on a percentage basis producing $323 million, which represents 17% growth from the first quarter of 2016.","Turning to the combined ratio, the GAAP combined ratio for the first quarter was 98.4%. While we are pleased to produce and underwriting profit with more than 5 million in the segment, we expect to show continued improvement as earned from new develops in future quarters. The overall loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for the Global Insurance Operations remained essentially flat year-over-year registering a 68.25 in the first quarter of 2017 were 68.1% in the first quarter of 2016. On a nutritional basis, these ratios improved 67.8% and our flat period-over-period.","Let me offer a couple of additional comments to further amplify our performance. First, for the 1Q '16 and 1Q '17 had unprecedented levels of connectivity in the U.S. with 12 PCS events declared in first quarter of this year. Despite this our book is performing well, our conservative loss estimates for our US property lines coupled with a series of deliberate underwriting actions taken over the past several quarters are largely mitigated the impact of these events to us. Second as earned premium comes in on several of our new business launches referenced earlier, which have historically generated better combine ratios, we expect the shipping portfolio mix will result in improved overall profitability.","Again the bottom-line, we expect improvement in the underlying loss ratios as we move through the year. Our expense ratio in the first quarter was 30.3% up when compared to 28.2% in the first quarter of 2016 were essentially in line with the full year 2016 results up 29.9%. The changed first quarter of 2016 represents roughly a one point increase in our commission in premium tax expenses and a one point increase in our operating expenses. There remained moderate pressure on our expense ratio due to the continued organic build of our operation along with the impact from the lag of earned premium. We anticipate the expense ratio to moderate and stabilize as we continue on our growth path. As Dom mentioned an expense ratio of roughly 30% remains very competitive in the Specialty Insurance segment.","I'll now turn to the performance of our major insurance portfolios starting with the North America P&C book which is our largest business. In the first quarter, the core P&C portfolio grew 15% or $353 million over the prior year period. They continue to gain momentum across the breadth of our specialty P&C operations headlining the quarter were a continued steady growth from our new business initiatives, which represented 17% of our total premium production in the quarter; the highest level we have experienced today.","The continued addition of outstanding talents supports our strategy across underwriting claims technology, actuarial and several support areas. And the announcement of a portfolio transaction, we consummated to effectively acquire renewal rates to a direct and facultative book of property business. This book of business closely aligned with our own appetite newly into our property expansion strategy, and we are pleased to welcome several new talents and underwriters to the Everest family.","Our assets in health group also delivered an excellent quarter of growth, with a 38% increase over the prior year comparable quarter. Our continued efforts to thoughtfully diversify and grow our product lines, including medical stop loss continue to prove successful. Notably in the quarter, several of our new A&H products, particularly our sports visibility offering also contributed meaningfully to growth. We expect we will continue to find opportunities across the balance book of A&H business as the year progresses.","Our Lloyd's operation also continued its expansion. The Syndicate contributed $21 million to the insurance growth in the quarter, nearly double the contribution from 4Q 2016. All lines of business ranging from our property through our professional indemnity books experienced growth despite a challenging rate environment. We remain deliberate in our growth pursuits and are finding opportunities for continued expansion.","Turning to the operating environment, the first quarter represented a predictably mixed picture from a rate perspective. The overall level of rate change varies meaningfully my major line of business. As a general statement across the entirety of the North American portfolio, I would say that rate pressures are somewhat mitigating. In fact, we have many lines of business that are gaining rate across our book. Let's take a look at this my major line of business. Commercial Auto again headlined our rate change results in the first quarter, as it has in several prior quarters. We continue to achieve high single to low double-digit rate changes for this line of business. Again, our exposure to this line is limited as it continues to represent less than 5% of our overall writings.","Also, as in prior quarters, the primarily general liability and umbrella markets continue to remain in the tight range and are basically flat year-over-year. The professional liability markets remain competitive with continued rate pressures in the mid single-digit range across various lines. We continue to take a conservative posture in this market. Of particular interest to us is the broader attention to rate in terms being exhibited in the U.S. property market, while capacity remains plentiful, the market continues to find the bottom. Directional price changes month-by-month are recognizing this reality. 12 PCS convective storm cat events in the first quarter, a record for insured losses, on top of last year's prior record quarter should add momentum to this price action. As we noted last quarter, we feel there is a larger positive story emerging that will allow us to selectively expand our portfolio.","Finally, workers' compensation, our largest line of business, continued to experience moderate rate pressure in the low to mid single-digit range on the back of continued favorable underwriting results. While not an unexpected result, there is still an opportunity to consider new business in certain select territories as we closely monitor the many trends across this line. So, while the rate environment is trending predictably line by line, the overall rate picture is improving across the entirety of our portfolio.","In conclusion, we are pleased with our start to the year. Our team continues to execute very well against the major strategic objectives within our organic growth plan. As a result, our market brand and capabilities continue to grow. The Annual RIMS Conference, which is underway as we speak, is reaffirming our belief in the Everest insurance value proposition. Based on the client interaction and meeting schedules of our colleagues in attendance, it is clear we are being embraced by a growing range of brokers and insurers alike. We look forward to continuing our momentum and reporting back to you on our progress next quarter.","With that, let me turn it back over to Beth for q-and-a.","Beth Farrell","Thank you, Jon. That ends our prepared remarks. I'd like to open up for the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question today from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning. My first question, I was hoping just to get a little bit more color. You guys saw exceptional growth in your reinsurance business to start the year. I know lots of moving parts with the crop, some growth in credit, and then also in other geographies outside of the U.S., but when you kind of blend your market outlook together, how do you really see the growth trajectory over the remaining three quarters. And just a question in relation to the Q1, is any of the premium growth that you saw kind of one-time in nature or are there any multi-year covers included within the strong growth you saw in the first quarter?","John Doucette","Good morning, Elyse. It's John, and thanks for the question. So, I think there were some one-off parts to the growth in the reinsurance operation. As we mentioned, there were some true ups, but there is also a combination of growth in the mortgage and credit lines. Some of those are new deals, and some of those are multi-year deals where we're continuing to get premium from prior quarters. So we would think a normalized growth rate would be high single-digit.","Elyse Greenspan","And do you think that high single-digit is something that's sustainable over the balance of 2017 based on how you see the market right now?","John Doucette","We do. We do think that -- I mean, there's a lot of gives and takes in that, but we continue to see new opportunities. There's places where we're coming off business that we don't think is attractive, but at the same time we continue to find new opportunities, both -- we talked about the motor quota shares in Europe tied to Solvency II. Also, in the U.K. motor market there's opportunities. But then also in the mortgage and the credit and one-off structured deals that we have in the pipeline now.","Dom Addesso","And this is Dom. I mean, it's also highly dependant upon June 1. So while we have had lots of new opportunities and growth in new areas, new types of products that we're offering, in particular credit, but depending on what happens with rates is just one; it's still yet to be determined. So hard to predict some sustainability to our growth rate, and we don't yet know what June 1 will be offering us.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. You guys [indiscernible] loss, did you guys have any adverse development associated with the change in the rate there?","Dom Addesso","The [indiscernible] loss, the prior period event, and that was covered in our prior year-end reserve position. And it's a kind of thing that though not specifically known at prior years, the kind of thing our reserve analysis contemplates for things that can go wrong. So it's completely covered in that reserve position. We estimate that with the current discount rate that they're applying up to $30 million was the impact.","Elyse Greenspan","And that's included in how your reserves are set today?","Dom Addesso","Yes, absolutely.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then in terms of capital return, there was no share repurchase in the quarter. I know we also saw a slowdown at the end of 2016. When you guys are thinking through capital return right now, how do you kind of balance just the growth opportunities that you're seeing in reinsurance as well as insurance? And then just also where your staff is obviously trading at a higher valuation, so can you just update us on your thought process for the first quarter, as well as when you think about capital return over the balance of 2017.","Dom Addesso","Sometimes I feel like a broken record on this one. As you know, we do not give any predictions as to what we will be doing in terms of share repurchases. But relative to the first quarter how we were thinking about it was that, as you did see, we had significant growth. So we remained a little bit more cautious on capital return, to the point of not buying in any shares. This coupled with the fact that we had a number of cat events that were potentially swirling out, surround [ph] out there. So that was part of our deliberations. And then the third, I think that you made reference to of course, was our rise in stock price. While in and of itself and by itself not a sole determinant, but along with the other factors led us to not be purchasing any shares back in the first question. And none of that means that we won't be back into the market throughout the year. But again, it has to be balanced up against events are the occurring in the marketplace as well as our premium growth trajectory.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thanks so much, and congrats on a great start to the year.","Dom Addesso","Thank you, Elyse.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning. And so first question on the insurance side. What do you think are your competitive advantages that you can grow in this -- like a more changing market condition, at the same time improving your core or your combined ratio towards your 95%, like maybe long-term target? How soon do you think you can get there?","Jon Zaffino","Good morning, Kai, this is Jon. I think our competitive position in the market is quite strong. And think sits on the backs of we are obviously trading with the benefit of a significant balance sheet from the Everest Group, which credentials exceedingly well in a number of our chosen markets. We have been able to amass what we feel is very distinguished talent, taking advantage of the dislocation in the market over the past couple of years. And remember, our insurance platform has been around for a while, so we have a pretty good reach in terms of different market segments, different product lines, et cetera. So as we refined our strategy and focused on the areas that we thought would contribute more to our bottom line and also help us increase our relevance with clients by providing solutions. We're now starting to see the momentum of all those actions take hold.","So that's been very encouraging. As for why we feel that's going to produce better results, there's a lot of changes. So to borrow John's comment earlier, there's a lot of ins and outs here, lot of different mix scenarios coming in. Our new businesses tend to trend at a lower ELR, expected loss ratios, than we've had in the past. So as those gain more scale, as we exit certain lines, such as our crop operation which is better handled in our reinsurance side, as we deemphasize a couple of other areas that had higher loss ratios, we expect that combination and mix to produce better performance that we've seen historically.","Dom Addesso","And I think in part, Kai, to answer that, the -- a little bit of market disruption along with, as Jonathan pointed out, the significant capital base that is attractive to our clients and brokers, but that market disruption again allowed us to get very capable people, but also as other competitors were reevaluating their strategies, that enabled us to grow certain segments faster than we might otherwise would've been able to do.","Kai Pan","And do you see yourself can get down to the mid-90's combined ratio next couple of years?","Dom Addesso","Well, one interesting point that we shouldn't gloss over is that the first quarter, while none of the events -- the weather events, catastrophes if you will, PCI events that Jonathan referenced, while none of them reached our threshold for declaring them to be cats, nonetheless, we had $15 million of weather losses in the first quarter of the insurance operations, which amounts to four-and-a-half points in the combined ratio for the insurance results. So as you could see, we're pretty much already where you're referencing.","Kai Pan","Okay, that's great. My second question is on the reinsurance side. So I just wonder, is there any seasonality because now you have the crop reinsurance in the U.S. reinsurance book. That would impact your second quarter and third quarter year-over-year comparison in term of the core combined ratio.","John Doucette","Hi, Kai, it's John. There isn't that much seasonality. And crop, while it's a new piece given the move from the insurance to the reinsurance, in the grand scheme of things it's relatively small across the overall global portfolio for the reinsurance operations. So I would say, no, there's not really much seasonality.","Kai Pan","So the fourth quarter and the first quarter results should be a good indication for the coming two quarters?","Dom Addesso","You're talking in terms of loss ratio?","Kai Pan","Yes, just the overall, the core combined ratio, attritional combined ratio, because there are probably different mix between loss and, like, commission expenses.","Dom Addesso","Yes, that doesn't move around all that much because from quarter to quarter based on our pegged loss ratios. Obviously, when we get to the fourth quarter we have our reserve here, and reserve review which could impact the attritional in that quarter. I don't know that you'd refer to that as a seasonality, but our earned premium is earned ratably through the year, and we book a consistent estimated loss ratio absent any [indiscernible] type events.","Kai Pan","Great. Just quick number clarification, there it's $30 million Ogden [ph] rate impact, is that already including in this quarter reserve development, or in the fourth quarter one? You said year-end [technical difficulty] reserve\u2026","Dom Addesso","What I was referencing was that the impact of Ogden in terms of a dollar amount wasn't made known of course until the first quarter. But what I was referencing was that we consider that to be a prior-year event which was more than covered in our year-end reserve review. While not specifically of course an item in the year-end reserve review just like many other discrete events that occur many quarters or years later frankly when you look at reserves pointing this is that our reserve review contemplates the fact that things can go wrong, things can happen, but you cannot specifically identify what they might be. So, our reserve review has a certain amount of conservatism built into it, or I would describe as a fact that the point of the reserve review as an unknown event and we have been in situation it was prior year event for us and well within the balance of being covered in our year-end reserve review contemplations.","Kai Pan","It's great. Well, thank you so much for all the answers.","Dom Addesso","Thank you, Kai.","Operator","We will take our next question from Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan.","Sarah DeWitt","Hi, good morning. In the Reinsurance segment, I was surprised with the underlying combined ratio improved year-over-year in what is still competitive market, can you talk about how you're achieving this and how sustainable is that going forward?","Dom Addesso","The simple answer is, Sarah, is just the changing mix, so as for example as mortgage and other credit related opportunities as that premium begins to flow through the books that carriers a lower loss ratio, combined ratio than which you would think about as the more traditional lines. That's frankly the simplest example of explanation. We will also have quota share coming into the reinsurance book, which also helps maintain that ratio.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay, great. And then just a couple of numbers questions, how much did the crop Reinsurance transaction contribute to the top line and then how much is your mortgage and credit business?","Dom Addesso","Crop was about $50 million.","Craig Howie","Yes, $53 million in the first quarter.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay. And how big is the mortgage and credit business?","Craig Howie","And the total mortgage of gross written premiums, it's about $150 million to $200 million.","Sarah DeWitt","Annually?","Craig Howie","In the quarter.","Dom Addesso","Sorry could you say that again?","Sarah DeWitt","That's an annual number or in the quarter?","Dom Addesso","Yes, that's annual.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay, great thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb","Thanks and good morning. My first question is on the outlook for the, the midyear Florida renewals where I believe you said hoping for flat rates I think it's pretty well understood that citizens insurance capacities can be down midyear in terms of demand for reinsurance protection but I just wanted understand if I have you correctly are you saying demand from other primary writers in Florida is going to enough to offset that. ","Dom Addesso","Well citizen is down because private market as soon much of that exposure so capacity will be soft from private market.","Jay Gelb","Okay, is there any influence do you think it midyear as a result of Matthew.","Craig Howie","We hope we think that there could be some influence but that all dependence on how much capital has been go into the market so look, based on the returns that the industry is producing on overall capital. We do you think it, it suggest that that rate should be in flat but there's no way for us to know what that might be right now.","John Doucette","This is John. There's also other contributing factors with AOB issue that's out there and that impacted people in 2016 including the capital position. The assignment of benefits, so the assignment of benefits issue that happened in that has been happening that has resulted in an increase in the attritional loss ratio for many of the Florida teams and so some of them had to go get more capital or in the process of getting more capital or raising more capital and as reinsurance is the form of capital. And so a lot of them are potentially looking to increase their buys whether it comes, whether that's on a quota share or on an excess loss basis, as well as some of the larger Florida seasons have also been diversifying outside the state, so as they've been growing, they have natural exposure growth for their overall books of business, their reinsurance demands to protect that book have also been increasing and we would see that to directionally to continue.","Jay Gelb","That is helpful, thanks very much. And then my separate question, Dom, in this year's annual shareholder letter, you talked about the decision to build in the Insurance segment as opposed to buy I'm kind of glad you brought that up in the letter hopefully it's pretty good jumping off point just to touch on it in a bit more detail.","Dom Addesso","That was specific question.","Jay Gelb","Yes, just in terms of -- in terms of that decision and kind of where you see the insurance segment going forward?","Dom Addesso","We have had this view for long time and it's not because we haven't considered opportunities that are out there and our view was based on the fact that integration since we had an existing operation as contrasted with not having one at all, we felt it was easier for us to grow our existing franchise. In the phase of acquisitions are tough because the integration issues are challenged in addition you're not quite sure talent that you're getting, the legacy issues that you might be attaining, there is a whole different face to the market in terms of how a particular company might be presenting itself to the distribution partners, they will have ability to kind of build our message, or culture or products or appetite all those things from the ground up is more attractive to us.","And then, of course, it coupled with many of these acquisitions as you know are occurring at tremendous multiples creating lot of goodwill but that aside we are potentially buying businesses that have mid-single digit ROEs that is not and I'm paying a premium for that, that's not all that attractive. And what we think we have done here in the short years has been too we're still in the legacy issues that we've had but you think the current enforce portfolio as I mentioned before. Absent the weather losses as already we had in the first quarter as already in the low to mid single 90s combined ratio so, I think our strategy there is proving to be so far so good one.","Jay Gelb","And a final one, if I can, the reinsurance performance in the first quarter was incredibly strong especially taking to account it was a worst first quarter for catastrophe losses in the U.S. in over 20 years, is that -- can you talk a little about whether that's risk management program structure primary companies just retaining more exposure, or what -- how come we didn't see more that impact on Everest results on the Reinsurance side?","Dom Addesso","There wasn't one event right was many events which for the most part has fallen on within company retentions along with the fact that as we've mentioned each quarter for many quarters now we keep, we tend to keep moving up our attachment point there is a most competitive part of the market has been down low. And so, and it have been spreading our aggregate, so we have been diversifying our cap portfolio slightly moving up attachment point coupled with the fact that many scenes as their capital base is going to continue to retain more so it's all of those things not any one of them, but it's all of those things come into play.","Jay Gelb","Thank you again.","Dom Addesso","Thank you, Jay.","Operator","We'll go next to Joshua Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua Shanker","Yes, thank you. Can I start with mortgage reinsurance, for a second? I want to know how you think about catastrophe risk versus mortgage reinsurance risk, is it similar and whatever remodeling in terms of its exposure to a mortgage catastrophe, and to how much business is there to be written out, there what's going to cause mortgage insurers want to see that risk in the future?","John Doucette","Good morning, Josh. It's John. So, couple of things, so we have then as we've talked about on the last several calls focused on the mortgage opportunity within a broader credit play that we are doing, but mortgage is a meaningful part of that. And we do see -- so we have focus on that both in the underwriting side but also and arguably more importantly building out underwriting capabilities, analytical capabilities, ERM risk and very technical capabilities for us to be able to think about that really to get it -- to bring it up to the level of, which it has, we have done to the level of how have been moved to best-in-class over the last several years in the property side.","So, in terms of how we think about to model it, we look at it from at the macro macro level and how it overlaps in intersection correlates with our asset portfolio. We think about it on an overall economic capital model to the group. We look at it on a realistic disaster scenario. We look at it as total limits that we deploy. We think about across years the correlation and the aggregation that can happen and really try to focus on what the economic situation is today and where we think it will be in the future so to determine how we want to play, where what attachment points we want to play at, how that would impact if something like the financial crisis of 2008 happen again, how that could perform.","Joshua Shankar","So, along those lines, is it normal think that sometime in the next decade, there will be a mortgage ad event? And is there a way to have that occur and avoid the loss of the underwriting?","John Doucette","Well, we have no idea if a loss is going to happen just like we don't know if catastrophe loss is going to happen. We\u2026","Joshua Shankar","I can promise you a catastrophe loss will happen in the next 10 years. I am certain of that.","John Doucette","I am going to write that down. So -- but we -- we're going to build a book and have an underwriting strategy that we think will succeed based on underwriting conditions, macroeconomic conditions, pricing conditions, and we're going to adjust the book. And that's our job. That's Dom and mine and the rest of the team's job to do that to react and how we think the book will best move going forward. But we do \u2013- we certainly manage to idea that a loss could happen and try to think of limits deployed and capital required in that context.","Dom Addesso","And it's also -- keep in mind that it's -- we tend to agree with you that you have to consider the fact that a loss can happen but it's also where you attach, how diversified you are. There is many factors which go into what the level of loss might be. And from a realistic disaster scenario perspective, the exposure that we have to the mortgage base is relative to property cat risk is much less and of course also relative to our capital, it's pretty small.","Joshua Shankar","And then I guess one more, can we expect that if you've done your homework correctly, a well-run mortgage rebook should outperform primary mortgage book?","John Doucette","I think the strength -- advantages and disadvantages of both clearly from a -- we have decided to make a reinsurance bet on it. And that gives us the benefit of hard dollar limits, that gives us the benefit of retentions, that gives us the benefit of having a compared to running an insurance operation far less resources, both capital and people wise. So, it gives us more ability to navigate the underwriting market, market cycle that could happen. So we feel like -- we feel pretty good about how we're deploying capacity and capital and our underwriting strategy and will be able to hopefully expand it if the market - the pricing and the market conditions allow but also be in a position to dial it back if we don't think we are getting paid a good risk adjusted return.","Joshua Shankar","And then quickly for Jon Zaffino, I want to know how he thinks about one, three, five-year plan? When you started like at the beginning of '15, did you have a three-year plan? Do you have a five-year plan? Wouldn't you sort of in the check points to note that the insurance business is performing in line with sort of the predicted plan on how to get this be important part of Everest Re?","Jon Zaffino","Sure, Josh. We have very much phased out a deliberate roadmap that aligns with what Dom mentioned before about an organic growth plan. What does that look like? What are the key milestones along that journey and how do we get there? So, certainly for us there was a few prominent themes in that process. Number one was sort of foundationally preparing the organization for that journey which is an ongoing everyday type of exercise. Certainly looking to enhance our market relevance in the form of people and products and distribution connectivity has also been very much a part of that. And then, certainly along the path we are going to make portfolio selection along the way.","A lot of that work has been at the forefront of our activity in the last several quarters if not year and a half or so. But remember, we are still adding talent as we go here to make sure that we continue keep up with our growth and aspiration. So that's ongoing work. So I would say that we're very much on track. We're going to follow market opportunity where it presents itself. We don't have a sort of hard dollar specific target in mind other than we certainly see a lot of growth opportunity that we want to pursue in our chosen markets. But certainly looking to foundation prepare, refine our operations, add the talent, increase the relevance. There is a lot of work going on day to day which the tactical activity that drives success on the insurance side that we're working hard at across the board.","Joshua Shankar","Well, thank you for all the answers and I appreciate the extra time.","Dom Addesso","Thank you, Joshua.","Operator","We will go next Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith","Yes, thanks. Just a couple of quick questions here; first, I am just curious in the Bermuda segment, what was the current dollar figure of the true-up which you had in the first quarter, just so we get a good sense of kind of what the year over year growth was looking like without this true-ups, the Bermuda segment?","Dom Addesso","Just one second.","Brian Meredith","Sure.","Dom Addesso","Yes, it's roughly about $60 million.","Brian Meredith","Great, that's truly helpful. And then, second question on the credit mortgage business, I am just curious when you think about the capital allocation to that business, how do you think about it? Are you using call it rating agency models? What are you using in -- and what is the risk here that perhaps has changed and where the rating agency look at the mortgage reinsurance business to get to maybe some type of capital requiring closer to [indiscernible] particularly with quota share, would that change your kind of view of the business?","Jon Zaffino","So, Brian, it's Jon. As a -- I think a couple of things. I think we feel like just overall first principle that Everest given our overall capital position and diversified book business, we feel we are pretty capital efficient in deploying capital in the areas like mortgage. We also know there has been conversations and some of the rating agencies have been looking at this fairly carefully about what the rating, how they should think about the capital required to support this book going forward. More times than not when more capital is required whether it's on the [indiscernible], or the rating agencies that puts pressure on supply. And we do that -- given our strong capital position and balance sheet and ratings, we do that as positive that will drive increases in demand and put downward pressure on supply. So, in terms of we think about it, we think about it as all of the above rating agencies with limits deployed, realistic disaster scenarios, stochastic, pricing, reserving, looking at an overall economic capital model, thinking about the assets and the liabilities and whole balance sheet.","Brian Meredith","Got you. Great. And then, another just quick question here. Given that you are moving to more shorter tail type businesses which on the liability side with MI and crop and stuff, is that causing any changes in your investment portfolio and kind of where you are going to invest and proceed?","Dom Addesso","No, it hasn't. The duration on the liability side really hasn't moved much approximately three years - four years, and our asset portfolio is underneath that. So that has not changed.","Brian Meredith","Great, great. Thanks. And last quick question here, workers comp market, I know you guys did mention that there are some dislocation of the insurance market in general and you are taking immense opportunities there. How about he workers comp market with some of the recent activity that we are seen there, any opportunities there?","Dom Addesso","In the insurance side?","Brian Meredith","Yes, insurance side, sorry, yes.","Dom Addesso","There are a lot of select opportunities. And we have expanded slightly some of our offerings we have expanded into some different states, but only selectively into certain states. California you know which is our biggest comp market, very profitable for us, rates are off a little bit, but we're still very bullish on sector given where rates are. And we will use comp frankly as a competitive advantage. There is a lot of -- a lot of markets we compete against that don't have comp capability and that gives us an edge to get into some other -- some of the other lines of business. So that's how we are thinking about it.","Brian Meredith","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our final question today from Nicholas Mezick with KBW.","Nicholas Mezick","Hi, good morning everyone.","Dom Addesso","Good morning.","Craig Howie","Good morning.","Nicholas Mezick","Thanks for fitting me in. A year ago, you mentioned that you have not done hiring in the insurance division. And in the prepared remarks today, you mentioned due to market turmoil, you have accelerated those investments. At Heartland, I see other underwriting expenses up about $9 million quarter over quarter. Where do you see the notional dollar amount is going in 2017 and 2018 or the other underwriting expense?","Dom Addesso","I don't know that we have an answer for you on that because it is all dependent on market opportunity. So, we think about it more as an operating expense ratio. And I think where we are at today, we are lower, particularly as the earned premium begins to catch up, because our lead of add for resources is not necessarily plateauing but not going up at the same pace that it has been over the last 18 months as we have been building up some of these new businesses. And as these businesses have - the premium begins to earn in, the expense ratio all other things being equal, should moderate. And as Jonathan pointed out earlier, we will continue to make new additions consistent with what we see as the growth opportunity. So it's a little difficult for us to give you nominal dollar amount because that will emerge as opportunity emerges.","Nicholas Mezick","Okay. And one of the governors to that sort of the sub 30 expense ratio target?","Dom Addesso","Right.","Nicholas Mezick","Okay, thanks.","Dom Addesso","And by the way, if it remained at 30 for foreseeable future again as we pointed out before, most of our competitors aren't even close to us there. So, while everyone seems to be focused on the increase in expenses, reality is that where we are at today is competitive relative to the market.","Nicholas Mezick","Just a quick follow-up on that last point, any overrides from the more conservative reinsurance program?","Dom Addesso","We have overrides in our reinsurance purchases, is that what you are asking?","Nicholas Mezick","Yes, that's driving the expense ratio to that sub 30 target?","Dom Addesso","Not to any significant degree. We do have some overrides but that's not driving.","Nicholas Mezick","Okay, thanks guys.","Dom Addesso","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn it back to management for closing remarks.","Dom Addesso","Well, I'll conclude by just thanking everyone for participating in this morning. And as you can surmise from our prepared comments as well as some of the answers to questions, we remain optimistic about our ability to deliver -- continue to deliver solid returns. Conservative management of our cat exposure, solid reserve position along with expense discipline and all that positions us to withstand what the market might bring to us. Coupled with growth into newer product areas and our reinsurance operations as well as what's proving to be a successful growth strategy for our insurance division, these things should continue to help us maintain our above average returns.","So, thank you for your interest, and I look forward to perhaps meeting with many of you in the months ahead. Thanks again for participating.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does include today's conference. You may now disconnect."],"8604":["Everest Re Group Ltd. (NYSE:RE) Q1 2016 Results Earnings Conference Call April 26, 2016 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Beth Farrell - VP, IR","Dom Addesso - President and CEO","Craig Howie - CFO","John Doucette - President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations","Jon Zaffino - President of North America Insurance Operations","Analysts","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Vinay Misquith - CRT Capital Group","Sarah DeWitt - JPMorgan","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital","Operator","Good day everyone, welcome to the First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call of Everest Re Group Limited. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Beth Farrell","Thank you, Roxanne. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, President of North America Insurance Operations.","Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements.","Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.","Dom Addesso","Thanks, Beth, good morning.","For the opening quarter of 2016, Everest had another solid underwriting performance with a combined ratio of 86%. This is slightly higher than where the full year 2015 ended which was due to an uptick in the expense ratio. The loss ratio in the first quarter is in fact slightly better than where the year 2015 ended.","In comparison to the first quarter of last year, the loss ratio was higher due to some level of cat activity in the first quarter of 2016.","The growth in our expense ratio in the first quarter was fully anticipated due to the expansion efforts in our insurance operation. The more modest change was in our reinsurance operation and the slight increase there is reflective of the reduction in premium as competitive pressures continue.","Our Group gross written premium for the first quarter was $1.4 billion, down 5% from the first quarter in 2015, which reductions in reinsurance had growth in insurance. The rate environment and foreign currency is driving the reinsurance premium reduction. Offsetting this is continued growth in our insurance operation as we build out our capabilities. You will hear more on this in the operations report.","Despite premium pressures in the reinsurance sector, these segments overall had a combined ratio of 81.3%. The year-over-year difference as mentioned is namely due to caps and a small uptick in the expense ratio driven by premium volume. This is an outstanding result in this market and will likely compare very favorably to industry results.","The insurance operations first quarter attritional combined ratio of 98.7 came in higher than last year solely due to the expense ratio. As I mentioned, this was fully anticipated but as our platform extends and premium earn grows, we expect that the abnormally for us high expense ratio will moderate throughout the year. Nevertheless our current expense ratio remains better than the industry average.","More important is that the attritional loss ratio continues to improve. Calendar year loss ratio was up due to some late reported crop hail claims. Overall however, our insurance operation continues on a very positive trend as each of our business initiatives continues to show accelerating growth into the second quarter.","Beyond the underwriting results, there was some headwinds. First investment income is down $20 million compared to last year's first quarter. Lower limited partnership income was the major cause. Based on what we see to-date in the second quarter, we expect that to be more positive in the second quarter.","Nevertheless, low yields generally continue to have a slightly depressing impact on income and while this will moderate overtime, there is limited upside that we see over the next several quarters.","The other items working against this quarter earnings was foreign exchange. However this was largely offset in shareholders equity through unrealized gains due to the positive impact of holding foreign assets.","Overall for the quarter the company had a very positive result generating a 12% annualized operating ROE and book value per share that rose 4% in the quarter. With the right mix of underwriting discipline and our continued investment in the insurance franchise, we will be able to continue to outperform the industry even with the second quarter events on the horizon.","As you know, there have been earthquakes in Ecuador and Japan as well as hail and flood events in Texas. But for all of this events combined, we currently expect them to be well below our expected cat load for the second quarter.","Finally I want to touch on our recently announced reorganization which changes this morning's presentation from prior quarters. Consolidating some our department into distinct operating units, with a superb leadership of John Doucette in Reinsurance and Jonathan Zaffino in North America Insurance, we\u2019ll improve the brand for each. As well as allow us to focus on intensely on each of these separate markets.","We\u2019ll now ask Craig to review with you the financial detail followed by John Doucette for Reinsurance Operations and Jon Zaffino for Insurance. Craig?","Craig Howie","Thank you, Dom, and good morning everyone.","Before I provide an overview of our quarterly results, I would like to point out a change in our segment reporting and our consolidation presentation. Effective this quarter we no longer consolidate the segregated accounts of Mt. Logan Re into the Everest Re financial statements.","This follows amended consolidation accounting guidance and is consistent with how Mt. Logan Re operates with third party investors. This is a retrospective application of an emended accounting guidance and all periods have been adjusted to present on a comparative basis.","This change had no impact to prior reported net income, operating income, earnings per share or retained earnings of Everest. The Mt. Logan Re earnings and fees will now be shown in the other income line of the Everest's financial.","Now, for the quarterly results. Everest had another solid quarter of earnings with after-tax operating income of $223 million or $5.19 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2016. This compares the operating income of $330 million or $7.34 per share for the first quarter of 2015.","The 2016 result represents an annualized operating return on equity of 12%. Net income for the first quarter was $172 million or $4 per diluted share compared to $323 million or $7.19 per share in 2015.","Net income included $51 million of net after-tax realized capital losses compared to $7 million of capital losses in the first quarter last year. The 2016 capital losses were primarily attributable to the fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio and impairments on the fixed income portfolio.","The impairments mainly related to credit right downs on energy investments. The majority of the equity portfolio adjustments have improved since the end of the quarter. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $171 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $215 million in the same period last year.","In the first quarter of 2016, Everest saw $10 million of current year catastrophic losses related to the earthquake in Taiwan. There were no catastrophic losses during the first quarter of last year. The overall current year attritional combined ratio was 85.3%, up from 83.1% at the first quarter of 2015. But only a half point higher compared to the full year of 2015, primarily due to the increase in the expense ratio that Dom mentioned.","Our expense ratio was up to 5.9% as we anticipated with the build out of our insurance platform and our Lloyd's syndicate. For investments, pretax investment income was $103 million for the quarter on our $17.1 billion investment portfolio. Investment income was below last year as expected. This result was primarily driven by the low interest rate environment and by the decline in limited partnership income.","Limited partnership income was down $13 million from the first quarter of last year, primarily due to energy related investments. The pretax yield on the overall portfolio was 2.8% with a duration of just over 3 years.","Foreign exchange is reported in other income. For the first quarter of 2016, foreign exchange losses were $4 million compared to an unusually high $47 million of foreign exchange gains in the first quarter of 2015. This $51 million pretax swing reflects the relative weakening of the U.S. dollar during the first quarter of 2016.","Other income also includes $3 million of earnings and fees from Mt. Logan Re compared to the $5 million of income in the first quarter of last year. The decline essentially represents the impact of the catastrophic losses during the first quarter of 2016.","On income taxes, the 11.4% effective tax rate on operating income is on the lower end of our expected bench for the year. This rate is slightly lower than the 12% tax rate at this time last year.","Stable cash flows continues with operating cash flows of $367 million for the quarter compared to the $351 million in the first quarter of 2015.","Shareholders equity for the group was $7.8 billion at the end of the first quarter, up $232 million from year end 2015. This is after taking into account, capital return for the $86 million of share buybacks and the $49 million of dividends paid in the first quarter of 2016.","Our strong capital position leaves us with capacity to maximize our business opportunities, as well as continue share repurchases.","Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide a review of reinsurance operations.","John Doucette","Thank you, Craig. Good morning.","For our total reinsurance segment, gross written premium for the first quarter was $977 million, down about $100 million or 9% compared to Q1 2015. Adjusted foreign exchange rates, it is down 8%. Net premiums were $858 million, down 7%.","On a constant currency basis, it is down approximately 5%. Roughly 60% of the decrease in gross written premiums in the quarter compared to the last Q1 is due to timing issues. This relates to the timing of what accounts were received and a one-off adjustment in last year\u2019s first quarter, it did not repeat this Q1.","The remaining 40% of the decrease in reinsurance premium is due to four items; first, foreign exchange rates. With the strengthening of the U.S. dollar impacting some of our segments topline, particularly our international reinsurance segment.","Second, rate decreases. Third, migration to higher attachment points with inherently lower premiums but better risk adjusted pricing. And fourth, non-renewal declinations or reduced shares on underpriced treaties.","Our reinsurance book generated $174 million of underwriting profit in Q1 2016, down $30 million compared to Q1 2015. This decrease is driven by two main causes. A reduction in earned premium which was down 8% quarter-over-quarter, and a $10 million increase in catastrophic losses in this Q1 compared with the prior Q1. This relates to the Taiwan earthquake that occurred in 2016.","The attritional loss ratio is 53% which is essentially flat compared to Q1 last year, as well as the full year 2015. The attritional combined ratio is 81.1%, down slightly from the 2015 full year 81.8% but up 1.3 points when compared to Q1 2015, largely due to business mix quarter-over-quarter.","This is predominantly due to the U.S. reinsurance segment which is up one point compared to Q1 2015. Now, some color on the April 1 reinsurance renewals which reflects approximately 10% of our full year reinsurance gross written premium.","April 1 is a key renewal date for Japanese and other agent business and for some Latin America and U.S. regional property business. The market remains challenging with reinsurance rates down. But not as significant as rates decline at 11.","For core accounts, we successfully gained preferential signings on desirable layers and programs in many different areas. Despite increased pressure from multi-year deals in Japan, we generally secured the annual timings which we wanted.","In loss affected areas such as Korea, India, and Guam, we were able to achieve improved pricing, terms and conditions. With our key global reinsurance clients in Asia, the USA and other places around the world, we mutually benefit from our broad strategic relationships.","As part of our hedging strategy, we maintained outward seating relationships with some of these large global players providing them high quality seating premium. In turn, this improves our reinsurance signings as a select core trading partner, thereby solidifying our long term strategic relationships. ","While several areas remain challenged, we are seeing robust submission flow, reflected increased demand including the following: Solvency II surplus relief treaties, facultative casualty particularly in loss affected auto departments, increased lines on existing treaties with several global clients and new layers for global clients. Some of them are reversing the trend of holding larger net retentions.","We scaled down our non-renewed treaties which do not compensated adequately for putting our capital at risk. This results in significant turn in our renewals. This combined with a nimble reallocation of capital to the best price business has resulted in the outperformance of our reinsurance portfolio relative to the broader market.","As of 41, Mt. Logan rule again with AUM now over $900 million, a growth of 33% in AUM from Q1 of last year. Logan remains one of the fastest growing capital markets convergence vehicle and continues to be a core part of Everest Re's long term capital management and business strategy.","100% of Logan's capacity was fully deployed at 41 renewals allowing for efficient and timely hedging of the Everest portfolio. This also benefits Logan's investors as their capital is deployed immediately rather than being uninvested earning no return, a common problem for investors in other convergence vehicles.","From the suite of hedges including Mt. Logan, Kilimanjaro cat bonds, traditional reinsurance, retrocessional program and IOWs, we manage our catastrophic risk well within our long standing group risk appetite.","As of April 1, we reorganized the worldwide reinsurance operation under one division, streamlining little podium lines while maintaining local market presence and controlled underwriting autonomy. We have added to our reinsurance bench strength hiring a deputy CUO along with recent additional hires throughout the operation to compliment our best-in-class global reinsurance team.","This reorganization and increased bench strength will provide for expanded product offerings and capabilities allowing us to grow and diversify our reinsurance book profitably. We\u2019re pleased with the overall outcome of both our 11 and 41 renewals despite the current market conditions and believe that we are off to another strong start this year for our reinsurance book.","Thank you. Now I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations.","Jon Zaffino","Thanks John and good morning. Everest Insurance performed well in the first quarter. The transformation into a vibrant and diversified specialty insured is gaining momentum. As a result, we remain encouraged about our ability to pursue profitable growth.","Our global insurance operations inclusive of the North America division and Lloyd's, gross written premium increased 11% quarter-over-quarter to 376 million. Net written premiums grew to 324 million representing an increase of 7%.","The net written premium growth lagged GWP growth primarily due to a marginally more conservative reinsurance strategy in our U.S. operations to support various new business launches.","The insurance segment gap combined ratio for the quarter was 101% impacted by prior year development of about 7 million mostly related to the late reported crop hail losses in Heartland.","On an attritional basis, the calendar year combined for the quarter was 98.7%, slightly above last year due to a higher expense ratio. Excluding Heartland, the attritional calendar year result improves further to 96%.","The attritional loss ratio remained essentially flat and in fact showed 40 basis points of improvements quarter-over-quarter coming in at 69.1% versus 69.5% for 1Q '15. As previously noted, the operating expense ratio increased 2.8 points quarter-over-quarter reflecting both seasonality and net earn premium particularly within Hartland and our continued investment in our global insurance capabilities both in the U.S. and at Lloyds.","To highlight this, our expense ratio is reduced by 80 basis points or 29% if we adjust with the organic Lloyds expansion. As Don mentioned earlier, this was fully anticipated and is also something we expect to normalize as the year progresses.","Let me offer some commentary on the performance of our major insurance segments, provide an update on market conditions and also on the build out of the Everest insurance platform.","Our U.S. and Canadian operations demonstrated growth and profitability in the quarter, although growth was not linear across all product areas. We continue to build capabilities across both of these platforms, enhance our underwriting sophistication and selectively launch new product lines. These efforts are supported by additional talent which should translate into meaningful growth and profitability overtime.","To be clear the rate environment is not favorable everywhere, nor is it the same as prior years, that stated opportunities continue to exist and we will pick our spots accordingly.","Notably in the quarter, we began benefitting from our increased product diversification. For example in the U.S., the California work comp market came under further pressure as favorable fundamentals attracted increased competition.","Despite these favorable underlying dynamics, we underwrote selectively a mid single digit rate reduction environment. That stage is we did find several opportunities within our specialty casualty portfolio both in the U.S. and Canada and also within Everest specialty underwriters our DNO, ENO and related lines platform.","Additionally, we continue to find opportunities for diversify growth across our property portfolio again despite rating pressure. Further, our A&H segment continued its strong performance with meaningful year-over-year within and medical stop loss and sports disability markets.","It\u2019s important to note that the strong premium growth experienced over the last several quarter\u2019s largely as a result of our strategic growth and diversification efforts has not yet been reflected through earnings. Therefore we would expect the continued build in earning in the insurance platform throughout the year.","Let me now turn to market condition. The market is exhibiting similar trends to those experienced in the fourth quarter of 2015. Headwinds continue to exist and negative rating pressure remains. That stated we are operating within a defined trading range across many lines of business with further rate pressure somewhat abating or in certain cases stabilizing across lines.","In the U.S. market property lines particularly in cat zones remain competitive. Rate reductions are on average, high single to low double digit. These reductions often widen peak cat zones where competition is more intense.","Third party casualty lines are mixed with some softness or flattening for the general liability lines, offset by positive rate in the commercial auto segment. Professional lines continue to experience a mid single digit decreases overall, less on primary layers, work comp is mixed depending on state and class of business and within the A&H market the market staff loss segment remains competitive other than for account of challenging loss experience.","So, again a mix market landscape depending on the many factors influencing various lines of business. As a result, and due to our increased product depth, we are able to adjust our underwriting empathy towards the lines with more favorable underlying dynamics.","Finally, a quick update on the status of our operational build-out within the insurance operations. We are capitalizing on the dislocation within the specialty commercial market to grow and diversify our platform notably by adding leading talent in several geographies across the company.","Our robust and diversified footprint in the North American market, empowers this talent to drive improved operational performance. In fact, everyone of our new and selected business launches in 2015 contributed to grow in the first quarter of 2016.","We expect this investment to further materialize as the year progresses and as we continue to execute on this plan into the balance of 2016 and beyond.","With that, let me turn it back over to Beth for Q&A.","Beth Farrell","Thank you. Joanne, we are ready for question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Kai Pan. Please go ahead.","Kai Pan","Good morning. Thank you. First, a quick question on the second-quarter cats - you said well below your second-quarter budget. What is that budget?","Dom Addesso","As we mentioned previously, our annual cat load is approximately 10 points of command ratio points - 10%.","Kai Pan","Okay. But if that has seasonality, the second and third quarter, I would imagine, would be higher?","Dom Addesso","Everyone deals with that differently. We actually treat that for capital rating or effective tax rate, we maintain a flat budget. But people do it differently, so \u2013 ","Kai Pan","Okay, that's great. Then back to your expense ratio, you guys have been sort of the competitive advantage, one of the competitive advantages, low - the expense ratio. I just wonder, given the buildout and also given the premium decline in the reinsurance segments, what's the near-term implication on the expense ratio?","Do you expect to - because you are still building out teams, then could trend a little bit higher in the near term? And what is long-term, what -- are you back to where you were the last few years? Or it will be settled down to a rate which is higher - lower than current now, but could it be still higher than what you have been?","Dom Addesso","Let me take the two pieces of that. On the reinsurance side, the rise in the expense ratio is predominantly driven by the topline. And we are going to maintain our discipline on topline and that will return to more normal levels once the market returns to a more normal level.","The other segments are pockets of business that we can find to offset the premium decline. We obviously have the bandwidth or the room to tolerate that expense movement because we already started from the very, very low base.","On the insurance side, that's elevated primarily because of the investment we made there, and the premium earned is not caught up yet to the investments we've made. That would moderate throughout the year and I think over the longer term, we would expect our expense ratio to be consistent with where we historically have been.","Kai Pan","My last question is really stepping back, look to your ROE profile over the last few years. In recognized catastrophe years, you've been able to achieve, like, mid-teen to high-teen ROE. This quarter the cat is relatively low, but the ROE is much lower. I just wonder, besides the expense ratio, what are the key drivers? What do you think is a one-off, and what are those that will be persist?","Dom Addesso","I understand, Kai. I think first of all the annualized ROE is frankly little bit understated and realizing that it\u2019s one quarter. We\u2019ve had some one time impacts in the first quarter and of course, that gets multiplied out for the four years on an annualized basis, the most notable of which is investment income.","But you also have foreign exchange which is I mentioned in my script though. You\u2019ve got an offset to that flowing it through the other comprehensive income because we\u2019ve got the investment in foreign assets which offsets what\u2019s coming through the P&L. So we have to recognize that.","You also had the reserve charges in the first quarter as well. So I think if you kind of adjust for those things - however you see fit when you see that our ROE on an annualized basis, on a pro forma annualized basis is higher.","Kai Pan","Okay, great. Well, thank you so much for the answer.","Dom Addesso","I should also add to that, excuse me Kai - I\u2019ll just add to that. Some of the things I mentioned is reflected in the book value per share growth, the 4%. That doesn\u2019t quite align with the 12% ROE but it is due to the some of the factors that I mentioned.","Kai Pan","Okay. That\u2019s great. Thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Michael Nannizzi. Please go ahead.","Michael Nannizzi","Thanks. I think you addressed most of our questions in your prepared comments. But on investment income, just - that ticked down in the fixed income component, like the core fixed income component of the portfolio. So I was just wondering if that was impacted by the carveout of some of the Mt. Logan assets, potentially? Or should we be looking at that sort of downdraft year-over-year? Is that something that we should anticipate will continue at this level for the foreseeable future?","Dom Addesso","Mt. Logan does not impact that number at all. And I think essentially what you are seeing is just long term decrease in the interest rates and the impact on our fixed income portfolio. Also driven by the fact that some of our limited growth in the invested assets were limited by the amount of share repurchase we\u2019ve made and the dividends we\u2019ve made.","So that will also not as much of an increase in invested assets. So the combination of those things is pointing to a drift down as I mentioned in my remark. We do anticipate though that\u2019s going to be flattening out here not just in future.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay, great. Thanks for that, Dom. And then just in terms of the insurance business, when we think about the expense side, should we be looking at notional dollars in the other underwriting expenses category? Like, should we be looking at that as, like, a notional dollar amount; and then the ratio for the more likely variable costs on the commission side as you're building out?","And in that, if we do, should we be thinking that that other underwriting expense dollar amount should rise from here? Or how to think about the pieces? Because obviously, on the insurance there's been a lot of movement of premium dollars, and changes, and now some investments. Just trying to get a better handle on how to think about that segment. Thanks.","A - Dom Addesso","Well, I think a straight ratio approach would be difficult. As I mentioned, we expect the expense ratio to moderate throughout the year and even more so in the longer term. And that\u2019s exactly to your point it\u2019s better to look at the increase in expenses in a notional dollar now, because that will give you a sense of the build and an additional expense year over year.","And of course if you project, depending on your projection of premium earn, that will produce the result in expense ratio. And again, to our point earlier, we would expect that expense ratio to moderate through time.","As well as the increase in notional amounts year over year, essentially, we\u2019ve had a pretty rapid build here over the last 6 months. Into the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, we\u2019ve made a significant number of new hires. So that\u2019s what impacting the notional amount as well.","Michael Nannizzi","Got it. Okay, great. And then just one last one, if I could. Just on the 2Q events so far -- I realize, Dom, you mentioned that you don't expect that to have a material impact on Everest. Have you guys given some thought in terms of how large you think these events might be just for the industry?","I mean, when we look at whether it's the San Antonio hailstorms, or at the Houston floods, or maybe the Japan quake -- just some idea in terms of how you're thinking about with the total industry loss exposure might look like?","Dom Addesso","We don\u2019t have, at this point, any better information than what you\u2019ve been reading in the trade presses about the ranges. And if we did, we frankly, we\u2019d have a more precise estimate that we could give you relative to each of those events.","Given the ranges that have been spoken about, we obviously feel very comfortable that it\u2019s well below our annual expected cat load or quarterly expected cat load if you will. And now, whether or not we say it\u2019s not material, it\u2019s your judgment.","But it\u2019s still well below our annual expected cat load. But I don\u2019t have a better sense of what those numbers are. It\u2019s early days. We are getting reports, and we have losses that will come to us from obviously our insurance book which are coming in slow.","Although we do reach out to potentially affected accounts. Same thing happens on our facultative side and then the biggest piece- I\u2019m talking about Texas now in particular.","The other piece would be treaty property. In Ecuador, we would only be affected by our reinsurance book.","Michael Nannizzi","Got it. Thanks for that Dom.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Amit Kumar. Please go ahead.","Amit Kumar","Thanks, and good morning and congrats on the quarter. Just a few follow-ups, I guess, on the previous questions. Maybe starting on the insurance side, Dom, you talked about the rapid build, the new hires. I think what a lot of us are trying to figure out -- is there some way to sort of talk about how big the books were of these people whom you've hired?","Are we talking about a materially large number of premium coming in down the road? I guess that is what we are sort of struggling with: how to ballpark that number.","Dom Addesso","There is no way that I can give you our specific plans but I want to. We certainly would expect some meaningful percentage growth year over year. We\u2019ve hired resources in the inland marine space and workers comp area.","In the professional lines and the PNO and ENO areas. Political risk trade credit; surety. What have I left out? But excess casualty. So all of those sectors we have added talent to- they come to us with many years of experience from, in many cases large global entities.","And so we would expect year over year some meaningful percentage increases. However, just like we do on the reinsurance side, it is a difficult time to be growing because of the rate environment.","So my comments have to be tempered by some degree of prudence that we are going to take on the premium that we put on the books. And that\u2019s the challenging part in terms of giving you some sense of what the actual dollar projects are.","Amit Kumar","And are these new hires sort of sitting back and waiting for the markets to turn with a specific ROE target in mind? Or is there a combination of premiums plus ROE target for them as they are -- as they have been joining you over the past several months?","Dom Addesso","As people in this room can attest to, no one around here, sits around, waiting for anything. So, no, we are not doing that. There are opportunities in each of these segments to put business on the book. I\u2019m not saying that there aren\u2019t opportunities.","What I am saying though is that perhaps what the market will give will dictate how quickly we add to those ranks. And how patient you are with marketplace.","So it\u2019s really more about what the additional expense numbers are in terms of what the marketplace will give us. But we do think that there is opportunities for the staff that we have here today and they are busy not only building relationships with our distribution partners, also building our infrastructure needs, underwriting guidelines, all that things that takes to run an effective insurance operation.","Amit Kumar","Got it. And then switching to the reinsurance side: would it be fair to say -- in your opening remarks, when you talked about it, were there more pluses than minuses on net met. It was a positive on the 41 renewals or did I read into those comments?","Dom Addesso","I\u2019ll ask John to - ","John Doucette","Good morning Amit. This is John. I think overall, again, it\u2019s not market but we are pleased with our ability to execute in that market. I think rates were down about 5% or so in Japan which is the major part of the 41 renewal.","We saw some combining of wind and quake programs into combined layers. We really did see a lot that we\u2019ve talked about this in the prior quarters. We really did see a lot of our ability to get signings that we want.","Signings by layer, increases on deals in layers that we liked. Moving up when we wanted to move up. The clients let us do that. And also leveraging some of the strategic relationships that we\u2019ve been building over the last several years.","So again, health market, but we\u2019ve felt pretty good about how 41 went for us.","Amit Kumar","And last question: is there any way to sort of draw that arc from 4\/1 to 6\/1 renewals? And how do you feel about that? Thanks.","Dom Addesso","We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen at 61. There is a lot of moving parts on, there is obviously a lot of supply of capital that\u2019s out there. There is potential demand shifts, variations on what citizens in Florida cat plan would do.","There is the talk of less buying that\u2019s happening for citizens for example. But that may in fact mean more limit being purchased by some of our longstanding clients.","So in some ways it might be more of a reallocation. So we are not sure what\u2019s going to happen at 61. But we are confident we will be able to successfully execute our plan about both writing a gross footprint that we are comfortable with and then combining that with our ability to match the risk to the capital, the appropriate capital as we talked about earlier.","So our ability to build a portfolio that we are pleased with and feel has strong potential in it.","Amit Kumar","Got it. I'll stop there. Thanks for the detailed answers and good luck for the future.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Vinay Misquith with CRT Capital Group. Please go ahead.","Vinay Misquith","Hi, good morning. So the first question -- I just wanted to follow up on the expenses, the other underwriting expenses for US insurance. So that was about $42 million this quarter. Curious whether the hiring is largely done, and whether we should be using this as the base for the future? Or should we see an uptick in those expenses near term?","Dom Addesso","I think you\u2019ll see a continued addition as we continue to build up the insurance platform as I mentioned before. But that will be consistent with what our expectations for growth are.","So we are not done given what our premium plans are for the longer term. No, of course, we are not done adding resources.","Vinay Misquith","Okay, the second question is on the reinsurance premiums. So this quarter, I believe 60% of the decline was because of one-time items. So the core decline in reinsurance premiums -- is it on 3%-ish? Should we think of this as a normalized number for the near-term future? Or based on your renewals, do you think it's going to be less or more?","A \u2013 Dom Addesso","It\u2019s somewhat of the derivative of the question that John just answered right I mean it\u2019s some of that is dependent upon what the 61 and 71 will be which we really have no idea yet but certainly were not anticipating any strong premium growth in the reinsurance sector through the balance of the year that\u2019s that helps at all just given what generally the rate environment has been over the most recent quarters. ","Having said that there is always new opportunities that we might see that could change the answer to that, so its an extremely difficult to answer to give you Vinay and when we really don\u2019t know what all the opportunities that will be presented to us but on a like for like basis we just looking at a renewable book and then may be some normal what I call normal may be new submissions that we would see then I would expect certainly a more a very flattish premium expectation. Premium amount. ","Q \u2013 Vinay Misquith","Sure, thank you. And then just one last thing: this quarter we saw not much in terms of share repurchases. Can you talk about capital management for the future, please? Thanks. ","A \u2013 Dom Addesso","I would like to answer that with just a brief know and but because obviously it does get asked every quarter and that\u2019s fine and I just taken that and we think we do have obviously at some level of repurchases this quarter and it\u2019s what we do each and every quarter and we look at what the opportunities are ahead of us and what the price of the stock is in the marketplace and we make decisions accordingly, we don\u2019t give any guidance on what our level of share repurchases are going to be other than to say that we will continue to repurchase shares at the appropriate prices in the market and we will look forward, when making that evaluation we do look forward a couple of quarters in terms of what we would anticipate vis-\u00e0-vis our book value.","Q \u2013 Vinay Misquith","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Sarah DeWitt. Please go ahead.","Sarah DeWitt","Hi good morning. On the insurance premium volume, I think you said previously that you hoped you could grow 20% or more annually, given some of the new hires you were making. Do you still think that's achievable, given the first-quarter results?","Dom Addesso","Well I think the part of that is going to be tempered back a little bit by the rate environment that we are seeing. But keep in mind that as I mentioned earlier some of the recent hires we just made into the late fourth quarter of last year and into the first quarter of this year and that is going to take sometime for them to have their impact. But I think we can get at a higher level of growth than what we experienced in the first quarter, whether or not we can get up to that 20% number we will see. But I think it will be higher than percentage growth I believe will be higher than what we saw in the first quarter.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay, great. And then just on the net investment income, I know you have the loss of a limited partnership over also the line item what is the right run rate to be thinking about?","Dom Addesso","Well I think I would say generally our expectation it wasn\u2019t for the energy related issue in our LP limited partnership income which was solely due to price of oil and now that that is kind of seemingly at least for now stabilize. We would have otherwise expected our investment income to be kind of flattish. So that is what I would expected the run rate.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay flat quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year?","Dom Addesso","Well because we already the first quarter down so quarter-over-quarter.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay, great. Thank you. ","Operator","And we will take our next question from Josh Shanker. Please go ahead.","Josh Shanker","Yes, so I guess I'm a little confused. Following up on Vinay's expense question, it seems like some of the guidance is that the expenses are elevated in this quarter and trickle down; and there's also new hires, and there might be a few more hires going forward. And I'm trying to understand the directionality. I guess there's a few moving pieces I need to zero in on, I guess.","Dom Addesso","Okay.","Josh Shanker","Can you sort of walk through how both of those things work? How it should trickle down, but also the hiring is sort of -- obviously, you're going to have to pay those people for the next two, three quarters as well.","Dom Addesso","I am not quite sure I understand the question but let me try.","Josh Shanker","All right, so just to say -- I don't understand. Why should we expect expense ratio to decline, I guess, is the question?","Dom Addesso","Because the pace of hiring that we have in the fourth quarter and the first quarter will not be as robust in the remaining quarters and we\u2019ll start to begin to see the premium earned take hold.","Josh Shanker","Okay. So the premium earned one was -- and there were large one-time procurement fees in sort of getting those people on board?","Dom Addesso","No, no, you're basically looking at an expense number year-over-year that's elevated because we have a group of people on staff that are here this year that weren\u2019t here last year and at the same time the premium earned this year compared to last year hasn\u2019t yet earned in for the business that these folks are now beginning to write. So that\u2019s why the expense ratio is going to moderate over time.","Josh Shanker","All right. Okay. That makes sense. And -- although, obviously, to Sarah's question, the growth -- we'll have to see where the growth comes in, I guess, overall. And then in terms of the sort of assets under management: when you think about Mt. Logan this year versus last year, did you have more interest than you are willing to put capital to work in the third-party vehicle?","John Doucette","Josh this is John. We have continued interest from a lot of people that have been looking at us for a long time and one of our goals is to continue to diversify the investor base and the types of investors that are in there.","And so we have a lot of people, a lot of the ramp up from somebody who expresses initial interest to making an investment sometime that's measured in 12, 18, 24 months. So, we take money in that we think we can deploy and we would expect that we continue to grow that over time and it\u2019s a balancing act between the two our opportunities set and the investor appetite.","Dom Addesso","If what you\u2019re asking Josh is and forgive me if I am reading too much into your question, but certainly I think overall demand in this space seems to have quieted a bit because of where rates are or rates are headed. So I think that\u2019s in part maybe perhaps what you're getting at. We still have an increased interest in Logan, but it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s at the same pace that it might have been a year or two ago.","Josh Shanker","Okay. That's -- I'm trying to figure out what the -- I guess the supply\/demand equation on that, which is a little loosey-goosey. But that definitely helps. And then finally, when we look at the -- you know, thinking about going forward over trailing 12 months, combined ratio in the insurance segment: how big do you think the insurance segment needs to be on a dollar basis for you to be confident that this is a business that runs at a consistent combined ratio below 100%?","Dom Addesso","I don\u2019t think the answer to that is a function of size. I think we had $1.5 billion of premium I think we're of sufficient size. I think what's been challenging for us as, has been some of the legacy issues that we had to deal with.","But I do think that at our size we can produce very profitably the kind of insurance bottom line we would all like to see. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a function of size.","What will happen though if this is in part the answer to your question, I am just measuring but my answer to you is in part driven by just focusing on the loss ratio. But we will have during this ramp up period, obviously the pressure on profitability just driven by the expense ratio.","But that\u2019s not the function of nominal size, that\u2019s a function of how we have chosen to invest in the business and how we\u2019ve chosen to grow it. So there will be some short term pressure until we get the premium earned catching up to the expenses that we put on the books.","Josh Shanker","Do you believe the rigor and conservatism of the reserving habits in the insurance segment is equal to that of the reinsurance segment?","Dom Addesso","You bet, it\u2019s the same management team. It\u2019s the same approach. It's the same diligence that frankly has started when I came here several years ago. It doesn\u2019t mean we've always gotten it right in sector by sector, but we're just as diligent in every one of our reserve buckets that we have.","Josh Shanker","Okay. Thank you very much for all the answers.","Dom Addesso","Thank you, Josh. ","Operator","And we will take our next question from Meyer Shields, please go ahead.","Meyer Shields","Thanks, good morning. One brief question, just to make sure I didn't misunderstand. I think, Dom, you said that the cat load overall was 10%. Wasn't it 12% not too long ago?","Dom Addesso","I am sorry. That\u2019s the difference between with and without Logan. If you include Logan premium that was 12% on all of that, but if it's just on the premiums without Logan it's 10 points.","Q \u2013 Meyer Shields","Okay, then that makes perfect sense. On a year-over-year basis, I guess, besides the insurance segment -- and I think you've explained that well -- corporate expenses also rose by about $2.5 million. Is there anything unusual there?","Craig Howie","Meyer this is Craig, that was partially the startup of our Lloyds operation. The startup cost associated with that and then also some other share-based compensation that comes through there as well.","Meyer Shields","Okay, well, just -- I guess both of those. I thought it was like --.","Craig Howie","One off accrual type items.","Meyer Shields","Okay, got it. Okay. And then, last, you mentioned earlier that there's been some disruption in the marketplace as competitors retrench. Are the margins in that sort of freed-up business different from what you're seeing in the overall marketplace?","John Doucette","Yeah. This is John Doucette. I think it depends on sort of what pocket you're referring or we're seeing in the business. I would say as sweeping comment, no, I don\u2019t think the margins are materially moving yet beyond some of the fundamental drivers of the business.","So one of the work they're not dislocation change premium or premium rate for that matter. So we're seeing different pockets react differently to this cycle in the market. But the biggest dislocation impact obviously is in the form of human capital. That\u2019s been significant and severe and we've taking full advantage of that, but not quite seeing that translate into a broad based different rating environment.","Meyer Shields","Okay, fantastic. And just one final, if I can. Is there any way we can, I guess as part of reporting, split off FX and the earnings from Mt. Logan?","Dom Addesso","Meaning split them out separately out of other income?","Meyer Shields","Yes","Dom Addesso","We will take that under advisory, thank you","Meyer Shields","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our last question from Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Jay Gelb","Thank you. I believe second quarter is a pretty large seasonal quarter for crop insurance. Can you give us some perspective on what you're seeing so far in terms of overall trends that would affect Everest in the crop insurance market -- things like yield and price activity?","Dom Addesso","I think at this point it\u2019s a little early to doing that, I think the weather conditions that we've noted we\u2019ve hit early so there doesn\u2019t seem to be any impact on not expecting any adverse impact on yield.","Of course price has been down this year on many of the commodities, So that\u2019s affected the premium, but in many ways that\u2019s not such a terrible thing given that it provides some floor if you will on the price protection.","So we're expecting -- we're expecting normal crop season, nothing hopefully profitable. We're not anticipating any adverse at this point any adverse outcome. That\u2019s the best I can give you on that.","Jay Gelb","That's helpful, Dom. And that usually means kind of like a low 90s combined on that business?","Dom Addesso","Correct","Jay Gelb","Okay. If you could just remind us, what are the commodity prices we should track to kind of keep on top of this stuff?","Dom Addesso","The main one is corn followed by soybean basically. That accounts for most of the revenue products within the crop space.","Jay Gelb","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Now I'd like to turn the call for our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.","Dom Addesso","Let me just close out with a few thoughts, and thank you everybody for participating and your interest and your questions this morning. In closing, I think, it\u2019s worth emphasizing again that 12% ROE and a 4% growth in book value per share, we think it\u2019s an outstanding result in this market.","And we will likely see that as the best in the industry. And, again as I said in answer to one of the questions that the ROE for the quarter is slightly understated due to one-time items in the first quarter.","And as planned, we will continue to make investments in the insurance segment. In the short term, this has resulted in an increased expense ratio but again, we believe that will be normalized over time.","And as mentioned on previous calls, this is a result of our build out not by strategy which is producing an improvement in the loss ratio. In the reinsurance business, we continue to do what we said we would do all along.","That is to be disciplined, manage through the cycle, not being bound by the top line. All this does have short term implications, it is still resulting in superior returns. So those were my thoughts for you for today and again thank you all for participating. Have a great day.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at any time."],"8602":["Everest Re Group, Ltd.

Today's conference is being recorded. ","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Beth Farrell","Thanks, Tony. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer; John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting Officer and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements.","Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.","Dom Addesso","Thanks, Beth and good morning. We are pleased to report another favorable quarter despite industry losses in China and Chile. For us, these two events totaled $100 million gross and $79 million, net of tax and reinsurance. Nevertheless, we were still able to generate $200 million of operating income, producing an ROE for the quarter of 11%.","Also impacting the quarter was lower investment income due to reduced limited partnership income. Investment returns continue to be an obvious challenge, which means an even greater result to produce adequate underwriting profits as evidenced by our year-to-date underwriting gain of $574 million and a year-to-date ROE of 14%.","I expect both our quarter and year-to-date results to be better than overall industry performance, due to our well-diversified portfolio and expected advantage. The underwriting gain for the quarter was $155 million and absent the China loss, the attritional combined ratio stood at approximately 82%.","While reinsurance segments drive the underwriting profit, the insurance operation has improved its attritional combined ratio year-over-year by almost 5 points for the nine months. This is a result of a number of quarters of improving rates as well as profitable growth of almost 30% during the nine months.","Reinsurance, including Mt. Logan on the other hand, had a premium decline of approximately 6% on a year-to-date basis, but on a constant dollar basis, our reinsurance premium is down 3%. Several factors are attributing to this. The market environment is an important element of this where renewal rates are down which also causes us to non-renew certain programs or layers. Offsetting this somewhat is the ability to move our capacity to more profitable but different layers, typically at higher attachment points, and therefore less premium per dollar of limit. This portfolio optimization is done in concert with our various hedging strategies, which include use of cat bonds, IOWs and Mount Logan.","Market conditions may flatten out as industry returns are subpar, capital growth is slowing and demand potential may be on the horizon. However, in the near term, we are not likely to see a market that would dramatically change our plans as price adequacy is mixed. This means we will continue to expect that most of our growth would come from our insurance units. The ongoing emphasis on adding superior talent and broadening our broker relationships will be key to our continued success there. In addition, broadening our insurance platform by developing our Lloyds Syndicate to the new Bermuda-based insurance platform will be immediately accretive. ","There are many new and exciting initiatives taking play at Everest in both the reinsurance and the insurance businesses. The new products and the effective use of capital markets in the reinsurance portfolio to line of business and geographic expansion in our insurance segment. These are all efforts that enable us to continue to generate superior returns on our capital compared to the overall market.","Thank you, and now I will turn it to Craig for the financial report.","Craig Howie","Thank you, Dom, and good morning everyone. Everest had another strong quarter of earnings with operating income of $200 million or $4.53 per diluted common share. This compares to operating income of $280 million or $6.12 per share for the third quarter of 2014. On a year-to-date basis, operating income was $755 million or $16.92 per share compared to $812 million or $17.46 per share in 2014. The 2015 result represents an annualized return on equity of 14%.","These results reflected a slight increase in the overall current year-to-date attritional combined ratio of 84.2% up from 81.9% for the same period last year. This attritional measure includes a $60 million gross loss estimate for the explosions at the Chinese Port of Tianjin. The estimate was based on a $3.25 billion industry loss estimate for this event. Net income year-to-date was $621 million or $13.92 per share compared to $859 million $18.47 per share in 2014.","Net income included $134 million of net after-tax realized capital losses compared to $47 million of capital gains last year or a difference of about $4 per share year-over-year. The 2015 capital losses were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio and impairments on the fixed income portfolio. The impairments mainly relate to credit write-downs on energy investments. Since the end of September, the majority of the fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio have already recovered.","On a year-to-date basis the overall results reflected gross catastrophe losses of $70 million in 2015 compared to $75 million in 2014. The third quarter of 2015 reflected $40 million of gross current year catastrophe losses related to the earthquake in Chile. This compares to $30 million of cats during the third quarter of 2014. Our reported combined ratio was 85.8% for the first nine months of 2015 compared to 83.7% in 2014. The higher 2015 ratio includes Tianjin loss as well as numerous weather related losses during the year that did not meet our $10 million catastrophe threshold. The year-to-date commission ratio of 21.8% was slightly up from 21.5% in 2014, primarily due to higher contingent commissions. Our expense ratio remains low at 4.8% on a year-to-date basis. Expense dollars are up from 2014, due to new hires and build out of our insurance platform. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $116 million for the quarter and $363 million year to date on our $17.6 billion investment portfolio. Investment income year-to-date declined $33 million from one-year ago. This decrease was primarily driven by the low interest rate environment and by the decline in limited partnership [Technical Difficulty]. ","This is Craig Howie; I know we were cut off, so I'm sorry if I repeat it, if I\u2019m repeating anything that I\u2019ve previously mentioned but I\u2019m going to start again with taxes. So on income taxes, the overall year-to-date 2015 tax expense $67 million lower than 2014. Mainly due to the 2015 capital losses which reduced income. Operating income does not include capital gains or losses. The 14.8% annualized effective tax rate on operating income is primarily driven by lower than planned catastrophe losses resulting in higher than expected taxable income for the year. A 14% to 16% effective tax rate on operating income for the year is in line with our expectations given our planned cat losses for the remainder of the year. Strong cash flow continues with operating cash flow of $988 million for the first nine months of 2015 compared to $926 million in 2014. ","Shareholders\u2019 equity at the end of the quarter was $7.5 billion, essentially flat compared to year-end 2014. This is after taking into account capital returned through $325 million of share buybacks and $126 million of dividends paid in the first nine months of 2015, representing a total return of capital through shareholders of over $450 million so far this year. Book value per share increased over 4% to $173.76 from $166.75 at year-end 2014. Our continued strong capital balance positions us well for potential business opportunities as well as continuing stock repurchases.","Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide the operations review.","John Doucette","Thank you Craig. Good morning. As Dom, highlighted, we had a very solid underwriting results into the third quarter of 2015 despite the industry\u2019s macro challenges. Our Group gross written premium for Q3 was $1.7 billion, up over $50 million from Q3 last year, with diverging trends in reinsurance and insurance. Quarter-over-quarter, our reinsurance book declined modestly, driven in part by foreign exchange, while insurance growth accelerated meaningfully due to our many growth initiatives. I will provide more details shortly. ","Our Group net written premium for Q3 was $1.6 billion, which was up 3% compared to Q3 last year. Year-to-date, our Group net written premium of $4 billion is up about 1% year-over-year and generated Group underwriting profits of $574 million. For our reinsurance segment, all reinsurance gross written premium, including Logan was $1.2 billion for the quarter, down 5% from Q3 last year, but on a constant dollar basis, premium was down only 2%. ","As discussed last quarter, we have been declining, reducing and non-renewing unattractively priced business. In addition, as previously discussed, we restructured deal for a significant client that continues to impact the topline. However, the expected profits are essentially unchanged. ","Our reinsurance book including Mt. Logan generated $142 million of underwriting profit in Q3, a $77 million decrease compared to last Q3, driven predominantly by the $100 million of losses related to the explosion at the Chinese port of Tianjin, and also the Chile earthquake. The Tianjin loss, while not a natural catastrophe, one of the largest insurer industrial loss in Asia and also one of the most complex losses in recent history making the outcome uncertain. But as Craig reported, we have conservatively estimated our loss by assuming industry losses at the high-end of the range. ","Year-to-date, our reinsurance segments including Mt. Logan generated $574 million of underwriting profit. We are pleased with these underwriting results, particularly in light of this quarter\u2019s loss event and the [Technical Difficulty] Logan is core to our hedging strategy. Supplemented by cap bond, IOWs, traditional reinsurance and retrocessional protection, we successfully enhanced our capital efficiency while delivering meaningful capacity to support our underwriting strategies. ","Turning to the insurance operations, we are progressing with the strategic build out of our platform while focusing on improving the bottom line results. This has been accomplished through the investment in key leadership hires, which in turn have brought significant underwriting talent and stronger direction toward achieving our strategic goals. ","Through nine months, premium in this segment is up 29% to $1.2 billion. This growth is highly diversified, coming from many areas, including several newly launched lines of business as well as product and geographic expansion in existing lines of business. We are building a world-class insurance platform, capable of offering products across lines and geographies, complementing our leading global reinsurance franchise. ","Year-to-date, we are up 35% in gross written premium on our direct brokerage business, which is underwritten internally by Everest underwriters. Our program business is up 10% year-to-date. This split growth trend is consistent with last quarter and our expectations, as we continue building out our retail books.","Insurance rates remind mixed with some lines seeing modest rate improvement and others coming under pressure. For the year, our rate monitoring systems indicate relatively flat risk-adjusted pricing across all lines, which we are pleased with in this rating environment. Bottom line, our quarterly insurance results for Q3 included an underwriting profit of $12 million with a 96.5% combined ratio, over 10 points better than our Q3 combined ratio last year. ","The underlying accident year results remain profitable and we're driving improvement in our loss and expense ratio through our rebalancing of the portfolio by risk, by product and by geography, as we gain economies of scale. As previously announced, we've received approval and principal from Lloyds to launch our syndicate, number 2786. We expect to obtain final approval to start business on January 1, 2016. Our Lloyds syndicate will provide Everest access to additional international business and new product opportunities, enabling us to further diversify and broaden our insurance portfolio in 2016 and beyond.","Now, some further detail on what we are seeing in each insurance markets. For California workers comp, gross written premium is up 13% to $75 million for Q3 compared to Q3 last year. With a mid-90s combined ratio, the rates are under pressure with increased competition. Professional liability premium dominated by our financial institutions book was $40 million for the quarter, flat compared to last Q3 and we continue to see rate pressure driven by excess capacity. ","Other casualty business is relatively flat quarter-over-quarter, but the combined ratio has been improving as our new initiatives gain traction and enhance diversification. In the short tail business, including property, DIC, non-stand auto and contingency business, written premium was $80 million for the quarter, an increase of over 38% from last Q3 as we have deployed more property insurance capacity and geographically diversified the book. Despite rate pressure in property, our opportunity to deploy capital at attractive returns remains, with the book running at high-80s combined ratio.","Similarly, our contingency business continues to grow at a nice rate with attractive opportunities and new strategic relationships, while running at a mid-90s combined ratio. Accident and health premium was up over 40% in Q3 compared to last Q3 to approximately $30 million, as several new initiatives gain traction and is running at a low-90s combined ratio. ","Crop conditions remain favorable and commodity prices are stable. Our crop insurance premium is up and more geographically diversified. We're running at a slight underwriting profit for the quarter, a meaningful improvement over last Q3. The outlook is favorable for profitable 2015 results.","In summary, given our new growth initiatives, particularly on the insurance side, as well as our ability to deploy capital effectively on the reinsurance side, due to our core strengths and sustainable competitive advantages, we continue to achieve bottom line results that are among the best in the industry. ","Thank you and now back to Beth for Q&A.","Beth Farrell","Yes, Tony, we are ready for questions. But first I'd like to apologize for the connection issue which seems to be coming from our end. If we have a future connection issue, please stay on the line and we will call back in. Thank you. Tony?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Amit Kumar with Macquarie Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Amit Kumar","Thanks, and good morning and congrats on the quarter. Maybe two quick questions. Number one is the discussion on the underlying AOI LR in the insurance segment. Can you talk about, I know you talked about 10 point improvement, if you adjusted for the agriculture book, what would that number be for ex-ag for the insurance book on an underlying basis, on an apples-to-apples basis?","Dom Addesso","Give us one second. It\u2019s 96% for the quarter, Amit. As far as our attritional combined ratio without crop, it\u2019s 96% compared to 95% last year \u2013 sorry 96% for the quarter, 94% year-to-date. ","Amit Kumar","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. The other question I had was the discussion obviously on growth versus capital versus not talking about the Lloyd's which has a stamp capacity of I guess 151 million. Now the buyback this quarter was a bit higher than I guess what we were expecting and trying to sort of think about that, was it higher because of some sort of catch up because on the Q2 call you had said that it was running a bit lower, is that simply the fact or is this sort of a new normal, how should we think about the repurchase this quarter? Thanks.","Dom Addesso","I think, Amit, you should think about perhaps a little bit of catch up. We were lighter than we certainly anticipated in the second quarter as the price target ran away from us a little bit in the second quarter and we just continued to have steady progress towards repurchasing shares. And we continued that into the third quarter particularly as we grew going through the quarter, it seemed as if it was going to going light cat quarter.","Amit Kumar","Got it. And then can you just upon the Lloyd's, when does that fully ramp up, the 151 million stamp capacity?","Dom Addesso","We expect to go live with Lloyd\u2019s in -- for the year subject to final approval by the franchise board or business plan et cetera, but we are on track to do that effective 1\/1.","Amit Kumar","Got it. Okay, that\u2019s all I have. Thanks for the answers.","Dom Addesso","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next we'll move to Joshua Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Joshua Shanker","Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Dom, whether you like it or not everyone looks at you as all bad things happening in Latin America must be happening to Everest Re. And so in the largest recorded hurricane in history is bearing down on Puerto Vallarta. How should we think about the pricing in the Mexican market, how should we think of agri risks that Everest is taking? Why or why not our investor is conspicuously concerned about Everest to benefit or to their detriment?","Dom Addesso","Well, I can\u2019t speak to why investors are conspicuously concerned or not concerned. All I can speak to is what we try to do. We manage our accumulations by each of our zone and of course as you and others know, our largest zone is in the Southeast US and of course we manage that down from there. Relative to what was happening in Mexico as an example or in Latin America for that matter. The industry was quite lucky of course that that event did not hit some of the more occupied regions in the resort areas. Interestingly enough, in the more recent times, we actually downsized of our participations in Mexico due to pricing trends and conditions. And as we continue to emphasize in each of these calls, we will look for fairly priced transactions and if we cannot need our hurdle rates, we will terminate or look to change our participations in some ways that matches our re-adjusted return targets that we have. So we continue to manage our P&Ls consistent with the balance sheet and we believe that what we\u2019re doing in terms of managing our risk through cat bonds, IOWs, and Mt. Logan, in fact, we write sizes that risk relative to our balance sheet. So, I think we benefit frankly from the diversification that we have across the globe as opposed to thinking about a particular event in some region of the world.","As you\u2019ve probably have noted our [indiscernible] was probably slightly below what others have reported. And again, I think it's a result of those actions that I\u2019ve just described where we actually got of some deals and actually our exposure turned out to be less. In Chile, we were at much less proportion of business than we did previously and of course that event again hitting offshore, the insured loss was not as great as maybe was originally feared. So I think on balance, again, the portfolio is diversified across the globe, which frankly we believe benefits us from a return perspective in using our balance sheet most effectively because I don\u2019t -- I hope that answers your question.","Joshua Shanker","It did to some extent; it did to the open end of the question. The other question as you mentioned in the previous questioner that the stock price got a little bit away from you in 2Q. The stock prices are between 180 and 185 in the second quarter, are you trying where possible to buy stock at book value and not above. Is 180, 185 when you have a $175 in book value a significant premium to where you want buy?","Operator","Pardon the interruption Mr. Shanker, it looks like we did unfortunately lose our speakers once again, if you could please hold your question, we\u2019ll get them re-established as soon as possible. And we've been rejoined by our speakers and Joshua ifyou wanted to ask your last question again.","Joshua Shanker","Must be that industry low expense ratio coming through here guys, I don\u2019t know.","Dom Addesso","But I don\u2019t think we were going to make the same comment but \u2013","Joshua Shanker","Actually my associate is who pointed that out by the way. So, the question was, you mentioned on the previous question that the stock kind of got away from your repurchased desires in the second quarter, it was all bobbing between 180 and 185, are you trying to buy at book and not above?","Dom Addesso","Not necessarily, we do look at over 6 to 12 month period but we just had a price target for that particular period and the stock just kept moving ahead of that. It's nothing more complicated than that. And we can think over the long-term, we have been repurchasing stocks and we look to do at not a specific target but I\u2019ll -- that we care to get share in a public [Technical Difficulty] to any levels repurchases, particularly our [indiscernible]. ","Joshua Shanker","But let me just put it in another way.","Dom Addesso","You can try. ","Joshua Shanker","Do you have sufficient capital right now on the books to write in your business or do you need to build up some more capital? ","Craig Howie","We do have sufficient capital, we do like to maintain some bid of excess capital. But as I\u2019ve mentioned in previous calls, the rating agencies have increased, particularly S&P has increased their capital requirements, so that excess position has shrunk a bit just based on rating agency actions. ","Joshua Shanker","Sure, fair enough. And then on the growth on the primary insurance side, that appears that some of the growth came from short-tail lines, I think that was up 40% this quarter and also the accident and health, and also you\u2019re planning to go on to Lloyds. Help us understand the risk management that\u2019s in place for that. This line seem to be I think under some pressure now. So help us understand what risk management put in place for that?","Dom Addesso","Well, we do have \u2013 first of all, we have our risk management committee that reports regularly to the Board, so I will point that out. And we monitor, if your question is about accumulations \u2013","Joshua Shanker","Well, I said, Dom, sort of more in the sense of \u2013 people in the industry are saying pricing has weakened these lines and we are seeing that \u2013 I mean, using growth right now from Everest, so just curious where you\u2019re finding --.","Dom Addesso","Let me just add to that, because pricing is, I would say, it\u2019s weaker. It does not mean necessarily that it\u2019s not adequate. So for example, as John Doucette highlighted in his comments, we talked about casualty being flat year-over-year, so that\u2019s kind of a reflection of what\u2019s going on in the market, perhaps what we feel are adequate returns relative to what we have seen. In the property space, we are still seeing many opportunities. A&H is a specialty segment, which experienced nice growth as well as some new product opportunities. Our contingency business\/sports and entertainment book is again a specialty business that\u2019s not necessarily subject to some of the pricing pressures that you mentioned. In addition, we have done some things in Canada, which have given us some growth. California DIC, while things have flattened out there, it\u2019s still \u2013 from a returns \u2013 just on return perspective, it\u2019s still very good business. So all of these pockets, we do monitor rates each and every month and quarter in all of our classes of business on the insurance side. ","John Doucette","And it\u2019s John. I just want to add a couple more things. You mentioned property specifically. We\u2019ve talked about this before, but I think it\u2019s worth repeating. We have one global catastrophe property and catastrophe pricing and accumulation system, which every underwriter around globe, well, insurance, facultative, treaty, IOWs, selling, buying, retro, and products we have talked about before, purple, whether it\u2019s from individual building or it\u2019s a territory, multiple territories or worldwide capacity and we have a view of risk built up by a lot of analytics and a lot \u2013 a dedicated cat team that is central and we can look at the relative pricing and the absolute pricing over time and across product irrespective of where it is, what form, what territory and we can allocate capital [Technical Difficulty] .","Operator","And pardon me, interruption, it appears that we are still experiencing some technical difficulties, please remain on the line, and we will get our speakers reconnected as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience. ","Once again, we appreciate your patience as we reconnect our speakers for today\u2019s conference. Please continue to stand by. Once again, we appreciate your patience as we reconnect our speakers for today\u2019s conference call. Please continue to stand by. Once again, we appreciate your patience as we reconnect our speakers for today\u2019s conference call. Please continue to stand by. And we\u2019ve been reconnected with our speakers.","Dom Addesso","Again, we apologize. We are going to a different room and a different phone. Let\u2019s see if this works better. So I think John was responding to the question we got cut off, is it correct?","Operator","Yes.","John Doucette","So, just to finish the thought and again, I apologize if I\u2019m repeating myself. We have one system for globally by product irrespective of the product, every underwriter on their desk has that, it rolls up for real time accumulations, real time pricing, whether it\u2019s insurance, fac, treaty, retro or any other products that we sell. We have a new Chief Underwriting Officer as part of the building out the insurance leadership team, whose job is responsible to make sure we\u2019re getting paid adequately for the risk that we\u2019re taking on a risk adjusted basis. And we continue to have the advantage of the various capital markets, convergence vehicles and structures that allow us to have capital efficiencies for the products that we sell and help the group get the most capital efficiency and the best risk adjusted return.","Joshua Shanker ","Sure. That\u2019s helpful. And are you seeing pricing on the primary side better than on the reinsurance for property?","John Doucette","It varies, it doesn\u2019t boil down necessarily to one answer, but directionally, there are certainly cases of that, yeah.","Joshua Shanker","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kai Pan","Thank you. Alright. So I would start with your take on the upcoming B court changes, what potentially impacts for the reinsurance demand?","Dom Addesso","I can\u2019t comment specifically, because I\u2019m not sure that we know all the details of those changes at this point, other than to know that we do expect that we\u2019ll have some impact for certain clients and that is, I did mention in my comments that we would expect some increase in demand and frankly that would be one of the reasons that I would expect some increase in demand, but I really can\u2019t give you any specific on what that might be for the industry as a whole.","Kai Pan","Okay. And then more broadly for the sort of upcoming renewal in Jan 1, it seems like you\u2019re more confident at this time that the rate will become more stabilized than the past renewal season. So what could go wrong from here?","Dom Addesso","Well, I suppose what could go wrong is that rates are down another 5 to 10 that would be wrong. And that would cause us to continue to make major modification to our portfolio but coming back from the two major industry events, they are certainly mixed thoughts on that subject. But given where we see the industry, where we see the returns, what we see from capital markets perspective, it doesn't look to me as if it should be a market that is continuing to slide dramatically.","Kai Pan","Okay, that's great. Then just a pick number question. Do you have a breakdown of the $6 million Tianjin losses by segments and also on Volkswagen what\u2019s your view on the industry exposure as Everest Re\u2019s exposure on that event?","Dom Addesso","The Tianjin loss by segment -- when you say segment, meaning our segments?","Kai Pan","Yes, reported segments.","Dom Addesso","I'll ask Craig to.","Craig Howie","The majority of it is in international, our international second. So essentially from our Singapore office but also from our Bermuda operation as well.","Dom Addesso","I'm sorry, what was the second question Kai?","Kai Pan","On the Volkswagen potential industry exposure there?","Dom Addesso","There I think we have something like $12 million of limits exposed to Volkswagen and we have not heard anything on that.","Kai Pan","Okay, that's great. Well, last question you might may. The insurance growth and margin looks like you\u2019re growing pretty fast, especially in short-tail and accident and health which has lower combined ratio -- underlying combined ratio than the group. So shall we expect mid-90s combined ratio continue to improve given the high growth like coming from those lower combined ratio business and also if you\u2019re stepping back, last year you have higher growth in the primary line of business was in early 2000 and which eventually doesn't help the Company. So I just wonder what give you confidence that what you're doing now that's different and your confidence by profitability going forward. Thanks.","Dom Addesso","There's a lot to that question. First of all, yes, that\u2019s certainly our plan to continue to have the insurance combined ratio to continue to trend down and we have every expectation that would happen over time. Relative to the early 2000s, well part of that growth was California comp, which actually over the very long time periods of 13 to 15 years that we\u2019re talking about was hugely profitable, yes there were periods were the comp turned into a loss for a period there but if you look at the body of work over that entire cycle, it\u2019s been extremely profitable, probably close to $1 billion of profit in total. The other parts of growth from the insurance base that emanated from the time period that you're referencing was a lot of program business and is decided we\u2019re deemphasizing the growth, our growth is primary coming from the brokerage space, the retail space, where we are underwriting risk by risk and not relying or dependent as much upon growth in the program space. Doesn't mean that we won't continue to do business with great partners in that space, it just means that we\u2019re a lot more selective than we have other way in which to grow the insurance portfolio and by that I mean direct brokerage space, we control the account and you control the underwriting at the desk level.","Kai Pan","That's great, thank you so much for all of the answers.","Operator","Thank you. Next we will move to Sarah DeWitt with JP Morgan. Please go ahead your line is open.","Sarah DeWitt","Hi, good morning. As you look out a bit longer term how'd you see the business mix evolving between insurance versus reinsurance?","Dom Addesso","Well as I mentioned in my comments, I certainly expect in the short term given what we expect out of the reinsurance space that is like to be that insurance will become a bigger part of the pie. If you look out over the very long term, I would expect that to be the case as well as we look to rebalance our portfolio. But we don\u2019t have any -- put out any procrastination [ph] about what percentage may or may not be. We frankly take advantage of what the marketplace is giving us in each part of the cycle whether that \u2013 and so if pricing is more adequate and very hard market in the reinsurance base and you are likely to see strong growth spurt there. It doesn\u2019t mean that it would necessarily be change our appetite in the insurance side, it\u2019s just a matter of which segment is growing faster than the next due to pricing adequacy.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay, thanks. And then I think historically you\u2019ve targeted a 12% to 13% ROE assuming normalized catastrophe losses, is that still an achievable goal as we think about 2016 and I think that will probably be better than the industry as well? ","Dom Addesso","If you are asking including cat losses or ex-cat losses?","Sarah DeWitt","Including some level of normalized catastrophe losses.","Dom Addesso","I do think that\u2019s potentially achievable. I don\u2019t know given where pricing is today on the reinsurance side ex-cats whether 13 might be pushing it, but again we don\u2019t forecast our results, but relative to what real rates are I think that\u2019s still a great return, but I do think our target is low teens absolutely.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay, great. Thanks for the answers.","Operator","Thank you. Next we will move to Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Meyer Shields","Great. Thanks so much. So two maybe big picture questions. One, is there any reason to expect the historical cycle in California workers\u2019 comp to not play out with this year next year looking really, really good and then things getting worse?","Dom Addesso","I don\u2019t know that on any line of business that I would fight any historical side. So there are cycles in every segment of our business and I don\u2019t know why California comp would be any different than any other segment of the business.","Meyer Shields","Okay, me neither. Second, setting aside pricing trends in underwriting decision, is there any risk to the reinsurance book from the efforts you have in insurance in general or maybe opening a Lloyd\u2019s platform from companies that you are not competing with more directly?","Dom Addesso","I think that risk is moderate at worst. I think as you look across the industry landscape most enterprises have both an insurance and a reinsurance footprint, even to the point where some more traditional insurance enterprises have started up reinsurance arms. So I don\u2019t see that as much of a threat. And in particular, what we do in the insurance side is mostly specialty lines business. ","Meyer Shields","Right, understood. Is the run rate for expenses and insurance likely to rise as Lloyd\u2019s goes live?","Dom Addesso","Well, we\u2019ve already \u2013 in our numbers already this year to date we\u2019ve expended some monies to get this project off the ground and certainly Lloyd\u2019s does have slightly higher expense ratio, but given the amount of premium relative to our $5 billion of gross premium across the organization I am not sure that it would -- really make much of a difference.","Meyer Shields","That makes sense. Great, thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And we will take our final question from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ian Gutterman","Great, thanks. I guess on the insurance business, is there any -- as the book is growing and changing, is there any seasonality to it? I guess the reason I ask is, normally Q3 has been a little higher than the first two quarters, but this year was much higher. Is there something seasonal about that or is that just the increased growth and this is -- think of this as sort of more of a normalized?","Dom Addesso","Well, the insurance side, remember, is influenced by crop which does have seasonality to it. To the extent that there is some seasonality that would come from property E&S book to the extent that we have some of that in south-eastern US. They haven't had any major events, so there hasn\u2019t been losses coming from that and again property E&S to the extent that it\u2019s growing and it has been growing in the north-east, could have some impact from winter storms, so yeah, there will be packets of seasonality across the portfolio. John wanted to add something.","Ian Gutterman","Okay. Got it. Okay.","John Doucette","The second part of your question was the type of growth initiatives and we've been talking about growth initiatives and we've been putting in place a lot of different resources, we've been hiring talent, we've been building the infrastructure on the insurance side and that takes time. We've been talking about that for several quarters and it\u2019s starting to kick in, including in this third quarter and we\u2019re seeing the fruits of the plan and the resources and the labor that we've committed to growing the insurance book. So it's that combined with the seasonality Dom alluded to.","Ian Gutterman","Got it. And I clearly realized both, I just don\u2019t know if I should just kind of a little bit of the magnitude of the increase this quarter, I was always trying to get at, but okay and then moving on I guess just a follow-up on the Lloyds question, can you talk more about specific business plan, I mean I don't know if, what stack capacity you've been approved for, what sort of lines of business you are targeting initially, is it going to be prop type stuff or might be just try to do like holders or even some casualties, what's the focus going to be?","John Doucette","It's -- a significant portion of it is professional liability, D&O, E&O commercial D&O and E&O. We also are -- we will have some reinsurance business that will flow through the syndicate, particularly as our China and perhaps our Australian business because of expense advantages of running it through the platform relative to keeping in on the reinsurance company paper, because particularly changes in China from a regulatory perspective, we won\u2019t have to bricks and mortar in China, that\u2019s one example. We will be granting cover holder status to a number of underwriting units around the globe to utilize the syndicate that will be some sports and entertainment business for example and contingency business that would come into the syndicate generally.","Dom Addesso","And the stamp capacity is $150 million roughly.","Ian Gutterman","Got it, great. Thank you. And then on Tianjin, this feels to me, I guess, I'm asking for your opinion and maybe some detail as well. It feels to me like this is one of those losses maybe like a deep water or a costa where it is just so hard to, it seems the primaries themselves don't really have any great insight into what the losses and it seems to me when we get these events, they tend to creep over time. Does this feel like one of those where you\u2019re worried about creep and if so as you are looking at how much put up this quarter and how did you account for that?","John Doucette","Well, I'm not sure that it is really like costa, custom because with that, it was a salvage situation and that really is what was driving up the cost tremendously. Here, you have frankly complete destruction, my understanding is that the area has been completely levelled and I don't know that because there are discrete values, I think that that would be less of an issue as contrasting with costa.","I guess the other question would be maybe the more uncertainly would revolve around any kind of BI, contingent BI claims that might be coming out of it, but again we reserved it at the high end of the range based on the estimates. As I mentioned before in answer to another question, our participation in the region is actually reduced. So we\u2019re feeling comfortable with our pick, but I'm not sure that any movement around that pick is necessarily all that material.","Ian Gutterman","Perfect. And then just lastly, just a follow-up on the B court question from earlier, what about as far as your handwriting appetite, does anything potentially change there and I think one of the more key topics on that is the changes in the tail factor on cat, does that have to change how you would look at tail beyond 250 or maybe how you look at aggregate covers, occurrence covers things like that, especially your appetite to write them. ","John Doucette","So we have always looked at in terms of pricing and accumulation, all points on the curve to one in ten thousand and beyond, we look at AO, we look at annual occurrence, we look at aggregate, we look at multiple events, we look at things that happen whether it was 2005 or Katrina, Rita, William \u2013 Wilma or 2011 with multiple events around the world. So we think about that as we create, manage our book and try to get the best risk adjusted return. In general, [indiscernible] which we think it will increase demand and therefore increase limit that\u2019s going to be purchased potentially by our customers and therefore upward pressure on pricing, that\u2019s a good thing. And we have the capital to support that and \u2013 including both our own equity capital and the various hedges that we\u2019ve been talking about for many quarters now that we have put in place. So we think that\u2019s going to put upward pressure and upward demand and we like that. ","Ian Gutterman ","Great, thanks so much. Good luck guys. ","Dom Addesso","Now, I understand from the moderator that that was the last question, but because of our interruptions, if there are other questions, we certainly would stand a few minutes. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And it appears, we have no further questions at this time. ","Dom Addesso","Okay, that\u2019s fine, just [indiscernible].","Beth Farrell","Thank you, and as always, we\u2019ll see you next quarter. ","John Doucette","Thank you.","Dom Addesso","Thank you very much. And gain, apologies for the connection issues we have had. We appreciate the interest. Again, we think we\u2019ve had an excellent. We\u2019ve had some events, but I think what you\u2019ve seen the way Everest has performed with the scale and diversification of our book, despite those industry losses, we are still able to produce very, very good returns, and I think it\u2019s just a reflection of how we manage our book of business. Thanks again for your interest. ","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect any time and have a great day. "],"8435":["Everest Re Group, Ltd.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introduction, I'd like to turn the conference over to Beth Farrell. Please go ahead.","Elizabeth B. Farrell","Thank you, Tim. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's fourth quarter 2011 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Taranto, the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dom Addesso, our President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the likes are subject to various risks.","As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph V. Taranto \u2013 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","","Thanks, Beth. Good morning. There has never been a year-end where I've been so pleased to see the prior year over with and the new year begin. That is to have the losses behind us so we can move into the opportunities that those losses have created going forward. Despite dealing with historic high for industry catastrophe losses, our balance sheet remains strong with capital in excess of $6 billion. This strength will serve us well as we move into 2012.","I'm optimistic about our prospects for 2012. Let me tell you why. First, our reinsurance portfolio will be much improved from the changes in our property catastrophe reinsurance portfolio. Property catastrophe rates, terms and conditions have improved throughout 2011, continued to improve at January 1, 2012, and I believe will continue to improve into April Japanese business.","Property reinsurance has become an increasingly important part of our operation as we move towards the best opportunities in the marketplace. At January 1, we saw rate increases on the order of 15% for retro business, 5% to 10% for catastrophe clients around the world if they didn't have losses and much greater increases if they did. Churns improved as well. As a consequence, we have meaningfully increased our expected margin on this business and yet not increased our PMLs in any peak zones.","Second, we have a significant transformation going on in our insurance operation that I believe will lead to much improved results in 2012. Roughly 20% of our 2012 insurance book will be written by Heartland, our crop insurance company. This book has made a profit the vast majority of years it has been in business and weather permitting should do so again in 2012. About 30% of our 2012 business will be workers' compensation, primarily in California.","Our year-end reserve review led to increased reserves which revised our view of 2011 profitability. We have achieved roughly 15% rate increases throughout 2011 and continue to get increases of that magnitude in January. I expect we will continue to achieve increases throughout the rest of 2012 as other companies top-up reserves. We project 2012 to generate an underwriting profit on the back of these increases.","About 15% of our businesses is written our professional liability unit. This unit has produced an underwriting profit for the past three years, and I expect another good year in 2012. The remainder of our insurance book includes our medical stop-loss business, which has been running to an underwriting profit, and our general liability and property business where we are achieving our targeted rate increases. Put it all together and the expectation is for a good year ahead.","Whereas I would not characterize the current market as a hard market, the positive changes in the property catastrophe reinsurance market, coupled with the improvements we anticipate in our insurance segment should make for a meaningful positive change for Everest. If you project catastrophes at a more normalized level, it should produce very solid earnings, much of which could be used for stock buyback. Dom?","Dominic J. Addesso","","Thank you, Joe. Good morning. I will begin my comments this morning by outlining the major events that have impacted our earnings for the quarter and year-to-date.","At this point, we are all familiar with the events that have affected our industry, which in total were in excess of $100 billion. For the year, our cat losses pre-tax were $1.3 billion, which is less than 1.5% of the projected industry losses. Given the size of these industry events, our share of losses were within modeled outcomes. And as reflected in our various risk management scenarios, our capital position remained intact as these events despite their significance were largely absorbed through earnings.","The details on the events for the year which highlights how unusual the year was are as follows; [indiscernible] earthquake, $532 million; New Zealand earthquake, $306 million; Thailand floods, $225 million; U.S. tornadoes, $61 million; Brisbane floods, $56 million; Hurricane Irene, $38 million; Cyclone Yasi, $20 million; Canadian fires, $13 million; and a cat IBNR of $50 million.","In the fourth quarter, the pre-tax losses were $380 million. The largest event was Thailand at $225 million. The other impacts were from events earlier in the year, most notably, Japan at $52 million, New Zealand at $37 million. Due to the complexity of these losses, the industry has seen continued development. In recognition of this, our reserves include IBNR of $50 million for potential development relating to all 2011 cat events.","Overall, the impact of cat losses in the quarter after-tax and reinstatement premium was $246 million, and on a year-to-date basis was approximately $960 million. As mentioned, on a pre-tax basis these losses were $380 million for the quarter and $1.3 billion year-to-date, which brings to light the fact that the underlying attritional results are improving year-over-year as a result of portfolio changes and rate increases.","Excluding cat and related reinstatement premium, the underwriting gain was $480 million for the year compared to $435 million in 2010. This is reflected in the current year to-date attritional loss ratio, which stood at 60% for 2011, compared with 61.2% in the prior year. This improvement is solely due to the reinsurance segments, which improved just over two points to an attritional combined ratio ex-cats and reinstates of 83.5% as a result of the rate increases and the portfolio shift from pro rata to excess of loss contracts.","This is expected to carry over into 2012 as certain pro rata contracts continue to run off. The attritional results for insurance showed little change year-over-year. This was a result of the crop book having an underwriting loss due to drought conditions and acquisition related costs, as well as higher accident year loss selections on other lines based on the year-end reserve studies.","These studies indicated a need for reserve strengthening mainly in workers' compensation and excess casualty, resulting in adjustments to prior years as well as the current year. However, rate increases in California workers' comp, 15% in 2011, which was over and above the 9% achieved in 2010, in addition to more normalized crop results, and the discontinuation of a select number of underperforming programs should result in meaningful improvements in the 2012 loss ratios. It is expected that these changes alone could lead to a 7 to 8 point improvement in accident year results.","Offsetting the reserve developments in the insurance segment was continued favorable emergence in the reinsurance segments overall. To complete the discussion on underwriting operations, both net premiums written and net premiums earned were up approximately 4% for the year. This increase is primarily being driven by the new business in our insurance segment, namely crop insurance and primary accident and health. Offsetting this was a decline in reinsurance premium, primarily driven by the shift from pro rata to excess.","In the fourth quarter, the reinsurance net premium written shows an 11% increase, with no corresponding increase in earned premiums due to an account written at the end of the quarter, as well as the cancellation of a large program in 2010. Finally, regarding overall operations, I will note that the expense ratio year-over-year is down slightly. This is mainly driven by a 2 point reduction in commission expense in the insurance segment, due to a change in the mix of business.","Turning to the other key elements of operating results, investment income was down on both the yearly and quarterly comparisons. The primary driver of this is the difference in income from limited partnerships. Nevertheless, after adjusting for these impacts, net investment income is still down slightly as a result of declining reinvestment rates. However, cash flow remains positive at $660 million for the year, which has helped to offset declining interest rates.","Realized gains were positive, in particular for the fourth quarter. And when combined with the underwriting results, investment income and tax benefits, it resulted in net income for the quarter of $41 million and a loss for the year of $80 million. Other comprehensive income was a loss for the quarter of $36 million, but a gain for the year of $35 million.","Essentially, there were unrealized gains for the year and quarter, offset by translation losses and a pension liability adjustment, which hit mainly in the fourth quarter. The net effect was a slight comprehensive loss for the year and a slight gain for the quarter, which means that the decline in shareholders' equity for the quarter and year primarily a result of dividends and share buybacks. This leaves our capital position in excess of $6 billion and, therefore, well positioned from market opportunities and potential future share repurchases.","Thank you, and now I'll turn it back to Beth for Q&A.","Elizabeth B. Farrell","Yeah, Tim, we are open for questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Matthew Heimermann with J.P. Morgan.","Matthew G. Heimermann \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC","","Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the underlying loss ratio. I think, you sufficiently addressed the insurance side in terms of suggesting it to 700 to 800 basis points of improvement there potentially in 2012 versus 2011. But just curious, is that when you make that comment; is that kind of where you think the book will be on a written basis or an earned basis in 2012?","Dominic J. Addesso","","That would be on an earned basis.","Matthew G. Heimermann \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC","","Okay. And then, you also -- it also look like there were some noise in the U. S. reinsurance segment and I don't think you address this in -- that in your opening comment. Could you just -- could you touch on that as well?","Dominic J. Addesso","","Noise in what respect, Matt?","Matthew G. Heimermann \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC","","Just for -- relative to our expectations, the underlying loss ratios are a little higher. So, given we also saw some adverse there, I was wondering if it was maybe impacted by either a change to the current year -- current accident year loss ratio in the fourth quarter? Or if there were attritional losses that didn't qualify as gaps in the quarter or anything like that?","Dominic J. Addesso","","Okay. I guess the first thing I'll point out is the attritional loss ratio for the U.S. reinsurance all -- I'm sorry, for all reinsurance segments, year-over-year was positive, right? If you're referencing the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter had a little bit of a tick-up because we did have some late reported -- from a number of contracts, late order was reported in the fourth quarter with an increase in current year losses.","This came through our loss reserve metrics that we -- outside of our reserve studies and we booked those events in the fourth quarter. So, it really is a current year event. There was some movement depending on the buckets prior year reserves, but overall there was positive development on the reinsurance segments on our -- for loss reserves.","Matthew G. Heimermann \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC","","And then --","Dominic J. Addesso","","As far as the current year is concerned, year-over-year, which is a much better metric to look at, is improving and we would expect that trend to continue.","Matthew G. Heimermann \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC","","That's fair. Do have the -- can you quantify the 4Q noise related to the late report even just ballpark it?","Dominic J. Addesso","","It was in the range of $30 million, I believe.","Matthew G. Heimermann \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC","","Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess, was there anything that affected your ability to buy back stock in the fourth quarter because when I listen to you talk about capital, it sounds like you've got more than enough capital to kind of support the growth opportunities especially given that you are talking about seeing growth without -- in premium without seeing growth in PML. So, just curious on that.","Joseph V. Taranto","","Sure, Matt. First of all, you're right. We have plenty of capital to buy back and we certainly plan to buy back going forward. We will be in coming quarter buying back. Yes, what affected things in the fourth quarter was -- for the most part was the Thai floods.","I mean once they happened and we had to get our arms around them and we clearly had information that others on the outside didn't have as we were trying to put together the sums. If there is anything big and important that's going on that we had more information than the outside world, we just don't buy back and that really is what affected us as we went through the fourth quarter.","Matthew G. Heimermann \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC","","Okay, that's helpful.","Dominic J. Addesso","","Early in -- Matt, early in the quarter, recognized that we're basically out of the market until we come out with third quarter earnings so -- and then soon thereafter, of course, is when Thailand happened.","Matthew G. Heimermann \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC","","Yeah.","Dominic J. Addesso","","And we did buy back some shares in the fourth quarter, a modest amount, but we did.","Matthew G. Heimermann \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC","","Okay. And then just --","Joseph V. Taranto","","It just goes back before the Thai floods happened.","Matthew G. Heimermann \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC","","You had a couple days, I guess.","Joseph V. Taranto","","Yeah.","Dominic J. Addesso","","Yeah.","Matthew G. Heimermann \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC","","The last question just -- I'm sorry for all the -- sorry for the numbers questions. But just -- I just wanted to make sure that I'm thinking about the taxes correctly, so specifically the net investment income, I was just hoping you could give us a sense of what the tax rate was on the recurring investment income because the tax rate ended up being a lot lower and I wasn't sure if there was a shield on the alternatives or what was happening there in terms of mix of tax rates?","Dominic J. Addesso","","Well, the tax rate has not bounced around all that much. We disclosed the effective tax rate in our supplemental information. For the year, it was 13.7% that contrasts with 12.7% a year ago. The only volatility -- there's two things that drive that. One would be our mix of tax exempts to taxables, which we did have some shift last year in that.","And secondly, the income from limited partnerships can be a driver in that. Some of that income is offshore, but it depends on where the income from limited partnerships is coming from, but I'm not sure that the volatility around that number is all that great in terms of being able to use it as a basis for projecting.","Matthew G. Heimermann \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC","","All right, much appreciated, thank you.","Dominic J. Addesso","","Okay. Thank you, Matt.","Operator","","We will take our next question from Vinay Misquith from Evercore Partners.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.","","Hi, good morning. Could you add some color to your exposure to the Thai flood losses and whether you have some uncapped quota shares there and what is the possibility of reserve development should the industry loss rise in that area?","Joseph V. Taranto","","Well, I'll start, Dom, and see if you want to add anything. I think a few points to make with regard to the Thai losses, first, I think it's important to note that the insurance policies in Thailand sub-limits both flood coverage and business interruption, which meaningfully contains the loss.","Second point I guess that I would like to make is that we have posted reserve at the high end of any industry estimates that we have seen. And of course, I would add, third, that we've also established a $50 million reserve for additional IBNR for the 2011 cats. So, I think when you take those things into consideration, we're in good shape. Dom?","Dominic J. Addesso","","I think that states it, I mean, we do have quarter shares in Thailand. But as Joe says, those coverages that are affected here are sub-limited, as well as there is not 100% take-up rate on that book of business as well. Vinay, did that answer your question?","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.","","Yeah, that's helpful. Thank you. The second point is on the fixed maturity securities, we saw the investment income decline about $7 million sequentially. So were there some one-time items in that or do you expect that to continue in the future?","Dominic J. Addesso","","Well, there's clearly a headwind as it relates to investment income, given reinvestment rates which we're all familiar with. I guess, I would -- to maybe help us think through this. We've estimated that our maturities and calls and that's why I say it's an estimate because we have to also consider potential calls and pay downs on mortgage backs. We'll be about $1 billion for 2012. So the average, if you take the average of that of course throughout the year that's $500 million.","And the differential in reinvestment rates, call it 250 basis points or 300 basis points. But if you just use the high end of that number, 300 basis points, that's essentially $15 million headwind on the investment income side. Offsetting that of course will be positive cash flow that we anticipate as well, that will not make up that full $15 million, of course, if that in fact turns out to be what reinvestment rates are for 2012. So that will give you a window on the fixed income side.","On the -- I know you didn't ask this, but just to complete the picture on investment income, on the limited partnership side, we have about $500 million of limited partnership investments. Our long-term return to date has been around 8%, 7% to 8%. So, you can think about that number in that context, so that would give you about $40 million estimate on limited partnerships. Having said that, in more recent years, those results have been ticking up slightly better, so I think that's a relatively conservative number.","There will be volatility around that, of course, given the fact that we do have the marks based on what's happening in the overall equity markets. But directionally, I think that might give you some guidance on the investment income. Is that helpful, Vinay?","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.","","Yes, it's very helpful. Thank you. One last thing, if I may. The earned premiums in the U.S. insurance segment were lower this quarter, were there some timing issues regarding the Ag premiums this quarter?","Dominic J. Addesso","","I don't believe so. I think we had some adjustments in the third quarter on the Ag book, but I can't -- I don't have the specifics of that with me right now. But I think --","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.","","Thank you.","Dominic J. Addesso","","Just look at the annual premium, I think that will give you a fix on what the quarterly impacts would be.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.","","Sure, fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","","And we'll take our next question from Amit Kumar with Macquarie.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","","Thanks and good morning. Just going back to the last question, if I understand this correctly, if the flooding loss continues to go up for the industry, what you are saying is that your number will not increase proportionately because of the sub-limits and I guess Dom, allocated IBNR should take care of any additional development. Did I understand that correctly?","Dominic J. Addesso","","I think that's a fair way to characterize. Our numbers that we put up excluding the IBNR that was referenced would translate into approximately a $17 billion industry event. And then, of course, we have an IBNR number that is available for that event as well as any other events that occur during 2011. So given the fact that we reserved at a very high industry loss level, therefore, our expectation is that we would not have any development on that number. I think that's probably bit more accurate way to say it.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","","Got it, that's helpful. The other question I have is in the opening remarks you mentioned that your PMLs were flat. I just wanted to sort of reconfirm that number. The one in 250, is that close to 11% or 12% or has that number changed?","Joseph V. Taranto","","No that's still a good estimate on the PMLs and we are still finalizing our one-one bookings, so we don't have a precise number on that, but generally, the trend has been down relative to year ago.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","","Got it. And then -- sorry, go ahead.","Joseph V. Taranto","","In other words our expectation for 1\/1 comparison to 1\/1. It's not a statement about what that might look like at 4\/1 or 6\/1 et cetera.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","","Okay, just one last question. On the California comp markets, I think you mentioned that you expect an underwriting profit. I know you talked about the rate increases. I wanted to get some color on the other side, the loss cost trends and your expectations going forward on the margins? Thanks.","Dominic J. Addesso","","Our reserve position at the end of the year contemplate general industry loss cost trends, as well as exposure trends, which for California work comp are in excess of 6% on frequency severity trends and in excess of 4% for exposure trend. And those would be used in our anticipated results and pricing needs for 2012.","Joseph V. Taranto","","And we've been getting 15% rate increases including through January of 2012. So we're outstripping that and then another 5%-ish on top of that, which should move the loss ratio and the combined ratio down for 2012. And I think put it into a modest underwriting position, that's our current projection.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","","I'm sorry. What was that 5% you mentioned?","Joseph V. Taranto","","Well, I guess, Dom was saying, you can put in medical inflation and if you come up with 10%-ish, but if you ever get increases of 15%, you've kind of taken care of the 10% and add 5% to the good.","Dominic J. Addesso","","Right. We have a 5% exposure trend I think is which we're what could be coming in as well.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","","Got it. And that the 15% that is the, I guess that is the actual net rate, which is being passed on the consumers right?","Joseph V. Taranto","","That's correct. And that's what we achieved throughout 2011 and so far what we've achieved in the early part of 2012.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","","That's pretty good. Okay, that's all I have for now. Thanks.","Operator","","And we'll take our next question from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.","","Thanks. I just had one general question, as you think about capital and from your comments in upfront. If you had to pick one, what's more important to you, ROE or book value?","Joseph V. Taranto","","I don't know that I would -- I don't know if there's an answer to that question. I think they're both very important to us and I guess they both really tie together. We do look at both of it, for us, as growth in book value per share.","Dominic J. Addesso","","And plus dividends.","Joseph V. Taranto","","Plus dividends, yeah.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.","","All right. I guess just thinking, I mean, if my math is right. I mean, every -- at this price every 1% reduction in share count is worth about $0.25 a share in book. I mean just, as you look out at the business that you like, which sounds like, it's more property cat, how do you balance the trade-off of potentially absorbing more capital there versus the buyback? And I'm sure this is something you think about all the time, just to understand kind of where you think about the edge given that choice, I would appreciate if that's possible. And just on follow-up. Thanks.","Joseph V. Taranto","","Sure. I think I'd first say that given the losses and dislocations in the Cat market, there are some very good opportunities this year that we certainly want to avail ourselves to. And we're doing it in such a way where our mantra, if you will, is more premium tighter terms less PML. So in that sense, it's going to consume a lot less capital and hopefully generate some very good profit.","And so it's a terrific opportunity. At the same time, it's also a very good opportunity in our opinion to -- with the buyback stock and that's why we intend to pursue both. And it's a little bit of a balancing act, but both provide some very good opportunity and we will proceed along both fronts.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.","","All right. And -- I'm sorry, Dom.","Dominic J. Addesso","Let me add to that.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.","","Sure.","Dominic J. Addesso","","Our growth in book value per share up to 2011 has been approximately 13%, book value per share plus dividend growth. Of course, prior to 2011, it was close to 14%. And any new transactions that we're obviously contemplating are changes to the portfolio are with an eye towards putting those transactions on at levels that would increase or come in above those types of returns.","And I know that's not precisely getting to your question, but I think it does give you some view as to how we're looking at. In addition, keep in mind, again, relative to share buybacks, there are other factors. Those other factors are rating agencies and maintaining a strong rating in the marketplace and having some amount of capital available for the market opportunity. So, it isn't just the pure Excel spreadsheet numbers.","Joseph V. Taranto","","That's right. I mean this year, 2011, demonstrates that -- I think it served us very well to have a very strong capital position in 2011. I would like to add to Dom's comment that that record of 13% compounded including 2011 is what we have achieved over the last 16 years and our plan is to beat that record going forward. We think we have the opportunities and the resources to do that.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.","","Great. And then just one follow-up, if I could. On the book kind of tilting more towards property cap than it has in the past, can you talk about what sort of business you are focused on, is it still sort of your low layer preference, is it more U.S. versus outside the U.S., and generally, are you seeing -- do you feel like you are seeing better rate in the book that you are binding versus the market overall? Thanks.","Joseph V. Taranto","","Well, clearly, the market is seeing increases, but I think we are in a position where we clearly want to achieve those rate increases, terms improvements, otherwise we just move elsewhere. There is a lot of good opportunities at this point. I think they will continue to develop, as I said, as we go forward including Japan and even into the Florida business in June and the other business in July.","So, there are opportunities both internationally and in the U.S. and when you say the U.S., different parts of the U.S. January 1 wasn't so much Florida business, that's the middle of the year, but I think with RMS 11 and what's going on in the world, I think that will continue to climb when we get into that. So, we are just in a position where we are picking and choosing the best opportunities that come to us and at the same time being very conscious of the PML.","As I said, I think we will have a much bigger margin on that business. I'd expect we probably will write $100 million to $150 million of additional premium in cat premium in 2012 versus 2011. And with that, our overall worldwide exposures will actually be down and the PMLs in peak zones will be down.","Dominic J. Addesso","","And also we do not look at the marketplace and say, we're tilting towards the U.S. or any other particular market, it's where the opportunities present itself. So, for example, Europe wind we feel is relatively under-priced, so in that particular area going into 2012, that's an area that we're managing down. We wrote more business this year in the Midwest given where pricing is going, but it's really looking at what opportunities the marketplace is giving you as opposed to tilting towards any particular geography.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.","","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","","And we will take our next question from Ian Gutterman with Adage Capital.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Advisors, LLC","","Hi, guys, just a couple clarifications. On the U.S. reinsurance, did I hear what the prior period adverse development was for, I know you talked about the accident year, but I am not quite sure you touched on where the adverse was from?","Dominic J. Addesso","","That was primarily excess casualty book.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Advisors, LLC","","And what years on that, recent years or older years?","Dominic J. Addesso","","It's a variety of years.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Advisors, LLC","","Okay, got it.","Dominic J. Addesso","","[indiscernible] Ian.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Advisors, LLC","","No, that's okay. And you obviously commented on expected improvement in the cat reinsurance and insurance accident years. What about the other books of reinsurance business the Bermuda book, the international book, are those expected to improve as well?","Joseph V. Taranto","","Let me slice that a little differently for you, Ian. You are right when we talk about the insurance book and cat book, we are probably roughly talking about half of our worldwide premium. And I didn't comment a whole lot on the other half. Now, the other half is probably 25% of the worldwide businesses that are non-cat property business U.S. and international, and I'd say 20% of our worldwide business is casualty reinsurance and then another 5% might be surety and A&H and other lines of business.","Now, the reason I didn't comment on that is nothing dramatic is happening in that half like it was happening in the cat world or is happening in the insurance transformation that we have going on. We do expect to achieve an underwriting profit, modest ones in all of that 50%, both of those pieces. But again, in the non-cat property world, we've made some improvements in selection and our clients have been able to get some modest rate increases. But there is nothing to report to you that is particularly different.","On the casualty side, I would say the same. We've kind of shrunk that down. As we've kind of gone to core clients with casualty rates particularly in the U.S. going down for the last number of years. We are seeing some flattening and some uptick in pockets there. I know many are getting more optimistic about that space and probably in the less optimistic category there. So I would say that other half of our book we expect it to do reasonably well, but it's not changing dramatically from 2012 versus 2011.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Advisors, LLC","","Okay, got it. And Dom, just to clarify to make sure using the right number on the insurance, the seven to eight points for improvement you were talking about that was versus the full year, so that gets it to about a breakeven for the 2012?","Dominic J. Addesso","","Yeah. And I guess to some degree it being a little bit conservative and I was just really referencing those changes, right. There will be other things that will be impacting positively the insurance book that Joe referenced that could in fact lead to a better result than that.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Advisors, LLC","","Okay, great. And then just last one. Joe, you talked about 1:1 renewal for cat, can you talk about outside of cat, did you grow your book, keep it the same shrink it and maybe what lines drift up or down?","Joseph V. Taranto","","Well, I think a kind of was just given you that, Ian, in the non-cat property and then the casualty, it really wasn't a dramatic change for us.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Advisors, LLC","","Okay.","Joseph V. Taranto","","It was pretty much the same. So, the areas that are really changing for us are in cat side in terms of additional margin and I think the insurance side, where we are, but the comp getting increase is although that that's not going to be anything like what we achieved in terms of combines in 2003, 2004 and 2005. We do think it will be in the black.","We are hopeful for bigger margins in the crop business and in our A&H business and some of the other parts of the insurance business. Put it all together and again I just think it will make for better margins and less volatility, I don't think it will make for dramatic top line worldwide increases in premiums, although, I do expect them to be up.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Advisors, LLC","","Sounds good. Thank you very much.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We'll take our next question from Sarah Dewitt with Barclays Capital.","Sarah Dewitt \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Hi, good morning. Could you give us some more color on what drove the reserve strengthening in U.S. insurance and how should we think about that going forward?","Dominic J. Addesso","","Well certainly, at the end of the third quarter, based on some interim testing that we were doing, we saw some weakness in our California work comp, the work comp in general and our excess casualty portfolio and we did put up additional reserves in the third quarter. That of course was subject to reserve review in the fourth quarter, which clearly the third quarter trends were certainly indicative of what we needed to do in the fourth quarter.","And at this point, we certainly anticipate that that reserve is appropriately booked, in fact, we booked above our midpoint estimate in both of those areas, but also keep in mind that whether it's California comp or excess casualty, those are just couple of reserve buckets relative to our overall $10 billion of reserves and 200-plus reserve categories that we monitor. And from time to time, we're going to get pluses and minuses in any one of those 200-plus reserve buckets.","And of course, this has been something that has been -- that we've seen for the last two years here. But we do think obviously that we've captured that. And again, I'll point to the fact that, if you look back at our core reserves overall, those have developed positively for us over in the last few years in total. So, and that's what's most important to us, is the overall reserve adequacy of the enterprise.","Sarah Dewitt \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Okay, thanks. And then on the premium growth, it's been a bit lumpy and was very strong this quarter. How should we be thinking about the pace of that going forward?","Joseph V. Taranto","","Well, again, as I mentioned, I think we will grow top line 2012 versus 2011. I do not think it will be dramatic. I would not put out a number, if you will, I mean in the cat space, as I said, we'll do more premium. But in the non-cat property there are some switches who will be going from pro rata to excess of loss and the same may be true in some other parts of our book. When you put it all together, I think it will be modest top line growth, but more margin and hopefully better loss ratio when combined.","Dominic J. Addesso","","Some of that that you see there is currency fluctuations. It's -- if you take out some of the currency impacts, it's not quite as lumpy as you would -- one might assume from just looking at the numbers.","Sarah Dewitt \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Great, thanks for the answers.","Operator","","And at this time, there are no other questions in queue. I'll turn it back to our presenters for any closing remarks.","Elizabeth B. Farrell","","Thank you for participating on the call.

On the call today are Dom Addesso, the company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, President and CEO of Insurance Operations.","Before we begin, please note that the company\u2019s SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, statements made during today\u2019s call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. Actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. The SEC filings have full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements.","Now, let me turn the call over to Dom Addesso.","Dom Addesso","Thank you. Good morning and thanks for joining our call this morning. The second quarter of 2018 was a decidedly mixed quarter for Everest. Surely, the bottom line results were not where we wanted them to be driven by the reserve charge we pre-announced. Nonetheless, it was another quarter of the successful execution of our strategy. We had a lot of success executing on the opportunities that have been presented to us in the market. We have seen strong premium growth both in our insurance and reinsurance business. Plus in both segments, our underwriting and re-underwriting actions have driven improvements in the attritional loss ratio and the profit margin embedded in our portfolio. Of course, the progress towards our strategic objectives is masked by the reserve charge. No doubt, this adjustment was disappointing. And while it reflects some broader underlying trends going on in the market, in reality we know it will require us to improve and make changes to recognize these trends.","The underlying cause of the reserve shortfall can be attributed to two factors, which were not apparent to us at year end. First, our clients are seeing a large number of reopened claims largely stemming from the AOB threat in Florida. Ceding companies were trying to settle claims quickly conceivably to mitigate the AOB issue. The loss reports we received from clients showed a high percentage of closed claims very clearly and we were encouraged by these reports. Settling claims quickly was initially a sound strategy, but what we now know is that this approach left our clients vulnerable when the actual repair bills came in higher than what they originally closed their claim. To a lesser extent, but for the same reasons, the claims reopening, has impacted Puerto Rico after Maria as well driving up losses, which crystallized in the second quarter. The reality was that these closed claim statistics we were seeing were a false positive.","The second factor was the extraordinary rise relative to past events in loss adjustment expenses. The expense numbers we are seeing are significantly above our historical data. In fact we saw some treaties experience high 30s and even 40% expense loads. Again, these numbers only began to emerge in the second quarter claim reports. Both of these factors reopened claims and a much higher than expected LAE were the overwhelming reasons for the increases we saw. Our reserves at year end for our core reinsurance cat portfolio contemplated demand surge, but these developments were beyond anything seen before. In addition, when coupled with the California wildfires, it had a leveraged impact on our aggregate retro book. I would refer to this as the cliff factor. In other words, our previous analysis had many of our clients\u2019 retro accounts not attaching, now some are very much in the money. So while these are the observations, it demands that we respond to what maybe the new normal. Going forward, cat pricing will need to reflect a higher level of loss adjustment expenses, particularly for those accounts that rely heavily on third-party adjustment services.","While some of the LAE level was driven by scarcity of resources due to multiple, almost simultaneous events, for example, citizens doubled their standard adjusted fees due to the shortage created by Hurricane Harvey. Our pricing needs to better consider this new reality, plus our reserving process going forward needs to be refined to consider these factors when there are multiple events as seen in 2017. This commentary I have just gone through hopefully clarifies the circumstances and our recognition that we need to respond appropriately to changing market conditions. However, while we did temporarily get the scorekeeping wrong make no mistake that we are playing the game at a high level and we will continue to do so. Our profits from our cat portfolio were $3.5 billion over the last 5 years. This business comes with volatility, but the appropriate reward for the risk is evident.","Finally, given the extraordinary circumstances of the 2017 cats and the separate process we use in setting cat reserves versus non-cat reserves, our review of our current reserves finds no read across on the adequacy of our non-cat reserves. We are very comfortable that our track record of conservatively setting our non-cat reserves continues. While these catastrophes obviously dominate the conversation, I would reiterate that other key parts of the organization are doing excellent and the attritional results are reflective of that. It is critical. The continued improvement is adding profitable diversification to our portfolio. The reinsurance portfolio has seen continued growth in mortgage and other credit related business as well as a revival of our casualty book, where pricing has improved considerably allowing us to entertain more deals. Overall, reinsurance premiums earned have risen almost 30% in the first half of the year to $2.5 billion, with an attritional combined ratio of 81.7%. This is an encouraging result as we move into the second half. The improvements in the attritional results reflect the trend we noted in the first quarter.","The insurance business continues its growth trajectory, where premiums earned in the first half have increased by 17%. This growth number is understated due to the cancellation and re-underwriting of certain legacy parts of that portfolio. In fact, the new business initiatives, along with the existing go-forward portfolios, have grown almost 30% or $300 million. As a result of re-underwriting and new growth areas, the book is now demonstrating more consistent profitability. The improving trend in the attritional is illustrated in the investor deck. Our new products are now earning in as you will note by comparing earned premium to written, which should continue to improve our margins. We are well-positioned to produce a good second half.","Thank you. And my colleagues will elaborate further and they of course welcome your questions at the end. Craig?","Craig Howie","Thank you, Dom and good morning everyone. Everest had net income of $70 million in the second quarter of 2018. This compares to net income of $246 million for the second quarter of 2017. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $280 million compared to $537 million for the first half of 2017. The quarter and year-to-date results were impacted by current and prior year catastrophe losses. Net income included $9 million of net after-tax realized capital losses compared to $50 million of capital gains in the first half of 2017. The 2018 capital losses were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on the public equity portfolio. After-tax operating income for the second quarter was $40 million compared to $234 million in 2017. Operating income year-to-date was $260 million compared to $501 million for the first 6 months of 2017. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $20 million for the first half compared to an underwriting gain of $313 million in the same period last year. The year-to-date combined ratio for the group was 99.4% compared to 88.3% reported in the first half of 2017 impacted by the higher catastrophe losses in 2018.","In the second quarter of 2018, the company reported a $400 million pre-tax increase in its estimates for prior year catastrophe events, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premium. The increase was primarily related to the 2017 storm events, was about one-third of the change related to reopened claims reported in the second quarter, about one-third coming from higher loss adjustment expenses and the other third coming from the impact on retro aggregate covers. The group also saw $65 million of current year catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance. Of the total, $50 million related to Cyclone Mekunu in Oman and Yemen and $15 million related to the late winter storms in the United States. This compares to $54 million of catastrophes during the second quarter of 2017. On a year-to-date basis, the results reflected catastrophe losses of $565 million compared to $74 million during the first half of 2017. Partially offsetting the catastrophe development was $97 million of favorable prior year reserve development related to non-catastrophe reserves.","The prior year favorable development was primarily identified for reserve studies completed in the second quarter of 2018. These reserves related to casualty and property reinsurance business both from the United States and internationally. The redundancy determined from the reserve studies was recognized in the second quarter given the magnitude of the overall indications. These redundancies have developed over time, but we don\u2019t react until the position becomes more mature. We continue to maintain our loss reserve estimates for the more recent years unchanged.","Excluding the catastrophe losses and favorable prior year reserve development, the underlying book continues to perform well. The overall attritional combined ratio for the first 6 months was 85.3% compared to 85.6% in the first half of 2017. With the improvement in the attritional combined ratio and the 25% growth in earned premium, the underwriting profit has improved by more than $100 million on an attritional basis for the first 6 months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. Our expense ratio remains low at 5.7% for the first two quarters of 2018 down slightly from 5.8% for the same period last year.","For investments, pre-tax investment income was $141 million for the quarter and $280 million year-to-date on our $18 billion investment portfolio. Investment income was up $23 million or 9% from 1 year ago. This result continues to be driven by the increase in limited partnership income, which was up $14 million from the first half of 2017 and the fixed income portfolio. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.1% compared to 2.9% 1 year ago as both the investment grade and alternative fixed income portfolios are up year-over-year. The duration of the portfolio remains at just over 3 years.","On income taxes, the tax benefit was the result of the amount and geographic region of the losses associated with the catastrophes and the income associated with the loss reserve releases in the quarter. The effective tax rate is an annualized calculation that includes planned catastrophe losses for the remainder of the year. The expected range for the full year is now 0% to 6%. Lower than expected catastrophe losses would cause the tax rate to trend toward the higher end of this range. Positive cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $133 million for the first half of 2018 compared to $634 million in 2017. The decline reflects a higher level of paid catastrophe losses in 2018 compared to 2017.","Shareholders\u2019 equity for the group was $8.2 billion at the end of the second quarter compared to $8.4 billion at year end 2017. The decline in shareholders\u2019 equity in the first half of 2018 is primarily attributable to the $232 million mark-to-market impact on the investment portfolio and capital returned through $106 million of dividends paid as well as $25 million of share buybacks offset by $280 million of net income. The company returned 47% of net income to shareholders. Our capital position remains very strong.","Thank you. And now, John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations.","John Doucette","Thank you, Craig. Good morning. Q2 was the first renewal season following the catastrophes in 2017 for some loss affected areas, notably Puerto Rico and some of the Caribbean at April 1 as well as Florida at June 1. Overall, the markets were mixed. And from a rate perspective, they varied based on loss activity as well as macro and local supply demand factors. However, these and other renewals in Q2 provided our underwriters with an opportunity to reshape our portfolio by capturing higher risk adjusted rewards. We improved our portfolio by achieving rate increases, particularly on loss affected Puerto Rican and Caribbean accounts, growing share with some key Florida clients, reallocating capacity to different attachment points and better priced layers. We also saw more turnover in the book as we decreased shares or declined poorly priced deals and scaled up capacity on more attractively priced opportunities.","Shifting capacity from excess of loss layers and proportional treaties on programs to where we are paid the best risk-adjusted price using our leading re-insurer position in the market to get preferred signings and utilizing both alternative capital and our equity capital to most efficiently match risk to capital all position us for better than market results. These advantages benefit us even for flat renewals and help drive some of this year\u2019s premium growth. Our reinsurance gross written premium for Q2 was $1.4 billion and $2.8 billion year-to-date, which is a 29% growth in premium over year-to-date 2017 driven by growth in all of our reinsurance segments. Some of our growth in reinsurance was due to increased excess of loss and quota share participation on existing treaties and also new quota share treaties with improved profitability following the 2017 cat losses.","In addition, we achieved some impactful reinsurance successes with several key global clients who want to trade more broadly with leading global re-insurers such as Everest Re across multiple lines of business around the world. Over the last several years, we have deployed significant resources to understand and be responsive to the risk transfer and risk financing needs of our global clients. Consequently, we continually expand our strategic relationships with several of these global clients and thus meaningfully have increased our in-force profitability and future opportunities with them.","We also benefited from rate improvement in certain lines, especially loss affected property lines and select casualty and professional lines. We believe our current portfolio overall is stronger and more resilient than it has been for a long time. As Dom stated, our results did suffer from development on the 2017 events predominantly from Irma and Maria. The confluence of three significant catastrophe losses within 5 weeks caused a surge in demand for loss adjusters, inflating loss adjustment expenses to exceptional level. In addition, claim reopening frequency in both Florida and Puerto Rico were higher than expected. As noted earlier, the combination of increasing loss estimates due to reopen and loss adjustment expenses, coupled with the losses on the California wildfires, had a more severe impact to aggregate covers which we wrote.","Including the 2017 loss emergence, reinsurance produced 107% combined ratio for the quarter. However, our attritional combined ratio was 79.8% for the quarter and 81.7% year-to-date compared to 84.2% and 82.1% respectively in the prior year periods. This quarter\u2019s loss ratio benefited almost 2 points from lower non-cat weather losses and a better expected loss ratio. The improved attritional combined ratios are noteworthy given the increased share of proportional business and additional casualty writings, which both typically run to a higher attritional combined ratio than a more property dominated excess of loss portfolio.","In our U.S. reinsurance segment, gross written premium of $1.3 billion year-to-date grew 23% versus the same period last year. Growth was broad-based across property and casualty lines. We saw new opportunities for excess of loss and pro rata deals, which included some new commercial and personal pro rata business, additional mortgage writings, reinstatement premiums and increased facultative writings. The Q2 year-to-date combined ratio was 116.8%. The corresponding loss ratio was elevated by 43 points of cat losses, mainly from the development on hurricanes Irma and Maria and the combined impact that these losses had with other 2017 events on aggregate covers. However, the year-to-date attritional loss ratio decreased 2 points to 54%.","The international segment, with gross written premium of $766 million, grew by 31% in this year-to-date period. This included growth in Latin America on new opportunities and larger post-loss treaty participations, increased pro rata writings and additional capacity deployed on international fac deals in an improved post loss rate environment as well as growth in new lines of business around the world such as Indian crop reinsurance out of our Singapore office and new products out of our Canadian operations. The combined ratio for the first 6 months was 88.2%. The 6 month loss ratio was impacted by 14 points of catastrophe losses, which included about $50 million from Cyclone Mekunu in Oman, with the rest predominantly from Hurricane Maria. The attritional loss ratio is running about flat year-to-date at 51%.","The Bermuda segment had gross written premium of $785 million or 41% growth during the first half, with contributions from writings covering various territories and lines of business. This included growth in London, Zurich and Bermuda operations in various lines in both excess and pro rata business and included some large opportunities with multinational insurers and continued expansion of our trade credit, surety and political risk capabilities and writings. The segment achieved an 83.6% combined ratio in the first half with the attritional loss ratio up less than 1 point to 58.6%. The loss ratio was affected by business mix, including additional premium.","Now, turning to the 6\/1 and 7\/1 renewal. Overall, the market offered modest rate increases for both property and casualty. Accordingly, we did not just follow the market, but proactively structured our global property portfolio in a competitive post-loss rate environment to maximize our returns by allocating larger lines on more attractive deals and reducing or declining under-priced deals. Through this process, we improved our portfolio for this renewal season, representing a better risk adjusted return as we head into this wind season with less exposed limit, less PML, more premium and more expected profit than last year. While some competition on the property side sought to increase market share, we stock with accretive deals from our core clients that recognize the Everest long-term value proposition. In the end, particularly with the increased deployment of capacity to capped pro rata treaties, we materially increased our premium while our cat exposure is flat or down depending on the territory and return period.","With respect to our casualty portfolio, we achieved some rate increases and lower ceding commissions. Modest improvement in reinsurance terms continued as the casualty reinsurance market has stabilized considerably from recent years. In addition, we added new profitable casualty business, which was not offered to much of the reinsurance market. Whether due to our long-term client and broker relationships, superior ratings, balance sheet strength or the ability to lead reinsurance programs for clients in all P&C lines around the world, we are often included in a select group of re-insurers invited to play on unique market opportunities. In the mortgage reinsurance markets, we remain a leader with a robust in-force mortgage book and significant future opportunities. With improved loan underwriting practices by lenders since the financial crisis, loss expectations remain muted in the near-term. However, we remained watchful of potentially destabilizing macroeconomic forces and\/or heightened competition and will manage our portfolio accordingly.","We are pleased with our progress at building a better positioned, meaningfully larger and more diversified global reinsurance portfolio. We remain confident that we can execute in a market that is transforming at an accelerated rate, whether it be from third-party capital, M&A consolidation, evolving distribution channels or rapid technology change and disruption. With that backdrop of fast-paced change, Everest Re will continue to differentiate itself with global breadth of capabilities across all P&C lines, meaningful and relevant capacity supported by alternative capital through Mt. Logan, cat bonds, traditional and non-traditional hedges, evolving and innovative capital structures, all allowing us to maximize the value proposition to our customers while enhancing returns to Everest shareholders, creative product structuring to deliver customized risk transfer and risk financing solutions for our clients, and expense efficiency and nimble execution via our flat and lean organization, allowing us to capture more dollars of margin for each dollar of premium than most of our competitors.","Thank you. And now I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations.","Jon Zaffino","Thanks, John and good morning. Our global specialty insurance operations delivered a solid quarter of performance. We are encouraged by our steady improvement and the progress we are making toward our key goals. Prominent among these goals are diversified and profitable growth and increased resilience across our in-force portfolios and operating platforms. Our team has done an outstanding job executing on the plan and building upon the many foundational pieces we have put in place over the past 3 years.","The second quarter brought some notable performance highlights beginning with the highest level of quarterly gross written premium, net written premium and net earned premium realized in our insurance operation history. It further marks the 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in our business. This achievement is the result of highly diversified growth across our property and casualty and accident and health operations, our growing geographic reach and our consistently evolving product capabilities. It also speaks to our increasing relevance within the specialty insurance market. This quarter\u2019s results are also encouraging considering our two largest underwriting divisions by gross written premium in the quarter. Everest Underwriting Partners and our U.S. property group experienced notable declines in their premium production due to various deliberate underwriting actions.","Importantly, this quarter builds upon the underwriting profitability achieved in the first quarter of this year and brings our year-to-date underwriting profit to $22 million, a more than twofold increase over prior year first half. Our second quarter underwriting profit is $9.5 million, a 3x increase over 2017 second quarter and $37 million more than our 2016 2Q performance. Further, five of the last six quarters have produced an underwriting profit, the lone exception being the third quarter of 2017, where we along with the rest of the industry felt the impact of unprecedented cat activity. We are encouraged, but not surprised to see our profitability increasing as we expand our specialty product premium writings along with our top line results.","An area of continued focus for the insurance operation is the attraction of industry leading talent across our expanding global platform. Everest Insurance remains a highly desirable home for talented professionals across a range of disciplines. In fact, more than 500 colleagues have chosen to join Everest over the past 3 years. These talent acquisition efforts continue to fuel our growth while ensuring we have the right people in place to support our expanding books of business. Notable hires this year include a new CEO of our Canadian Insurance operation, the Everest Insurance Company of Canada, a new leader of the Specialty Insurance Group, our dedicated platform in the sports, entertainment and leisure space, and a new head of our E&S Casualty operations. Each of these leaders strengthens our already deep bench of talent and are representative of the top-flight professionals joining our organization. The evolution of Everest Insurance is a long-term effort, and there is room for further improvement. But there is no denying that many strategic actions we have taken since 2015 are beginning to take hold and evidence themselves in our underlying results.","Turning to the financial results for the second quarter of 2018, the global insurance operations produced $646 million in gross written premium, an increase of $77 million or 13% over second quarter 2017. Adjusting for a second quarter 2017 renewal rights deal that enhanced our wholesale property platform, gross written premium growth improves to 17%. Year-to-date, gross written premium rose to $1.2 billion, a $147 million or 15% increase over the same period of 2017. Adjusting for the renewal rights deal, first half gross written premium growth also comes in at 17%. Again, gross written premium for the second quarter represents the single largest quarter of production in our history and showed a 96% increase over 2Q 2015, nearly doubling our production from when we started this transformation just 3 short years ago. The significant addition of new products, which continue to gain scale, coupled with strong performance from our many existing product areas, contributed to this excellent result. 9 of our 11 major business segments showed year-over-year growth in the first half, while our line of business mix remained generally stable, with roughly 40% of our premium written in short-tail classes and the remainder in our specialty and casualty line.","Our net written premium growth, while still a healthy 6% year-to-date over the comparable period of 2017 was impacted by two notable items. First was the previously discussed 2Q \u201817 renewal rights deal, which included a one-time transfer of unearned premium in that quarter. If we exclude this one-time item, net written premium growth improves to 8% for the first half. Further impacting net written premium growth are additional hedges we have implemented for our wholesale and retail property portfolios, which included a one-time cession related to a new quota share placement incepted on April of this year. Net earned premium in the quarter was $408 million, an increase of $45 million or 12%. Year-to-date, net earned premium increased by $114 million or 17% over the prior period to $802 million. The growth in earned premium has been anticipated as various new business ventures incepted over the past 3 years begin to earn through the P&L at a greater rate.","Turning to the combined ratio for the quarter, the GAAP combined ratio was 97.7%, a 140 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2017. Year-to-date, the GAAP combined ratio was 97.3%, a 150 basis point improvement over the comparable prior year period. Our attritional combined ratio for the quarter and year-to-date period, are 95.4% and 96.6%, respectively. This represents a 1.8% increase over 2017\u2019s second quarter of 93.6% and a 90 basis point increase over 2017\u2019s year-to-date result of 95.7%.","Last year\u2019s second quarter attritional combined ratio had a one-time benefit from an adjustment to our A&H portfolio, which accounts for the majority of the 90 basis point increase in the year-to-date attritional combined ratio. This quarter\u2019s loss and loss adjustment expense ratio improved 1.6% from the prior year period to 68.7% from 70.3%. This includes 2.6 points of cat activity in the current quarter related to late winter storms in the U.S. This compares favorably to the 3.6 points of cat activity in 2Q \u201817. The second quarter \u201818 attritional loss ratio increased 1.5% to 66.3% from 64.8% in 2Q \u201817. However, on a year-to-date basis, the 2018 attritional loss ratio of 66.2% remains very stable and, in fact, it is flat compared to the first half of \u201817.","Our expense ratio was stable in the quarter as we take advantage of our improved scale to continue our investment in people and technology. Our expense ratio in the second quarter was 29%, down from the first quarter result of 31.9% and essentially flat from 2Q 2017. For the year-to-date period, the expense ratio was 30.5%, up a 100 basis points from the 29.5% in the comparable period of 2017. Again, we anticipate the expense ratio to stabilize as we continue on our growth path and as earned premium continues to come through in the second half of the year. As we\u2019ve stated in prior calls, an expense ratio of roughly 30% remains very competitive in the specialty insurance segment.","I want to spend a few minutes on the rate environment and share some observations with regards to pricing. Overall, I will break this down into 3 areas. First, we see some encouraging trends in parts of our U.S. property and commercial auto books, for example. Second, we are encouraged by some gradually improving lines of business such as primary general liability and various professional lines. And third there remains some areas under a higher degree of rate pressure, namely U.S. workers\u2019 compensation, which we will continue to closely monitor. Overall, excluding workers\u2019 compensation, Everest Insurance produced an aggregate rate change of plus 5.8% in the second quarter, which is the strongest rate change we have seen since the second quarter of 2012, a 6-year high. Further, this continues an upward trend in non-workers\u2019 compensation rate change that began in the beginning of 2017.","As for the encouraging areas, commercial auto was up 14% for the quarter and 13.1% year-to-date. Property rates increased 13.1% for the quarter and 12.6% year-to-date. Commercial auto has been on an upward trend over many quarters, and for property, the second quarter was the fourth in a row of growing rate increases. As for lines showing steady rate improvement, primary general liability is gaining momentum and the quarter\u2019s plus 3.2% change is more than double the rate increase we experienced in the first quarter of this year. Further, the second quarter marks the sixth quarter of the last 7 in positive rate change territory for this line.","As with respect to various professional lines, we continue to experience moderate rate pressure, although overall rates appear to be bottoming out, coming in near flat for the quarter. Workers\u2019 compensation, despite coming under persistent rate pressure, continues to perform well and in line with our view of loss experience across our portfolio. As stated previously, we remain encouraged by the profitability of this line of business, and we\u2019ll carefully monitor rate and loss cost trends in the coming quarters.","Some concluding comments. Stated simply, the momentum across our global specialty insurance operation continues. Strong premium growth and increasing profitability are being achieved alongside continued investments in talent, technology and operating platforms. We have built an adaptive, resilient and relevant specialty insurance organization that we continue to grow, guided by our number one priority of profitable, sustainable growth. We look forward to continuing our momentum and reporting back to you next quarter.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Todd for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker","Thank you. In your prepared remarks, you spoke about what you got wrong on the cat losses last year and suggesting you have you have under-priced loss adjustment expenses. So, is the book of business you have in cat today under-priced relative to what you should have priced that at January 1?","John Doucette","Good morning, Josh. It\u2019s John. Thanks for the question. I would not characterize it that way and we always are continuing to evaluate loss trends and factors that go into our pricing. And really, it was a function of the loss adjustment expenses that happened in totality when the multiple events happened, but we do look at and have modified our loss adjustment expenses going forward and we did going into this renewal season at 6\/1.","Josh Shanker","Did that change the competitiveness about how you could participate? Did you find that your business was better except for that 1\/1 than at 6\/1?","John Doucette","I think there is a lot of countervailing occurrence that are happening. And at 1\/1, that\u2019s more of a different market. 6\/1 is Florida and there is a lot more territories at 1\/1. So I think there are a lot of moving parts, including some of the capital. I think there was more macro overarching supply demand as we headed into 6\/1. There is a lot of moving parts that are there. With did, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we did write more on deals that we liked and wrote \u2013 declined several deals or reduced the share of deals that we didn\u2019t like and some of that was pricing, some of that was what we thought the right kind of either an agreement or disagreement on what the price equilibrium should be for losses that happened or losses to particular layers, so either by region or to a client or to a layer and what we thought the price equilibrium should be for that. So, it was more than usual churn in the portfolio this Florida season than we had seen, but we were in the end pleased with our ability to deploy the capital, supporting the clients that we wanted to support. We also wrote more proportional business as we indicated both in casualty and in property.","Dom Addesso","Josh, these multiple events also had \u2013 because they were multiple events, had a disproportionate impact on our retro add book. And as a result of pricing demand that we had back in January 1 we actually have less exposure there than we did in the previous year. Go ahead.","Josh Shanker","Yes. If you think about your outwards reinsurance book, I think that in retrospect, you wish you had certain kinds of protection, particularly around LAE that you didn\u2019t have coming into this year. Do you feel well protected on your outwards reinsurance book this year or does it carry with the same risks that befell you in 2017?","Dom Addesso","First of all, big portion of our outwards book is through Mt. Logan, which is proportional as well as some facultative specific deals, which again are for the most part proportional. So, those are not affected. Our cat bonds, which frankly make up the bulk of our protections beyond Mt. Logan, are really intended to be protected against capital events, not earnings events. So, we still feel very comfortable with our cat load that we profess to be under 9% and that our protections are the same or better.","Josh Shanker","Alright. Well, I will see the floor to other questions.","Dom Addesso","Thank you.","John Doucette","Thanks, Josh.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning. So my first question just trying to get a bit more color on the increase to losses for 2017. So, you guys mentioned part of it was related to the AOB issue in Florida. We have seen that going on in the state with a bunch of the homeowner insurers for sometime. So in retrospect, I mean, maybe are you a little bit less surprised that this happened, just a little bit more color there? And then my second question would be, I don\u2019t know, if it\u2019s IBNR that you can disclose in relation to how you are carrying for these events or some other metric I guess. So we would expect we can kind of look to a number and say this has been fully addressed and we don\u2019t expect any additional movement from here?","Dom Addesso","I will ask Craig to address the IBNR question, but relative to the AOB, the AOB issue was not the AOB per se, it was the threat of AOB that we think was driving the number of reopens. So again to be clear what we were seeing as increases were due to reopens not as it relates specifically to AOB. Craig, on the IBNR question?","Craig Howie","Elyse, on the IBNR, we believe that we have put up adequate IBNR and when we went through these calculations for these catastrophe events, our goal was to put this issue behind us. And so we believe the IBNR that we hold for all our cat events and that\u2019s separate from our non-catastrophe reserves is adequate to cover in any and all prior year cat.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then my second question maybe this ties back to a little bit of what Josh was asking, but if we look at your losses following on this quarter\u2019s increase as a percent of equity, you do stand above your peers following this increase. So in retrospect, as you think back were you carrying too much risk, two to three storms? And I guess as you have you did mention writing less aggregate retro this year. So do you think given that the increase happened kind of right around the midyear renewals were taking place, do you think that you were able to kind of see it in time to make enough adjustments to the book you are carrying into this year\u2019s wind season?","Dom Addesso","Right. So in response to your first question, I will take a little bit of \u2013 I slightly disagree with characterizing it as above our peers. It\u2019s frankly more in line. We manage our cat exposure as you know on an after-tax basis as do many others, but most others aren\u2019t being in Bermuda, don\u2019t have some of the same advantages from our tax structure that we do. So frankly, we consider it on that basis. And again given our capital position, given what I mentioned in my script, was that again over the last 5 years, our overall cat portfolio has been extremely profitable at generating over $3.5 billion of profits in that 5-year time period as well as I think if you look at our operating ROE compared to our peers, I think you will find that we lead the group there as well. So, the answer to your question relative to tax is we manage our cat exposure at less than 9 points of combined ratio points on an annual expected basis. And frankly over the last 5 years or 10 years, it\u2019s actually proven to come in right in around that number. So we think we have kind of optimized our portfolio. The fact that we write a lot more retro and retro ag than most other participants again because of our size and our scale can lead to a little bit more volatility, but again we think that that\u2019s come with the appropriate returns. I don\u2019t know if that answers your question, but...","Elyse Greenspan","Yes, that does. And then one last question moving away from the cat increase, the current accident year results were pretty strong in reinsurance in the quarter. In the prepared remarks I believe you said 2 points was from non-cat weather. You showed about a 5 point improvement in your accident year loss ratio in reinsurance in the quarter, which did stand out as you commented just given the shift to pro rata and casualty business. So is that as you think going forward is that a level of improvement that can be sustained or were there some other one-timers in the quarter or should we just look to the half year number as representative of the underlying margin improvement we could see?","Dom Addesso","I always prefer to look at a half year number, because any one quarter can have a fair bit of volatility in it, but I think the half year number is fairly reflective of kind of what we expect going forward recognizing of course that it was positively impacted by the non-cat \u2013 the scarcity of non-cat cat events, which is frankly has not occurred for a number of years. You might recall last year, it was for both primary companies and re-insurers, there was a lot of storm activity in the first half of the year that didn\u2019t reach the level of, in our case, $10 million per event, so we call them non-cat cats. But recognizing that difference, depending on how you would like to account for that in your models again in the 6 month numbers would be more reflective of how we see the portfolio.","John Doucette","And Elyse, good morning, it\u2019s John. I\u2019d just add a little more color on the portfolio so we did see rate increases at different points in time this renewal season post the events again, we talked about it at 1\/1 was it as much as we were hoping for now but we did see rate increases at 1\/1, 4\/1, 6\/1 and 7\/1, and that is going to have some impact in the numbers you\u2019re looking at we also as we continue to build out our mortgage and credit portfolio, that has run to an attractive combined ratio and there is a lot of other things I talked about the global clients and the strategic relationship we are building with some of those, also has run favorably so there is a lot of moving parts but again, just to reiterate from the prepared comments, we really believe that our overall portfolio, our U.S. international casualty, professional, property, mortgage, structured is better positioned today that we\u2019ve been able to get rate in some places but also position the portfolio and build some stronger portfolio overall that will impact that has impacted the attritional combined ratio.","Dom Addesso","To further add to that, John mentioned in his prepared comments about, as well, a low combined ratio line expansion in or growth in trade credit political risk and surety again, we have, over a number of quarters now, worked hard to diversify our portfolio not only by product and class of business but also geographically and I think that if you look at the underlying metrics, you\u2019ll find that we\u2019ve achieved a lot of that success and that\u2019s, in part, what\u2019s driving down what historically had been a much higher annual expected cat load, driving that down below 9%, notwithstanding the fact that, yes, we have these events in \u201817, but again, given the fact that we have a retro book that, in retrospect, was not \u2013 it was not a surprising effort.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thank you very much for all the color.","Dom Addesso","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.","Yaron Kinar","Good morning, everybody. My first question on the reinsurance front, so Everest, I\u2019d say is probably a little bit of an outlier in terms of the strong growth in net premiums written that we have seen and that growth has accelerated this quarter. John, I know you said that this growth was broad, but I am just curious are there any particular notable deals that drove this particularly strong growth this quarter and are you seeing the ceding commissions or the ceding rates relatively stable?","John Doucette","Good morning, Yaron. Thanks for the question. So, we are \u2013 so a couple of things. So I mentioned the global clients and so the large, the top 15 or so multinational insurers, we see them coming back, I would say, the pendulum when we have talked about this over the last several earnings calls or years, where they were retaining more, centralizing their ceded, re-globalizing their treaties and sometimes that worked for them on a pro forma basis and sometimes, it didn\u2019t \u2013 maybe it didn\u2019t work as well on some of the classes of business with some of the volatility they wanted and we do see that there seems to be as the pendulum seems to be moving a little bit in the other direction that they are potentially ceding more. And that is a disproportionate advantage to Everest, because they have very strong type reinsurance security committees they want to trade with people in basically all lines of business, not just property they want to trade with re-insurers in all lines of business, and they want to trade with them around the world and given our broad portfolio and experienced underwriters that are situated in all the major markets, hubs around the world, we have that ability to trade with the global re-insurers locally as well as holistically at a corporate level and that is driving not all, but it\u2019s driving some of it we are also seeing continued opportunities in the mortgage space and frankly, we are seeing other clients coming to the market with casualty and professional reinsurance treaties in a way that we haven\u2019t seen the last couple of years so we had been bearish on the casualty space for many years and ahead of our peers on decreasing as the ceding commissions went up, and we didn\u2019t like the trade as much or the strategic positioning of that and we are directionally moving increasing our capacity to that space as we do see more favorable dynamics for us to allow us to support casualty and professional treaties and again, we do have some strategic relationships there, not just with the global clients, that are resulting in some meaningful premium opportunities and you asked about the ceding commissions we are seeing, in some cases, the ceding commissions coming down there\u2019s been a lot of talk about that, that maybe if property can\u2019t subsidize other lines of business, that other lines of business will have to stand more on their own so at 1\/1, we were pleased with that, and we continue to see some favorable movement on ceding commissions across our long tail book of business.","Yaron Kinar","That\u2019s helpful. And just to clarify the increased use of your services and your balance sheet by the global clients, that\u2019s coming that\u2019s broad based or is it coming from a concentrated number of clients?","John Doucette","So, we trade basically with all of them, the top 14, 15, 16 of them, but it varies, where some of them, we trade a lot more and part of that\u2019s their cession strategy, their reinsurance strategy on how where they are in that thought process part of it is long-term relationships that we\u2019ve developed with them part of it is where they\u2019re situated so there is a lot of moving parts, but we do trade with all of them but what we are seeing is our ability that when they come to the market, they would come and talk to Everest they will come and talk to a few other large global re-insurers, but they won\u2019t necessarily talk to a broad reinsurance panel and again, that is disproportionately impacting favorably our ability to grow the book and diversify the book.","Dom Addesso","Our growth with these global clients, for most of those relationships, the total volume has grown not all, but so we can\u2019t if you\u2019re trying to get to is there are small handful, it\u2019s across the spectrum, no.","Yaron Kinar","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then on the insurance side, I guess given that net premiums earned are up over 15% in the first half of the year, why would the expense ratio deteriorate year-over-year?","Jon Zaffino","Good morning. This is Jon. I think you are going to see some movement in any discrete quarter based on the timing of our hiring effort, the timing of various investments in technology I think what we are aiming for is again as I said in my prepared remarks that 30% level is quite competitive but there\u2019s a lot of moving parts as we continue to expand geographically in various lines of business and make various investments so that\u2019s part of it we look at the on a trailing 12-month basis, it\u2019s trending the right way and we also looked at it compared to first quarter, which obviously was a nice improvement. So we are pretty comfortable with where that\u2019s been.","Yaron Kinar","Great. Thank you very much.","Dom Addesso","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Kumar with The Buckingham Research Group.","Amit Kumar","Thanks and good morning and thanks for the color. I have three follow-up questions to the loss development discussion. Number one, just going back I guess in your opening remarks, you outlined two reasons for the loss development two other companies in our universe talked about the same reasons yet they actually released reserves from 2017 events how can we as outsiders reconcile these two things in which Everest is an outlier?","Dom Addesso","Well, I mean, I can\u2019t speak to what their process is, and I think I\u2019ve already suggested that we have to make some changes in the way we look at these things and I\u2019ll point back to and I can\u2019t speak to what the circumstances were in these two companies, some of which, by the way, we may have supported on the retro side and didn\u2019t see losses from them until the second quarter. So that\u2019s kind of an interesting sidebar, but we were disproportionately impacted by our retro ag book, which by definition is going to be late record and I think overall, I can\u2019t speak to what they\u2019ve done versus what we\u2019ve done, but we know we have to make changes to how we address these multiple events going forward I will also point to the fact that you might recall that in the weeks following and the months following these events, that widespread press reports of claims being closed, the events were not as large as was expected so there was some market chatter, if you will, that wasn\u2019t setting off any alarm bells for us and clearly, in retrospect, that was a mistake, and we had readily admitted that but for sure, the loss itself is certainly contained within our capabilities, within our earnings our long-term track record is still intact and when you go back and push this event back into \u201817, I still submit to you that our operating returns were better than all of our peers.","Amit Kumar","Fair point. I guess it\u2019s just relating to that answer can we have some comfort or how much limit is left in this cover, which you were referring to and how will this respond if there is any additional development?","Dom Addesso","I\u2019ll ask Craig or John to.","Craig Howie","So Amit, as we went through this from the ground up, we did look at the aggregate covers that had losses submitted on them, and we know what those limits are that remain on those covers but what we really did from a modeling standpoint and going to the underlying underwriters was try to find out what other aggregate covers have we written where we haven\u2019t seen a loss selection yet, and we are trying to extrapolate that across our portfolio so that\u2019s what\u2019s included in our additional loss estimate for these events.","Amit Kumar","Got it. The third and final question it\u2019s been a few years since we have discussed models and their efficacy I know in the past, I think you have mentioned using an AIR model any thoughts on AIR versus RMS and even any cost of changing the models that you use? Thank you.","John Doucette","Hi, good morning Amit, it\u2019s John. So look, we are well aware of limitations of the models and that these are tools and one of the things that go into how we underwrite, how we price and how we reserve and there were many examples during not just the 2017 events but events prior to that, that showed model misses from the major vendors, and that happened multiple times, including during the 2017 events, with orders of magnitude missed so we agree with you that the models are a tool and need to be thought that way, and so we rely we look at the models, but we rely on first principles as well as underwriting who the clients are we want to support, what do we think of their underwriting, what do we think of our positioning with them, how they trade forward, how they treat reinsurance and\/or retro writers and we think that allows us to both build a profitable book of business as well as build a sustainable, competitive franchise with clients that we have around the world.","Amit Kumar","But you still use the AIR model, right?","John Doucette","Yes, we use AIR. We also look at RMS. We look at other a lot of AIR and RMS haven\u2019t developed in some of the more developed developing countries, and we looked at local models we try to look at all data sources, all modeling, all vendor models that we can to determine what we think is Everest to a risk.","Amit Kumar","Thank you.","Dom Addesso","Thank you, Amit. I have got \u2013 I think we are running over and we are more than happy to stay on, because we have got a number of other people in queue. So, next caller?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan","Good morning. Thank you for fitting me in. My first question is on the current quarter, second quarter catastrophe losses $65 million seems to be higher than your pre-announcement 2 weeks ago, just want to clarify that?","Craig Howie","So Kai, this is Craig. We pre-announced a net after-tax number, and that number was net of other current year weather related losses so as you heard us talk about, we were able to lower our loss selection on the reinsurance side for non-cat losses, if you will, anything below $10 million we were able to lower that loss selection because we didn\u2019t have many events during the first half of the year that were indicating reinsurance exposure so that\u2019s what was offsetting that $65 million, and then the rest is after tax to get us to the $25 million that was in the pre-release.","Kai Pan","Okay. So that portion benefits your underlying core loss ratio in your reinsurance operations?","Craig Howie","That\u2019s correct. It was not a cat event it was the underlying reinsurance attritional loss ratio.","Kai Pan","Great. My second question, on the insurance side it looks like if you take out adjustments a year ago, it\u2019s pretty flat in terms of combined ratio, underlying combined ratio given the business growing and still probably not up to the goal of mid-90s combined ratio yet, so do you think there\u2019s room for further improvement towards that goal and how quickly you can get there?","Jon Zaffino","Hi, Kai, it\u2019s Jon. Good morning. Yes, let me remember, there is two things going on in the second quarter comparative first, as I mentioned, was the renewal rights deal, which moved some things around secondly was the onetime adjustment for our A&H book so achieving the flat both loss and combined on an attritional basis, that feels like we\u2019re directionally moving the right way considering some of the deliberate underwriting actions we took throughout the first half of the year and actually, candidly, we have for the prior couple of years we expect that momentum to continue for instance, some of our newer businesses, which we think have very, very favorable risk-return characteristics, were about a third of our premium writings in the quarter that\u2019s an all-time high from the inception of each of these so as that continues to earn through, we do expect further improvement again you might get some movement in any discrete quarter based on various movements across the book, but overall, we still think there\u2019s room for improvement.","Dom Addesso","To add to that, Kai, we have some of our newer lines of business, longer earning periods, whether it\u2019s surety, trade credit, political risk, transaction risks and those portfolios are beginning to build, and the earned premium is growing proportionally there and those are very low combined ratio classes.","Kai Pan","Okay, great. Last one, if I may. On the buybacks and it looks like you resumed buyback, $25 million in the quarter I assume that\u2019s before you know this loss revision in 2017 events I just wonder what\u2019s your thought process behind it and now you\u2019ve started trading below 1.1x book. Will you be more aggressive in buying back your own shares even during the wind season?","Dom Addesso","It was a very attractive price.","Kai Pan","Thank you.","Dom Addesso","Thank you, Kai.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our last question from Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields","Thanks. Two quick ones. I think first of all in reinsurance, was there any change in the accident year loss pick for casualty and specialty lines from the first quarter to the second quarter?","Craig Howie","There was always movement, Meyer, with respect to loss picks throughout the quarter we constantly look at, we hold reserve committees at the end of each quarter as part of that process, we do that both on the reinsurance side and the insurance side, but as we go through that process, we look at everything, we look at rate change up or down, we look at loss cost trend up or down, but there is constant movement in those expected loss ratios in any given quarter where the movements this quarter. The answer is yes, slight movements only.","Dom Addesso","But nothing material, and some of that has to reflect the fact that we had some newer business coming into that line so it has to be reflective of the business that we\u2019re now putting on the books but generally, it\u2019s been pretty stable.","Meyer Shields","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. So in the past few years, you have had phenomenal aggregate reserve development generally concentrated in the fourth quarter I know this is sort of an unrealistic question, but should we assume that some of the second quarter reserve releases came out of what we would normally see in the fourth quarter as a function of conservative reserving?","Dom Addesso","Well, part of the answer to that question and it\u2019s not a ridiculous question, the reserve studies that we had done this time are the same reserve studies that we do every time for this kind of year typically, those reserve studies, because they are smaller lines of businesses, don\u2019t produce these kinds of results, which and therefore they are not material. And therefore sometimes \u2013 if they are material, they get booked. If they are not material, then we wait for the fourth quarter. So this time around, we have some relatively smaller lines of business or classes of business that produced pretty favorable number obviously. And so obviously I don\u2019t know the answer to your question, because we haven\u2019t done the year end reserve studies yet, but typically you wouldn\u2019t expect this level of releases from the lines of businesses that were under review and therefore you wouldn\u2019t expect these lines of business to have contributed that much to the year end reserve releases. Is that helpful at all?","Meyer Shields","It is, yes. Very much so. And I guess just a final follow-up, is there any sense of the change in \u2013 or any quantification of the losses ceded to Mt. Logan because of the reserve shift?","Craig Howie","Could you say that again? What was that?","Meyer Shields","Yes, I am sorry. The magnitude of the change in 2017 tax free losses that were ceded to Mt. Logan?","John Doucette","Yes. So, this is John. So, the short answer is yes. As indicated previously, Mt. Logan participates on basically quota shares of layers and portfolios of business that Everest writes and consequently, the cession to Mt. Logan grew particularly \u2013 grew accordingly with the increase in the loss picks that Everest put forth.","Meyer Shields","Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.","John Doucette","You are welcome.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen. That ends our questions for today.","Dom Addesso","Thank you, Todd and thanks to all for your questions today. I hope you came away with a better understanding of the circumstances regarding our reserve change. But nevertheless, as we look back at the portfolio and our business model, we remain very confident that our underwriting strategy is solid. And as I mentioned, it\u2019s evidenced by our 5-year average operating ROE through 2017, which after adjustment for the cat losses was 11.8%. This is better than each of the companies in our peer group and I think it\u2019s worth emphasizing. Cat business is volatile. But as I pointed out, it\u2019s profitable through the cycle and again as I mentioned previously, it\u2019s less than 9 combined ratio points on average through those same 5 years. But what I really \u2013 I think the message we want to leave you with is the understanding of the breadth of our entire business model. And over the last couple of years, we have succeeded in lessening our cat exposure by diversifying our reinsurance portfolio and the credit, other specialty classes along with as John talked about, the resurgence in our casualty lines of business. And as a consequence, the attrition results continue to improve. Furthermore, the organic build of our insurance operation has been noteworthy. We now have profitable specialty insurance operation expected to exceed over $2 billion in premium. That\u2019s double from 3 years ago. I recognized in the short-term that it maybe very natural to look at the current results in this business that can be sometimes misleading. And if you more closely examine the underlying metrics, I think you will find and get a better sense of what the future holds for Everest. So, we believe it\u2019s a bright one. Thank you very much for your interest this morning.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference.

Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to turn this conference over to Jon Levenson. You may begin.","Jon Levenson","Thank you, Chantelle, and welcome to the Everest Re Group, Ltd. 2019 fourth quarter and year-end earnings conference call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, EVP and Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, EVP and President and CEO of the Reinsurance Division; and Jonathan Zaffino, EVP and President and CEO of the Everest Insurance Division.","Before we begin, I need to preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest's SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement.","With that, I turn the call over to Juan Andrade.","Juan Andrade","Thank you, Jon, and good morning. It's my pleasure to join you for the first time as President and CEO of Everest.","2019 was a solid year for our company as we continue to benefit from improving market conditions across all areas of our business. We are well positioned for this market with broad capabilities in top talent, and we remain focused on solving our clients' most critical risk transfer needs in a disciplined and profitable way.","For the full year 2019, Everest recorded net income of over $1 billion, a significant increase from the prior year and a 12% net income return on equity. Net operating income for 2019 was in excess of $872 million, also a significant improvement over the 2018 result.","Our combined ratio for the year was 95.5% compared to 108.8% in 2018 despite $550 million of catastrophe losses during the year. Our book value per share growth was 16%, and we grew our revenues by 8%.","We remain focused on our industry-leading expense advantage. We achieved a 6% expense ratio in 2019 while continuing to make significant investments in people, technology and the infrastructure necessary to grow our company. These overall results are a testament to the strength and diversification of our franchise. We had sizable contributions from both our underwriting and investment operations throughout 2019.","Specific to the underwriting operations, 2019 demonstrated the success of our strategies in both reinsurance and insurance. For the full year 2019, Everest generated $336 million in underwriting income.","In our Reinsurance division, we generated $255 million in underwriting income with a 95.4% combined ratio even with an active catastrophe year with industry insured losses in excess of $50 billion. This result reflects the steps we have taken to diversify our portfolio and reduce volatility. In our Insurance division, 2019 marked another strong year of profitable growth.","We finished the year with gross written premium of nearly $2.8 billion, a 23% growth rate, over $81 million in underwriting income and a 95.8% combined ratio. Our U.S. franchise, which makes up the majority of our Global Insurance business, ran a combined ratio in the low 90s for the full year.","The Insurance division had pretax operating income of $270 million for the year, including the allocated $189 million of investment income, an excellent result. Overall investment income for the group was $647 million, up 11% over the prior year.","Given the prudent investment mix of assets we maintain, this was also an excellent outcome. Overall, our invested assets grew by $2.3 billion in 2019 to nearly $21 billion, driven by record underwriting cash flows and the solid return on invested assets.","Turning to the fourth quarter of 2019, overall group results were impacted by $215 million in catastrophe losses and higher-than-expected losses in our crop reinsurance book as a result of inclement weather. This resulted in a group combined ratio of 101.5%.","For the quarter, as a result of these losses, our Reinsurance division posted a combined ratio of 103.9% and an underwriting loss of $55 million. Our Insurance division generated over $26 million in underwriting income and a 95.1% combined ratio. Heading into 2020, we remain very well positioned.","In our Reinsurance division, we were pleased with our January one renewals, which represents about 50% of our annual reinsurance premium. Underwriting discipline remains paramount, and we were able to underwrite a stronger portfolio with greater balance, diversification, more expected margin and reduced volatility.","In our Insurance division, the rate momentum continues to build up meaningfully in virtually every class of business. Our Insurance division is hitting full stride at an ideal time given the market tailwinds. We have the right culture, platform and relevance with our clients and trading partners.","We also have the underwriters and systems necessary to capitalize on the current market, with the infrastructure in place to ensure underwriting discipline and appropriate risk selection. Strategically, our focus is on increasing Everest's earnings power in terms of both our underwriting and investment income, with the goal of driving superior book value growth over time.","Underwriting profitability will remain at the core of everything we do as we execute on our well-defined premium growth strategies in an improving underwriting environment. We will continue to search for profitable growth opportunities and increase relevance. To use a sports metaphor, we're on the front foot.","We will also continue to create optionality and diversification in our business with a broad mix of products, distribution and geography. This allows us to focus our underwriting capital on the most profitable classes, regardless of the environment. With regard to investment income, strong operating cash flows and returns on invested assets will continue to grow our portfolio going forward.","Our focus will be on optimizing the performance of our investment portfolio while maintaining a well-balanced and prudent investment posture. The efficient use of our capital facilitates returns on equity significantly in excess of our cost of capital. Our goal is a double-digit return on equity.","Our first priority is to deploy capital into the business to position Everest for long-term success and profitable growth. Growth in our earnings power, combined with our strong balance sheet, low leverage, strong financial ratings and the effective management of capital, will position Everest to succeed in every stage of the market cycle.","Now let me turn it over to Craig to provide additional details on the financials.","Craig Howie","Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone.","For the fourth quarter of 2019, Everest reported net income of $218 million. This compares to a net loss of $385 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. Net income for the full year was over $1 billion compared to net income of $89 million in 2018. These results were driven by a strong underwriting performance across the group, higher net investment income and lower catastrophe losses compared to 2018.","In the fourth quarter of 2019, Everest saw $215 million of net pretax catastrophe losses compared to $875 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The 2019 pretax loss estimates came from Typhoon Hagibis in Japan for $190 million and the Dallas, Texas Tornado with $25 million. On a full year basis, the results reflected net pretax catastrophe losses of $550 million in 2019 compared to $1.7 billion recorded in calendar year 2018. These losses are pretax figures, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premium.","As a reminder, the company uses net after-tax loss estimates when setting its catastrophe loss budget for the year. Excluding the catastrophe events, reinstatement premiums and favorable prior period reserve development, the underlying book continues to perform well with an overall current year attritional combined ratio of 88.4% for the year compared to 87% last year.","This increase was primarily due to the business mix in the Reinsurance segment, which has been writing more proportional casualty business over the past several quarters, which carries a higher loss ratio but benefits from the current underwriting market condition, also due to the impact of the current year crop reinsurance losses in 2019 of about $50 million.","On reserves, we completed the remainder of our annual loss reserve studies during the fourth quarter. We booked $19 million of favorable prior year reserve development. This is in addition to the $75 million of favorable prior year development reported in the first three quarters of 2019 for a full year total of $94 million.","The Insurance segment reported $16 million of favorable prior year reserve development during the quarter, which was largely related to its workers' compensation business. The Reinsurance results - segment reported $3 million of favorable prior year development during the quarter and $77 million for the year.","The Reinsurance segment saw favorable development in some short-tail and credit-related lines, such as property, surety, marine and mortgage. This favorable development was offset by actions we took to strengthen reserves in the Bermuda segment for losses on some specific accounts for both property and casualty. Before moving to taxes,","I'd like to remind you that we've included a split of our net investment income between the Insurance segment and total reinsurance. This is shown on Page 15 in the financial supplement. It indicates the contribution provided by each segment to pretax operating income and reflects $458 million allocated to reinsurance and $189 million of net investment income allocated to the Insurance segment. We are including this information to better demonstrate the total contribution by business segment and highlights the stand-alone value of the growing insurance franchise.","On income taxes, the tax benefit was the result of losses associated with the catastrophes this year. Since the majority of the catastrophe events came from business written in the U.S. book, the losses and tax benefit primarily reflect the U.S. tax rate.","The effective tax rate is an annualized calculation that includes planned catastrophe losses for the year. For 2020, we expect our tax rate to be about 12%, which reflects an annual cat load of about six points of loss ratio.","Shareholders' equity for the group ended the year at a record $9.1 billion, up $1.3 billion or 16% compared to year-end 2018. The increase in shareholders' equity is primarily attributable to the over $1 billion of net income and the recovery in the fair value of the investment portfolio.","During the quarter, the company announced an 11% increase in its regular quarterly dividend and paid $1.55 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our balance sheet and overall financial position remains strong. We maintain industry load debt leverage, manage a high credit quality investment portfolio and generate robust cash flow.","Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations.","John Doucette","Thank you, Craig. Good morning.","Following three years of significant catastrophes and more recent loss development, the 2020 reinsurance market is dynamic, just as our property book in 2019 was a better portfolio compared to 2018. After this January 2020 renewal, we have a stronger, even healthier book across our overall global property portfolio, including property cat, proportional, facultative, per risk, retro and PURPLE treaties with better balance, diversification and limit deployment, and we have improved expected margins while managing the size of our catastrophe PML.","We are optimistic about the opportunity set in front of us while remaining realistic that there are choppy waters to navigate in both property and casualty lines. It is an improving market marked by increasing demand for reinsurance with roughly flat reinsurance supply. And for specific deals, pricing was determined by class of business, territory and loss experience.","Everest is well positioned in this market given our unique strengths and attributes. These include our long-standing client relationships and robust ability to source business globally with strong balance sheet and strategically located and seasoned underwriting teams empowered to make decisions and execute.","At January 1, Everest deployed more capacity in retro; our PURPLE product; loss-affected territories with rate improvements or continued post loss, higher reinsurance rates; casualty; specialty; and facultative lines around the globe. Conversely, we continue to re-underwrite poor performing accounts or accounts which did not have strong pricing.","On these programs, we cut back our share or came off. Approaching January 1, we utilized alternative capital to capture value in the improving market. We went back to the cat bond market to renew the expiring Kilimanjaro bonds and utilize the approximately $800 million of AUM in Mt. Logan. Along with in force, cat bonds and other hedges, we holistically built capacity to deploy on deals we like, particularly in retro and PURPLE. At 1\/1, we were able to improve profitability of our global cat book, optimizing the risk\/reward of the portfolio while managing the volatility.","There's been a lot of discussion of the U-shape market pricing dynamics. I think the correct analogy is a W-shape. Why W-shape and not a U-shape? Both exhibit increasing primary and retro rates. But in the U-shape model, reinsurance rates would not move up much at all.","However, in the W-shape model, the reinsurance rates, terms and conditions were mixed. Some disappointingly flat and some with nice improvements and continued attractively priced opportunities. That is why we believe a W-shape is a better visualization of the market. First, the left side of the W-shape model, primary insurance. Everest writes a large amount of proportional treaties.","We are directly benefiting from improving primary markets in casualty, property and specialty lines, particularly in E&S and in certain capacity-restricted territories such as Canada. Our relevance to our clients and brokers for providing much needed risk transfer, capital support and volatility management helps them capture value in these improved primary markets.","Now the middle part of the W-shape model, reinsurance. As I said, results were mixed, some good, some disappointing. Positives were global reinsurance programs, pockets of casualty, mortgage, structured business, many facultative lines and several loss-affected areas.","Disappointments included several smaller capacity programs and several cat-free territories. Specifically, at January 1, several large global property programs that tapped out global capacity had improved pricing. Therefore, we wrote more with several large multinational global clients, particularly with our strategic partners.","Loss-affected territories impacted by catastrophes over the last three years have substantially better rates, and in some cases, those rates continued to improve. But smaller limit programs, including regional U.S. and smaller clients around the globe, did not see much rate movement.","Most of Europe and much of Latin America and Asia were closer to flat. China was down, and we deployed less capacity there. Casualty reinsurance saw a directional improvement in reinsurance rates as well as benefited from primary rate increases, improved terms and limit contraction, resulting in a better priced and better balanced book. There's been a lot of talk about social inflation and increased loss trends in casualty. We believe this is a reversion to the long-term mean as opposed to something new.","And this reversion to the mean in trend and loss development is something that we have been underwriting for, pricing for and embedding in our trend factors for several years, prior to this being in the headlines now.","Seasons continued to decrease their volatility through a combination of gross line reductions, buying down treaty retentions, buying more casualty reinsurance and buying more facultative reinsurance in both property and casualty. Fac helped seasons manage line size and protect certain rigs that get limited or excluded under treaties during this part of the cycle. Then at the right price, terms and conditions assuming that risk, our seasoned fac teams can specifically underwrite those risks.","In the last many months of fac renewals, including this 1\/1, we have seen a significant increase in the number of opportunities in fac, both in casualty and property, in the U.S. as well as internationally, much coming with significant rate lift. And mortgage, which has treaties incepting throughout the year, remains a positive driver in reinsurance.","Finally, the right side of the W-shape model, retro. At January 1, retro rates were up meaningfully, and we wrote more premiums accordingly. We dusted off our pillared product, PURPLE, and marketed that beyond the few core clients who have been consistent buyers.","The end result was roughly a 25% increase in our combined retro and PURPLE premium. Therefore, improving insurance, mixed reinsurance with some bright spots and improved retro results in the W-shaped market.","As we look forward to 2020, we see January one momentum continuing throughout the year on reinsurance and retro, including upward pricing pressure both in Japan at April one and also in Florida at June 1. Trapped capital and investor fatigue continue as important drivers in the property space.","We see a mixed casualty reinsurance market continuing in 2020 with some reinsurers writing more and some are treating or writing less. This is a function of perception of loss trends, market share and underwriting actions taken over the last several years. As discussed on many prior earnings calls, given casualty underwriting actions we took the last six to eight years, we are optimistic about the current market.","Mortgage continues to be a core line for us. We have increased our book and expect to see increased reinsurance demand from the buyers in 2020 and beyond. With proactive optimization, continued re-underwriting and diversifying our global portfolio, we are pleased with the outcome at January one and are well positioned for the future. Thank you.","And now I will turn it over to Jon to review our insurance operations.","Jonathan Zaffino","Thank you, John, and good morning.","Everest insurance completed 2019, delivering another year of solid profitable growth with the strongest underwriting income in many years, and as you heard from Juan, achieving a milestone of $270 million of pretax operating income.","Stated simply, the insurance organization is well positioned for continued success in this firming market. Our strategy, thoughtfully executed upon over the past several years, is producing solid results.","We continue to increase our relevance within the specialty insurance segment, and most importantly, among our valued clients. We remain optimistic about the future and continue to see meaningful opportunities ahead. This is an underwriter\u2019s market, and we have the platform, the products and outstanding talent to continue to thrive.","For the full year 2019, we achieved gross written premium growth of 23% or $2.8 billion. Our net written premium, likewise, grew 22% to $2.1 billion. Over the last two quarters of 2019, we experienced a gross written premium growth rate of 30%, which speaks to the accelerated pace of firming in the market and the increased opportunity set across our global specialty wholesale and retail product offerings.","Various underwriting divisions, representing our short, medium and long tail books, all experienced opportunistic growth in the quarter. Our mix remained generally similar to the prior year, with one notable decline in U.S. workers' compensation down 4%, now equaling about 20% of our total writings.","While we continue to see opportunity in workers' compensation, we remain cautious in that line of business. Our short-tail and accident and health portfolios remain roughly 30% of our total mix, and our specialty casualty portfolio is also roughly 30%.","The balance is made up of our various professional and financial lines offerings. Business originated within the U.S. excess and surplus lines market and London wholesale accounted for nearly 40% of our total premium in 2019. This may scale even further as we continue to see meaningful opportunity through this important channel.","Our new business in the quarter was solid once again, and our retention ratio grew in each major distribution segment. Add to this, growth emanating from rate change and all of these factors further contributed to top line performance. As you heard, profitability was solid in both the quarter and year-to-date period. Our year-to-date 2019 result is the strongest underwriting profit in many years and is 6% greater than last year's results on the same basis.","The reported loss ratio was essentially flat year-over-year, registering a 65.2 versus 65 in the prior year. However, the attrition loss ratio improved 20 basis points over the prior year coming in at 66 versus 66.2. The expense ratio for the year remained stable, around 30%, while we continue to invest in people, technology and infrastructure, including our growing international platforms.","As an example, we continue to invest heavily in our claims organization to promote better outcomes for Everest and our clients. This includes the recruitment of outstanding talent across every level of our claims group as well as investments across our operational infrastructure enabled by technology.","Further, we have migrated claims handling away from TPAs and several key product lines and geographies to our in-house claims teams and are very pleased with the results thus far. We will further enhance this important aspect of our organization in 2020. As we look to the rate environment, we see accelerating rate improvement across most of the market.","In the quarter, we experienced pure rate increases, which excludes the impact of exposure of 12% excluding workers' compensation and 7.9% year-to-date on the same basis. This is the largest increasing in many years and continues to be led by double-digit rate increases within our property portfolio. Financial lines and umbrella excess are also showing significant improvement, registering double-digit rate increases as well.","And in the case of excess casualty, rate increases are in the high teens. Encouragingly, we also see primary general liability rates moving up in the fourth quarter as well to the mid-single-digit range. Every major line of business we underwrite showed improvement in rate change momentum in the fourth quarter.","As we have previously noted, we remained very well positioned to take advantage of this improved pricing environment in terms of our people, product set and our ability to offer solutions to clients in this evolving market. Most importantly, all of these actions continue to drive meaningful income in the insurance organization. In conclusion, we entered 2020 with excellent momentum.","Our global platform, extensive global distribution and, most importantly, talented team continued to differentiate Everest insurance in the market. Having recently hosted our 2020 Underwriting Summit, a gathering of our top underwriting leadership across the world, I can assure you the team is focused and prepared to continue executing on our key underwriting directives. We look forward to reporting back to you on our progress next quarter.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Chantelle for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","My first question kind of I guess trying to tie together a few things you guys said in the prepared remarks. It sounds like your cat load should be lower in 2020. I think you guys said around six points relative to where it's been trending. But then it sounds like you guys saw some good opportunity, both on the reinsurance and the retro side at 1\/1?","So is that more a function of just some also good growth you're seeing on the casualty side of things? I'm just trying to lump that all together and why your cat load will be down if you're seeing good growth on the cat side?","Juan Andrade","Yes Elyse, this is Juan. So let me start then I'll ask John Doucette to add to this as well. So as you pointed out, we did see a very good opportunity in the retro market at 1\/1. We continue to see a good economic bet from the perspective of rate momentum. We were also successful in moving further up in attachment points, et cetera. So for us that was really a very good opportunity. And as a result of that, you will also continue to see our volatility continue to improve, as both John Doucette and I mentioned in our prepared remarks.","I think you will see that in our numbers throughout the year. Now with regards to casualty, we also continue to see pretty good opportunity on the reinsurance side, essentially for all the reasons that we mentioned, with the improvement in the primary side of things, particularly in general liability and some of the improvements that we've seen in excess casualty as well, and given the fact we are providing proportional treaties with some key clients, that was also a pretty good opportunity for us up in the 1\/1 period.","John Doucette","Yes, good morning Elyse, this is John Doucette and just wanted to follow-up a couple of things. So, yes, we did see opportunities in certain pockets of the reinsurance, and we saw opportunities in retro and Purple. We also saw places within the property area in the reinsurance that we didn't like, and we scaled back accordingly, and that freed up some of the cat load for us to deploy elsewhere.","We also talked about and deployed additional hedges, reloaded the cat bonds. And they came in lower, which also freed up some of the EL. And then as Juan said, really trying to continue to diversify the book, which is growth in casualty, growth in mortgage and growth in facultative and specialty non-cat-exposed lines of business as well.","Elyse Greenspan","That's helpful. And then, Craig, you mentioned you were kind of going down into some of the pushes and the pulls in terms of the reserve development. In terms of Bermuda segment, I guess the net number is a small number for the quarter. But could we just get a little bit more color on what you strengthened in terms of property and casualty accounts and the size within that segment?","Craig Howie","Sure, Elyse. First of all as you said, we did take some specific action for both property and casualty in the Bermuda segment. For property, we primarily strengthened reserves for one account, which we no longer write, and also a specific loss related to some very older years. In the casualty side, we strengthened reserves for some specific accounts, including a nonstandard auto account that we wrote in 2015 and 2016. We no longer write this account.","The other thing, as you mentioned, there are some puts and takes and there always are. We have over 200 IBNR scenarios. And so you're always going to see some ups and downs. But the other thing that's going on in the Bermuda segment this quarter is we had a one-time commutation of a contract. So that actually served to reduce prior period reserves by about $20 million, and it was offset by about a $20 million commission paid. So essentially, no material impact to the underwriting results in the quarter.","Elyse Greenspan","That's helpful. And then one last question did you guys see any movement in any catastrophe losses, prior year cats in the quarter that offset each other? Or it was just kind of not much movement there in the quarter?","Craig Howie","There's always some movement up and down, Elyse, with respect to catastrophe losses. But overall, our current - our prior year catastrophe losses continue to hold, and there was no overall movement.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Mike Zaremski, Credit Suisse.","Mike Zaremski","Maybe a good commentary in the prepared remarks especially on pricing is there a way to try to frame, I know there's a lot of moving parts, maybe kind of loss cost inflation on the primary insurance casualty side? Are you - is it still kind of stable quarter-over-quarter or some companies are saying it's kind of inching a little higher, curious if any color there?","John Doucette","Good morning Mike, this is John. We definitely - let me go back to sort of what we mentioned in the prepared remarks that we definitely saw a meaningful uptick in the rate environment in the second half of the year. As you mentioned, every line of business has a bit of a different dynamic. We obviously have a process for tracking or viewing rate and trend assumptions across all of our lines of business. But I would tell you that we feel quite confident that the written rate is exceeding trend in virtually every area.","It will take a little bit of time for that to earn through. And this is a comment a bit export comp, of course. But even in that case, we're still seeing negative frequency trends. So we're watching all of this. The uptick as I mentioned, of 12% in the quarter ex-comp, that's up from 7.5% in the third quarter, 6.5% in the second quarter, so you get the feel. So we feel really good about the rate environment. We like where we're heading, and we do believe on a rate basis, we are exceeding trend in almost every area.","Mike Zaremski","And lastly, if I look at the paid to incurred loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, it seems like it ticked up a little bit, and it's above 100%. Anything you'd call out there or is it just normal variability?","Craig Howie","I think that's just normal variability, Mike.","Operator","Our next question will come from Amit Kumar, Buckingham Research.","Amit Kumar","Two follow-up questions, the first question goes back, I think to the first question regarding the shift in business mix in the reinsurance segment, casualty market conditions as well as the cat market conditions. When we think about 2020, would that imply based on the shift that the AY ex cat loss ratio should tick-up or not?","Juan Andrade","So Amit, this is Juan. So look I think let me address it in a couple of different ways. So I think, number one, we are seeing a very programmatic shift in business mix in the company. It's something that we started really in 2019, and it will continue into 2020 as we look to manage volatility on the property cat side of things. And that's essentially the commentary that you've heard from both John and I.","As far as basically being able to shape a book particularly at the 1\/1 renewals, with lower volatility, better margin, et cetera, et cetera. At the same time, it's also the commentary regarding our mortgage book of business, which we continue to see as a terrific opportunity for the company, as well as pockets in casualty. And again, that's not across the board.","We are very discerning underwriters in that sense, but we do see pockets of opportunity as we see the primary rates go up, as we see opportunities for tighter terms and conditions and for us to be able to play in that environment. So from that perspective, I think that makes us real. And let me turn it over to John.","John Doucette","Yes good morning Amit. So there are a couple of countervailing currents, and Juan touched on a couple I'll just add. So like what Jon Zaffino said on the primary side, we are seeing, when it comes to the proportional treaties we write in short and certainly in long-tail lines. We're seeing in specialty lines, we are seeing the rate lift. So we have changing mix of business, which is changing our attritional.","We also see the rate changes. But similarly as Jon Zaffino said, we would expect that to take a while to earn into the numbers. So net-net-net, we probably look to the full year's attritional loss ratio as a good guide.","Amit Kumar","And the second and I guess final question. Going back to the discussion on the reserve parts movement, if we were to step back, the reserve release number is lower than the prior quarter's trend line. And again, I know that one should not look at any sort of repeat of past patterns. But that said, the number is lower than what it has been in the past was that - maybe this question might be for you, Juan. Is that because of your enrollment, maybe something you saw, maybe just talk about that a bit more?","Juan Andrade","Sure, Amit. Look, keep in mind also that we released a total of $94 million in 2019. So while we had $19 million in this quarter, there was also $75 million in releases in prior quarters throughout 2019. That being said, we do have an ongoing and dynamic process to review our reserves. We do recognize bad news quickly, and we require good news to be proven over a longer period of time.","As we do these reserve studies, and if we identify an area where we do need to strengthen, we will take a range of actions. We will increase our loss reserves already on the books, we will increase our current senior loss fix, and we will adjust our pricing targets for new and renewal business.","And I think that's some of what you heard Craig described, particularly for the Bermuda segment in the quarter. But also keep in mind that, I think as Jon Zaffino said, while in most classes in this current market, the rate that's being achieved is outpacing the loss trend. In our business, we do need to see results season over time.","So that leads me to take a position that is cautious upfront, but frankly, willing to have an upside surprise in the future. So in the meantime, we review, we analyze, we act on our portfolio throughout the year, and that's basically the approach that we will follow and that you saw in this quarter.","Operator","Our next question will come from Yaron Kinar, Goldman Sachs.","Yaron Kinar","Good morning everybody. I guess my first question is around third-party capital. So I think both Mt. Logan and Kilimanjaro capital is down year-over-year. How much of that is a function of the markets or external pressure, timing? Or how much of that is just a function of Everest shrinking the gross property cat exposure growing its equity base?","John Doucette","Good morning Yarn, it's John. So as we talked about, we have this - we've talked about before, we tried to have a holistic hedging program across the cat bonds, across Logan, across traditional and other nontraditional hedges that we have in place to really allow us to have the portfolio match the best capital to risk, manage the P&Ls and reduce the volatility.","And we'll dynamically allocate between those based on market conditions, capital availability, really to try to set it up where we're serving our clients and our shareholders the best. In terms of specifically Logan and Kilimanjaro, so cat bonds in general for the entire industry are more out of the money, lower return periods. And they haven't had as many losses over the last couple of years, although there have been some.","So there was - capital was tighter there, but we didn't see the same withdrawal to the same extent that more of the alternative capital playing in the sidecars and other kind of just straight up taking reinsurance or retro risks.","So I think there was more availability there. And we had specifically decided that we wanted to move this - the new cat bonds lower more into the money and less just to be in the tail. So from an EL relief, actually despite it being less dollars of limit purchased, it was more EL relief than the expiring bonds that we had in place.","And in terms of Logan, it really - there's a lot of moving dynamics. There's investors that have come in. There's investors that have scaled up. There's investors that have come out. There are investors that have scaled back. There is clearly - this is an industry comment, not an Everest or Logan comment, but there is investor fatigue with the losses and some of the surprise losses.","So I would say, overall, third-party capital is tight right now. You still have trapped capital, even going back to '17, certainly from '18, and then Jebi happening. I mean Jebi and the development there as well as the recent Japanese losses closer to the renewal season also resulted in more trapped capital. So I think net-net, the third-party capital is tighter, and we'll continue to see that throughout 2019.","Juan Andrade","Yaron, the only thing I would add is that the way we access alternative capital in the end of the year and to 1\/1 really allowed us to build the capacity to deploy and to improve 1\/1 market, as we discussed earlier, particularly to our retro and PURPLE products, while helping us to manage our volatility and our P&L. And so for us, that was very strategic.","Yaron Kinar","Understood, I appreciate the thoughtful answer. And then my next question, probably for Jon Zaffino on the insurance side. So margins - underlying margins seemed very stable year-over-year, had a pretty good ratio there. But nonetheless, I think we did see an uptick at the end of the year, both in the expense ratio and the loss ratio, underlying loss ratio?","Can you maybe talk about that and is that just normal volatility or is that something that you really maybe - was a step change or a small step change, I guess, into the end of the year?","Jonathan Zaffino","Yes, thanks for the question. Let me try to provide some additional color on this. So let me - I'll start with taking on a couple of parts. First off, as you mentioned, we do think the year-to-date number is a better gauge and more reflective of our performance. As respect to the attritional loss ratio and that 140 basis point increase you saw in the quarter, there is noise in the quarter emanating predominantly from an unallocated loss adjustment expense, a UA expense catch-up that affected the attritional loss ratio.","Excluding that catch-up, the pure attritional loss ratio actually declined by about 100 basis points. Then again on a year-to-date basis, the attritional is flat basically for the full year. I also want to add, and if you recall in prior calls, we did take a more conservative view of our work comp book earlier in the year. So, on a year-to-date basis, that's also creating about a 70 basis point headwind, if you will to the year-over-year comparative.","As respects, the expense ratio, as Craig mentioned, we experienced favorable prior period development in our work comp book as we have for the past couple of years, and associated with that was a one-time profit commission, which caused the commission ratio to go up a bit in the quarter. Absent of that, we had about a 200 basis point improvement in the commission ratio. And secondly, there were some timing issues associated with expense accruals in 4Q.","And we also had some prior year lower incentive comp accruals based on company performance, et cetera. So that just hopefully gives you a little bit of color as to sort of what was going on in the quarter. But again, we think the full year numbers are more indicative of our run rate and our trend.","Operator","Our next question will come from Meyer Shields, KBW.","Meyer Shields","I want to look at the reserves from maybe a different perspective. When we look on a full year basis, we're seeing a little bit of a decrease in dollars of reserve release. Is it fair to say that the gap between the conservative numbers that you're booking and the ASCO numbers out there that, that gap is shrinking?","Craig Howie","Meyer, overall, I would say, the conservative numbers that we're booking come from how we select our loss picks over a long period of time. In other words, that's part of our annual planning process, and we take into account factors like rate change and loss trend and historical loss ratios. And as we set those reserves, we go through this process with our reserving actuaries, our pricing actuaries, our underwriting and our claims area as well as management.","We select from various metrics, whether that be prior year loss selections, the plan, the bridge, which takes into account our - both rate and trend. And then we also have the reserve studies that come from the reserving actuaries. And then we also look at how the business is priced and how the underwriters select those loss picks. We go through that. We also compare that to our actual reported loss experience.","And then we modify it each quarter as we go through the reserve committee meetings and the underlying assumptions. As I said before, we have over 200 IBNR categories that we look at, and some are - some go up each quarter, and some come down each quarter as we look at this and as we go through the reserve studies. So what I would say to you is the process has not changed.","We continue to go through that process. We continue to quickly recognize unfavorable development that we're seeing in that process, but we tend to hold or recognize favorable development over a much longer period of time. So as I would say to you and I've said to you before, we continue to hold the more recent years. And again, this quarter, we took action on some specific accounts. But overall, the process has not changed over time.","Meyer Shields","Second question, I guess international reinsurance had a phenomenal attritional loss ratio. Was there anything unusual or was that just a true-up for the full year?","Craig Howie","Essentially, for international it's not necessarily a true-up. What I would say to you is in that - in those areas of the world, and what I'm talking about here are Latin America, Brazil, Middle East and Africa. What we saw was fewer non-catastrophe-type storms in those regions, which allowed us to take down what we would call property-related loss picks that would fall below our cat threshold for that period. So that's what you're seeing come down in the fourth quarter for that region.","Operator","Our next question will come from Brian Meredith, UBS.","Brian Meredith","Yes thanks, just a couple of quick ones here. First, what was the impact of the crop loss in the quarter on the underlying combined ratio at reinsurance? And was it all U.S. reinsurance or was it elsewhere as well?","Craig Howie","So it happened in two separate regions, Brian. But essentially, it's $50 million.","Brian Meredith","Yes.","Craig Howie","And the two separate regions are U.S. reinsurance as well as it happened in Canada as well. So from a total reinsurance perspective overall, the $50 million is about 3.5 points for the quarter and about one point overall for the year.","Brian Meredith","And then I guess, one bigger picture question, curious, for Juan and Jon. Given the magnitude of growth that you're seeing right now in your insurance operation can you talk about - I mean and I see that obviously, your expenses are up, so you're kind of adding people and stuff. Talk about how you get comfortable with the magnitude of growth that's going on right now. I mean I know it's a good rate environment, but substantial, substantial growth has done and how you're controlling that?","Juan Andrade","Yes, sure so let me start that, and then I'll hand it over to Jon Zaffino. So I think it's important to recognize where the growth is coming from, right? And I think as Jon illustrated in his prepared remarks, it's really from a couple of buckets right so increased rate is certainly part of that. Keeping in mind that we did have a 12% increase in rate in the quarter, excluding workers' compensation, so that's certainly part of the lift.","The other part of the lift that we're seeing is about 40% of our business and growing is exposed to the E&S space, which is really where we've seen the majority of the opportunity come up at this point in time. We also had very good renewal retention. If we look at our retail book of business, it's really in the mid to high 80s, and our E&S retention is in a good place. So you look at those three things: an increase in rate, opportunity particularly in the E&S space, solid renewal retention.","And on top of that, you add the fact that we've added about 60 additional underwriters throughout 2019 and starting to get essentially the picture where that growth is coming from. Now specific to your question on how we manage this, et cetera. That is some of the investments that you're seeing us continue to make, both in technology as well as infrastructure for the company.","One of the things too that I think is unique to us is that we have a very focused distribution footprint, and so we know who has the business that we want. We're trying to increase the shelf space with them, and we're not out there buying to basically grow with everybody. So that also allows us to have a much more focused presence from a distribution standpoint that's out there.","But investments in technology, investments in our target operating model, et cetera all basically give us comfort that the growth that we're seeing is something that is sustainable for us, which at the end of the day, is really the most important thing, it\u2019s really sustainable, profitable growth. Jon?","Jonathan Zaffino","Yes no I think thanks Juan that's really well said. I would just sort of maybe echo a couple of Juan's points here. Number one and you could see it in the supplement, our growth is balanced and diversified across our chosen product areas and maybe to amplify a couple of Juan's points. Our growth in the E&S market is growing faster than our top line overall. So we are taking advantage of that.","So the comment on our rate and exposure lift, that accounted for about 20% of our growth in the fourth quarter, so just to give you an order of magnitude there. And then yes, we're well positioned with our trading partners. The value they see and what Everest can bring to the table is creating basically record submission flows. We're well into the 150,000-plus submission activity. So, all that together in conjunction to what Juan said, is what's sort of creating this environment.","Operator","Thank you very much. At this time, we have no further questions in the queue. So I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing comments.","Juan Andrade","Well, thank you for your questions and allowing us to talk about the year and the quarter. As I mentioned before, we are very well positioned for 2020. We were very pleased with our 1\/1 renewals, and we're excited with the momentum that we continue to see in our insurance business going forward. So with that, we look forward to updating you at the end of the first quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time this now concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your phone lines, and have a great rest of the week. Thank you."],"8596":["Everest Re Group, Ltd. (NYSE:RE) Q1 2014 Earnings Conference Call April 24, 2014 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Beth Farrell - Vice President, Investor Relations","Dom Addesso - President and Chief Executive Officer","John Doucette - Chief Underwriting Officer","Craig Howie - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Amit Kumar - Macquarie","Meyer Shields - KBW","Brian Meredith - UBS","Ian Gutterman - BAM","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","Operator","Good day, everyone and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Beth Farrell - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Augusta. Good morning, and welcome to Everest Re Group\u2019s first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting Officer; and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today\u2019s call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements.","Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.","Dom Addesso - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Beth and good morning to all. We are pleased to report another excellent quarter, which continues to improve on the trend from last year. The attritional combined ratio for the first quarter improved to 80.4% from 81% for the full year of 2013. Premium volume continues to grow rising 7% over last year. Despite softening in the property cat market, there are still sufficient opportunities for profitable growth for Everest given our scale and financial strength. John will get into further detail in his report, but is evidenced by the improving combined ratio. The growth has come with improving margins, which is partly the result of new products, particularly in the credit and specialty line space.","In the property reinsurance lines, where there have been rate reductions would continue to modify our portfolio to achieve the best risk-adjusted return. So, for example, in Canada, where rates were going up for property catastrophe exposed lines, we committed more capacity. Likewise in other territories, we reduced our move to different layers, our move to pro rata from excess, or we rode different types of product. Of course, we did renew accounts at reduced rates, but only when they met our return hurdles. And in most regions, there is still business at attractive rates. I must emphasize that the ability to diversify and remain flexible is the key to improving margins.","An additional tool that has enabled us to improve our net position is our capital markets platform, Mt. Logan. This has enabled us to increase our share across many programs and bring new product to market. While at the same time earned fees and profit share on the business sourced. A key value of our global franchise is being able to marry the risk appetite of the capital markets, with a global, well-diversified source of business, constructed by best-in-class underwriting and analytical skills. There are not many that can duplicate this value proposition.","You also no doubt saw that we recently came to market for cap-on placement. This is another capital market vehicle allowing us to leverage our underwriting ability and marketing reach across a larger capital base. This transformation of our business at least for now is about capital management. Capital is now available in many forms. And while this can cause us to reshape our capital structure, one thing is constant, developing business, underwriting that business, producing contracts and paying claims. These additional forms of capital provide more options for managing our equity base and funding growth. We are flexible and adaptive to change that can add value to customers and shareholders.","You have also heard us speak about our insurance operations as another source of business that can be a diversifying risk. For these reasons we have continued to increase our emphasis in building this business out further while remaining focused on improving results. In the first quarter results we are clearly seeing the early signs of this progress with a 98.2% combined ratio. Same time, we have already expanded into new products and territories. And excluding crop insurance which was down in the quarter, our insurance book grew 10% in the first quarter. Craig will explain the adjustment in crop premiums (first) quarter. Our crop business remains an important part of our strategy, but we will face some downward pressure on the premium side in part because of the decline in commodity prices from last year. Nevertheless, our plan is to grow our footprint as diversification is key to developing and managing a profitable book in this sector.","As we move forward, the significance of emphasizing underwriting profitability in all segments takes on even greater importance as investment income continues to come under pressure. In the low rate environment and in a business where asset allocation is closely followed by rating agencies, there are limited options. We were an \u2013 early adopters of different asset allocation strategies which has kept our returns amongst the best in the sector. However, given constraints, we are not expecting dramatic changes from here. Nevertheless, we will continue to be active but prudent in terms of allocation.","Despite these headwinds, whether it is a tough rate environment, third party capital, with declining investment income, we have another terrific quarter with net income of almost $300 million and return on capital of 17%. And we would expect this to continue through the remainder of the year absent any significant events. With these results and our focus on managing capital we are pleased to be able to return to shareholders $285 million in the first quarter through share repurchase and dividends. This is a record for us in any one quarter. And we are committed to returning capital consistent with the needs of the business.","Thank you and now to Craig for the financial highlights.","Craig Howie - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Dom and good morning everyone. We are pleased to report that Everest had another strong quarter of earnings with after-tax operating income of $281 million or $5.93 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2014, this compares to operating income of $301 million or $5.88 per share for the first quarter of 2013. Net income for the first quarter was $294 million or $6.21 per diluted share, compared to $384 million or $7.50 per share in 2013. Net income includes realized capital gains and represents an annualized return on equity of over 17%.","These results were driven by a solid underwriting result offset by lower net investment income compared to the first quarter of 2013. The results reflect the continued improvement in the overall current year attritional combined ratio of 80.4%, down from 80.7% at the first quarter of 2013 and down from 81.0% at year end 2013. This measure excludes the impact of catastrophes reinstatement premiums and prior period loss development.","The total reinsurance attritional combined ratio was 77.3% compared to 76.8% in the prior year first quarter. The slight increase in this ratio for the reinsurance portfolio was anticipated after the January 1 renewals and with the additional pro rata business written. The insurance segment attritional combined ratio was 97.2% compared to 98.5% in the prior year. However, eliminating the effects of the primary crop book, this ratio would have been 92.8% compared to 95.9% in the prior year.","All segments reported underwriting gains for the quarter. Neither this year, nor last year included any catastrophe losses in the first quarter. Total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $215 million for the quarter compared to $210 million underwriting gain last year. The insurance segment reported an underwriting gain of $4 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $193,000 last year.","Each year reflected an underwriting loss for crop insurance in the first quarter due to the seasonality of crop premium. Earned premium for crop insurance declined at $17 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to last year. The estimated premium was adjusted to reflect the lower-than-expected premium for the winter crop season due to the re-underwriting of the book and commodity price reductions year-over-year. Based on current prices, we expect the crop premium to decline for the full year of 2014 as well compared to 2013.","Mt. Logan Re\u2019s financial position and operating results were consolidated into Everest beginning July 1, 2013. These results were included in a separate segment and reflected a $10 million underwriting gain in the first quarter of 2014. Everest retained $2 million of income and $8 million was attributable to the non-controlling interests of this entity. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $228 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $210 million in the same period last year. Our reported combined ratio was 80.0% for the quarter compared to 80.7% in 2013. Our low expense ratio of 4.4% continues to be a major competitive advantage.","On reserves, our overall quarterly internal reserving metrics remained favorable. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $123 million for the quarter on our $16.8 billion investment portfolio. Investment income declined $23 million from one year ago. This decrease was primarily driven by the decline in the limited partnership result for the quarter, although low reinvestment rates and capital used to redeem stock and debt also contributed.","Limited partnership investments resulted in a loss of $2 million for the quarter compared to a $17 million gain in the first quarter of 2013. Our existing limited partnership portfolio was fairly mature and we are starting to see a decline in current gains coming from these investments. Despite the declining rates, our investment portfolio continues to perform well. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.1% with the duration of just over three years. The quarter reflected $13 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $83 million last year. These gains are mainly attributable to fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio. There were $2 million of derivative losses during the first quarter compared to $15 million of derivative gains last year. This is related to our equity put options and is a function of the change in interest rates during the fourth quarter.","On income taxes, the 13.8% effective tax rate on operating income is in line with our expected tax rate for the year. Stable cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $367 million for the quarter compared to $259 million in 2013. This is despite the high level of catastrophe loss payments over the past few years. Shareholders\u2019 equity for the group was $7 billion at the end of the first quarter, up $69 million from year end 2013. This is after taking into account capital return through the $250 million share buybacks and the $35 million dividends paid in the first quarter of 2014. Book value per share increased 4% to $152.80 from $146.57 at year end 2013.","Our strong capital position leaves us with capacity to maximize our business opportunities as well as continue share repurchases. Thank you. And now John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting Officer will provide the operations review.","John Doucette - Chief Underwriting Officer","Thank you, Craig. Good morning. As Dom highlighted we had a strong start to the 2014 year. Our group first quarter 2014 gross written premium was $1.3 billion, up $90 million from Q1 of last year with growth coming predominantly from U.S. reinsurance and international reinsurance. For our reinsurance segments total reinsurance gross written premium including Logan was $1.04 billion for the quarter, up 12% from Q1 last year. As mentioned on the last earnings call, we continued to benefit from flight-to-quality, rolling out new products, expanding our relationships with some larger clients and writing U.S. property exposures domestically as we leverage the competitive advantage of our high ratings and significant capacity.","We have continued to make progress in our multi-line initiative in the USA developing new relationships and broadening existing relationships with multi-line clients as our underwriters relationships with those clients go back for many years sometimes decades. In Q1 we deployed capacity to fund several short tailed quota share treaties at terms we found attractive. Expanded our purple lightings and continued to deploy capacity this quarter in credit related opportunities. Total reinsurance including Logan bottom line we had a very solid quarter with underwriting profits of $225 million, up 7% compared to last year Q1 underwriting profits.","Now, some color on April 1 reinsurance renewals. For our overall reinsurance book, we grew our global property gross written premium and continued to see dollar margin expansion in the overall book at 41 compared to last year. With the combined ratio and the expected risk adjusted returns remaining flat from the prior period. This demonstrates the strength and the diversification of our business. That said, specifically for Japan our premium dollars in Japan were down from last year due to the following reasons. The continued consolidation trend among of longstanding clients result in an emerged reinsurance treaties and in some cases less pro rata premium. Japanese exchange rates caused the decrease in gross written premium in U.S. dollars. And rate decreases on Japanese excess of loss treaties of 10% to 15%.","Turning to our overall casualty reinsurance book globally, while primary rates remain attractive seeding commissions on casualty quota share treaties are still under pressure. Therefore we remain cautious of deploying capacity on risks, which appear to have heavy competition. Nonetheless, we continue to find new insurance and reinsurance products and new deals where we can and deploy our capacity at attractive risk adjusted rates. Through the first quarter and at 41 we continued to rollout and utilize Mt. Logan Re and saw these benefits at each renewal as it allowed us to deploy larger lines on attractively priced treaties and provide more capacity to targeted clients, while containing our PMLs.","We are pleased to report that with additional capital raised at 41, Logan is now in excess of $400 million in AUM. And again 100% of the Logan capacity is fully deployed. This success continues to highlight the significant value proposition we bring to our capital market investor partners in Logan while being completely seamless to our clients who continued to deal with the same core reinsurance trading partner Everest as they have for many years. This smooth flexible deployment of capacity to our clients has helped us secure better signings on many non-cat exposed classes as more of our clients look to have broader and deeper relationships with pure high-quality re-insurers.","In addition to Logan, we have initiated other PML and capital management strategies. As Dom mentioned, we recently obtained $450 million of fully collateralized catastrophe reinsurance coverage funded in the cap-on market. This coverage was purchased through Kilimanjaro Re across two layers. One layer is in a current space deal providing tail protection for Southeastern USA wind risk and the other layer is an aggregate cover for providing tail protection for all natural perils in the U.S. and Puerto Rico as well as British Columbia earthquake risk in Canada.","The combination of Logan cap-ons and other reinsurance and retrocessional protections from both traditional and alternative markets allows us to match our portfolio of risks to the best capital structure. This in turn allows us to broaden our product offerings and our value proposition both to our clients and to our shareholders. With this flexibility on how and where we deploy our underwriting capacity combined with flexibility of the form of our capital structure to mange those same risks, we believe we can and will continue to improve our risk adjusted returns and improve our cost of capital. In the end, we are pleased with our Q1 reinsurance results and continue to nimbly identify, execute, and deploy capital to profitable opportunities across the global reinsurance market.","Turning to our insurance operations, our premium was $230 million in Q1, down from last year\u2019s Q1 gross written premium of $250 million. However, this decrease is primarily driven by premium adjustments for Heartland\u2019s crop book for the reasons, which Greg mentioned. Stripping out Heartland premium, our insurance operations GWP is up 10% year-over-year for Q1 with most other insurance segments showing growth reflecting the impact of the initiatives we have put in place over the last couple of years. We continue to see profitable growth opportunities in many areas and we have been successful growing in those areas that we have targeted, including non-program workers\u2019 comp, casualty, specialty lines, property, E&S and DIC, non-standard auto and accident and health.","We continue to see primary rate improvements in almost all insurance segments. However, we have seen some weakening in some of the professional insurance lines, where we remain cautious in our deployment of capacity. Our California Workers\u2019 Comp book saw an average of 8% rate increases in the first quarter continuing the significant rate increases for the last several years providing a compound rate increase in excess of 60% over the last five years. We continue to see profitable growth and positive rate increases in our property E&S and DIC books and see that expanding throughout the rest of 2014 as primary rates have been holding across this book.","Bottom line, our reported insurance results were positive with a 98% combined ratio for the first quarter. And after eliminating the effects of Heartland, the combined ratio was 94%, down 2 points when viewing Q1 2013 on a comparable basis. We are pleased with the underlying trends in our insurance book as we begin to see the positive results of our initiatives over the last several years with noted improvements in both loss ratios and expense ratios.","In summary, around the globe, we have viewed not only as a lead re-insurer in all P&C lines of business, but also as a creative problem solver and we continue to be given the opportunity with our broker partners to structure new deals, new products, and alternative solutions for many of our corporate and insurance clients. Thus, we remain very bullish on our future.","Thank you and now back to Beth for Q&A.","Beth Farrell - Vice President, Investor Relations","Yes. Augusta, we are open for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Jay Gelb of Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Thank you. On the insurance segment with the 94 combined ratio excluding Heartland in the first quarter, would you anticipate is that sort of the right run rate we should anticipate for the rest of the year barring any usual items?","Dom Addesso","Jay, this is Dom. That certainly would be a reasonable assumption. It could improve from there, but due to continued improvement in California comp, but that\u2019s a reasonable assumption.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Including the crop book would be a couple of points higher all-in?","Dom Addesso","The crop book actually for the year we are still anticipating at this point mid 90s combined, so low 90s combined depending on the outcome of winter wheat, but generally we are expecting the overall number to gravitate towards the mid 90s on an accident year basis.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","The next issue is on partnership income, Craig, I think you mentioned that were \u2013 that part of the decline was reflecting the book seasoning. So just trying to get a perspective on for the remaining quarters, maybe what we should be penciling in, in terms of partnership return?","Craig Howie","Well, as I said, we are starting to see a slight decline, because they are become fairly mature, but as you noticed even over the last several quarters, it has started to come down. This quarter we happen to have one partnership that threw off a loss of over $5 million, which is what was driving the $2 million loss in the quarter, but it has been coming down over the last several quarters.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Right. So in the back half of last year when it was running in that kind of $5 million\u2026","Craig Howie","$5 million for quarter.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Yes.","Craig Howie","I think that\u2019s probably a better estimate, Jay.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then Dom, do you have any thoughts or commentary on the recent movement we have seen in Bermuda between Endurance and Aspen, has that changed your view at all on M&A in Bermuda or anticipating any sort of increased consolidation beyond that transaction?","Dom Addesso","Well, I didn\u2019t expect that question right out of the gate. I think first of all let me say, it certainly would be inappropriate for me to comment on the transaction per se and I know that\u2019s not what you are asking about, but clearly I think that as we have been discussing in some of our opening comments, we have benefited by, for example, by our scale and our strength in the marketplace and our capital position. And I think in part if this transaction or transactions like this are in fact an attempt to achieve a different level of scale in the marketplace. So, it doesn\u2019t surprise me, not particularly this transaction, but that we would see transactions like this bubble up in the marketplace for that reason. The other reasons I really wouldn\u2019t be in a position to comment on, but I do think that\u2019s in part what\u2019s driving this particular idea and perhaps ideas like this in the future.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","I appreciate that. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the Vinay Misquith of Evercore.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","Hi, good morning. So, first just the numbers questions, curious how much was the crop insurance negative adjustment, I believe you mentioned $17 million, so was that for the earned premiums, so was the adjustment $17 million or what the premiums down $17 million?","Dom Addesso","The earned premium was down $17 million. The net premium that was written is down $30 million for the quarter.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore","Sorry. And what was the impact of \u2013 just the adjustment for the entire $40 million, sorry?","Dom Addesso","Down $15 million.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore","Okay. So down $15 million, okay, fine. That\u2019s the adjustment, okay. Second is we have seen that citizens has upsized take at bond significantly, what do you think is going to happen on the June 1 renewals for Florida?","Dom Addesso","Well, certainly there is downward pressure in the overall property cat space depending on the territory. And given how well that market is still priced, we certainly would expect that pressure to carryover into Florida. In terms of our prediction as to how much, well, we will just have to wait and see. We are not prognosticating at this point. No, for us, we write on an XOL basis about $130 million in Florida and then the remainder of our exposure is on a pro rata basis. And as we said again in our opening comments, if rates are down, but still meet our return hurdles, yes, we may do some continuing XOL, but it more likely be that perhaps we would ship some of our capacity to quota share. And again it depends on what the market is willing to give us from this June.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just one last numbers question I believe the tax rate 13.8% that I hear correctly that you expect, yes, and I believe you mentioned that you expect that for the entire year. Historically, I thought it was between 12% and 13%, so curious why you expect a higher tax rate for this year? Thanks.","Dom Addesso","13.8% is an effective tax rate that we would expect for the year that rate could even go up from there as we have talked about in the past specifically on the last quarter call that if there are no catastrophes for the year that rate could even go up. That\u2019s with an expected amount of catastrophes for the year.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is \u2026","Dom Addesso","Excuse me, one other point, keep in mind that, that in your assumptions that rate does have to move with cat losses, so you can take the rate up without taking expected cat losses down, correct.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Wouldn\u2019t just I know we \u2013 it sounds like we got some pieces per crop, but would it be possible just to get the 1Q premium for crop and then the combined ratio for crop for the first quarter?","Dom Addesso","1Q premium for crop was minus 15% for gross written premium.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Okay.","Dom Addesso","And I\u2019m sorry your second question was\u2026","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","The earn premium, I mean, I guess the earned premium that rolled into revenues?","Dom Addesso","The earned premium that you would see in the first quarter for crop is only about $2 million.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Okay, got it. Great, thanks. And then the question about the California comp book, can you talk about the rate you took in remind us what the rate you took in 2013 and where loss churn was there and where you are booking comps today on an action in here on an initial pick basis?","Dom Addesso","I\u2019ll let Craig give you the last year information, but right now for California comp on an accident year basis, we are in the mid 90s.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Accident year combined?","Dom Addesso","Yes.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Okay, got it. Great.","Dom Addesso","I don\u2019t know if Craig is looking for some of the information\u2026","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. And then if I can just ask one more. So in Bermuda, is it possible to know and I realize it to blended book and probably there is some \u2013 there is some composition change to it, but is it possible to get an idea of what the year-over-year change in pricing or rate was in that book?","Dom Addesso","You are talking about\u2026.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Roughly.","Dom Addesso","What property cat, because Bermuda is a mixture of property and casualty, so it\u2019s a little tough to answer that question.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Well, let me get to the base of my question. So the part I am trying to understand is the attritional loss ratio was flattish year-over-year and it\u2019s been down on a year-over-year basis for the last few quarters. And I am just trying to understand just given generally that there has been some pressure in reinsurance pricing how does that factoring, because if it were just typical primary insurance or something very simple, you have reductions in pricing that would cause your combined ratio to rise, but it seems like we have absorbed is the market some declines in pricing, but that attritional ratio has been flat. I am guessing there is some mix change in there or something I am just trying to reconcile that?","Dom Addesso","It\u2019s exactly that. It\u2019s the mix change. They can move in and out of retro business depending on what we do, out of London and some of those transactions, it\u2019s essentially mix change which is driving that.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Right. So, I mean \u2013 so, is it fair to assume that if all else equal if you have this environment and you have mix change, which it allows you to keep your attritional flat, does that mean that you are taking more risk per unit of premium that you are collecting?","Dom Addesso","Well, first of all, keep in mind that on a gross written premium basis, Bermuda was down year-over-year.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Yes.","Dom Addesso","And I think it\u2019s a reflection of when we say a mix change, it\u2019s kind of we would like to emphasize over and over is that we have the capacity, the willingness and the ability to actually change our mix and move from one class of business to another, one layer to another always trying to achieve the best risk-adjusted return. So that\u2019s really what we are striving to do and in times you will see a segment like Bermuda, for example, perhaps slip in premium, because we are backing away from certain class of business that aren\u2019t giving us the right return.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Right. I mean, if we are in an environment where if there continues to be challenges in the reinsurance market, is it possible to just keep that attritional loss ratio flat even with pressure just, are there some limitations of mix that will cause at some point that attritional loss ratio to start to rise?","Dom Addesso","There is always that potential. And it all depends on how fast and how far rate decreases are and what we back away from in terms of business that doesn\u2019t meet our return hurdle. So, yes, if you would want to continue to write the same book of business, year-in and year-out, yes, attritionals will rise. On the other hand, if you move into different new products, different geographies change attachment point, use the capital markets potentially. I mean, there is lots of ways in which we can maintain our profitability throughout difficult, which you are describing as a difficult market.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Great, thank you very much for answering those questions. I appreciate it.","Operator","We will go next to Amit Kumar of Macquarie.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie","Thanks and good morning. Just a few quick follow-up questions. First of all, going back to the Florida piece, you mentioned that your XOL piece is $130 million, is the remainder $70 million or so or am I thinking of the total Florida book wrongly?","Dom Addesso","Our Florida pro rata is approximately it would be another couple of $100 million or in total \u2013 sorry, in total it would be $280 million roughly, that\u2019s XOL and pro rata.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. The follow-up to that point is I think last year you had talked about getting preferential signings, you talked about private players, multi-year deals are you seeing that phenomenon for at least this year too or is it much different?","Dom Addesso","I will let John answer that.","John Doucette","Yes, this is John, Amit. Yes, we are seeing that opportunity in some cases private layers, in some cases clearly at 11 and 41 preferential signings, but also new products, new layers, new products with existing clients and new clients. And that answers the prior question about attritional losses as well. It\u2019s our job to figure out how to make money, no matter what market we face. And yes we are seeing the opportunities where we are one of the biggest broker markets in the world and we are getting better and better signings from brokers and clients working with the brokers.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie","And then when you mentioned new clients are the smaller I guess new de-pop entities who exactly are these\u2026?","Dom Addesso","We are not talking just Florida here. We are talking across the entire portfolio globally. So its new clients globally, it\u2019s an with existing clients across the world. Specifically in Florida I mean we have relationships with almost 40 companies and we see how deal that comes into the market and we have been trading with many of those clients for many, many years. And we do have relationships that are not broadly marketed.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie","Got it. That\u2019s quite helpful. The other question I think is a follow-up to Mike\u2019s question on maybe California comp. Did you see any changes in loss cost trends over the past quarter. There has been obviously a lot of debate. A lot of reports have come out on the impact of SB-863. And it seems that impacted very strong the companies presence in the marketplace do you see any changes in your book or has it been sort of a steady state from 2013?","Dom Addesso","We have not yet seen any changes I am not saying we are not out there. But we have maintained \u2013 actually we didn\u2019t answer much question earlier about loss cost trends. We have build loss cost trends into projection and that\u2019s typically depending on massive business in the mid to high single digit range so that\u2019s built into our reserve assumptions. And so far that has been sufficient clearly in the most recent accident years. The reserve development we saw in the fourth quarter of last year is primarily older years.","John Doucette","And the answer to Mike\u2019s question was the rate increase for 2013 was 13%. And we were running in the 96 range last year on an accident basis.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie","Got it. The final question?","Dom Addesso","So just to follow-up on that you can see that we \u2013 while the combined ratio has not improved to the level of rate increases which means that we are taking some of that obviously into loss cost trend and probably more than as necessary at this point but (indiscernible).","Amit Kumar - Macquarie","That\u2019s good. The final question is probably a follow-up to Jade initial question as you look at your growth prospects your purple on Logan you have talked about different new products I am curious as you sort of look out how do you look at organic growth versus outside opportunities to add to the portfolio?","Dom Addesso","What\u2019s the distinction that you are making between organic growth and outside opportunities.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie","What I am trying to ask is based on all the changes we are seeing recently is it fair to say that probably you don\u2019t need to look at other entities at this juncture?","Dom Addesso","Okay, I am sorry. So right now we do not need to do that and in fact growth strategy at least for us will never be built on an acquisition. It doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t look at many things because as you can well imagine everyone calls us when there is a potential deal out there. But we do not build our growth strategy off of an acquisition. We prefer frankly to build from within so you don\u2019t have to deal with legacy issues, integration issues and nine times out of ten there is limited strategic value to many of the opportunities that we see.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie","Got it. That did answer my question. Thanks. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.","Dom Addesso","Thank you.","Craig Howie","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields - KBW","Thanks. Dom you talked earlier about the tendency of seeding commissions to go up now, is that trend varying by the size of the seeding, is that different now than it was five or ten years ago?","Dom Addesso","That was John that spoke to that and I don\u2019t know that we are necessarily seeing it differently by size customer. Certainly, it can be influenced by the size of the transaction given that there might be some that are hungrier for premium. That would maybe \u2013 could be the only comment I would make about that.","John Doucette","And obviously, this is John, and obviously it is also reflective of the clients\u2019 individual experience. So, lot of cases, whether it\u2019s whatever class of business they are in, if they are spending that results, we see seeding commissions going down. If there has been catastrophes that have hit, there are covers, including pro rata deals, seeding commissions go down. So, really it\u2019s both the macro and the micro situation that drives these.","Meyer Shields - KBW","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And very briefly is there a good proxy we can use of limited partnerships?","Dom Addesso","Well in the past, we have guided people to just the general equity markets. And I think we probably still would say that, that is as good a proxy as you can get and I think it points to what Craig mentioned earlier that in response to another question that our limited partnerships were quite strong last year, but that\u2019s kind of in line with the general equity markets were strong last year. And conversely, the equity markets in the first quarter this year were not quite as strong or flattish. And I think that\u2019s consistent with our limited partnership experience, except for the one. I mean, in our particular case, there was this one LP, which was distorting I think what we would otherwise normally have expected for the quarter. And that we would not expect that going forward. So, I would say that the best proxy you can use is the general equity market \u2013 public equity market.","Meyer Shields - KBW","Okay, fantastic. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Brian Meredith of UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS","Yes. Couple of quick questions. The first one and my apologies if I missed this, but in the insurance segment, operating expenses were down about 13% year-over-year, was there something unusual that happened there?","Dom Addesso","Just good stewards on the expense side, in part it\u2019s premium growth and frankly that\u2019s most of it and maybe some internal allocations, but nothing dramatic other than premium growth.","Brian Meredith - UBS","Premium right, but actual expenses were down 13% year-over-year.","Dom Addesso","That would be driven by allocation, you include commissions in that.","Brian Meredith - UBS","No.","Dom Addesso","That would just be allocations then.","Brian Meredith - UBS","Okay, thanks. And then Dom and John, I wonder if you could just update or not update or just remind us kind of what\u2019s your thoughts are on Watford Re and then there is a bunch of other companies that are kind of looking into these types of potential facilities, what interest level would an Everest have of potentially doing something like that and what do you think the potential impact is on the casualty markets, reinsurance markets?","Dom Addesso","Well, yes, one of your questions was that we are looking at that as I think probably most of our peer companies are doing. And we haven\u2019t yet determined where we are going with or we have not yet concluded on that analysis yet. And generally it would certainly cause one to think that it could soften the casualty reinsurance market further from where it is now.","On the other hand of the types of transactions that are likely to go into these types \u2013 into these facilities are not generally \u2013 generally already tend to be lower margin type business, lower volatility associated with the class of the business that fit these structures. And so it may not have as dramatic an impact as has been prognosticated by many on the overall capital market. That remains to be seen. I am not sure that any of us really know for sure where that all ends up, but it is something we are looking at. And in fact it can create interesting opportunities for seeding companies frankly that to help them with their cost to capital on transactions and they in fact create opportunities into the reinsurance market space that don\u2019t exist today. We are the casualty space frankly where a lot of companies are holding on seeding less business, increasing mix. Some of these ideas can in fact create transactions that can help their P&L or balance sheet and perhaps a reinsurer can add value and see premium go up in the space. There are a lot of possibilities that can come out of these structures, but we are examining that very closely.","Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS","Great. Thanks for answers.","Operator","We will go next to Ian Gutterman of BAM.","Ian Gutterman - BAM","Hi, good morning. I guess a few different questions on different parts of your cap book, just to follow up on the Florida question from earlier, obviously we speculate pressure on extra well which is mentioned, you talked about your book, can you talk about I assume there will be upward pressure on seed-in commissions in quarter two is out there and can you give us the sense of how you think about that?","Dom Addesso","Again there is many, many moving parts to it. There is a current submits to seed-in commissions to the extent and we saw this phenomenon last year to the extent that there was a \u2013 to the extent that the reinsurance spanning goes down from some of our clients resulted in more attractive combined ratios including seed-in commission to the reinsurer. So we \u2013 as we talked about it on the last couple of calls, we wrote more pro rata business last June. We also wrote more pro rata business at one -one. We wrote another $50 million - $55 million of property pro rata at one-one. And again we crossed our book the combined ratio globally improved.","John Doucette","I wouldn\u2019t expect that the same dynamics that we are expecting be extra well of our market from the introduction of third party capital to have as to no matter can impact on the pro rata market that I think is really what you are getting in.","Ian Gutterman - BAM","Yes, exactly. Okay, great and then as a follow up to that on the extra well side given the talk on how much rates will fall this year, do you feel like we are approaching a bottom or are we near people\u2019s walk away price or if there is another no last year and there is still abundant capacity next year can flow the rate go down another double digits or are we getting closer to walk away point.","Dom Addesso","I don\u2019t know we answered that question certainly if we were to go down to your question, 10 this year and 10 next year, we certainly would be getting very, very close to all walk away point.","Ian Gutterman - BAM","Okay.","Dom Addesso","On a full basis, but again remember that it doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t participate in that market through our platform. If capital markets are willing to come down to those levels then we have the capacity that we can deploy in that fashion or move again to more pro rata. And as we can still stay very, very active in the marketplace and move to other products, move to different attachments points. Perhaps write the business and use the capital markets as a reinsurer, so there are many ways in which this can play out to our benefit frankly going forward.","Ian Gutterman - BAM","Got it. And then that actually leads to the next question on the cap on, I was just confused and maybe this was just nomenclature or something that I don\u2019t quite follow, but is your for US vendors I think $1.2 billion at the 1 and 100 and the cap on, on the index that was referenced had $1.4 billion to $2.1 billion index loss that equated to 1 and 34 to 1 and close to 100, so on the current one you are obviously talking so that I can be comparable, I was curious why index loss at the 1 and 100 is $2.1 billion when your PML 1 and 100 is $1.2 billion are they not comparable for some reason?","John Doucette","Yes, this is John. Basically that\u2019s the (indiscernible) cap-on the mechanics of that really reflect, it\u2019s basically is taking for the current one it\u2019s Southeast states and it basically is taking industry loss events because it\u2019s a PCS trigger. It\u2019s taking industry loss event and then there is effectively market shares by each of those states. And so it\u2019s taking a very big loss and then scaling it down or range of big losses and then scaling it down to the market share. So those are \u2013 the short answer is those are two different things, our PMLs and how the mechanics of the bond responds.","Ian Gutterman - BAM","Okay, that does that. I can maybe follow up more from that. That\u2019s what I was trying to get at. And then just\u2026.","Dom Addesso","I think, Ian, just bottom line is that purchase of that bond did reduce our PMLs, our 1-in-100.","Ian Gutterman - BAM","Basically the $2.1 billion equates to your $1.2 billion, is that the right way to think about it?","Dom Addesso","It\u2019s not \u2013 the $1.2 billion is one point in the curve. The reinsurance we purchased is a special purpose vehicle, Kilimanjaro, that finishes that cap-on is not one point on the curve, it\u2019s across the distribution.","Ian Gutterman - BAM","Okay, got it. Okay. And then just real quick on Mt. Logan, the $36 million in gross premium just knowing the capital deployed is a little over 10% rate online, if my math is correct, is that right?","Dom Addesso","Yes, but remember the $400 million be careful though, the $400 million that we cited as now assets under management that\u2019s a recent number.","Ian Gutterman - BAM","Right, using I think it was 320 million earlier in the year maybe?","Dom Addesso","There is also a accounting recognition of the premium. Over 2014, we would expect it to be higher and more seeded premium in each of the quarters going forward against that capital base.","Ian Gutterman - BAM","Okay. Well, what I was getting at is just I thought normally for fleet collateralizing indeed closer to a 20% rate online to sort of make the math work, is that generally accurate?","Dom Addesso","I think we are trying to build the mousetrap that is maybe different and better than what is out there. And I think the fact that we have been able to go from zero to $400 million in the relatively short of time highlights that we may have a better mousetrap than others that are out there.","Craig Howie","But I do think though that the simple arithmetic that you were trying to do is probably a bit low.","Ian Gutterman - BAM","Got it, okay. I will follow up on that one offline to you. Thanks.","Operator","We will go next to Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. And I have two questions. One is on the capital structure, another on reserves on the capital structure you have the one of sort of the least levered balance sheet debt to capital ratio less than 7%. And now you have a third-party capital Mt. Logan and cap-ons and what do you think about your equity base of $7 billion. Could you sort of buyback more than you earned like you did this quarter that actually actively reducing your shareholder base?","Dom Addesso","Well, we tend to want to think about share repurchases within the context of earnings. That\u2019s generally has been our approach. And what we are trying to do with our capital in Mt. Logan and the use of cap-ons and other types of third-party capital structures is grow the business. Alright, this is a growth strategy not one in which we are trying to shrink the business. As we have mentioned earlier, we think that our size capital position rating, global franchise and the ability to grow is what perpetuates the good earnings we have been able to produce and good ROEs we have been able to produce. So in all of that context, it really means that it\u2019s to our advantage in the marketplace to the extent that opportunities present themselves to grow our capital base. And when I say grow our capital base that means in all vehicles that we have mentioned meaning our own equity capital, Mt. Logan, use of cap-on structures and other vehicles. But in the context of our equity capital, it is important to us to be the size that we are at. So we think about share repurchases in the context of earnings.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","So would 100% payout ratio a fair assumption?","Dom Addesso","That depends on the price of our stock. It depends on what opportunities present themselves. It depends on a lot of things. And we don\u2019t give prognostications about what level of shares we are going to be repurchasing, but as you saw we did obviously have $250 million this quarter was a pretty good number for us.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","Okay. In terms of my second question on reserves and your reserve development has been minimal throughout the past two years and each quarter actually, but if you look underneath, you have some large reserve charges and the insurance operation why you have large reserve releases from your reinsurance operation, then they tend to coincide like in the fourth quarter, I just wonder are those just coincidental that you do big reserves like study at year end? And then following on that is that going forward as you see the past reserve issues in your insurance book gradually well hopefully were diminishing and you said Dom, since you joined Everest you have been focusing on the reserve side setting probably more prudent like setting more cushions in your reserve that is possible we will see sort of these efforts actually playing out in formal favorable development in the future?","Dom Addesso","Yes, hopefully the reserve practices that we have been adopting over the last couple of years I think will hold us in good stead, but we point out that our reserves even prior to we getting here in many years developed favorably, probably less than 9 years come in positive relative to the initial pick. The we do our reserve studies meanly around the year end we do some of the smaller classes of business throughout the year, but the larger material lines, we focus on that in the fourth quarter, certainly if we see anything coming out of the smaller lines of business during the years we can pick some action certainly like we did here in the first quarter with the insurance from the medical amounts side and but insurance has been more of an issue than reinsurance because many of the business we were in were lines of business and those typically many of the business tend to be more problematic than in the ongoing book. And also our insurance lines of business tend to be on overall basis tend to be in the longer tail areas in the reinsurance side. So those are some of the more challenges related to insurance, but we clearly think that we have got control.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","Thank you very much.","Operator","And it appears that\u2019s all the time we have for questions today. And I would like to turn it back to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.","Dom Addesso - President and Chief Executive Officer","We thank you very much and thanks for your questions. We would like to just say in summary that clearly we think we had a great quarter what some will describe as a challenging environment. We happened to think that the challenges create opportunities for a company like Everest and we have the ability to do different things and respond quickly and appropriately to market conditions that are at our feet today and they certainly won\u2019t be the same tomorrow or two years from now. We appreciate your questions and your support and look forward to seeing everybody in the interim. Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Elizabeth B. Farrell","Thank you, Jessica. Good morning, and welcome to Everest Re Group\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting Officer; and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today\u2019s call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements.","Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.","Dominic J. Addesso","Thanks, Beth and good morning. We are pleased to report on favorable second quarter results this morning. Our operating income per share has improved for both the quarter and the year over the comparable prior year period. Net income per share for the quarter was up over the prior year, but the six month number is lower for 2014 due to lower realized gains on investments in 2014.","The improvements in operating results are clearly driven by continuing and growing underwriting gains, offset of course, by declining investment income results. The underwriting results did benefit from lower cats this year, but do reflect $45 million of losses in the second quarter, half of that reported last year.","Nevertheless, our underwriting gain in the first half remain strong at $423 million, which was up slightly over the prior year due to growth in premium earned. The growth in premium was achieved while maintaining margins, which is a reflection of our ability to navigate through this market. Yes, rates are down in many of the cat exposed regions, however, by changing attachment points and reallocating capacity to different product types and new products we have been able to secure additional business at rates that meet or exceed our hurdle rates.","In addition, our Mt. Logan facility and other similar arrangements permit us to present more meaningful capacity to clients, which enable us to secure placements at terms that are acceptable. This trend will continue into the third quarter as we have secured capacity from the Cat Bond placement we sponsored as well as some purchases of ILW capacity. We are a significant market with over $7 billion of capital, and these strategies allow us to lever that up even further. Combined with our A Plus rating and team of innovative and responsive underwriters we are increasingly becoming a market of choice.","Nevertheless, we must continue our disciplined approach. And in some segments you will note that we were forced to retreat due to pricing. John will cover this further in his report, but of particular note is the fact that essentially all of out net premium growth was in our U.S. reinsurance segment. The insurance operation continues to perform well, with an underwriting profit in both the first and second quarters of this year.","Growth has been constrained due to the crop book, which has actually declined year-over-year by $75 million due to lower commodity prices. That means, of course, that all of our other targeted growth areas are doing well. Primary pricing is still increasing although at lower rates, and as such, our insurance result excluding crop is running in the mid-90s, which is an improvement over the prior. The crop portfolio was expected to improve but will lag the other lines this year as we are making significant technology investments there this year. We were active this first quarter on capital management, and Craig will get into the details.","Given the financial flexibility gained from our sponsored Cat Bond, the Mt. Logan facility, IOW purchases and our new debt offering we continue to have the ability to maintain share repurchases within our earnings stream while at the same time expanding the franchise. All in all we feel that with an increase in shareholder value per share of over 10% in the first half, we have done an excellent job in a challenging underwriting and investment market. We have the talent, resources, capital and most importantly discipline to continue that through the cycle.","Thank you. And now, I will turn it over to Craig for the financial highlights.","Craig W. Howie","Thank you, Dom and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report that Everest had another strong quarter of earnings with net income of $290 million or $6.26 per diluted common share, this compares to net income of $276 million or $5.56 per share for the second quarter of 2013. Net income includes realized capital gains and losses. On a year-to-date basis net income was $584 million or $12.46 per share, compared to $660 million or $13.09 per share in 2013. The 2014 result represents an annualized return on equity of 17%.","Operating income year-to-date was $532 million or a $11.35 per share. This represents a 3% increase over operating income of $10.99 per share last year. These overall results were driven by a solid underwriting result offset by lower net investment income, compared to the first half of 2013. The results reflect a stable overall current year attritional combined ratio of 80.9% on a year-to-date basis down from 81.0% at year end 2013. This measure excludes the impact of catastrophes, restatement premiums and prior period loss development.","All segments reported underwriting gains for the quarter and for the first half of 2014. Total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $181 million for the quarter compared to $134 million underwriting gain last year. For the first half of 2014, total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $396 million, compared to a $344 million gain last year.","The insurance segment reported an underwriting gain of $4 million for the quarter, compared to a gain of $9 million last year. And on a year-to-date basis the insurance segment reported an underwriting gain of $8 million, compared to a gain of $9 million in 2013. Each year reflected a $2 million underwriting loss for crop insurance during the second quarter primarily due to the seasonality of crop premiums.","Mt. Logan Re\u2019s financial position and operating results were consolidated into Everest beginning July 1, 2013. These results are shown in a separate segment and reflected a $9 million underwriting gain for the quarter and a $19 million underwriting gain year-to-date. Everest retained $3 million of this income and $16 million was attributable to the non-controlling interests of this entity.","The overall underwriting gain for the group was $195 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $143 million for the same period last year. On a year-to-date basis, the underwriting gain was $423 million compared to a gain of $353 million in 2013. These overall results reflect $45 million of current year catastrophe losses in the first half of 2014 all recorded in the second quarter.","Of the total, $30 million related to late reported loss from the snowstorms in Japan, and $15 million related to the earthquake in Chile. This compares with $90 million of catastrophes during the first half of 201. Our reported combined ration was 82.5% for the first half of 2014, compared to 84.2% in 2013.","The year-to-date commission ratio of 21.9% was slightly up from 21.2% in 2013, primarily due to higher contingent commissions. Our low expense ratio of 4.5% continues to be a competitive advantage. As for loss reserves, in June we fourth annual global loss development triangles for 2013. There were no major changes since the 2012 release.","Our overall quarterly internal reserving metrics continue to be favorable. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $131 million for the quarter $254 million year-to-date on our $17.6 billion investment portfolio. Investment income for the first six months declined $40 million from one year ago. This decrease was primarily driven by the decline in limited partnership income for the year, although low reinvestment rates and capital used to redeem stock and debt also contributed.","Limited partnership investments resulted in a gain of $6 million for the quarter, compared to a gain of $20 million last year. On a year-to-date basis, the gain was $4 million, compared to a gain of $37 million in 2013. Our existing limited partnership portfolio is fairly mature, and as result, we have seen a decline in current gains coming from these investments.","Despite the declining rates, our investment portfolio continues to perform well. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.1% with a duration of three years. The first six months reflected $52 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $106 million last year. These gains are mainly attributable to fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio.","There were $2 million of derivative gains during the first half of 2014 compared to $27 million of gains last year. This is related to our equity put options and is a function of the change interest rates and indices this year. Other income and expense included $50 million of foreign exchange losses in the first six months of 2014. This was mostly offset by foreign exchange gains on bonds reflected in other comprehensive.","On income taxes, the increase in effective rate is primarily driven by lower than planned catastrophe losses resulting in higher than expected taxable income for the year. 14.4% effective tax rate on operating income is inline with our expected rate for year given our planned cat losses for the remainder of the year. Strong cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $590 million for the first half of 2014 compared to $439 million in 2013.","Turning to capital management. We issued $400 million of 4.868% 30-year senior notes in June to replace our 5.4% senior notes that will mature in October. Shareholders equity at the end of the quarter was $7.3 billion up $355 million or 5% over year-end 2013. This is after taking into account almost $400 million of capital return to $325 million of share buybacks and $69 million of dividends paid in the first half of 2014.","Additionally, we repurchased another $10 million of stock after the quarter closed; these purchases will be reflected in the third quarter financial statements. Book value per share increased 9% to $160.27 from $146.57 at year-end 2013. Our continued strong capital balance positions us well for potential business opportunities as well continuing stock repurchases. Thank you.","And now John Doucette will provide the operations with you.","John P. Doucette","Thank you, Craig. Good morning. As Dom highlighted, we continued our strong results into the second quarter of 2014. Our group gross written premium was 1.42 billion up $155 million from Q2 of last year with growth coming from each of our reinsurance segment. Net written premium was $1.22 billion, which was closer to flat given the various hedges. For our reinsurance segments, total reinsurance GWP including Logan was $1.1 billion for the quarter, up 16% from Q2 last year. We remain optimistic on our reinsurance operation despite several market headwinds.","We are successfully navigating this market and growing profitable by utilizing our competitive advantages, including our leading global market position, franchise and representation; our strong ratings and well capitalize balance sheet; our expense ratio advantage over our competitors and our culture of bottom line execution; our best-in-class analytics which allows us to make informed and accretive portfolio management decisions; our state-of-the-art enterprise risk management framework, which recently got upgraded to strong by S&P; our utilization of the capital markets convergence both offensively and defensively across a variety of strategies to maximize efficiencies for our clients and maximize value to our shareholders; and our long-term trading relationships with our clients as one of the longest standing and largest reinsures. These are all advantages that provide Everest with the edge in this competitive space.","We are also benefiting from strategic relationships we have been building and the new products we have been rolling out across the entire reinsurance division. All of this has enabled Everest to continue to profitably deploy its capital. This July 1st marks the one year anniversary of Mt. Logan, representing the successful partnering between Everest and third-party investors to opportunistically grow and deploy capacity in the catastrophe risk market.","We believe this strategic initiative has been successful for all involved, and our unique Logan structure was validated by new investors again coming into Logan at 7\/1, resulting in increased AUM even after paying out profits to our investors. We continue to believe that the Logan structure adds value to both our clients and our shareholders. Our clients and brokers benefit from Everest being able to deploy more capacity on deals and layers which are attractively priced.","Having access to both rated and unrated balance sheets allows us to deploy capacity to our clients in a more efficient manner than either one by itself. And our shareholders benefit from Everest\u2019s ability to deepen client relationships better manage our overall capital and our PMLs, while achieving higher risk adjusted returns and improving our cost of capital.","As we mentioned last quarter, in addition to Logan we have initiated other PML and capital management strategies. We recently obtained fully collateralized reinsurance coverage funded by the Kilimanjaro Re cat bond and we were active buyers in ILW space. Executing these strategies helped us trend some of our peak PMLs. Currently the price of risk around the world has decreased in many areas. But with our core advantages and deployment of several capital market strategies we can compete, win, grow and build significant shareholder value in any market condition.","Here is some color on June 1 and July 1 reinsurance renewals. For our overall global property reinsurance book at June 1 and July 1, we continued to grow our gross written premium aided by the additional capacity provided by Mt. Logan. While the expected combined ratio up about one to two points year-over- year, the gross and the net dollar margin continue to expand in the overall book compared to the same period last year. This demonstrates the significant benefit of our long-standing diversified global portfolio across many clients, products and territories.","Across our book Florida cats XOL rates were down approximately 10% to 15% compared to last year. Despite that we were pleased with our 6\/1 renewal by growing our gross and net premiums as well as our gross dollar margin and our net dollar margin across the Florida book. This was achieved by deploying meaningful capacity on cat XOL deals which we liked with key strategic clients, while reducing shares or declining deals which we did not find attractive, and in some cases moving up attachments on our programs where we found rates were more attractive.","In Florida and other USA regions there were some quota share treaties on which we were unable to come to mutually acceptable terms, so we came off. However, we also built new pro rata relationship as well as increased some existing quota share relationships where we like the clients, the pricing, terms and conditions.","We are continuously rebalancing both our cat XOL and pro rata books in Florida and elsewhere around the global as we seek the optimal position on the programs, which we believe provides us with the best risk adjusted returns while maintaining our relationships with longstanding clients.","Our overall, net, net Florida PMLs are flat from 1\/1 as a percentage of GAAP equity against increased dollar margins given our portfolio management and hedging. Internationally we found renewals a mix bag with some areas under rate pressure particularly China and Australia and correspondingly premiums were down in those areas. But in those and other areas we had better than market results due to our lead market position and the strength our relationships with long-term clients and brokers.","Turning to our overall casualty and longer tail reinsurance book globally primary terms and conditions remain attractive, but reinsurance terms continue to be under pressure for commodity type treaties and seeding commissions on casualty quota share treaties are generally moving up. Therefore we continue to execute new products and new opportunities and we saw some nice growth overall in our long-tail book.","These one off highly customized solutions more than offset the GWP on the traditional casualty treaties which we declined due to pricing. Total reinsurance including Logan bottom line, we continued the strong underwriting results with underwriting profits in the second quarter of $190 million, up 42% compared to Q2 last year underwriting profits.","Now with respect to our insurance operations. Our premium was $316 million in Q2 essentially flat from Q2 last year. As mentioned, this is due to a decrease in crop premium at Heartland from lower commodity prices. Stripping out Heartland premium our Q2 insurance GWP is up 12% this year compared to Q2 last year. Rates are generally up in the insurance operation, including casualty and workers\u2019 comp. Property insurance rates were mixed depending on the type of risk and the territory.","We continue to see profitable growth opportunities in many areas in our insurance book, including areas that we have targeted such as non-program workers\u2019 comp, casualty, specialty and contingency lines, property E&S and DIC, accident and health and our Canadian insurance operations. However, we remain cautious in the professional lines with more capacity coming into that space. Bottom line our insurance results with profitable year-to-date and for the quarter.","With the year-to-date results coming in at a 98.1% attritional combined ration and a 93.9% attritional combined ratio excluding crop, which is better than the same result last year. We continued to be pleased with the underlying trends in our insurance book we are seeing encouraging results of our insurance growth initiatives over the last several years with noted improvements in both loss rations and expense rations. As well as premium growth in all areas of our insurance book expect for Heartland this year. We expect these trends to continue with both top line and bottom line growth in our insurance book.","In summary, the world of insurance and reinsurance is a rapidly change in world and while there may ultimately be a structural shift in the market, we are as well positioned as anyone to benefit from these changes. We remain confident in our ability to achieve profitable growth for our shareholders, and we remain bullish on our future.","Thank you, and now back to Beth for Q&A.","Elizabeth B. Farrell","Jessica, we are open for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And we will go first to Amit Kumar with Macquarie.","Amit J. Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","","Thanks, and good morning. Just two quick questions. The first question relates to your underlying loss ratio ex-cats for reinsurance. I am looking at the numbers, and I am wondering, you are talking about pricing declines, why wouldn't that number go up? Is that more a business mix shift issue or is there more to it?","Dominic J. Addesso","","Amit this is Dom.","Amit J. Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","Hey.","Dominic J. Addesso","There are a number of factors. One is mix of business, another would be some of it is pro rata and to the extent that primary pricing is increasing that impacts it. And I think your question was just related to the reinsurance book.","Amit J. Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","Yes.","Dominic J. Addesso","And then new products in particular is what would be driving that and different lines of business that we are getting into.","Amit J. Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","So that is nearly offsetting the double-digit declines in pricing?","Dominic J. Addesso","Correct.","Amit J. Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","Got it. The other question I had is just going back to your discussion on the crop, how should we think about the future with the prices being down but the yields being up? How do you feel, how does this play out? I know it is a bit early, but would just love to get your thoughts for the future on the crop.","Dominic J. Addesso","We\u2019ve already given part of my answer which is \u2013 it is bit early and you know for now weather is looking favorable. So we are anticipating decent yields certainly commodity prices are down for now, but there are still a lot of room to go on where that market settles out. So and then you\u2019ve got the issue of retentions by the \u2013 or deductibles that the clients have retaining portion of a risk. So we are anticipating at this point that the downward turn in commodity prices would be a factor. But there is still plenty of room to go here.","Amit J. Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","What percent of your \u2013 I am sorry\u2026","Dominic J. Addesso","Did you have follow up?","Amit J. Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","Yes, what percent of your book is revenue based?","John P. Doucette","Amit this is John.","Amit J. Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","Hey.","John P. Doucette","Most of it. A vast majority of it is revenue based.","Amit J. Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","Got it. I'll stop here and re-queue. Thanks for all the answers.","Dominic J. Addesso","Amit, I want to go back also to your first question which is the declining property cat pricing, you also have to remember that property cat premium only represents about 25% of our total premium. So you can have a decline in pricing there, but other new products and other things can \u2013 it's highly levered, the impact of that is highly levered.","Amit J. Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","Got it. Fair enough.","Dominic J. Addesso","Okay.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","","Hi, good morning everyone.","Dominic J. Addesso","Good morning, Josh.","Joshua D. Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","Good morning. I wanted to talk a little about the premium seed in the international segment as it relates to pricing and as it relates to Mt. Logan's participation?","Dominic J. Addesso","Well, some of the premium in the international is a result of some strategic relationship that we have with some large global clients, so that is dominating that. It is heavily reinsured as well. So that\u2019s dominating the session there and the of course, you do have the Mt. Logan impact as well.","Joshua D. Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","So the Mt. Logan portion of that would be the minority of the seed?","Dominic J. Addesso","That\u2019s correct.","John P. Doucette","Correct, yes.","Joshua D. Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","And these relationships I guess you did not have them one year ago?","Dominic J. Addesso","That\u2019s correct. Excuse me. Let me just clarify that. These were clients we had one year ago but these particular transactions were not in place one year ago.","John P. Doucette","Yes.","Joshua D. Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","And just what lines of business is this, and in order to get it you have to have a -- it is a fairly high seed, so I am just sort of interested in like what lines or I don't know what you are willing to say about it?","Dominic J. Addesso","It is across the whole lines of business. Its multi line approach quota share.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","Okay, but I mean and you are willing to say as much as you want to say about it I guess. That was my only question.","Dominic J. Addesso","Well, I mean it is essentially the ability for these clients that need Everest in that marketplace with our rating and our capital and it enables them to increase their participation in the markets that they operate in by patterning up with Everest on these particular transactions.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","Okay. So these are reinsurance companies who probably couldn't get the business on their own?","Dominic J. Addesso","No, no, no. They are primary companies, they are primary companies.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","And So I guess you are retro ceding back to the client? I don't understand why there is a high seed I guess.","John P. Doucette","That is correct.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","Okay. Okay, very good. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay H. Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.","Thank you. On the international reinsurance segment with the retention the net to gross going down to 70%, do you feel that is something we should just see this quarter or will that affect the sessions going forward which is typical much closer to a \u2013 where the net to gross is typically much closer to 100% in international reinsurance.","Craig W. Howie","Jay, this is Craig. I think this is something that we would expect to see going forward as well.","John P. Doucette","This is John. We would also as Longan \u2013 as we continue to seed business from all the segments we would see an impact of that at least somewhat within the international segment as well.","Jay H. Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.","Okay. Have you said before what portion of Everest Re's business is seeded to Logan?","John P. Doucette","You can see that in the segment report in terms of what the gross written premiums that are seeded to Logan in the Logan segment at the back of the analyst report.","Jay H. Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.","Okay. So that is just direct from the Everest Re book.","Craig W. Howie","Correct, you are right.","John P. Doucette","Correct.","Jay H. Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.","Okay. And then on share buybacks the pace slowed in 2Q relative to 1Q, why was that?","Craig W. Howie","Basically the price of the stock kept going up and exceeding our target in terms of what we gave, instructions that we gave to our broker and we just couldn\u2019t keep pace with it.","Jay H. Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.","All right. I guess that is a good problem to have. Thank you very much.","Craig W. Howie","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. The first question is just follow-up on Josh\u2019s question on the retro buying. If you step back and think about strategically do you think it is a defensive move that you want to retain, maintain and grow the relationship or it could be arbitrage that actually can enhance your margin offensively?","John P. Doucette","This is John. Good morning. Lots of times around the world we have opportunities to partner and build the strategic relationships with clients and there is a variety of reasons why they do that and sometimes its to get access to their business or our business or as Dom said earlier, to give them an opportunity to enhance their writings and as we've been saying from many quarters now, we've been building strategic relationships with this which gives us access to what we believe is profitable business and it helps strengthen relationships with some of our long-standing clients around the globe.","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then you mentioned on sort of your global reinsurance book raise of pricing decline and [indiscernible] renewals expected combined ratio to deteriorate about one to two point, but that seems \u2013 could you give more color on that? That Seems more comparable with some of your pricing commentary you had said about the pricing decline especially in Florida pretty big, but it looks like the combined ratio deterioration relatively moderate so anything behind that?","Craig W. Howie","Well impart with what I mentioned before and I will ask John to comment as well, but again recollect that the cat premium particularly the cat XOL premium, are total cat premium is 25% of our total premium volume. So if that pricing is down 10% to 15% it\u2019s not going to be dollar-for-dollar impact of the combined ration across the entire book. So there is that leverage impact.","John P. Doucette","Right and the 10% to 15% was a comment on Florida rates. We also talked about how we move up in programs where the rates weren't \u2013 we move within programs so that the impact to us may not be 10% to 15%, but then the comment on the one to two combined ratio point that was on our global property book and I think that just highlights the kind of the strength of a diversified portfolio trading in 80 countries around the world where we write property reinsurance with clients that we've been trading with for a very long time and it helps insulate our portfolio and we look to grow areas around the globe where we think we are getting paid to take the risk and that helps to insulate our portfolio for various rates decreases that are happening in different areas.","Craig W. Howie","And remember in the first quarter, you might remember in the first quarter that we referenced some areas of the world rates were going up in particular Canada. So that\u2019s something that helps offset declines that we see in other territories.","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Last question maybe for Craig. I saw that you mentioned the tax rate is going to be 14% or run rate or am I miss that?","Craig W. Howie","That\u2019s correct Kai. So let me just explain a little bit. Taxes \u2013 operating tax specifically operating tax was based on the geographic region where the income is earned, right and then its also based on the tax rate in that country. What we had is an annualized rate of 14.4% that\u2019s higher than where we were after the first quarter at 13.8%; it\u2019s primarily due to the fact that we had lower than planned cat losses. So with a full cat load for the year we would expect our tax rate to be somewhere between 13% and 14% and with the remaining cat load for the rest of this year, we expect it to be at about 14.5%.","If we look at this with no more cats for the rest of the year, I would expect that rate to even rise further to about a 15% to 16% rate. So it\u2019s really based on \u2013 currently it\u2019s primarily based on the amount of catastrophes that we have or don\u2019t have during the year.","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you so much for all the answers.","John P. Doucette","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.","Thanks. Dom, I just have a question on I think it was to an answer to a mix question about mix change. What lines of business are you growing in or are you mixing towards where margins are kind of similar or better than the cat business?","Dominic J. Addesso","Most of it would be in the credit space. John.","John P. Doucette","Definitely, we are seeing some. We've talked about that the last several quarters, we also are you know one-off highly customized products that we think have better, its not commodity, they are not just a plain vanilla product that everybody can do. Again, some of these are very complicated products that we have the underwriting talent, the actuary, the contract wording, tax, et cetera to bring to bear. And we are seeing a lot of traction in that.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.","Got it. And from a capital intensive perspective how do those products sort of compare to the cat business?","John P. Doucette","Well, the way we think of capital is you know capital where we are full \u2013 areas where we were full attract \u2013 either fullness or volatility attract more capital. So in a lot of cases we are not that full and a lot of these products have more structure to them, so they don\u2019t have the volatility that cat books have. So in general they attract less capital.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.","Got it. So this is an area, it sounds like, that you will continue to move towards. Good margins, you are getting paid for technical expertise that others can't replicate, so that seems like an area that you will look to continue to grow?","John P. Doucette","That\u2019s our job, to find areas like that and others.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.","Got it.","Dominic J. Addesso","And it not just technical expertise, its also size, capital base rating these are all things that give us an unique advantage.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Can you give an example, is this like in the mortgage guarantee space or is this something different?","John P. Doucette","","I mean, there is a whole array of deals. But as Dom said, we have done a lot of different things in the credit space, some in the mortgage space too.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.","","Got it. Okay. And then one question about Mt. Logan, so the cat load there was higher than the legacy business. So is that what you would expect that Mt. Logan will run at higher cat load than the sort of on balance sheet business or was that somewhat anomalistic as we are trying to figure out how the relationship between that and your on balance sheet business moves.","John P. Doucette","This is John. If I understand your question correctly, it is what is the embedded cat load as percentage of premium. Mt. Logan is taking all and only property catastrophe excess the loss business, where Everest on the reinsurance book and the cat load as a percentage of premium is applied to all lines of business. So you would see\u2026","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.","A more concentrated. Okay, that makes sense.","John P. Doucette","Yeah.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.","Okay. And then just last question, Dom, I think a number of questions you mentioned 25% cat as a percentage of premiums. Do you have any \u2013 what is that in terms of as a percentage of underlying or underwriting profitability? Just trying to right size those two.","Dominic J. Addesso","","Well, our expected underwriting profit on a cat book would be running to a 50% to 60% combined ratio, that would be kind of what we would expect, somewhere in there. It depends on territory, it depends on attachment point, a lot of variable there. But that would be kind of the expected outcome of the \u2013 from the catastrophe book. Does that answer your question?","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.","Maybe I didn't phrase it right. But I guess if cat premiums are 25% of total premiums is there an equivalent percentage or can we know what the equivalent percentage is of just profitability of total kind of Everest profitability represented by your cat business?","Dominic J. Addesso","","Well, it is a significant portion, no question. Because \u2013 but you got the cats that you earn the premium. And you have got commission in brokerage that gets charged against that, so it is a significant percentage of profits, no question.","","Craig W. Howie","","I mean, given the volatility we would certainly expect it run to a higher percentage underwriting profits for us to assume the volatility tied to the capital. And we would \u2013 likewise we would assume it to run to lower combined ratio.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.","Right, got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","","We will go next to Meyer Shields of KBW.","Meyer Shields \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc.","","Thanks, good morning, everyone. John, one quick question. I guess I was a little surprised that you said you are moving up in attachment points in Florida because my understanding was that the higher the attachment points the more competitive things were. Am I misreading the situation?","John P. Doucette","","I think the situation is dynamic and I was trying to give a couple of examples and there's other examples that would be counter to that. But one thing that I think we saw was some of the Florida companies moved up partially because of not having had cats over the last couple of years had moved up their retention. And again our view of risk may be different than other people's view of risk, but there were definitely cases where we thought the pressure on rates was less higher up in people's programs than otherwise.","","Meyer Shields \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc.","","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Two quick numbers questions if I can, I guess for Craig. One, the tax rate specifically on net investment income also went up in the quarter is that likely to persist?","Craig W. Howie","","That\u2019s really based on where that investment income is, and so when you say likely to persist, if it is in the U.S. it is taxed at a 35% rate, that is really what it comes down to. ","Meyer Shields \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc.","Right. Is the mix shifting away or towards the U.S.?","Craig W. Howie","For the gains that happened this period yes.","Meyer Shields \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc.","Okay. And we talked about higher commission expense on contingent commissions. Is that both U.S. reinsurance and the insurance segment?","Dominic J. Addesso","It is mostly the reinsurance segment. On the insurance side most of our contingence arrangements would have been with MGAs, and, of course, as you know, we have been shrinking our participation in that segment of the market. So while we still have some reserves out there for profit sharing, contingent payouts the impact of that is much smaller. It is mostly the reinsurance book.","Meyer Shields \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc.","Okay, fantastic. Thanks very much.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian R. Meredith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Good morning. A couple of just quick questions here for you. First one with respect to some of the quarter share \u2013 the business you got off of in the quarter, did that impact the second quarter results or are we going to see that hit the third quarter because I know in the past you have had some ups and downs in your North American business because of some big quota shares you have gotten off of?","Craig W. Howie","There was an impact to the book this period. Again it is based on the amount of premium that was leaving and being returned, but small impact to the book this period.","Brian R. Meredith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","So it wasn't big under going out, okay.","Dominic J. Addesso","You right, but over time our mix between pro rata and XOL really have not changed that dramatically. And, in fact the reference quota share that we are now off of in particular in Florida we have replaced with some other Florida quota shares, as well as some quota shares in the Northeast. So again the book is constantly \u2013 it is fluid.","Brian R. Meredith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Got you.","Dominic J. Addesso","","We would not expect any significant impact when the complete year unfolds the year-over-year numbers will not be that dramatically different.","Brian R. Meredith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Great, thanks. And then second question I am just curious, Dom and John, can you chat a little bit about what you are seeing with respect to demand for casualty reinsurance out there right now? Has it increased at all?","Dominic J. Addesso","If you are willing to pay a high seed, yes the demand is going up. And in our particular case we are not playing in many of those high seeding commission transactions. John, if you have anything further to add?","John P. Doucette","","Yeah, there certainly have been some cases of people coming into the market, that haven\u2019t been in the past. But, I think there has been a long-term trend of kind of tepid demand on casualty business, and again that's more \u2013 it varies a lot around the globe.","Brian R. Meredith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Okay. So you haven't really seen a change necessarily this quarter where primaries are trying to buy more casualty?","Dominic J. Addesso","Not in any strong trend that we could identify at this point, Brian.","Brian R. Meredith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Great. Thank you.","Dominic J. Addesso","","Thank you.","","John P. Doucette","Thank you.","Operator","","And we will go next to Vinay Misquith with Evercore.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","","Hi, good morning. Just to follow-up on the international retro that was purchased, I believe you said that that should continue in the future. But this quarter we saw ","about a 30% increase in gross written premiums, so should that continue into the future so higher gross written premiums and higher retro in the future?","Dominic J. Addesso","","Let's maybe clarify something, it is retro sessional absolutely in the way it is booked or what it is called, but it is not really retro in the way you are implying. These are transactions that where we are participating with some global clients on deals where we are taking a premium in the front end and they are participating to a significant degree as a reinsurer of that in coming portfolio.","So don't think of it in the terms of we are out there buying retro in the retro market. It is not that. We do \u2013 we have increased our quote on quote retro buying just from the mere fact, we have the Mt. Logan facility and various ILWs that we are buying, but it is dwarfed by the strategic transactions that we have been talking about earlier.","So that percentage that you see, that you saw in terms of sessions is likely to persist but it is not necessarily going to grow dramatically from here unless we find other strategic relationships and transactions to enter into with clients. So that is the best I can do about telling you what is out there in the future with respect to that number","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","","Sure. But it says on the gross written premium line says you are also taking more on the front end and then giving it out sort of on the back, correct? I mean that is the way to look at it.","Dominic J. Addesso","Right, right. But it is part of a complete transaction that \u2013 of a few clients.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","Sure. That is helpful. The second is with respect to the primary insurance I see the expense ratios are going up. Was this a one time [indiscernible] in that?","Dominic J. Addesso","Just that was really more of a function of the fact that our Heartland the crop premium was down dramatically this year as I mentioned because of commodity prices and the commission ratio in the crop book is less than our standard the other primary lines of business.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","Sure fair enough. And then the last one the share repurchases I think you answered that question. But if I heard you correctly, you said you can sort of give back all the capital from earnings despite growing your business. I just wanted to understand that correctly. Can you buyback\u2026","Dominic J. Addesso","I don't know that I quite said it that way. I basically said that we certainly look \u2013 our share repurchase program looks to be contained within earnings, that does not necessary mean that we are saying or predicting that we would buy-in up to our actual earnings. It all depends on the price of the stock. It depends on what opportunities we see out in front of us and what our needs for capital are, but certainly we got a little bit behind our targets in the second quarter again due to price movement in the stock.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Dominic J. Addesso","Thank you.","Operator","","And our last question comes from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management LP","","Hi, good morning, guys.","Dominic J. Addesso","Good morning.","Craig W. Howie","","Good morning.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management LP","I guess my first question is sort of big picture. I guess, Dom, I am sort of puzzled why we are not shrinking the reinsurance book? And what I mean by that is if we had this conversation a year ago or even in January frankly, it seemed like the pressure was mostly on cap. When you talk to people, you made the reference and others have to casualty seeding commissions it seems like the Loyd's guy is trying to cause trouble in the other non cap property lines. I mean why aren't we shrinking the book instead of growing the book?","Dominic J. Addesso","Because our margins are expanding and in many cases the premium or the transactions that we are seeing exceed and I don't mean by a slight margin, exceed our hurdle rates for business. So if we are able to put additional business on the books and still generate double digit returns on equity to our shareholders we are going to continue to do that. ","Also remember that we have increased as we mentioned we have had our sponsored cat bond, we have had IOW purchases. Our net return on capital on transactions is higher than the gross cost. So in other words, we are improving our ROE by bringing on business and then using \u2013 taking advantage of the capital markets to lay off significant portion of that risk if not in some cases all of it. So that is the reason why.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management LP","So when there \u2013 I guess the reason I ask is there are other reinsurance executives saying we are starting to have behavior that is starting to I guess maybe no be the late 90s, maybe rhymes with the late 90s. You don't agree with that statement then?","Dominic J. Addesso","Well, because we have got other forms of capital we can hedge the exposure.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management LP","Okay.","Dominic J. Addesso","So if \u2013 that we didn't have in the late 90s. So if we are able to utilize the capital markets and improve our ROEs while at the same time maintaining, and John mentioned this but it is worth reemphasizing, our net PMLs from the beginning of the year have not really changed materially as a percentage of capital. So we are expanding margins with basically the same PML exposure.","John P. Doucette","","I would like to add a different dimension response to your question. We also are seeing opportunities. There has been a lot of talk about the haves and the havenots in the reinsurance world. And so I can't respond specifically to you say, other reinsurance executors are saying these things. But our opportunity set is not the same as the opportunity set in front of a lot of other reinsurance companies. We see deals around the globe that are shown to three or four reinsurance companies.","We are creating new distribution sources through these new products we have been talking about now for several quarters. So we have significant clients that we have global clients that want to do more business with companies like Everest and less business with other people. So, there is a lot of other dimensions to the landscape and we think we are navigating it pretty well.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management LP","That is a very, very good point. Just to follow-up, I normally wouldn't ask about a specific contract but I think it is in the public domain who Citizens reinsures with. You guys took a very large line I believe on that new Citizens program. I don't think you were on it much or at all the year before. Can you just maybe talk a little bit about why that was a good place to put capacity?","John P. Doucette","","Yes, we did take a larger line this year. We liked it. We liked where it attached, and frankly there were some improvements in the contract wording is one of the reasons we didn't put up a bigger line last year. So we were happy with that, and it met our returns and so therefore as we look and headed into our June renewals we thought it was accretive to the portfolio that we are trying to build and it made sense particularly \u2013 it fit well, and given the way we managed our net PMLs we thought it was the right thing to do.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management LP","Got it. So if looked \u2013 obviously you had a big up there, a big down on universal. Outside of those two would you say your cap book grew in the quarter or was it really just those were the two big swings and the rest was maybe flat to down?","John P. Doucette","It grew in the quarter.","Dominic J. Addesso","","Gross. Remember what I was saying earlier.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management LP","Right. But I am saying ex-citizen growth. What I'm trying to get is it was citizen all of the growth or was there other growth even if you didn't do that?","John P. Doucette","","There was lots \u2013 one way I would describe this renewal was very volatile.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management LP","Got it.","John P. Doucette","","There were lots of new structures, we played at different levels of attachments, our line sizes moved up and down more than it had in the past.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management LP","Got it, got it. And then just lastly a number questions, in the U.S. reinsurance segment the acquisition expense ratio historically it has bee around maybe a 22 and went up to 25 this quarter. Was that mixing, was that higher seeding commissions, any color on that?","Dominic J. Addesso","That is the higher contingent commissions in the commission ratio.","","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management LP","Okay. But it is more contingents than the base seeding commission going up?","","Dominic J. Addesso","That is correct. Right.","","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management LP","Got it, perfect. Thank you.","Dominic J. Addesso","You got it.","Operator","","And at this time I would like to turn the conference back to Dom Addesso for closing remarks.","Dominic J. Addesso","Well, thanks for all your questions this morning. In summary, I would like to just reemphasize that despite the many challenges that are out there in the market place that we have discussed this morning, we remain optimistic about continuing to deliver double digit ROEs due to our size and ability to navigate through this market. So again thank you for participating on the call this morning.","Operator","","This does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these SEC filings. ","Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplements. ","With that, I turn the call over to Dom Addesso.","Dominic Addesso","Thanks, Jon, and good morning, and welcome to our call. In the third quarter, Everest produced operating earnings of $3.39 per share despite experiencing $280 million of cat losses. Our underlying performance continued to be excellent as our attritional underwriting gain of $250 million nearly offset the catalysts. On a year-to-date basis, our underwriting profit was $365 million and $700 million, excluding cats. This is a solid outcome and demonstrates our ability to absorb cat volatility due to a large and well-diversified book of business. When combined with another solid quarter of investment income, the year-to-date operating income is at $742 million. These outcomes are being driven by an organization that has evolved dramatically over the last several years due to an intentional strategic focus and supported by market conditions. What you see, for example, is a continued effort to reduce cat volatility as a result of growth, diversification and exposure reductions.","In reinsurance, the growth has been focused largely on mortgage risk and casualty lines where rates, terms and conditions have been improving. Keep in mind that our cushion for these lines, especially casualty, was of a more recent vintage. For many years, we deemphasized casualty. Only recently, as the market has been improving, have we been growing premium. The greatest diversifier, however, has been our successful push into the specialty insurance space. By year-end, we will be closing in on $3 billion of annual gross premium. And as you have seen, the profit picture there remains solid. ","Our timing on these initiatives has been good. Rates are improving in many sectors. And, yes, while there have been pockets of frequency and severity trends to take note of, these are managed through conservative loss picks through the cycle. We're in a long-term business, and at times, cost of goods sold may seem uncertain, but we are less worried about that and what we see on trend versus rate given our book of business and where we have it pegged.","The market is poised to continue higher as it grapples with trend, increasing weather events and anemic investment returns on new money, but now is not the time to retreat. ","With that, let me pass it over to my colleagues to give you some of the details around the story. First, to Juan Andrade, who, as you know, is my successor effective January 1. Juan?","Juan Andrade","Thank you, Dom. It's a privilege to be here as a member of the Everest team. After 8 weeks on the job, I've had the opportunity to start getting deep into our businesses and to meet our employees, major customers and our key distribution partners in the U.S. and around the world. I'm very appreciative for Dom's support and that of the entire leadership team as we transition responsibilities at the end of the year. Dom has built a great business that we will continue to advance. ","Everest is well positioned for the current market environment. We have a highly diversified franchise with a strong team of smart and experienced leaders, a rock-solid balance sheet and enduring customer relationships. I have been very pleased with the talent, division, the energy, the focus and the pride in Everest that everyone I have met has shown. The feedback that I have received from our customers has been universally positive. They value the longevity of our trading relationships, our financial strength and sizable capacity, our knowledgeable underwriters and the access to products in the right locations, along with our responsiveness and innovation. We have 2 very strong and complementary businesses. We are a top 10 global reinsurer with a 47-year history. We have a seasoned and strong underwriting team around the globe, broad product capabilities, a dynamic strategy that is responsive to market conditions, best-in-class data-driven management systems and a competitive expense advantage. We also have an entrepreneurial and growing primary specialty insurance business with a client-first culture of providing solutions with more than 150 products and services. This team is led by highly skilled industry professionals who are focused on sustainable profitability and growth and who have the underwriting discipline and built the tools and processes required to ensure continued success. While being very cognizant to the challenges facing our industry, we also see opportunity.","These industry challenges are resulting in improving pricing and terms and conditions in both insurance and reinsurance. In some classes of business, we are seeing the strongest rate movement in many years. This change in the market is long overdue, and we remain committed to being selective to where we dedicate resources and capacity. At Everest, we will continue to focus on underwriting profitability and sustainable growth with a relentless focus on execution, diversifying our business, always strengthening our enduring relationships, managing our cat exposure and maintaining our strong balance sheet that provides the foundation for the security that we provide to our customers.","I am optimistic about the future of Everest. We have a strong franchise that is positioned to succeed regardless of market conditions. ","With that, I turn the call over to Craig.","Craig Howie","Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2019, Everest reported net income of $104 million. This compares to net income of $198 million for the third quarter of 2018. On a year-to-date basis, Everest had net income of $792 million compared to net income of $474 million for the first 9 months of 2018. The 2019 result represents an annualized net income return on equity of 13%. These results were driven by a strong underwriting performance across the group, our highest quarterly investment income in the last 9 years and lower catastrophe losses compared to the first 9 months of 2018.","In the third quarter of 2019, the group incurred $280 million of net pretax catastrophe losses compared to $230 million in the third quarter of 2018. The catastrophe losses related to Hurricane Dorian at $160 million and Typhoon Faxai at $120 million. On a year-to-date basis, the results reflected net pretax estimated catastrophe losses of $335 million in 2019 compared to $795 million in 2018. ","Everest reported $52 million of favorable prior year reserve development in the quarter. This primarily related to a onetime commutation of a multiyear contract that reduced prior year carried loss reserves by $44 million, which was offset by $44 million of commission paid, effectively no material impact to the underwriting result in the quarter. Another $4 million of the favorable development was identified through reserve studies completed in the third quarter of 2019. Excluding the catastrophe events and favorable prior year development, the underlying book continues to perform well with an overall current year attritional combined ratio of 87.7% through the first 9 months compared to 87.0% for the full year of 2018. This increase was primarily due to the business mix in the reinsurance segment, which, as we have noted, has been writing more casualty business over the past several quarters.","Turning to investments. Pretax investment income was $181 million for the quarter and $501 million year-to-date on our $20 billion investment portfolio. Investment income was up $60 million or 14% from 1 year ago. This result is primarily driven by the growth in investment assets coming from our record cash flow, which was $1.5 billion during the first 9 months. Some of the strong cash flow comes from the increase in overall premium volume, including an increase in the casualty writings, which has a longer tail and allows us to invest the money longer. ","Before moving to taxes, I'd like to point out that we included, for the first time, on Page 15, in the financial supplement a split of our net investment income between the Insurance segment and total reinsurance. This shows an indication of the contribution provided by each segment to pretax operating income and reflects $361 million allocated to reinsurance and $140 million of net investment income allocated to the Insurance segment. The split is based on gross carried loss reserves, excluding catastrophe reserves. We are including this information to better demonstrate the total contribution by business segment and illustrate the unrecognized embedded value of the growing insurance franchise. This is consistent with previous comments, encouraging investors to look at Everest on a sum-of-the-parts basis.","On income taxes, the tax benefit we recorded in the quarter was the result of the amount and geography of the losses associated with the catastrophes and the favorable prior year reserve development associated with the onetime commutation of a multiyear contract that I previously mentioned. The year-to-date effective tax rate of 9% is an annualized calculation that includes planned catastrophe losses for the remainder of the year. Higher-than-expected catastrophe losses would cause the tax rate to trend lower than the current 9%. ","Shareholders' equity for the group ended the quarter at $9 billion, up over $1 billion or 14% compared to year-end 2018. The increasing shareholders' equity is primarily attributable to the $792 million of net income and the recovery in the fair value of the investment portfolio. ","Our balance sheet and overall financial position remain strong. We maintain industry-low debt leverage, a high-quality investment portfolio and continue to generate positive cash flow. You will notice some minor revisions related to foreign exchange in our financial supplement. None of these revisions impact operating income.","Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide an review of the reinsurance operations.","John Doucette","Thank you, Craig. Good morning. The magnitude of industry losses over the past 3 years has been extraordinary for the reinsurance market. Although the insurance industry would have hoped for a quieter 2019 to regroup, this has not been the case. The losses have shaken up the primary reinsurance and retro markets, creating dislocation and, in turn, opportunity. Though not an across-the-board traditional hard market, we see a foundationally more sustainable environment for the near and medium term in many lines. Multiple factors are pushing the market, including 2017, '18 and '19 cat losses, with corresponding trapped capital and negative sentiment for ILS; emerging industry loss trends in casualty; improving primary market and underwriting actions taken by major participants; and continued low investment income yields. Given the above, we are increasingly optimistic on the treaty and facultative global reinsurance market heading into renewal and our improving opportunity to deploy capital profitably in 2020 and beyond. ","We continue to see increased demand for reinsurance globally driven by our clients' desire to reduce volatility, manage regulatory capital constraints and decrease net capacity deployed. That increase in demand, in conjunction with improved insurance and reinsurance pricing, terms and conditions, will result in more opportunities hitting our underwriting requirements and pricing targets. At the same time, the supply of reinsurance capital is relatively flat or down, considering trapped capital, given that over 50% of the retro capacity is supported by unrated, alternative capital. And there will be more collateral trapped by the recent events, in addition to the remaining collateral still trapped from the 2017 and '18 events. Not all rated reinsurers are positioned to write multiple classes of business across all territories to clients large and small, but we are. With our solid financial strength and ratings, multi-decades long trading relationships, we are one of the few global reinsurers writing in all P&C lines in most developed territories, making us well positioned to take advantage of these positive trends to drive differentiated results.","Year-to-date reinsurance premium is $4.7 billion, up 3% from last year. Growth in our business is being driven by increased casualty writings, more proportional business, mortgage, more treaties with our global clients and increased back opportunities. This growth was muted by the reunderwriting of some portions of our property book as we pushed pricing and reduced lines or came off programs that did not meet our required pricing targets. Year-to-date, reinsurance underwriting profits are $310 million, impacted this quarter by the Dorian and Faxai losses mentioned by Craig. ","Year-to-date reinsurance attritional losses are 57.5% compared to 57.0% for the full year 2018 due predominantly to shift in mix, increased casualty business as well as overall more proportional business to capture the primary rate movements. This is offset by increased mortgage writings which have a lower combined ratio. Heading into the renewal season, we are optimistic about the market conditions in casualty, fac, mortgage and certain property markets, including retro and loss-affected areas. ","In U.S. casualty, reinsurance terms are improving. Primary rates are increasing on loss-affected programs, along with some tightening of terms and conditions. Some market participants have signaled reducing capacity. Combined, this results in some interesting opportunities. Since 2018, we have been increasing our casualty reinsurance writings based on these improving conditions, and this trend will likely continue heading into January 1 renewals. ","Facultative is seeing meaningful, increased submission activity globally, improved rates and terms in both property and casualty, resulting in an increased business at much improved economics. As mentioned last quarter, our global fac book is well over $400 million gross written premium in force, and we see continued growth opportunities there given favorable market conditions. Fac is typically a leading indicator of client risk appetite, and therefore, shows increased future demand for our treaty capacity. ","The global impact of Lloyd's and other major insurers reunderwriting is meaningful. Significant premium is coming to market, which is then subject to increased rate and improved terms and conditions. This is in addition to some large primary insurers tightening capacity and pushing rate in both property and casualty lines. The mortgage market remains favorable as the large GSEs, Fannie and Freddie, continue to privatize risk. Our well-seasoned mortgage portfolio continues to produce strong earnings with growth potential. Currently, our annualized mortgage book is about $200 million of gross written premium, including many multiyear deals with future premium that has not yet been recognized. We continue to proactively scrutinize relevant economic trends and underwriting standards which remain attractive, and we'll continue to look for more opportunities there. ","Given these multiple areas to deploy profitably our capital, our pricing targets for cat-exposed property reinsurance and retro continue to rise. We remain committed to manage volatility to our long-standing disciplined underwriting, robust portfolio construction and through increased property hedging in both traditional and alternative hedges. The current property momentum is generally favorable and likely will last well into 2020, but additional improvement in rates, terms and conditions are required in global property reinsurance and retro markets given the elevated risk factors and increased exposures in certain territories as well as the recent substantial industry losses. More rate is required to get back to adequate levels to achieve a long-term, appropriate and sustainable return on capital. Concentrating property underwriting on our core clients has created a better risk-adjusted portfolio with significantly more dollars of profit per unit of risk, and we do have the capacity to increase our participation in improving markets when returns increase enough to warrant. ","We expect January 1 property rates to generally be up in most regions, and more recently loss-affected territories will see greater impacts. In retro, we anticipate double-digit rate increases. With Hagibis causing further losses and trapped capital late in the year and uncertainty of ultimate loss, rates may improve more.","Improvement in retro is necessary given those rates have been under the most pressure by nontraditional capital but also because retro bore a disproportionate share of losses since 2017. Everest has the capital and capability to effectively write in this market. We believe there will be select opportunities to deploy additional capital depending on market conditions.","Overall, we are in a reinsurance market where favorable trends exist for those able to capture and maximize the best opportunities. With our financial strength, nimble culture, global capabilities and diversified capital sources, we are prepared to meet our clients' needs while delivering superior results to our shareholders.","Thank you, and now I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations.","Jonathan Zaffino","Thanks, Jon. Good morning. Everest Insurance has just completed another quarter of solid execution, resulting in excellent top line growth, and more importantly, continued profitability. We continue to advance our strategy to build a world-class, diversified Specialty Insurance Group fueled by talent, partnerships and a deep set of specialty products that are well positioned within this changing market. Our solid results this quarter billed on the first 2 quarters of this year and marked the 19th consecutive quarter of growth for the insurance operations. Our gross written premium growth of 29% quarter-over-quarter is once again balanced across all major business segments. Our growth accelerated this quarter beyond our year-to-date trend line of plus 21%, in part, reflecting the changing nature of the market which is impacting nearly all major product lines. This is particularly the case for business originated within the excess and surplus line market, which accounted for over 1\/3 of our premium written in the quarter. ","Our new business this quarter provides some additional context on our balanced growth. It was driven by a multitude of areas, reflecting the specialty nature of our portfolio, including specialty casualty, which, once again, experienced meaningful rate increases in the quarter; our property and short-tail businesses, led by both our retail and excess and surplus property divisions, both of which also achieved meaningful rate increases; and our various other specialty product lines, including transactional risk, credit and political risk and surety. Each of these businesses continues to see meaningful increases in opportunity.","The segments I just referenced make up approximately 75% of our business growth in the quarter and represent the balanced portfolio we seek to build. The combined ratio for the quarter is 96.4%, 3.2 points better than the third quarter of 2018 and year-to-date is 96% or 2.1 points better year-over-year. This is due to both lower catastrophe losses impacting our repositioned property portfolios and to an improved attritional loss ratio. The expense ratio remained stable despite our continued commitment toward investments in people, technology, new business units and new facilities. New underwriting capabilities established in Bermuda and the regulatory approval of the London branch of our Irish insurance company are good examples of these new facilities and represent our continued commitment to international expansion. Further, new and expanded office locations in the U.S. are bringing us closer to the customers and trading partners we serve.","Turning to the rate environment. We are encouraged by the results we see here. In the quarter, we experienced pure rate increases, which exclude the impact of exposure of 7.6%, excluding workers' compensation, and a positive 6.7% year-to-date. The quarterly ex work comp rate increase is the largest increase seen since the second quarter of 2012 and continues to be led by double-digit rate increases within our property and commercial auto portfolios. ","Financial line in umbrella, excess are also showing improvement in the mid- to high-single digits, while general liability rate lift continues to build momentum with rate increases in the mid-single-digit range. The London wholesale market is also improving, showing double-digit improvement this quarter driven by professional indemnity, management liability and property. Year-to-date, International is showing a 7% improvement. ","We are very well positioned to take advantage of this improved pricing environment. In terms of our people, product set and our ability to offer compelling solutions to the market. This, coupled with strong retention rates within both our wholesale and retail books, is an encouraging sign. In other words, the strategic plan we have been executing over the last several years has positioned us well in this current rate environment. ","Most importantly, this growth in top line, coupled with improved business metrics, has resulted in Everest Insurance continuing to post an underwriting profit over 2x greater for the year-to-date period and now standing at 10 of the past 11 quarters. As Craig mentioned in the new investment disclosure, the pretax net investment income for insurance is $140 million year-to-date, thus our pretax operating income year-to-date now stands at $195 million, an excellent result. ","In conclusion, we remain pleased with the continued progress we are making and the establishment of a world-class specialty insurer. The over 90,000 new business submissions we have received year-to-date in our direct broker operations speak to our relevance and positioning in this market. Further, the underlying performance of our diverse books of business remain solid, and hence, we are well positioned to create value for all of our constituents in the evolving market ahead. ","We look forward to reporting back to you on our progress next quarter. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Holly for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question from Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research Group.","Amit Kumar","And welcome to Juan on the conference call. One question and one follow-up. Maybe I'll start with Juan. With you coming onboard, and I know you mentioned that you've been meeting people, et cetera, over the past 2 months. Do you have a view on Everest Re's reserves? And will you be doing some sort of a ground-up reserve review as we head into year-end?","Juan Andrade","Thanks, Amit, and thank you for the welcome on that. And, look, as you pointed out, I've had the opportunity to actually travel quite extensively over the past 2 months, meeting people, reviewing our businesses, et cetera. With the point specifically on reserves, I have had a number of discussions with our actuarial team, and what I can tell you is that Everest has a very solid process. Expected loss ratios are reflective of our best current information, industry data and other data sources. We also have very experienced underwriters who know their business, and they proactively work to mitigate known potential and unknown exposures, and the company also reacts to bad news quicker than good news. So we're constantly analyzing, taking actions on these findings and constantly repeating this process to ensure the strength of our balance sheet. Frankly, this process has resulted in Everest initial loss ratio picks developing, on average, over the last -- over 2 points favorable, including cats, over the past 10 years. And again, I think that's an important point that we have seen favorable development, on average, of 2 points over the last 10 years from our initial loss ratio picks. So I believe that we have a solid process, and we're constantly reviewing this performance of our business, and we will take action if it's warranted.","Amit Kumar","Got it. That's helpful. And the only follow-up, and I will re-queue. This might be for Dom or Mr. Zaffino. Going back to the growth in the Insurance segment, I think 21%. I know we discussed this on the last call. However, in some of the recent conference calls, there have been further alarm bells on the loss cost trends, the discussion on social inflation, the total environment, even the underlying loss cost trends. Does this give you a reason to maybe slow down the growth from here? Or how are you thinking about the rate versus your loss cost trend metric?","Dominic Addesso","Let me start, and I'll ask Jon to jump in as well. As we previously mentioned in the opening comments, any new business opportunities that we take on appropriately contemplate trend, frequency and severity, et cetera. And obviously, we've been getting rate increase for the last couple of years in many of the lines. I'd also point out that, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, our loss picks that we put on these books of business are very conservative from the very beginning and reflect those trends that we're all concerned about. In fact, relative to the market, I'll point out that, take commercial auto for example, we've been increasing our loss pick there for the last couple of years in recognition of those trends. Similarly on excess liability, the same thing, although we're not necessarily seeing any spike in claims activity. But in anticipation of some of the noise within the marketplace, again, we're picking a conservative number. Likewise on workers' compensation where we've seen rate decreases, we've also been increasing our loss selection there. Although that line of business continues to trend very favorably from a loss reserve perspective. So we certainly share the market's concerns over these issues. But as I've mentioned earlier, we think we have them properly ring-fenced. And we'll see what the future will tell for that. And, Jon, do you have anything to potentially add to that?","Jonathan Zaffino","Yes. Let me touch on the growth for a second in the quarter here, and there's really 5 or 6 things we're seeing as contributory to the growth. First and foremost, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it's all increased rate opportunity that we're seeing across the board almost, excluding workers' compensation, combined with pretty solid renewal retention. So if you recall from prior quarters, there was a lot of portfolio reshaping, repositioning going on. We've seen that stabilize, so our retention ratios are much stronger than they have been.","Secondly, as I mentioned, we're seeing a lot of opportunity in the E&S space. Submission flows are through the roof. We're seeing a lot more opportunity there, a lot of dislocation, and it's predicated off of a number of different factors, but we're certainly taking advantage of that. And then somewhat linked to that is the growth in our underwriting population. Over the last year, we sort of stopped the clock at third quarter of '18 to say we've increased the underwriting population by almost 20%. So we have more people, wonderful talent across the board who's able to respond to this market change and condition, and we're taking advantage of that. The other piece I'll point out is even as you look at the supplement, even in our -- some of our specialty casualty areas -- remember, very little of what we do is standard business. This is a specialty company. So while it might be in a certain line like GL, we will write GL out of 12, 13 different areas, each with various tones of specialization. And as Dom mentioned, we're going to react to trends as we see them. We're constantly monitoring for those and react accordingly. So you almost have to deconstruct those buckets to really get the -- to feel what's happening underneath there, but we're comfortable where we're at.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","My first question. Was hoping, Juan, to get some color from you just in terms of thinking about Everest's outbound retro strategy for next year, if you have a view in terms of using cat bonds, ILWs or traditional retro within the outbound purchases. And I guess, just on an overall basis, you guys alluded to retro rates increasing substantially at 1\/1, and so retro rates really do skyrocket next year. Would you have to shrink your kind of curve capacity if you aren't able to buy that coverage?","Juan Andrade","Sure, Elyse. So let me start, and I'll ask John Doucette to add some color to that. Look, I think as John Doucette mentioned in his remarks, we are seeing a change in the retro market. There's a lot of trapped capital currently out there, particularly from the events in '17, '18 and '19. And as a Jon mentioned, the majority of that retro really has been without alternative capital. As far as rated carriers are concerned, this does create an opportunity for us to get additional rate that is much needed in that space and for us to have essentially opportunities for growth there, albeit on a disciplined way of doing that. So we are looking at opportunities for growth in that space right now, and I think John can give you a little bit more color on our strategy.","John Doucette","Yes. Thanks, Juan. So part of the rationale as to how we built the strategy of how we think of hedging the book is we want to get it to the right net risk appetite and then also shape the book to where we want, more here or less there, in terms of net position. But very importantly is we have -- and we've talked about this a lot. We have a variety of hedges, different products, different durations, different attachment points, different territories, frankly, different investor pools of capital that we're -- that we've been tapping into. And that's the cap on capital pool is different than the Logan investor pool is different than our traditional reinsurance and retro hedges that we put in place, different than ILWs. And what we have built is a suite of those that are a lot more robust than any one of them individually. And I would note that, particularly with the cat bonds, and this was intentional, the cat bonds that we do are on a multiyear basis. And we are one of the largest, if not the largest, sponsor of the catastrophe bonds in the world on the property side. And those basically, year-over-year, will have no increase in the cost of hedging. And so that provides a nice, stable anchor to our hedging strategy, and then -- and again, we'll look at all -- across the whole suite of the different hedges that we have. We'll look at that in terms of how -- what we want to do where and based on availability and price and execution and things like that.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then my second question. If we could -- do you guys have an initial view on the Q4 cat losses for Everest? We obviously had another typhoon in Japan. You also have the California fires and some events within Texas. And, Craig, in terms of taking to the Q4 tax, can you just kind of guide us in terms of tax rate for the fourth quarter as well?","Dominic Addesso","Let me start, and I'll then ask Craig to mention the tax rate. It's really early days on assessing Hagibis. You've seen, I'm sure, what the modeling firms have put out in one particular case. The range is pretty wide, and it's really too soon for us to direct the market on where that loss is ending up. We obviously have other events, Faxai, that can be used somewhat as a guidepost. But even in that particular case, it is still very early in assessing where that might end up. Although, obviously, we feel we've reserved it conservatively at the high end of the range. So we can't give any guidance at this point until we know more. And the minute we know more, I'll come up with an estimate. We certainly will be potentially disclosing that. And, Craig, why don't you...","Craig Howie","Elyse, this is Craig. With respect to taxes, I mentioned in my comments one of the things that we look at from an effective tax rate standpoint is the number that we gave for this quarter is an annualized number. It's essentially a 9% rate. If the catastrophe estimates for the fourth quarter are higher than our planned catastrophe estimates for the fourth quarter, we would expect that rate to be lower than the 9% rate. As far as what's in the plan for the fourth quarter, we've given you guidance before that our average annual cat load is just under 7 points of cat and about 1\/4 of that would be in our planned cat load for the fourth quarter.","Dominic Addesso","Keep in mind that -- I know you're trying to get to a specific number on the P&L. But in fact, to the whole notion of how we manage cat exposure, we do manage cat exposure on an after-tax basis. Clearly, some markets don't have the ability to do that because they're in a tax-free jurisdiction, but we look at our net cat exposure on an after-tax basis. So we think we have a unique ability to take on business in a tax-efficient manner.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Brian Meredith from UBS.","Brian Meredith","Yes. John, I'm just curious your commentary about more renewals and solid pricing and what's happening here. If you break that down, what are you looking at as far as Europe goes? Because Europe, I don't think it's had quite the cat activity. And could that potentially offset some of the -- kind of good pricing we're seeing in retro when we look at the total picture?","John Doucette","Yes. Brian, it's John. Yes. I mean, look, we write $6 billion to $7 billion premium all over the world, all products, all lines and across large clients, small clients. There's going to be pockets that we think are doing better. We'll try to allocate more pockets that aren't necessarily doing as well. There'll be less. And to your point, so we went to -- this is the conference season. So several of us went to Monte Carlo, and there was a lot of bullish talk on pricing there. Then we -- some of us went to CIAB out in Colorado, and it was more bullish there. Part of that is the timing. Part of that is the territory. And then a lot of our underwriters just recently came from APCIA, and we're more bullish still. So we're seeing -- generally, I think we're feeling like there's some momentum building on the pricing, but there are definitely pockets of that, that, that wouldn't apply too as much. And in bottom, the conversation was more muted, partially because of the loss activity over the last few years. And right now, going on now is the Asian conference, SIRC. So we're looking to get feedback there. But part of -- as we really think about this global portfolio and how we dynamically allocate it, we'll do that in real time based on where we see the opportunity set for us best to deploy our capital.","Brian Meredith","Great. And then just quickly on the Insurance side, I'm just curious. Big growth in your property short-tail this quarter after it being kind of down for the last several quarters. What kind of happened all of a sudden caused a big shift there?","Jonathan Zaffino","I don't know if it was a big shift as it might look. There are obviously improved market conditions that we're seeing. Some of it has to do with lower year-over-year comps on some deliberate actions we took in the prior year in the portfolio. But overall, we're feeling quite optimistic about the opportunities that are coming in. Obviously, we measure those on a real-time attribution basis, and we can see sort of what's happening. And we're very confident that the book that we're assembling right now is quite strong. So some of it's year-over-year comps, but it was just simply a function of market opportunity and rate.","Brian Meredith","Great, great. And just one other quick one on the Insurance side. Special liability, are you guys seeing the same type of loss trend pressure that others have kind of talked about and reported?","Jonathan Zaffino","We're seeing it as an industry observation, but not as much in our book. If you recall 3 years ago, we took very aggressive corrective action and basically took most of our exposure off, particularly in the public D&O space. So we are watching the same types of events, and we are seeing those. But our book is a bit different, a bit insulated. What we're encouraged by, Brian, is the rate we're seeing. So if we look at it quarter-over-quarter on our professional liability book or our D&O book, it's -- the rates have almost doubled. So we're more constructive on that market going forward, so starting to build some exposure, but we've been a little bit insulated by some of those broader trends.","Dominic Addesso","And that is another series of lines of businesses where we took -- made some loss pick selections higher a couple of years ago. So we have been aggressive in pushing up our loss picks in those lines as well. I mentioned earlier the casualty, in particular, and commercial auto but also on the professional areas, we've been pushing up our loss cost -- pushing up our loss picks.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs.","Yaron Kinar","First question is around losses from Dorian and Faxai. I guess there are many ways to slice and dice this, but one thing I did note was that the market share -- Everest market share of these losses seem to be pretty much in line with the market share of prior losses in these regions for the company. And I would have just thought that maybe that market share should compress, just given the actions that you've taken to shrink your catastrophe exposures. So any thoughts on that?","John Doucette","Yaron, it's John. Overall, we did -- as we reprice the book, we did take -- decreased some net exposure, as you saw in our PML that we stated. And part of it is a function of what we were trying to get to in some of the more of the peak zones, and part of it is a function of where we see the opportunity set. So we have been a very strong supporter, for example, in the Caribbean for a long time. We have developed a very nice attractive book there. And correspondingly, we have a decent market share there. And our intention always is try to have a lower market share of the loss, the market share of the premium as we try to build out the portfolio. But part of it is where the specifics of the losses that happen.","Dominic Addesso","So you would have seen -- I think another way to answer that question is that, as we were trying to reduce some volatility, as John mentioned, looking at our PML disclosures, certainly a big part of the reduction would have occurred in Florida specifically.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question just goes back to the Bermuda reinsurance segment where we saw a significant decrease in the commissions and brokerage ratio. Can you maybe talk about that?","Dominic Addesso","Craig, can you...","Craig Howie","Yaron, this is Craig. One of the things that I would encourage you to take a look at with respect to that Bermuda book and the commission lines, specifically, is look at it more on a year-to-date basis. What is included in that line is also contingent commissions, but what you're really seeing is a change in business mix. What we've seen is lower costs on the commissions paid for some of the property pro rata business and some larger global account deals that have been written as well as mortgage. Offsetting this slightly is what you're seeing is a higher loss pick, which is up about one point year-over-year. So again, the idea was to grow the book but to get it -- to grow the book at a better overall margin.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. So I guess we should look at the year-to-date results as maybe a better indicator of the actual run rate?","Craig Howie","Yes. So that's down about 3 points, but that's more in line with where we would expect it to be than the quarter number, yes.","Dominic Addesso","And keep in mind, that highlights the fact that -- we've been saying about improving rates, terms and conditions on the reinsurance portfolio. That evidence fell through in the proportion of business through lower, lower cedes. So that's where we're seeing the benefit of that.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research.","Crystal Lu","This is Crystal Lu in for Ryan Tunis. My first question is about the reserve development this quarter. Can you provide some detail on where the reserve releases came from?","Craig Howie","Sure, Crystal. This is Craig. What I would say to you with respect to the reserve studies that were completed this quarter, essentially what we saw were releases from Canada as well as accident and health on the reinsurance side.","Dominic Addesso","In addition to the mortgage.","Craig Howie","In addition to the -- yes. In addition to what we had said with respect to the commutation of the multiyear deal. But the actual reserve studies that were completed for the quarter were favorable by about $4 million.","Crystal Lu","Okay. That's helpful. And the second question is on capital management. Can you just talk a little bit about your desire to build capital versus return it going forward?","Dominic Addesso","Well, first of all, our strategy around capital has always been to certainly maintain some level of excess capital in order to support the growth that we've had, and you've seen how we've been able to grow the business organically over the last couple of years. So we clearly feel that we do have sufficient capital, and we also feel we have some excess capital. But we have not been, in essence, returning -- buying in any shares over the last several months. As you know, our stated intentions have always been to not be aggressive in terms of buying in shares during catastrophe season. So it doesn't diminish our appetite for share repurchases going forward or in any other forms of returning capital to shareholders once we emerge out of the cat season.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Meyer Shields from KBW.","Meyer Shields","Great. This is, I think, mostly for John Doucette. I'm trying to balance the benefit of accelerating and increasingly earned rate increases against the book of business diversification into higher loss ratio lines. So basically, can you give us a sense as to when the benefits of rate will match or outpace the higher attritional combined associated with more casualty?","John Doucette","That's a multi-faceted question. There's not a simple answer for that. We do look at -- maybe I'll bring it back to kind of our pricing and ROE framework. So we do have a holistic ROE framework that goes across all lines of business, all territories, and that factors in volatility of the lines, historical performance of the lines. It also factors in duration. So we can kind of crystallize things into one view of risk and return based on an ROE framework that we have, and we would see -- and so that would factor in long duration versus short duration, volatile versus nonvolatile and things like that, that allows us to help turn the dials. And again, that will vary all over the place by territory, by line, by client, by size, by product, et cetera.","Dominic Addesso","Keep in mind, too, Meyer, the other thing that I think was worth considering or looking at and things -- something we've referenced in the past is that you've got to be careful about just looking at the combined ratio. And sometimes, you got to pay attention to the dollars, to the bucks. And the reality is, is that when you look at our underwriting result in dollar terms, it's actually gone up year-over-year. So I understand we look at the combined ratios themselves, but we also look at dollars of profit.","Meyer Shields","No. That's very fair. Just a quick follow-up. The Faxai estimate that you guys put out was clearly very conservative. But I'm wondering, now that we've had another typhoon in sort of the same region and the risk of some demand surge associated with that, is there still a risk of, I guess, either industry-wide or Everest's Faxai losses going up?","Dominic Addesso","Oh, I don't know how you answer that, Meyer. You could always say there's a risk to anything, and perhaps there's a risk that it could go down, too. I mean maybe that's the right way to answer it. But we've reserved it what we think is a very conservative level. I think it's been suggested that the industry ranges reflect the risks that you are referencing. So therefore, perhaps it's already embedded in the industry estimates. Look, more than that, we're not certain, but we don't have strong conviction that we're going to be short. Put it that way, best way I could say it.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Mike Zaremski from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski","Dom, first off, congrats on a successful career at Everest, and all the best to you. My first question -- as I've taken everything's been said on the call so far, it feels like if we think about on the casualty side that you're saying the trend is well within rate increases. And then also, I think, Dom, you mentioned you guys have been underweight in some of the lines that might be causing some higher trend for -- more so for your peers. I'm just kind of curious. Is there a fear factor in the broader marketplace right now in the casualty side causing rates to move so much? Or is it truly a change in loss trend coming into the marketplace or both?","Dominic Addesso","I think it's -- it could be a number of factors, and I'll ask certainly any of my colleagues here to chime in as well. I do think that the marketplace is seeing trend, clearly, which, again, we feel that we've either accommodated through rate increase and\/or a higher loss pick. And just to stay on that point for just a second, I think you'll find that if you examine our lines of businesses that we are near the high end, if not at the high end, or even above many industry loss estimates for the industry loss picks. So we have reserved it conservatively. And clearly, with our mid-90s combined ratio and you back off a very competitive expense ratio of lower than average expense ratio, you back into a loss ratio that I think you'll find is, again, above the industry. And that's not because of our book of businesses. It's because we conservatively selected a loss space. So just to focus on that for just a second. ","But I do think, back to your question, factoring will be trend. The factor will be perhaps some of the industry maintaining their loss picks through a softening cycle and perhaps they're seeing some of the redundancy, if have had redundancies, start to erode. That's a factor as well. Certainly, anemic investment returns, meaning an increasing desire or need to have an increasing underwriting return. Those are all factors that impact any underwriter's view or any management's or executives' view of where the market needs to go.","John Doucette","Yes. And, Mike, this is John Doucette, and I just want to add a little more color from the reinsurance side. So, yes, we have been underweight over the last several years, and I encourage you all to go back and look at what we've been saying about casualty going back 6 or 7 -- starting 6 or 7 years ago, where we talked about concern of worsening casualty markets, broadening terms and conditions and some emerging risks. And clearly, increased ceding commissions on the reinsurance side. A lot of that is now coming to fruition. So it's exactly what we have been talking about in reunderwriting and managing our portfolio for a long time, which we think puts us in a good stead going forward to take advantage. We are seeing some of the larger buyers come back into the market, and that can have a meaningful impact on the reinsurance market. So a lot of those losses also had stayed with some of the large globals who have been buying less. And I think the pendulum swinging back now as they're looking to help decrease their net lines as well as the underwriting results that they're doing on a gross basis. So we think that will certainly impact the market. So a combination of what we had done starting 6 or 7 years ago as well as the opportunity set that we have with our ratings and balance sheet and positioning with the large global clients who have very, very tight reinsurance security list and a whole lot of reinsurers either don't qualify or aren't allocated large lines to them, we think puts us in a good stead for what we see as an improving casualty market going forward.","Michael Zaremski","That's helpful points. And finally -- yes, please.","Jonathan Zaffino","No. I was just going to add one quick point from insurance side. And just to be clear, I don't think we dispute the fact that there is trend. There is trend. I think what Dom is referencing is we've made conservative loss selection, but I'll give you a for instance here on our commercial auto book. On the insurance side, I just want to remind you, it's less than 10% of our total premium. So it's not a big part of what we do. Our accident years '13 through '16, we took corrective measures all throughout the reserving processes, and so we did see the average development. The reality is we have already taken the measures to address that. So just a quick point. We're not disputing the fact that there is trend. It's real, but I think some of the measures we've taken are giving impact.","Dominic Addesso","Thanks, Mike.","Michael Zaremski","Okay. That's helpful. And lastly just maybe for John Doucette. You spoke about property reinsurance and about there being elevated risks and more rate needed to reach \"adequate levels.\" So I guess do you feel that in the segment of the crop cat market that maybe isn't earning its cost of capital today, and so we need to see double-digit plus rate increases to kind of get more bullish on you guys growing that portfolio meaningfully?","John Doucette","Yes. There's a lot of moving parts there. And so a lot of it is a function of what, where the losses have happened and frankly what the response for the market and what the response of some of our clients is to losses. And $250 billion, $350 billion of losses we sometimes have a disagreement with some of our clients in terms of what the right price equilibrium should be after the losses have happened. And you look at different brokers put out different rating indices. And while we have seen some rate, that's kind of coming back. That's building back up to some of the rate decreases that have been happening since in 2011, 2012, and we watch that carefully. So we are looking. It will vary -- certainly, there's been underwriting issues that we've been focused on in terms of reunderwriting and managing our wildfire exposure and things like that, that we had focused on. ","So there's a variety of conditions that -- where we're going to get to. But we're going to deploy capacity where we think we're getting paid the best. We're going to deploy capacity behind long-term strategic clients, and that will vary by product, and then we'll allocate. And this is important that I don't think people realize as much. We also move between excess loss -- cat ex loss versus proportional versus per risk, and we'll move that within the same client to get -- and we'll also move within cat layers. We'll move up and down layers based on where we think we have the best rates, and that's very helpful. And because of our trading relationships and our balance sheet, we have more ability to do that than some of our competitors. And then we'll also look at allocating between our reinsurance and retro based on where we see the best pricing conditions. So there's a lot of moving parts going into that for where and how we're going to deploy our capacity.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank.","Joshua Shanker","And, Dom, congratulations on a decade. Hopefully, you won't be a stranger. And congratulations to Juan on your start at Everest. Wish you the best.","Juan Andrade","Thank you, Josh.","Joshua Shanker","Yes. First question, I guess for John Doucette. And if we look over a multiyear attritional combined ratio like underlying in the reinsurance space, it's been going up. As you've been deemphasizing catastrophe -- or not deemphasizing, but writing non-cat and casualty as a higher proportion of the book, as we think about 2020 and the mix of the book, should we continue to see the attritional combined ratio rising in the reinsurance segment based on mix?","John Doucette","Josh, I think I would say the year-to-date numbers today for the attritional loss are probably a decent indicator for what 2020 is going to look like.","Dominic Addesso","And again, back to -- let me -- Josh, let me just jump in. By the way, thank you for your thoughts. Let me just jump in here. Again, back to my comment I made earlier about let's not get too focused on the \"combined ratio\". The only way you'd see the combined ratio go up on an attritional basis is if the dollars of profit margin would be going up. So that's the way we would look at it.","Joshua Shanker","Okay. But of course, I mean, the cat business has a very low attritional combined ratio to it and so lower proportion of the overall pie, I guess.","Dominic Addesso","I take your point on that, and I don't think you'd necessarily see that book of business shrink so dramatically that it would have a meaningful impact on that element of the combined ratio that you're referencing.","Joshua Shanker","All right. And then for Jon Zaffino, on the insurance and winning business, we are seeing with some of the companies that have already reported a decline in retention on their insurance businesses. Could you just talk a little bit about the relationship with distributors and what they're seeing in terms of how competitive you need to be with the brokers in order to win new business?","Jonathan Zaffino","Josh, I guess I would maybe reframe the question a little bit and just start by offer a comment on what defines a relevance to our brokers. Number one, and we talked about this in the past, while we've been active at transforming and building the insurance operations over the last 5 years, recall that all of our main divisional \"client-facing leaders\" are far from new to this business, averaging over 30 years' experience. They have deep and long relationships with many of our distribution sources. So number one, we have a number of connection points within both the retail, wholesale, even delegated authority pockets of the market. Secondly, I think one of the keys themes for relevance is can you bring forth a very strong, differentiated balance sheet across a wide range of products. That's why we constantly sort of quote the 150 specialty products. And we're finding that happen in lots of different pockets. ","We're seeing the relevance of that in a lot of different pockets. For instance, some of our rating-sensitive lines of business, D&O, credit, political risk, surety, our balance sheet differentiates So we're seeing a good flow of opportunity there. In a market like this, the key is to be able to respond to the flow that you're receiving. So a lot of the work we're doing -- and we constantly talk again about investments in technology. How do we handle all this throughput? Again, I mentioned, I think, the 90,000 submissions new business year-to-date. How do you handle that? A lot of work we're doing operationally to make sure we're prepared. So when you think of those things together, the relationships we have, the wonderful balance sheet, the deep set of products and the improvement operational environment to handle all this, it creates a pretty powerful formula. Did that get to it, Josh?","Joshua Shanker","I suppose. And do you think that some of your competitors are getting less relevant as your abilities become more relevant in the market?","Jonathan Zaffino","Well, I think one thing we are seeing is a change underwriting posture from a lot of our competitors. And you heard about limit compressions in a bunch of different markets which is opening up opportunity for us. We've been pretty much front foot from the beginning. We know what we want to do to. It's an organic build. We're not distracted by rapid changes in underwriting appetite. So we are picking up some of the advantage of a market that is viewed, I think, generally as quite skilled in what we do, very stable and very clear on what our asset types are. So that's been benefiting us.","Operator","As there are no further questions, I'd like to hand the call back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Dominic Addesso","Yes. Thank you, Holly, and let me just close this out. I'd like to thank you all for joining this morning. And of course, thanks for the many years of relationships we've developed. As you know, this is my last earnings call, and you can well imagine the smile on my face. Not that I don't love you all, just saying. Actually, through that time, I've appreciated the exchange. It's not easy to summarize these last 10 years, but let me leave you with a few quick thoughts. As I've said many times, this is a long-term business. It needs to be managed in that fashion. And while, at times, conflicts with your mandate, which I understand, one shouldn't lose sight of the game plan. To that end, Everest has been on a path to grow shareholder value. And over a 10-year period, we had a compound annual growth rate of close to 10% in that shareholder value growth. And gross written premium has grown from $4 billion in 2009 to what would be hopefully an annualized $9 billion in 2019. ","At the same time, we reengineered our legacy Insurance business and bolstered those reserves and went on to build what is becoming one of the best premier specialty insurance franchises in the business, approaching $3 billion in gross premium written. Our reinsurance business has evolved into a more diversified portfolio, growing profitably into what is now one of the top markets for brokers globally, a true international brand. Investment portfolio has been greatly diversified and by several metrics has proven to be one of the best performing relative to duration, quality and data. None of this happens without the great team sitting with me here today, and I thank them enormously for their support and efforts. And now we ask Juan to lead us on that journey. I'm extremely confident that he and Messrs. Doucette and Zaffino, along with the rest of the Everest team, will continue to do great things. ","Thanks for this morning, and hopefully, we'll see you in the days ahead. Have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

(NYSE:RE) Q3 2014 Earnings Conference Call October 23, 2014 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Elizabeth Farrell - Vice President, Investor Relations","Dominic Addesso - President and Chief Executive Officer","John Doucette - Executive Vice President and Chief Underwriting Officer","Craig Howie - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Amit Kumar - Macquarie","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","Meyer Shields - KBW","Operator","Good day, everyone, and welcome to the third quarter 2014 earnings call of Everest Re Group Limited. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Elizabeth Farrell","Thank you, Kim. Good morning, and welcome to Everest Re Group's third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting Officer; and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and alike are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements.","Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.","Dominic Addesso","Thanks, Beth. Good morning. We are pleased to report another very strong quarter. Operating earnings per share of $6.12 is 46% above the prior year's third quarter. And on a year-to-date basis the $17.46 of operating earnings is 15% above the prior year pace. These operating results produced an operating ROE of 16%.","The lower level of cat losses versus last year in both the quarter and the year-to-date numbers was undoubtedly a contributor. However, it is important to highlight the fact that the attritional results remain quite strong.","The underwriting income on a year-to-date basis excluding cats has risen to $697 million from $665 million in the prior year. This is a result of portfolio management, which includes diversification both by product and geography; shifts between pro rata and excessive loss; new products; changing attachment points to focus on the best priced layers; and finally, use of outside reinsurance to various capital market platforms, including our own, to achieve better risk adjusted returns.","Another factor, but not in consequential, is a disciplined expense culture. Our expense ratio amongst the lowest in the industry improve year-over-year. Maintaining a firm grip on expenses will enable us to withstand the impact of any market softening, but more importantly enables us to entertain business opportunities at levels which are still accretive to or perhaps not to others.","One other contributing factor to the results for the quarter was an increase in investment income over previous quarters, due to timing on some of our limited partnership investments. Nevertheless, as maybe obvious, investment income will continue to drift lower, as older investment years mature and funds get invested at today's interest rate levels.","We have deployed a number of alternative asset strategies to blunt this. And while they have worked well, we are getting close to our asset risk appetite, as defined by our capital position.","Regarding operational highlights, our best performing and largest segment continues to be our U.S. Reinsurance operation, with a reported combined ratio of 72.6% this year. Our International Reinsurance segment, while typically an excellent performer and still quite profitable, is down relative to last year.","Most of the cats and other smaller events, now classified as cats, have been occurring in regions outside the U.S. These will include events like the Chile earthquake that occurred in the second quarter and Hurricane Odile in Mexico this quarter among others. Nevertheless, the combined ratio on a year-to-date basis still stands at an 88 for this segment.","Our insurance operation had an underwriting loss for the quarter, due solely to our U.S. crop business, which again is having a difficult year because of commodity prices and hailstorm events. Excluding this portfolio, the remainder continues to improve in profitability and growth, with 5 points of underwriting margin and 12% growth in the topline. This growth is a combination of rate increases as well as success in our business expansion efforts in E&S lines and specialty classes of business.","John will give further details on the operations, but we are well-positioned in each of our units to achieve return superior to the industry. While it is still uncertain what pricing will be at the next upcoming renewal season, we have thought through the various scenarios and will adapt, depending on conditions at that time.","Each of these strategies is with an eye towards maintaining the return levels we have been accustomed to through the cycle. These strategies include reducing business in certain areas, introducing new products, utilizing capital markets, expense control and managing capital levels through share repurchases.","Our strong and sizable capital position along with our underwriting talent, allows us the flexibility and market presence to be a significant factor in the marketplace. For this position of strength, we can continue to find the best opportunities and provide above average risk adjusted returns, despite what many see as market challenges.","Thank you. And now, Craig will give you the financial report.","Craig Howie","Thank you, Dom, and good morning, everyone. Everest had another very strong quarter of earnings with net income of $275 million or $6 per diluted common share. This compares to net income of $235 million or $4.81 per share for the third quarter of 2013. Net income includes realized capital gains and losses.","On a year-to-date basis, net income was $859 million or $18.47 per share compared to $895 million or $17.94 per share in 2013. The 2014 result represents an annualized return on equity of 17%.","Operating income year-to-date was $812 million or $17.46 per share. This represents a 15% increase over operating income of $15.22 per share last year. These operating results were driven by a strong underwriting result and lower income taxes compared to the first nine months of 2013.","The results reflect a slight increase in the overall current year attritional combined ratio of 81.9%, up from 81.1% for the same period last year. This measure excludes the impact of catastrophes, reinstatement premiums and prior-period loss developments. Gross written premiums of $4.3 billion on a year-to-date basis were up 11% compared to the same period last year.","All Reinsurance segments reported underwriting gains for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. Total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $588 million for the first nine months of 2014 compared to a $487 million gain last year, an increase of 21%.","The Insurance segment reported an underwriting loss of $13 million on year-to-date basis compared to a gain of $9 million in 2013. The 2014 results reflected a crop loss $42 million for the year, which included estimates to reflect the decline in corn commodity prices and losses related to hailstorms this quarter.","The Mt. Logan Re segment reported an underwriting gain of $28 million for the quarter and a $47 million gain year-to-date. Everest retained $5 million of this income and $42 million was attributable to the non-controlling interest of this entity. This compares to $1 million that Everest retained year-to-date last year.","The overall underwriting gain for the group was $622 million on a year-to-date basis compared to a gain of $500 million for the same period last year, an increase of 24%. These overall results reflect $30 million of current year catastrophe losses in the third quarter of 2014 compared to $75 million of cats during the third quarter of 2013. On a year-to-date basis, catastrophe losses were $75 million in 2014 compared to $165 million in 2013.","Of the $30 million total for the quarter, $20 million related to Hurricane Odile on the Baja peninsula, and we included an additional $10 million for the second quarter earthquake in Chile, now a total of $25 million for that event. Our reported combined ratio was 83.7% for the first nine months of 2014 compared to 85.6% in 2013.","The year-to-date commission ratio of 21.5% was slightly up from 20.9% in 2013, primarily due to higher contingent commissions. Our expense ratio remains low at 4.6% on a year-to-date basis.","For investments, pre-tax investment income was $142 million for the quarter and $397 million year-to-date on our $17.6 billion investment portfolio. Investment income year-to-date declined $26 million from one-year ago. This decrease is primarily driven by the decline in limited partnership income and by the low interest rate environment. Also, the capital used for share buybacks and redemption of debt contributed.","Limited partnership income is down $16 million year-over-year. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.2% as compared to 3.6% last year. Duration has moved from 3.2 years to 3 years.","The first nine months reflected $47 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $136 million of gains last year. These gains are mainly attributable to the fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio.","There were $4 million of derivative gains during the first nine months of 2014 compared to $33 million of gains in 2013. This is related to our equity put options and is a function of the change in interest rates and indices this year.","On income taxes, the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by additional foreign tax credits utilized in the quarter, relating to both the 2013 and 2014 tax years. The year-to-date operating income effective tax rate decreased from 14.4% in the second quarter to 12.3%. A 12% to 14% effective tax rate for the year is in line with our expectations, given our planned cat losses for the remainder of the year.","Strong cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $926 million for the first nine months of 2014 compared to $825 million in 2013. This is primarily due to lower catastrophe loss payments.","Shareholders equity at the end of the quarter was $7.4 billion, up $414 million or 6% over yearend 2013. This is after taking into account capital return through $400 million of share buybacks and $103 million of dividends paid in the first nine months of 2014, representing a total return of capital to our shareholders of over $500 million so far this year.","Book value per share increased 11% to $163.14 from $146.57 at yearend 2013. Our continued strong capital balance positions us well for potential business opportunities as well as continuing stock repurchases. Thank you.","And now, John Doucette will provide the operations review.","John Doucette","Thank you, Craig. Good morning. As Dom highlighted, we are pleased with our continuing strong results in the third quarter of 2014. Our group gross written premium was $1.67 billion, up $200 million or 14% from Q3 of last year, with growth coming predominantly from the U.S. and International Reinsurance segment.","Our net written premium was $1.52 billion, which was up $128 million or 9% over Q3 last year. For our global reinsurance segments, including both total reinsurance and Logan, gross written premium was $1.3 billion for the quarter, up 19.5% from Q3 last year.","Our growth in the third quarter was driven by new business opportunities both in the U.S. and internationally, in both cat and non-cat risk related deals. We wrote several new U.S.A. property pro rata deals. We took over as the lead reinsurer on one major international treaty, which was significant new business and new premium to us. And we also wrote several new specialty deals.","In addition, during the quarter, we closed several significant reinsurance deals, many of which have not yet been recognized in our earned premium, but will flow through in the next several quarters. Examples of these include: a new large non-cat exposed risk deal for an international client; the extension of several strategic deals with global clients; a new large reinsurance treaty covering a highly diversified international professional liability book of business; and new alternative risk reinsurance deals that provide a variety of risk coverages.","As we've been highlighting for the last several quarters, we believe that we are successfully navigating this choppy market. This is despite market headwinds for several classes of business, including a declining rate environment in many lines, higher client retentions and new and different types of competitors in this space. We have and will continue to grow the franchise profitably, make meaningful underwriting profits and build long-term shareholder value.","Our competitive strength enable us to achieve these goals. We have the size, geographic scope and breadth, and the longstanding broker and client relationships over the last 50 years to be one of the few top reinsurers of choice.","We have then and will continue to exploit this sustainable competitive advantage, by providing to our partners a highly-rated lead reinsurer with very seasoned lead market underwriting teams that can respond quickly and creatively, to deploy meaningful capacity in any class of P&C business around the world.","We continue to build strategic relationships with our clients and to enter distribution relationships with key brokers, and find new sources of distribution and revenue from both new clients and new products. We are seeing underwriting successes in many different areas of our book, driven in part by our investments in several underwriting initiatives over the last several years, including Mt. Logan, our capital markets facility, to position ourselves for future, long-term, growth and profitability.","Mt. Logan continues to help us execute our longer-term strategic goals. As we are now managers of third-party capital, we have more tools in our underwriting arsenal to help us achieve our objective of being the go-to broker reinsurer for all brokers and clients around the world.","The additional capacity provided by Logan and other hedges has enabled Everest to grow the topline, without materially increasing the risk to our balance sheet. And at the same time has allowed us to generate fees. In turn, Logan's investors have enjoyed superior returns relative to similar vehicles in this space.","In fact, Logan exceeded its return targets to investors in its first full year of operation. This was driven in part by a relatively benign catastrophe loss season. But more importantly, it was a function of the broadly diversified portfolios that Logan, in partnership with Everest, can create for its investors. We continue to have significant interest from new investors for Logan, and expect to grow Logan in both dollars of assets under management as well as the number of new Logan investors throughout 2015.","With Logan, the Kilimanjaro cat bonds, ILW purchases and other traditional and retrocessional protections and hedges, we are succeeding in lowering the cost of capital required to support our property catastrophe book, creating fee income for Everest to enhance our underwriting income and building a very attractive risk adjusted portfolio for our shareholders. And that helps us find more business that is accretive to earnings on our current level of capital. To highlight this, for our overall property catastrophe book around the globe, our net ROE is up compared to our gross ROE.","Turning to insurance operations. Insurance premium was $364 million in Q3, down slightly from Q3 last year. As mentioned previously, this is due to a decrease in crop premium in Heartland from lower commodity prices. Stripping out Heartland in both periods, our Q3 insurance gross written premium is up 15% this year compared to Q3 last year, with growth coming form virtually all segments within our insurance operations.","Rates are mixed within the insurance operation, with casualty, environmental and non-standard auto rates up. While rates are also up in workers comp, we saw additional capacity come into that market, and thus saw lower rate increases than in prior quarters. Property insurance rates were slightly down or slightly up, depending on the type of risk and territory. And new capacity in the professional liability space in U.S. continues to be aggressive in capacity and price, so we remain cautious there.","As discussed in previous quarters, we continue to see profitable growth opportunities in our insurance book, and we will continue to develop these areas, including casualty, contingency and event cancellation, non-program, workers comp, property E&S and DIC, and accident and health. In addition, we have been expanding distribution relationships to rollout new accident, health and specialty and contingency insurance products.","Bottomline, insurance results had an underwriting loss for both the quarter and year-to-date, but this was due to our crop insurance book. The insurance book had a loss of $21 million for the quarter with a $31 million loss in the crop book. This crop loss was caused by reduction in commodity prices, particularly corn, which was down approximately 30% from the base rate in February.","A loss in our largest crop state, Minnesota, due to a cold wet start to the planting there, which resulted in some preventive planting claims, and therefore yields that were not able to offset the commodity price decline as well as crop hail losses stemming from significant Midwest hailstorms in the quarter.","We continue to look to grow the Heartland operation to build economies of scale and diversify its geographic spread of business, and rollout enhanced IT systems to improve operating efficiencies and to make it easier for our agents to do business with us. Excluding the crop results, the insurance segment continues to see improvement with an attritional combined ratio of 95.6% for the quarter and 94.5% for the year.","We remain pleased with the underlying trends in our insurance book, with noted improvements in both loss ratios and expense ratios in many segments, due to our insurance profitability initiatives over the last several years. We expect these trends to continue with both topline and bottomline growth in our insurance book, as we continue to focus on expanding distribution, rolling out new products and enhancing our platform capabilities, to deliver a wide range of insurance products to our customers on both an admitted and non-admitted basis.","Our disciplined opportunistic culture is focused on achieving the best risk adjusted returns across all of our business segments. And our strong underwriting bench, high ratings and strong balance sheet, along with our efficient distribution platform and competitive expense ratio continues to enable Everest to generate double-digit returns for our shareholders.","Thank you. And now, back to Beth for Q&A.","Elizabeth Farrell","Kim, we are ready to open up the floor for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And we'll take our first question from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Just a question on the U.S. reinsurance book and the Bermuda book. In U.S. reinsurance, just trying to understand what is the profile of the business that you're writing more of? And is it a sort of different profile than your legacy book? And how do the modeled returns on that new business compare?","Craig Howie","I mean the book, we write off classes of business within the U.S. We write pro rata, risk, cat, retro, and we have a product called PURPle. And we will deploy different amounts of capacity to each of those depending on where we see the best returns. And the returns, while down, are still north of a 20% ROE.","Dominic Addesso","Michael, the book has not changed considerably over the years, typically as it relates to some of the peak zone areas. The reality is that we've actually diversified the book a bit more. Our casualty book, for example, is a little larger than it was a couple of years ago, but still not at the heights that it was at in 2002, 2003 timeframe.","We've also have written a number of pretty good growth in our regional client sector, as well as a little bit growth in our facultative book as well. But it's not a significant change. Most recently, in the last year, as John pointed out in his talking points, we did write some new property pro rata quota share deals. Many of those were in non-cat exposed areas. And there are shifts from time-to-time in the portfolio, depending on where the opportunities are. I don't know if you have a follow-up to that.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","I guess the question is how much of your sub-70 underlying combined growing -- you grew the book almost 20%. How much is, for example, just the fact that weather has been light, how much of that has driven that result? Just trying to understand, I mean is this where you're sort of modeled returns, where you expect returns to be or how much sort of help did you get from light weather?","Dominic Addesso","Well, the results of ourselves, as well as the rest of the market are always helpful when catastrophes are low. Particularly in the U.S., while there wasn't any major cat event. We also benefited this particular year in the U.S. due to a lower level of attritional cats. And we define that as any event to us that's less than $10 million. So that you see a year-over-year improvement in the U.S. book in part due to that.","On the other hand, we have a higher level of attritional cats in our Latin American book. And then in our Bermuda book, that was a little worse than a prior year due to purchase of ILWs. But you're going to have that impact in any one particular segment from time to time, I think the point is that the overall book is well-diversified, and that's the point of it, right. Better diversified than we have been, ever in our history, I would say.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","And to the extent that Mt. Logan also is growing, does your appetite or has your appetite for business changed now that Mt. Logan is online and sort of scaling up or do you still seek the same type of profile business that you would have without the presence of a Mt. Logan?","Dominic Addesso","As you may or may not know, our participation in Mt. Logan is proportional to our own book. In other words, the risk that we put into Mt. Logan is also partly retained within our portfolio. So our interests are aligned. So that means that our appetite, for our portfolio, Logan does not change our appetite. What Mt. Logan allows us to do is actually, for lines of business or class of the business or territory, that we think are attractive it allows us to expand our capacity in those areas. So that's the appetite part of it. But it doesn't change our return appetite.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","So the return threshold for Mt. Logan is the same as Everest?","Dominic Addesso","Correct.","Operator","We'll move on to our next question from Amit Kumar of Macquarie.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie","Just a quick follow-up, I guess on the last question, if I heard you correctly, you mentioned north of 20% return number. Is that sort of the average number you were talking about in terms of the new business that you have written or is there a range around that north of 20% number?","Dominic Addesso","As John will follow-up as well on this, but just to clarify that, and it's excess of 20%, and that's on allocated capital based on our modeling. Of course, we carried more capital than what the models would imply. And we have different appetites or different return objectives by classes of business for sure. John, do you want to?","John Doucette","I think the short answer is absolutely, there is going to be every class of business, not just property, not just cat; casualty, reinsurance, insurance, there's going to be wide range of returns, combined ratios and return on equity in every class, and we build books of business. And there is different attachment points, different ways we play different products that all have different returns that crystallizes into that total we are talking about.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie","I guess a follow-up to that would be why would someone be walking away from that business, which Everest is able to capture? Is there more to it or is that what you said that you were the lead, and hence, you're just seeing more opportunities? I guess, what I'm trying to figure out, it's a tough market out there, others are shrinking and yet you have found these specific opportunities and I'm trying to figure out is it more Everest-specific or is there an industry issue, which is helping Everest more than its peers?","Dominic Addesso","We've said on many quarters, and I think you're seeing it in the numbers, we continue -- I mean, one of the example is some of the bigger clients, they want to do more business with fewer people, and that means that there is some diversification away from the big directs. And then there is also a consolidation of the P&L. We have been a direct beneficiary of that.","We can't really comment on other peoples view. We have our capital model. It's been the same capital model we've had for many years. But we think that we have enhanced opportunities with some of the consolidation that's going on, and that certainly would drive part of what you're seeing.","Certainly, we can't comment on what other market participants are seeing necessarily, but some of the decrease that occurs in some of the other markets is not just under-priced business, it's also, as John pointed out, in some of the larger programs, lines that are lost. And so that's certainly a factor.","And don't miss understand, I mean there are lines of business that we shrink and pullback from as well. It's not that we're seeing every class of business, every attachment point, every layer being appropriately priced. So there are places in our portfolio that are contracting and there are other places, which have expanded.","John Doucette","And one other point I'd like to add is, and we've said this before, but you can't underestimate the importance. We write a lot, unlike a lot of our competitors, we write for a lead market property, reinsurer and write that book of business from the U.S. and that gives us better access to clients, better ability to visit with them, meet with them, negotiate with them onshore, and that is very helpful. And sometimes business gets done domestically and then doesn't go to other jurisdictions to get completed.","Operator","And we'll move on to our next question from Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","For the crop insurance book, you highlighted the impact in 3Q. What's your expected impact in 4Q?","Craig Howie","We do expect to see some change, because the commodity prices have changed from our estimate, from where we booked these numbers for the third quarter. However, we still would expect a loss in the fourth quarter. We'll still have expenses coming through, and again, expect the loss in that quarter as well.","Dominic Addesso","It will be modest, though.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","And there was $31 million loss in crop in 3Q?","Craig Howie","That's correct, for the quarter; and $42 million year-to-date. Now, that's for both MPCI Crop as well as Crop-Hail. There were several storms, hailstorms, that happened during the quarter and we took a fairly large loss, which represents about half of the loss for the quarter, Jay.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","And then separately, on Mt. Logan, given the sharp improvement in profit in 3Q, is there a way we could better project what the outlook for that is? I know there's some lumpiness, but my sense is it's tied to some extent to the amount of capacity that's provided. So is there any straightforward way, for us, as outside observers, to be able to project that?","Dominic Addesso","You're talking gross or net?","Jay Gelb - Barclays","I would say probably gross, and then also on the underwriting gain?","Dominic Addesso","It's partly reflective of the marks that go to Mt. Logan portfolio. But I'll ask John to comment on that.","John Doucette","I mean, clearly there is seasonality component to it, in terms of where we are, so it's very much cat dependent. I mean that book is, that the business that we currently have in Mt. Logan is 100% property catastrophe reinsurance. So it's going to be very much a focus, it's very much a function of what is the cat business that's happened.","Dominic Addesso","And from an underwriting gain perspective, on a net basis, in other words after non-controlling interest, it's not that significant. For the nine months, it was $5 million, I think.","John Doucette","Correct.","Dominic Addesso","So I wouldn't expect a material change from that into the fourth quarter. To me that's really the best way to look at it. Of course, we've got the underwriting fee income for managing that portfolio that comes in as well. In terms of what sticks to us, I don't know if it's material enough that we can give you a better answer than that.","Operator","And we'll go next to Vinay Misquith of Evercore.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","The first question is on the accident, your combined x cats and the reinsurance segment, that's ticked up this quarter. Was curious if it was sort of by choice that management has written a lot more diversifying business and so it's more of a business mix issue or is it more of the pricing issue?","Dominic Addesso","Vinay, as I mentioned perhaps before, but just to clarify, what's happening in the overall reinsurance book is, and particularly this quarter is the Latin American attritional cats, so we had tickup in that. That probably was the biggest driver. And then in Bermuda, we had purchase of ILWs. There is some mix issues going on as we wrote some more U.S. proportional business, non-cat exposed, so that does have an impact. But overall the biggest change is due to the Latin America attritional cats in the reinsurance.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","So would you say that this quarter was slightly higher than average and what you would expect for the future?","Dominic Addesso","Yes. As far as its attritional number, absolutely.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","And just looking at where pricing is going, we're hearing that ceding commissions are increasing for every non-cat business. How much should we expect the combined ratios to go up next year, for more than a couple of points, or a couple of points would be reasonable?","John Doucette","We don't really forecast combined ratios. We don't disclose that. Frankly, we are still closing out our planning process for next year anyway, but clearly that would be pretty close, giving you an earnings number. And we don't disclose that.","But let me just make a comment about that, generally. Certainly, the market is difficult. There are many areas where it's very competitive. What we have managed to do is buy different products in the property cat space in particular, which is probably where your question is coming from, in part we have moved the different layers, changed attachment points, gone outside, as John pointed out, purchased retrocessional protection, diversified our book further, all with an eye towards trying to maintain the same return levels.","And it's certainly, entirely possible that if some of this business doesn't meet our return objectives that we will begin to withdraw with certain capacity. And if that means that we manage our capital more aggressively, then we'll do that. So there's lots of levers that we can pull into this marketplace.","With respect to ceding commissions, a lot of that frankly ends up in the casualty, treaty area. That would be the largest impact to us, the impact of increased ceding commissions. And in many cases where ceding commissions have reached extraordinary levels, we have actually even non-renewed or not participated in those offerings. So that does put some pressure on the treaty casualty writings, for sure into next year, if that continues, and we will see.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","And just a simple numbers question, the corporate expenses, I think, doubled this quarter. Were they some one-time items or is this the level for the future?","Craig Howie","Corporate expenses doubling this quarter; I am not sure that I see that on an overall basis.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","Sorry. The corporate expenses were $10 million this quarter. Was it about $5 million in the year ago order? So just curious, if there were some one time items in there?","John Doucette","In which segment?","Craig Howie","Overall.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","They're overall corporate expenses, it's a small line item, just a $10 million number","Craig Howie","It's just normal fluctuations. I don't expect any -- there is no continuing trend there that we can point to. I would look at that number on more of an annualized basis as opposed to a quarter number.","Operator","And we'll move on to our next question from Joshua Shanker of Deutsche Bank.","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Everyone's going to be always confused by the writing of all these premiums, there's nothing we can do about it. But I did think to myself that driving in the past, you guys have talked about the proportional treaties onshore, which you mentioned a little bit on the conference call. I would think that will be driving your tax rate up over the long run.","You had some foreign tax credits come in this quarter that came as a surprise to me. I mean, can we talk a little about the tax situation and whether I'm wrong to think they're going up over time. And how one-time in nature these foreign tax credits were and how I should think about that?","Craig Howie","So the nature of the foreign tax credits is this. First, in order to take foreign tax credits you need to be a tax payer. We just filed our 2013 tax return in September and became a tax payer, again, utilizing all of our loss carry forwards on a tax return basis. So that's the first thing you need is to become a tax payer.","The next thing you need is foreign-source income and we have an earning income where our branch locations are outside the U.S. mainly Canada and other places like that, so we have an earning income. So now we get to take those foreign tax credits against the actual tax on the tax return. So that's number one. We got to take those for both 2013 as well as the 2014 year this quarter. What I would expect to see going forward is about $10 million per year of foreign tax credits. So I'm not at big number, but it is an ongoing number.","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank","And then as it relates to the higher amount of onshore pro rata risk, is that driving the attritional tax rate up over time?","Craig Howie","What would drive that attritional rate up traditionally for us that we've mentioned in the past is more catastrophes. So in other words the less catastrophes we have here located in the U.S. and taxed in the U.S., the more taxable income we would have, therefore the higher the tax rate. Right now, the tax rate has been relatively high, if you will, 14.4% last quarter, because of the lack of cats in the U.S.","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank","One just quick question, something I've been looking at, have you guys pointed the independent director or independent directors to Mt. Logan yet?","Dominic Addesso","We are in the past was doing that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","My first question is on the crop side. Just wondering if you have any commodity hedging? And if you do have, is that part of your loss ratio or operating numbers? Then on crop, if you think about longer-term, a normalized weather year, what's your sort of like normalized or expected combined ratio for that line of business? And next year, if the commodity price staying the same as it is right now, do we expect a big drop in terms of the premium you will be able to collect?","Dominic Addesso","First of all, on the crop side, we have no commodity hedges in place, unless that addresses that. From a expected loss ratio on an expected basis for crop, around 80%, double high-70s would be what we would expect. The price levels stay where they're at. What would happen to the premium? I don't know that there would be any material change in premium.","John Doucette","No. We would expect, assuming that we kept the same policy count we would expect the premiums to stay the same. We are and have talked about trying to grow the policy count with additions of staff in different areas that will help us do that.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","So just to clarify that, so premium will stay the same even though the commodity price, like the next several will be like 30% lower than earlier this year?","Dominic Addesso","Well, there is a lot of moving parts including the volatility factor that's been lower in the last couple of years. So we don't know where that will end up being for next year.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","Then on a different topic, on the sort of east we saw, alternative capital, the basic supply going, now they're talking about some of the primary company may see less into the open market. Sp from your perspective, just wanted to hear your thoughts about, one, in the near-term where you see the genuine pricing going? Are we bottoming out on that? And then longer-term, how do you think the industry will evolve and how is Everest repositioned for that?","Dominic Addesso","Well, that's a very heavy question and a big topic for sure. First of all, relative to what's going on in the alternative capital space, what you're asking is, less ceded premium into the marketplace. A lot of that premium, if you're speaking about hedge fund type structures, typically the premium going into those types of vehicles will be more casualty focused business, which frankly for us right now has not been a growth area for us. So we would not anticipate any major impact from some of those early movers into that space.","It's still early days with respect to hedge fund capital coming in. My early view on it is that it's very difficult to raise capital into these structures, and that doesn't mean that they won't exist. But it's not clear to me at this point that it will be a huge part of our business, at least at this point. If in fact that evolves to be something different, and it's likely that will be more attractive to investors to invest into that space, Everest would certainly be prepared to consider that as one of its platforms, not unlike what we've done with Mt. Logan.","Mt. Logan for us is where we see more immediate term growth in the alternative capital space. As John pointed out, we still would expect there to be increased assets under management there. And for us that is a strategic play, where we're actually as I mentioned before able to deploy more capacity through the use of that facility. So we see it as a tool, not a threat. And it's just another form of capital, and allows us to manage our own capital more efficiently. That'd be the case.","In terms of pricing, certainly on the capital market side, there seems to be some evidence that we're certainly trading near our bottom, particularly as you look at cat bond pricing, and even some of the things that we see going on in our capital markets facility Mt. Logan, where investors are hitting some floors with respect to the returns that they expect. Hard to say what impact that might have on traditional pricing or any pricing at one-one.","As you probably know, next week is PCI, but more recently coming from -- had some folks at Baden-Baden, but before that in the CIAB and before that in Monte Carlo, there seem to be less talk about price decline and more talk frankly from any of our ceding company clients about maintaining traditional panel, maintaining relationships, and making sure that their panels where highly rated. So all that conversation to me suggest that we are floating somewhere around the bottom at this point, but we will see in the next 60 days.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","And if I may ask one last question on the buybacks, it looks like slowdown a bit in third quarter and why your earnings have been great. So are we expecting a tick up in the fourth quarter that still targeting probably return 100% to show payout ratio in 2014?","Dominic Addesso","As you know, we don't give guidance on our share repurchases. But I will point out that we historically in the third quarter, given that's our highest cat exposed season that we have typically lightened up on share repurchase. And this past third quarter was no different than what we've done in others.","And so we would certainly look favorably on increasing that in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter market conditions, both pricing of our stock as well as market conditions on the pricing side. If those are all favorable, then we would look to increase our share repurchases. But we do not forecast or give a number on what that might be. We do it week at a time.","Operator","And we'll move on to our next question from Meyer Shields of KBW","Meyer Shields - KBW","Dominic, the trend of panel consolidation that you're seeing, is that sort of a one-time issue that's going to wash through or do you see sort of incrementally benefiting companies of your size in the next few years?","Dominic Addesso","I think it's likely to continue. I don't know about the next few years. It's difficult time horizon too on that, but I would see that accelerating or continuing on some level for sure. Unless there is some consolidation in the industry, so that there are larger capital providers, then I would expect that trend to continue. And I think that's probably why you see some exacts predicting or suggesting there should be greater consolidation within our space.","Meyer Shields - KBW","The slowing rate increases in workers compensation that you mentioned, are they still running ahead or in line with loss trend?","Dominic Addesso","Yes. I think it was around 8% or 9%, or 7%. 8% for the first nine months of the year.","Meyer Shields - KBW","And lastly, I guess this is probably for, Craig, when I look at Mt. Logan and sort of compare the reported underwriting profit to the net loss attributable to non-controlling interests, it looks like a higher percentage of the underwriting profits went to the investors than in past quarters. Is there a good way of modeling that going forward?","Craig Howie","Well, I think as Dom mentioned before, it's not necessarily a material number to us yet, but it is seasonal, because of the property cat losses. So we would expect after we get through the season that you may see some additional results flow into Everest, profit commissions things like that, that would flow-through. But right now, it's more seasonal.","Dominic Addesso","It also is due to us, the initial investment that Everest put in, and then growth of third-party money. So the share of Mt. Logan is higher to external investors.","Meyer Shields - KBW","Where is it right now?","Craig Howie","We were 9 of 50.","Dominic Addesso","And remember, we were a higher percentage of that in the early days. And of course, as we attracted more funds, that gets diluted obviously, the percentage gets diluted.","Craig Howie","Initially, we were 50 of 250, and now we're 50 of over 400.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Elizabeth Farrell","We would like to thank everybody for participating in the call. And if for some reason, we are not able to get your question answered, please feel free to give us a call. Thanks.","Dominic Addesso","Thank you all very much.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"8798":["Everest Re Group Ltd.

My colleagues will provide the details on our results, but before they do, I want to point out a few important insights.","The first relates to top line growth. Within the overall increases in gross written premium, there are classes of business being reduced, where the rates are inadequate, terms and conditions are challenged or, in some cases, the customers no longer desire to cover in whole or part. Nevertheless, given current market conditions, along with our meaningful capacity and experienced underwriting teams, Everest is seeing an increasing number of profitable opportunities with the result and increase in business overall. We are proud of the market position that we have built and appreciate the preferred status we have in the market with customers and intermediaries. Second is the underlying performance of our business. We have detailed the change in business mix over the past few years and the impact on the loss and acquisition cost ratios. I note that this quarter, the attritional accident year loss ratio of 59.2% is very consistent with the result for the full year 2018. This is noteworthy for two reasons. First is that our loss selections do not yet reflect any underwriting actions taken, which is typically recognized as improvements are realized. And second, the earned premium in this quarter still reflects a good portion of business at 2018 rates. Rate increases achieved at January 1 and April 1 reinsurance renewals and any further rate increases will be earned throughout the year providing additional improvement to the attritional results.","Turning to rates, although it is by no means a traditional hard market, I am encouraged by how the industry is responding to loss activity and trends. While capacity is available, there is a discipline emerging from both balance sheet and third-party capital for cat-related business, in addition to pricing, improving terms and conditions which are essentially equivalent to rate improvement, are also gaining traction. Property pricing has been the most responsive. Although it has taken 2 years of losses to bring change to the underwriting and pricing of the most challenging areas, notably wildfire and the AOB and LAE issues in Florida. Beyond property, the pricing momentum is mixed. Classes of business where profitability is challenged are getting some much needed rate. There is also a renewed discipline around other classes, including commercial auto and professional liability, also reflective of poor results. Other sectors, including energy and excess casualty, are firming, in line with the recognition of advancing loss costs trends and a market that is tightening. And finally, the discipline in London precipitated by tightening capacity at Lloyds and the increase in migration of business from the admitted markets to the E&S space is adding momentum to an improving market. I\u2019m not declaring victory by any stretch, but it is encouraging to see both the primary and reinsurance markets demonstrating a rational response to the issues at hand.","Everest is in a fantastic position to capitalize on this improving market due to our fundamental strengths. Our focus on balance sheet strength and financial security is the starting point. The bedrock of our business is a promise to pay, and to that end, we have kept ample levels of capital, low financial leverage and strong ratings. Over the long term, I am confident that shareholders have benefited from this conservatism as it has allowed Everest to access the best business even during times of market stress that otherwise could have gone elsewhere. Everest also has tremendous experience and long-standing relationships with the most important trading partners around the world. We have worked with some customers for over 40 years, and as a result, it\u2019s difficult to replicate highly diversified book of profitable business. And finally, Everest has and will continue to have a strategic focus on long-term performance with a willingness to absorb volatility over the short term. In an improving market, our capacity, relationships and long-term focus are a very powerful combination.","One final thought worth highlighting is that Everest is increasingly known as a market leader within the Specialty Insurance segment. The RIMS conference this year certainly spoke to that dynamic. Last year, Everest Insurance achieved excellent growth and underwriting results. And here, in the first quarter, accident year results are likely better than market expectations and many of our specialty insurance peers. While our insurance operations may get overlooked by investors sitting alongside one of the largest and premier reinsurance franchises in the world, the reality is that our insurance group is trending to end the year at record profits and will likely end the year ahead of many of its peers. That is both a size and profit common. I urge you to run the comps and include it\u2019s fair share of investment income.","Although Everest is clearly one entity, we have two distinct yet complementary businesses, and I encourage you to look at the value of each individually and the resultant sum of the parts. While both reinsurance and insurance benefit from being part of a larger group and the many synergies they create, they each have a great potential and value on their own and into the future.","With that, I turn the call over to Craig.","Craig Howie","Thank you, Dom and good morning everyone. Everest had a solid quarter of earnings, with net income of $349 million for the first quarter of 2019. This compares to net income of $210 million for the first quarter of 2018. The 2019 result represents an annualized net income return on equity of 17%. Net income included $74 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $19 million of capital losses in the first quarter last year. The 2019 capital gains were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on the public equity portfolio. After-tax operating income for the first quarter was $282 million compared to $220 million in 2018. This represents an annualized operating return on equity of 14%. These results were driven by strong underwriting results across the group, stable investment income and lower catastrophe losses compared to the first quarter last year. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $196 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $108 million in the same period last year.","In the first quarter of 2019, Everest saw $25 million of catastrophe losses related to flooding in Australia compared to $100 million of catastrophe losses reported during the first quarter of 2018. Overall, our prior year catastrophe loss estimates continue to hold. We revised the ultimate loss estimates by event and by segment with no change in the overall loss estimates. Estimated net favorable prior year catastrophe development was offset by $24 million of adverse catastrophe development on the third quarter 2018 Japan loss events. No other events breached our $10 million catastrophe threshold in the first quarter of 2019. Therefore, any losses arising from these events were covered in our attritional loss estimates, which include a load for estimates less than $10 million.","The overall current year attritional combined ratio was 87.4%, up slightly from 87.1% in the first quarter of 2018. The attritional loss ratio remained relatively flat at 59.2%, in line with Dom\u2019s earlier comments, while the commission ratio of 22.5% was up slightly compared to the same period last year, primarily due to changes in business mix and contention commission adjustments in the reinsurance segment. The group expense ratio remains low at 5.7% and was lower than prior year due to the increase in earned premium. Our reported combined ratio of 88.7% was lower than first quarter last year, primarily due to the lower reported catastrophe losses in 2019.","For investments, pre-tax investment income was $141 million for the quarter. This was based on our $19 billion investment portfolio, a new record for Everest. Investment income was 2% above the first quarter of last year. This result was primarily driven by the increase from the investment grade fixed income portfolio, which had a higher asset base this year. This was partially offset by lower limited partnership income. Since some partnerships report income on a quarter lag, this quarter\u2019s results reflected the poor equity market performance of the 2018 fourth quarter. We would expect there to be improvement in the limited partnership income going forward if the public equity market trading conditions continue to improve in 2019. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3%, flat compared to 1 year ago. However, both investment grade and alternative fixed income yields were up year-over-year.","On income taxes, the 12.5% effective tax rate on operating income was close to the 13% tax rate we expect for the full year. Positive cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $460 million for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $196 million in 2018. The increase reflects a lower level of paid catastrophe losses in 2019 compared to 2018. Shareholders\u2019 equity for the group was $8.4 billion at the end of the first quarter, up $523 million or 7% compared to year-end 2018. The increase in shareholders\u2019 equity since year-end 2018 is primarily attributable to $349 million of net income and the sharp recovery in a fair value of the investment portfolio, partially offset by capital returned through $57 million of dividends paid and $60 million of share buybacks in the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, we purchased another $9 million of shares after the close of the quarter, for a total of $25 million year-to-date. Everest continues to maintain a very strong capital position with low debt leverage and high liquidity in our investment portfolio, in addition to our robust cash flow.","As Dom mentioned, the strength of our balance sheet is critical to the success of our business. An attestation to this is the affirmation of our A.M. Best A+ superior rating announced last week. Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations.","John Doucette","Thank you, Craig. Good morning. We are pleased to report a robust underwriting profit and solid premium growth for the Everest Reinsurance Division during the first quarter of 2019. Our business remains well-positioned for the current market and for what we see as the evolving trends over the near-term. While the improving market that is emerging today is not an across-the-board rate lift as we may have seen in years gone by, it nevertheless has the potential to be meaningful and sustainable. And this environment favors companies such as Everest, who have the breadth, depth, flexibility, size and innovation to capture evolving opportunities across all classes of business and territories. Everest\u2019s success in the current market is based on these fundamental strengths: a global brand and platform; long-standing, broad relationships with clients and brokers built up over the last four decades by deeply experienced underwriting teams around the world; meaningful capacity; diversified capital sources; and a strong balance sheet.","This quarter, we continued to see the value of partnership with clients, where the reinsurance relationship is strategic for all involved. As our clients have seen pockets of capacity in certain areas reduced, they increasingly turn to Everest to solve their risk and capital needs. Our ability to withstand market stress and continue to provide meaningful, stable capacity over 45 years is of great value to our customers and their intermediaries. Reflecting on the latest two major renewals, January 1 and April 1, we are encouraged with the rate change trend in the market. While not a hard market by historical standards, increasing evidence of stabilization on both underlying business and reinsurance business continues. The market has been reconsidering rates on key parallels and is now painfully aware of the risks embedded in historically less conspicuous parallels such as wildfire. The result is a market requiring rate increases and improved terms and conditions on loss-affected business while maintaining generally stable to increasing prices in non-loss affected programs.","Overall reinsurance market capacity remains tight as both traditional and alternative capital are recalibrating their assumptions on loss costs, exposures, risk assessment and various risk perils, particularly given the amount of catastrophe losses over the last 2 years. And they are becoming more selective as to who they will back and the terms and conditions with which they deploy capacity, which is a positive step in the evolution of the overall reinsurance market. The knock-on effect to non-cat lines is also noteworthy. The market\u2019s broad recognition that cat-exposed profit can no longer subsidize underperforming treaties and other lines of business is resulting in actions on terms, conditions and underlying rates if they have been inadequate on a standalone basis. At the same time, there is increased demand as our customers re-underwrite their primary books, apply rate increases and seek to manage their net exposure. Outside of traditional P&C classes, we also find the outlook on our mortgage business robust and continue to see a long runway in the mortgage space for us to deploy capacity profitably in the current forms as well as in new products, structures and distribution sources.","Now for a review of our quarterly results. For the reinsurance division overall, we wrote $1.5 billion of gross premium and reported an 86.5% combined ratio. Premiums were up 9% on a constant dollar basis year-on-year, with casualty as strong contributor to the growth. Original casualty rates have seen pockets of improvement, with reinsurance terms and pricing stable and, in some cases, increasing. Lower catastrophe losses helped drive an improved reinsurance division underwriting profit of $177 million, and our overall attritional loss ratio was about flat at 84.7% despite a larger percentage of the earned premium coming from pro rata business, which typically runs to a higher attritional loss ratio. Growth was strongest in our U.S. operations, up 19%, largely due to proportional casualty treaties predominantly written in 2018. The overall combined ratio was stable, with our attritional loss ratio down slightly and the attritional combined ratio up 3 points mainly due to commissions, increasing from the greater mix of pro rata business.","The international operations also exhibited strong growth, with premiums up 13% on a constant dollar basis. Increased demand for Facultative reinsurance was a large contributor to the quarter\u2019s growth. And dislocation of capacity in London and other markets improved the opportunities for Everest in many international territories. Results in the international reinsurance segment were impacted by $25 million of loss from the Townsville monsoon and flooding in Australia as well as from increased loss estimates related to the third quarter 2018 Japanese loss events. However, our attritional loss ratio was flat at 53%, and our attritional combined ratio was down 1 point to 78.6%.","The Bermuda operations had a decrease in gross premium, dropping 9% on a constant dollar basis. However, the year-over-year comparison was affected by premium recognition timing as the first quarter 2018 premiums were bolstered by the timing of premium reported on certain large accounts. Our London and Dublin operations included in this segment showed growth, benefiting from the dislocation in new markets. Profitability metrics are skewed due to some large shifts in prior period cat reserve to other reinsurance segments. Our attritional loss ratio of 61.6% was up 2.5 points due to an increase in casualty and specialty writings. However, our attritional combined ratio of 87.4% improved slightly.","In summary, the first quarter was a solid start to the year for our reinsurance operations, and we remain well-positioned to capture rate improvements due to recent loss activity and overall favorable underlying market trend.","Thank you. And now I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations.","Jonathan Zaffino","Thanks, John and good morning. Our insurance operations are likewise pleased to report a strong start of the year. Our first quarter performance was excellent as measured across several metrics, most importantly the significant increase in underwriting profitability. This solid first quarter profit continued the trend we have demonstrated over the past 2 years, notably by delivering an underwriting profit in eight of the last nine quarters.","Underlying growth was excellent in the quarter, and some of the heavier impacts of non-renewal activity lessened, although have not completely diminished. The Everest global insurance operations produced gross written premium of $595 million for the quarter, an 18% increase over the first quarter of 2018 and a 37% increase over the same period in 2017. As we have over the past 4 years, we continue to pursue thoughtful and disciplined growth within our chosen product segment across the entirety of our global operations. This is the strongest first quarter production we have experienced in our history, and it marks the 17th consecutive quarter of top line growth across a diversified palate of high-value product areas.","Most importantly in the quarter, the solid growth, combined with outstanding execution, resulted in underwriting profit of $19 million, a 50% increase over the $13 million of underwriting profit in the first quarter of 2018 and a nearly fourfold increase over the first quarter of 2017. Further, our attritional loss in LAE ratio improved 1.1 points to 65%, reflecting the continued migration toward the higher value and diversified specialty books of business and the earned premium impact of these businesses into our results. The evidence shows that our confidence in pursuing the organic build of a world-class specialty diversified insurance organization has been justified. As we have reported on prior calls, our leadership and underwriting teams across the globe continue to execute well on their individual and collective mandates, particularly during times such as these where we are experiencing transitioning markets. Our teams remain focused on our opportunity set, measured by our robust submission flows across lines of business, continues to grow, something I\u2019ll touch on later. We look forward to build on this momentum throughout the year.","Turning to the financial highlights, the global insurance operations produced $595 million in gross written premium in the first quarter, an increase of $90 million or 18% over first quarter 2018 again evidence of our growing relevance in the specialty insurance market. As in prior quarters, contributions remained quite balanced across the diverse group of property and casualty and accident and health underwriting divisions within our global insurance operations. In fact, aside from our program operation, Everest Underwriting Partners, where we\u2019ve taken underwriting actions in pursuit of improved profitability, every other major business segment in the Everest Insurance portfolio delivered growth above 15% over first quarter of 2018.","Turning to net premiums, for the first quarter of 2019, net premiums written also grew by 18% to $457 million while net earned premium grew by $32 million or 8% to $425 million. Our reported GAAP combined ratio for the quarter was 95.6%, a solid improvement of 1.2 points over first quarter 2018 and nearly 3 points improved over first quarter 2017. The attritional combined ratio was also 95.6% in the quarter, a 2.4-point improvement over the first quarter 2018, attritional combined of 98% and an 80-basis point improvement over the full year 2018 attritional combined of 96.5%.","The overall GAAP loss ratio for the first quarter of 2019 was 65%, effectively flat as compared to last year\u2019s 64.9%. The first quarter of 2019 attritional loss ratio ex cat improved further by 1.1 points over the first quarter of 2018 and a further 3.2-point improvement over first quarter 2017 results. As anticipated and discussed on prior calls, the downward drift on the attritional loss ratio continues. This is a result of an improved mix of business, the growing benefit from the many new businesses launched, the improving underlying rate dynamics and the strategic underwriting actions of the past 4 years.","Our expense ratio for the quarter was 30.6%, an improvement of 1.3 points over the prior year period. This is in line with our full year 2018 expense ratio of 30.3%. The first quarter 2019 expense ratio remains very competitive in the specialty insurance market and reflects stabilization around the 30% mark regardless of continued significant investment and talent, new products, new geographies and new technologies.","We continue to recruit and retain the best talent in the industry and have invested in modern office locations to assist our colleagues in serving our customers in their local geographies. To support our talented employees and to enhance our client value proposition, we have committed to a robust program of IT investments in both traditional infrastructure and a variety of cutting-edge and innovative technologies. It is through the hard work of colleagues and their tireless commitment to execution that we have been able to pair this investment and growth with an industry-leading expense ratio.","I\u2019ll turn now to the market conditions, which are clearly painting a picture of an evolving market. One of the barometers used to draw this conclusion is our submission flows in the quarter, which amounted to our third highest on record. This was particularly acute in our various wholesale dedicated businesses, where submission activity is significantly increasing month-to-month.","As for underlying rates, we largely experienced an improving Property and casualty and accident and health pricing picture across the organization, a trend that has continued from last year. The exception has been workers\u2019 compensation, where rates remained under pressure. However, our view of profitability within the line remains positive. Excluding workers\u2019 compensation, overall property and casualty renewal premium change, which includes exposure change, was 6.9% in the quarter. Pure rate change on the same basis increased by 5.5% in the quarter. Virtually, all lines showed quarterly improvement led by commercial auto, property and umbrella excess. Encouragingly, financial lines globally also showed strengthening, building on a trend that began in the last 2 quarters of 2018. This is the highest aggregate rate change we have seen in roughly 5 years.","Finally, and this is something that we pay close attention to, terms and conditions also point to improvement, particularly in the property and excess casualty markets. The bottom line for us is that we are focused on achieving adequate technical pricing across our portfolio and are working diligently toward that objective every day. In conclusion, the first quarter 2019 showed continued progress on our journey, along with solid results. Our vision of building a leading specialty diversified insurance company has become a reality. We have demonstrated that our strategy is sound and, more importantly, that we can execute on that strategy as evidenced by our consistent underwriting profitability across 8 of the last 9 quarters.","More importantly, we believe we are positioned with the right capabilities, products and, of course, talent to service our customers in this evolving market. We look forward to continuing our positive momentum and reporting back to you next quarter.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Jonathan for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Amit Kumar with The Buckingham Research Group.","Amit Kumar","Thanks and good morning. Just maybe a few questions. The first question is probably for Dom. In the opening remarks, you talked about how the 59.2% was obviously did not reflect some of the things we talked about. I was curious, and maybe this, ties to ties into insurance and reinsurance, how should we think about what would be sort of a normalized fully adjusted number if all the pluses and minuses were to have flown through the numbers?","Dom Addesso","Amit, we don\u2019t forecast earnings or try to give you any specific guidance on the numbers. In large part, that\u2019s the job of you and many others. I think what we\u2019re trying to suggest is that our first quarter numbers, not surprisingly, would be consistent with our 2018 loss picks on an attritional basis. And I think what we\u2019re also trying to suggest is that we\u2019ve got ahead of us rate increases that were already some of which was came through in \u201818. We\u2019ve got rate increases coming January 1 and April renewals, and then of course, highly anticipated June account.","So, I think what we\u2019re trying to suggest is that there should be improvement in that number. And that\u2019s somewhat, of course, dependent upon what the level of rate increases are, which we don\u2019t try to publicly prognosticate on a specific level of rate increase. So you\u2019re on your own.","Amit Kumar","No, that\u2019s a fair point. I was probably trying to come up with the Q4 comments and back into maybe 2 or 3 points of improvement. The other question I had was the discussion on reinsurance pricing and the upcoming 6\/1 renewal. The 6\/1 reinsurance premiums have [obviously seen a growth] substantially for the Q2 2018 versus Q2 2017. I was curious, based on how you\u2019re thinking about capital deployment, is it going to be more about risk selection at 6 at the upcoming renewal and, net-net, your size of the book remains mostly unchanged? Or how should we think about that?","Dom Addesso","Well, that of course, Amit, is somewhat dependent upon what\u2019s presented to us at 6\/1. As we\u2019ve said, we certainly would anticipate some meaningful rate activity and terms and conditions, which are improving, which essentially is rate. But naturally, that will vary by client. So, in some cases, the level of rate activity will vary by client, I guess is where I\u2019ll try to leave that.","Our activity at 1\/1 reflected some reduction in our exposure, as you could see from our PML\u2019s disclosures. And that was, of course, due to the fact that we did not achieve the level of rate increase that we felt was necessary. And on a risk-adjusted basis, some of the accounts were non-renewed. Whether or not that present itself in the same way at 6\/1, not very likely. We certainly anticipate 6\/1 will be much stronger than what we saw at 1\/1.","And what we saw at 4\/1, by the way, were meaningful rate increases. And in fact, Japan was an area, for example, where we had pulled back in more recent times due to risk-adjusted pricing going down, but we actually increased slightly our participation in Japan at 4\/1. So, it\u2019s a mixed bag. It\u2019ll be dependent upon what the market opportunities present to us. But I don\u2019t know that you\u2019ll necessary, see us meaningfully increase our exposure.","Amit Kumar","That\u2019s a fair point. The final question might be for Craig or John. The $37 million positive movement in the catastrophes in the U.S. reinsurance, where is that from?","Craig Howie","So, Amit, we go through a comprehensive approach this is Craig to review our cat reserves on a current year basis but also in prior years as well. And we go through them. We look at each of them. However, we reserve on a group-level basis, not a segment-level basis.","These events do not always fit neatly into a segment because the exposure can be written from multiple segments. We tend to react quickly to any adverse development, as you saw from the Japan loss events from 2018 that we took a charge for, but we take our time to react to any favorable development until that position becomes more mature.","So, you may see movements between segments, but it\u2019s really done at an overall level.","Amit Kumar","Okay. So that $37 million is from several pluses and minuses, I think is what you\u2019re saying versus one single event?","Craig Howie","Correct.","Amit Kumar","Got it okay I will stop here thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.","Craig Howie","Thank you, Amit.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi good morning. My first question, I was hoping to spend a little bit more time on the forward pricing environment. I recognize we\u2019re still on discussions for the midyear renewals. But given what we\u2019ve seen in the industry with Irma and the development with Irma, I mean can you give us a sense what kind of price increases would you need to see for this to be a successful renewal versus prices? If we get closer to 6\/1 and prices fall short of expectations, is there a certain bar where Everest is going to walk away if they\u2019re not able to recoup price increases after 2 successive years of losses?","Dom Addesso","So, Elyse, I\u2019m going to ask John to comment John Doucette to comment, but let me just say that consistent with what I\u2019ve said before is that we try not to prognosticate where the rate increases will be going and frankly where they even need to be.","It varies by client, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, depending upon client experience, other relationships, risk-adjusted returns, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. And frankly, it doesn\u2019t really do us any service to be trying to put a specific number or bar on it. I think it probably telegraphs an inconsistent message or an incorrect message to The Street.","And frankly, it perhaps depending on the client relationship, it could be the inappropriate target for a specific client. So, it doesn\u2019t really serve our purpose to be putting a benchmark or drawing a line in the sand, so to speak, as you described. But John, do you have any further...","John Doucette","Yes, and thanks, Dom. Elyse, thanks for the question. First, I do want to highlight that there\u2019s actually been 3 years of hurricanes hitting Florida, not 2, with Matthew, Irma and Michael. And I think there\u2019s been a lot of movement there, and I think there\u2019s been \u2013 as Dom said, as we look at this, we need to achieve the rates that we expect at, and that will vary by client. That will vary by product. That will vary by attachment. But we fully intend to differentiate the clients in terms of how they have performed with their losses, with their LAE, with AOB, with their loss creep, et cetera. So that will all factor in.","We clearly see capacity tight as we head into the market both as I touched on in my earlier comments, both on the traditional and in the alternative space for a variety of reasons due to some of the aforementioned reasons, but also just the reload the alternative capital and the lack of reload.","So, a couple of other points, that we continue to look to where we want to allocate capacity and not just property that\u2019s not just by a client in Florida. And we are allocating more capacity to global clients, where obviously as Jon Zaffino articulated, deploying more capital and capacity on the insurance space. We\u2019re seeing increasing opportunities on the casualty reinsurance space and, as I said, on the mortgage space. So, all of that factors into a higher required return threshold for where we are headed into our Florida business. We don\u2019t predict rates, but we think it\u2019s going to be a very, very late renewal, potentially messy. And ultimately, we think it\u2019ll be profitable for us.","Dom Addesso","The only thing I\u2019d add to add, Elyse, is that while it\u2019s maybe precisely on point to your question, hopefully this helps. I did describe earlier that we\u2019ve increased our participation in the Japan market. And there, we\u2019re seeing rate increases of 20% to 30%. So maybe that gives you some notion of our appetite and maybe perhaps what\u2019s needed generally.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then in terms of your Jebi development in the quarter, so if we look at where your initial loss sat, and we\u2019ve seen a lot of development across the industry, and so the development that we\u2019ve seen from you guys, smaller percentage of your initial loss, is there a difference in how you attach on treaties there? Or maybe the level of insured losses you\u2019ve used when you set up the reserve for the losses in the third quarter of last year? Just any guidance there that we should think about in terms of the development on Jebi?","Dom Addesso","So, we believe that last year, when we established that reserve, we were at the high above frankly, we\u2019re way above where the industry estimates were at the time. So that obviously kept us in good stead as well as the fact that we\u2019ve essentially when you look at the losses in Asia, we\u2019re looking at them as a group of losses as with respect to that marketplace. So, I think all of those factors combined enabled us to have that managed appropriately.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. My last....","Dom Addesso","Give me one second. I think maybe John Doucette...","John Doucette","Yes, and I just want to give a little bit of a frame of our market share in Japan. So, if you think back since over many years, we had post, the Tohoku earthquake substantial rate increases, and we significantly increased our book of business then. And then over the last several years, there had been a downward pressure on the rates. And we, accordingly, kind of turned our books each year a little bit for the worst performing accounts, and we also were moving up capacity, which I think is reflective of where we find ourselves for the Japanese book overall.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then my last question was on the expense ratio. It was up a little bit year-over-year. And then if I look within the U.S. reinsurance segment, you saw an uptick a decent amount uptick in the commission and brokerage ratio from where you\u2019ve been trading. Is there something going on there that we should think about in terms of modeling going forward?","Craig Howie","So, Elyse, this is Craig. Expenses year-over-year, one of the things that you saw at year-end, was variable pay expenses, where we\u2019re taking down at the end of last year, predominantly due to the profitability of the book. Those are back in normal, ranges for this year overall, but what you\u2019re seeing is just a slight uptick in expense dollars. But overall, the expense ratio is staying at a low level of 5.7% overall.","John Doucette","Yes, and Elyse, this is John. I just want to add a little more color on the mix change. So, we also have been talking about increasing our casualty book of business overall, increasing our pro rata business. And at 1\/1, we took action based on rates tied to our property retro and aggregate retro portfolio, and that decreased. The combination of those, all those, do have or did have an impact on the attritional combined ratio.","Dom Addesso","And the expense ratio, of course, is...","Craig Howie","Is down year-over-year.","Dom Addesso","Is down over year. But the commission ratio had a and I think you referenced the U.S. reinsurance, that had a contingent commission adjustment in the first quarter, a true-up, if you will, due to the mortgage book.","Elyse Greenspan","And how much was that true-up?","Craig Howie","Overall, it relates to a bunch of things. It relates to contingent commission and the mortgage true-up, but it\u2019s also relates to the business mix that we had with more pro rata business coming on the books that John just mentioned.","John Doucette","And different classes of business that specifically have contingent commissions in them.","Dom Addesso","So, we don\u2019t have one specific number for the mortgage adjustment.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you for all the color.","Dom Addesso","Thank you, Elyse.","Craig Howie","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.","Yaron Kinar","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I guess this question is a multi-part question. So, first, just looking at the total reinsurance underlying attritional combined ratio of 87.4%, it just seems a little bit lower than the roughly 87% number that I think we had run rated last quarter. So, other than maybe contingent commissions or a couple of other minor \u2013 are there any major drivers there that, that would have resulted in this significant improvement quarter-to-quarter?","John Doucette","No, I mean, we continue to deploy more capacity into the mortgage space, which we think has a robust risk reward characteristic. And as you may recall, the mortgage book are basically multi-year deal. They\u2019re over several years. So, deals from 3 years ago were still getting earned premium, 2 years ago, et cetera, 1 year ago, as well as writing new premium. That certainly has the directional impact of improving the attritional combined ratio given the potential profitability in the mortgage portfolio.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Dom, from your earlier comments, it sounds like between the underwriting actions that you\u2019ve taken and has been implemented starting in January and the rate increases that you\u2019ve been seeing, you are expecting an overall improvement. So basically, you are expecting that rates will be an excess of loss trends. Is that kind of broadly true? Are there lines of business or geographies where you actually don\u2019t see that to be the case?","Dom Addesso","Not in any meaningful way. I think generally \u2013 and that\u2019s primarily because in any particular class of business in a particular geography, and of course, this can get pretty minute. But if that were the case then you\u2019d be seeing us take capacity move it away from those from that sector. I\u2019m not sure that I could really highlight anything that\u2019s moving in the wrong direction.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. And then I guess one last quick one. I think the increase in losses from Japan is for all 3 industry events, so Jebi, Trami and then the flood losses. Would you be able to break that out?","Dom Addesso","We do not break that out.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. But if I take the 3 industry events together, it would seem like you are in the 80 basis point to 90 basis point market share of those 3 losses based on current estimates. Is that roughly how you\u2019re seeing it?","Craig Howie","Roughly 1%.","Yaron Kinar","Roughly 1%, okay. Thank you very much.","Dom Addesso","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.","Ryan Tunis","Hey thanks. Just looking for a little bit more color on the texture behind the Japan book now at renewals maybe in terms of premium size, how much of that is quota share? What\u2019s the weighting between the wind and the quake and how much of that \u2013 if it\u2019s excess of loss is aggregate or occurrence?","John Doucette","Good morning, Ryan, this is John. So, our Japan book is about $60 million \u2013 $50 million to $60 million, up slightly this year over prior years. The mix would be \u2013 I don\u2019t have that in front of us. The mix would be mostly excess of loss business and that\u2019s mostly property. There\u2019s some other surety, fidelity and some other smaller programs that we write for a lot of the major clients.","Ryan Tunis","Thank you. And then a follow-up for Dom, going back to the prepared remarks about \u2013 thinking about these 2 businesses from a similar parts context. I\u2019m just curious, like what is your ROE outlook on \u2013 where the primary insurance business is today and where the reinsurance business is?","Dom Addesso","Well, first of all, our \u2013 we would certainly target an ROE in the double-digits. Clearly, we would expect a higher ROE out of our reinsurance business and the insurance business given the volatility there. A couple of 100 basis point difference, but that\u2019s about as specific as I think I\u2019d want to get without giving you a specific number, which would then, of course, translate into an earnings projection.","Ryan Tunis","Fair enough. Thanks.","Dom Addesso","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Joshua Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua Shanker","Yes, good morning, everybody.","Dom Addesso","Good morning.","Joshua Shanker","I want to talk a little bit about pricing, obviously, both sides of the markets. First of all, in terms of the rate increases on the primary inside and it\u2019s not just for you, but others, to what extent are broadly discussed industry price increases going to get mitigated by higher outwards reinsurance costs, which you guys will benefit from? And two, in absence of property pricing being up, I\u2019m sure in your non-property lines, you had all seen price increases, but would it be business as usual or is there really something palpable going on outside of the property-driven pricing markets?","Jonathan Zaffino","Good morning, Josh, this is Jon. Let me take that from the primary side. First and foremost, I don\u2019t see this as a reinsurance-driven pricing change. I think some of the underlying fundamental dynamics are such that there are a number of areas that just simply needed to correct the rate action. So, we\u2019re seeing that across several lines, some of which I mentioned in my script, we\u2019re actually seeing some of the momentum actually built, which is \u2013 which fundamentally I think is creating a pretty interesting dynamic and outlook.","So, we anticipate that to continue as the year moves on and we\u2019re seeing it outside of property. We mentioned the commercial auto, not a new story obviously. But as I mentioned earlier, in the financial lines, you\u2019re starting to see particularly in some of the management liability areas, public company D&O, certainly primary layers, you\u2019re starting to see increased rate of change happening there in terms of rate action. So, we just see it\u2019s sort of a broad-based move, but a lot of it being driven by underlying fundamentals versus kind of a top-down view.","Joshua Shanker","And even though it\u2019s not being driven by the reinsurance side, are your clients going to see some of their rate-driven margin expansion curtailed by higher outwards reinsurance costs?","Dom Addesso","Well, there would be \u2013 we would expect the industry \u2013 the primary industry to obviously realize some of the reinsurance rate increases. I\u2019m not so sure that, that would translate into margin compression on their end. I think their rate levels, clearly, the reinsurance spend is only a portion of their gross written premium. But I think the economics are such that I wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect any compression for their margin because of increased reinsurance pricing.","Joshua Shanker","Fair enough.","Jonathan Zaffino","And I think \u2013 and John Doucette can speak more to this, but I \u2013 everyone buys differently. So, I think it\u2019s a very difficult translation of one-to-one. So, I don\u2019t know, John, if you want to comment on the demand side.","John Doucette","Yes. What we\u2019re clearly seeing a lot of our clients, reinsurance clients, looking to grow \u2013 to buy more frankly, grow their reinsurance treaties and some of them are property-driven for volatility. Interestingly, we\u2019re still seeing a lot of demand on the casualty side of the house. And that is resulting in \u2013 so to your \u2013 to the original question, we\u2019re still seeing non-property rate improvement with improved terms and conditions and lower ceding commissions on the casualty, the broader casualty part. And then we\u2019re also seeing some pick-up in some of the specialty reinsurance areas, aviation, marine, et cetera. We\u2019re seeing some lift, some of that\u2019s really loss-driven. So, we\u2019re seeing some opportunities there that we wouldn\u2019t have found attractive in prior years, but at a better pricing, we could put more capacity to work there.","Dom Addesso","The one area, Josh, where you may see some of which you\u2019re suggesting could be in Florida with some of the smaller companies, where they may feel a little bit of pressure from rising reinsurance costs, but that would be the only spot where I think that would potentially go through.","Joshua Shanker","Alright, well, thank you for the answers.","Dom Addesso","Thank you, Josh.","John Doucette","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields","Thanks. I was hoping you could give us an \u2013 your views on the sophistication of the Japanese catastrophe models compared to the ones we\u2019ve got for the Southeastern United States?","John Doucette","So, let\u2019s start with first, all models are wrong. And every time a loss happens, some of the weaknesses get demonstrated and then there\u2019s kind of a look back and a retooling back to cover the losses that happened. And I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why we take a pretty holistic view on \u2013 across the whole board and really try to think about it on a first principle basis and so not just be model-driven. So, our \u2013 I think the data is getting better over time overall, but it\u2019s still not nearly as good in a lot of international areas as it is in the U.S., that would include Japan. But it has gotten a lot better over the last several years and the models therefore are also better.","Meyer Shields","No, great. Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. Second question, I think it\u2019s \u2013 my impression at least is that, you tend to see reinsurance buyers or really all insurers get somewhat more optimistic in their loss picks during soft markets and then that reverses when rates rise. Can you talk about how you sort of manage against that in the reinsurance book?","Dom Addesso","Well, I mean, it\u2019s an interesting observation, and, of course, selecting an ELR and knowing the true cause of business, cost of goods sold in this business is something that you never really know for years into the future. So, you never really know accurately your cost of goods sold and it\u2019s always a challenge. So, the best way to deal with that is to use all the tools that are available to you, stay true to your process, be conservative and disciplined around how you establish loss reserves and just collect all the data you can.","And I think what we\u2019ve shown and demonstrated is that in our attritional book, we have a fairly good track record over the last half a dozen years or so of reasonably reserving through various market cycles. But look it\u2019s never an exact science and it\u2019s all about being presenting the fair financial picture, which we think we\u2019ve done. John?","John Doucette","Just to add a little more color, we also benefit \u2013 and this is where I think data and experience with clients, clients\u2019 business in different territories, I mean, we write this business for over 45 years. We write in basically all P&C lines in all territories and have traded with 70% of our clients for decades now. And that\u2019s incredibly helpful because we can pull up prior year submissions. We can pull up similar clients and we can look and build.","So, I think being \u2013 having a global footprint for a long period of time gives us a very strong insight into what we think the market really is, the loss pick really is and the rating environment really is, which I think has helped us time and time again being in that favorable position to be able to execute on that and not just rely specifically on what a specific client information tells us, but to be able to pull in across kind of our institutional knowledge on actuarial pricing and trends \u2013 loss trends and whatnot.","Dom Addesso","And to be specific about our process and I know we\u2019ve mentioned this from time to time, what we do in our process is that after the last reserve study and this will apply to every class of business, we then apply to that last reserve study selection, we apply what\u2019s happening with rates. So, if there are rate decreases going on in the marketplace, we will take the last reserve study pick and adjust it downward or upward, I\u2019m sorry, for any rate decreases and the opposite if there are rate increases going on. So, that\u2019s how we deal with it specific to our company.","Meyer Shields","Okay. That was very thorough and helpful. Thank you.","Dom Addesso","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith","Yes, thanks. Most of my questions have been asked, but just one quick question here. John, what do you think the impact of the AOB legislation in Florida is going to have on just the pricing environment to the kind of loss cost stuff going forward?","John Doucette","Yes, it\u2019s a great question. Again, we try to absorb all the information out there. We don\u2019t really try to make specific predictions on what this is going to do or what that is going to do in a while. I\u2019ll go back to 3 years of hurricanes hitting Florida, a lot of capacity, the loss creep that we did see, I think capacity is tight, as Dom alluded to, a lot of the reinsurance clients there, their reinsurance programs are capital for them, and I think they need to be reflective of the not-so-great experience over the last couple of years. We certainly hope and we think it\u2019s a positive move that the Florida legislature is addressing this issue. So, hopefully, that\u2019ll make an overall better healthier market in the long-term.","Brian Meredith","I guess most specifically, do the quota shares actually done in Florida, do you think it\u2019ll have any impact on pricing then or are you going to kind of just wait and see what happens call it a year from now?","John Doucette","I think there could be \u2013 I think \u2013 I don\u2019t know if your question was insurance pricing, the original pricing or reinsurance pricing.","Brian Meredith","Yes.","John Doucette","I think it\u2019s going to be \u2013 I\u2019m \u2013 there\u2019s going to be directional movements up and down on all that stuff. But again, I think the capacity is tighter at this renewal.","Brian Meredith","Great. Thank you.","Dom Addesso","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions in the queue.","Dom Addesso","Good. I\u2019ll just sum up here. Thank you for joining this morning and for your questions and discussion. Certainly, we\u2019re off to a good start for the year, but more important is what is likely to unfold as the year progresses. And I think as you have heard from us and other market participants the rate outlook is quite positive. This along with our many business initiatives and expansion opportunities causes us to be very optimistic about our future. So, I look forward to interacting with many of you in the weeks ahead and have a good day. Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

On the call today are Dom Addesso, the Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, President and CEO of Insurance Operations.","Before we begin, please note, the Company\u2019s SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, statements made during today\u2019s call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. Actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. The SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements.","Now, let me turn the call over to Dom Addesso.","Dominic Addesso","Thank you. Good morning. Last night, we released earnings per share of $5.02 for the third quarter. Despite the number of catastrophes for the industry in the quarter, this turned out to be a quarter for us with a solid ROE. This result reflects a strong quarter for investment income, continued strong underwriting income from attritional results and tax benefits achieved from our portfolio of composition.","These factors, coupled with a positive equity market resulting in realized gains for the quarter, produced 9.7% annualized net income ROE for the quarter. No doubt that it has been an active last 15 months for cat losses, and of course, one more quarter to go with already some known cats.","Well it's been challenging for those individuals and businesses directly impacted by these events. These are challenges to which we have responded well and in fact better than most. Over that time, we continued to produce positive results and we anticipate the same in the fourth quarter.","Our portfolio composition is able to absorb volatility and over the longer-term, including these recent years, has produced total shareholder return of over 12%. On an ROE basis, over the last five years, Everest has outperformed by approximately 300 basis points, a top 20 peers listing as compiled by A. M. Best.","Nevertheless, we must always look forward. And as all of us recognized, there are significant questions which persist around our industry, most notably, the influx of third-party capital and price adequacy. That is why you may have observed that over time, our net annual expected cat load has drifted down from over 12 combined ratio points to currently less than 9, and will likely drift down into next year.","This has been and will continue to be the result of deliberate execution of our strategy, a combination of reducing and diversifying our cat portfolio and diversifying into other segments of the business. You will hear more about this from my colleagues. We continue to believe the future is bright for Everest given the scale we have on the business and our breadth of underwriting and capital management capabilities.","And therefore the ability to leverage that into the better opportunities, the market offers and to participate meaningfully in new classes and constructs. We see the recent catastrophe events as being a strong proof point of our value proposition and this along with our clients focus on earnings volatility, has continuing to increase demand for our products and services. Thank you for your participation this morning, and I look forward to our dialogue during the Q&A.","I'll now turn it over to Craig for detailed financial results.","Craig Howie","Thank you, Dom, and good morning, everyone. Everest had net income of $206 million for the third quarter of 2018. This compares to a net loss of $639 million for the third quarter last year, a quarter heavily impacted by catastrophe losses. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $486 million compared to a net loss of $102 million for the first nine months of 2017.","Net income year-to-date included $35 million of net after tax realized capital gains compared to $79 million of capital gains in the first nine months of 2017. The capital gains were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on our public equity portfolio. After tax operating income for the third quarter was $167 million compared to a loss of $624 million in 2017.","Operating income year-to-date was $428 million compared to a loss of $123 million for the first nine months of 2017. The group recorded a modest underwriting gain of $278,000 for the third quarter essentially a breakeven result with a 100% combined ratio. This compared to an underwriting loss of $1 billion in the third quarter of 2017 with the combined ratio of 164%.","The year-to-date underwriting gain for the group was $21 million compared to an underwriting loss $705 million for the same period last year. The year-to-date combined ratio was 99.6% compared to 116.5% reported for the first nine months of 2017 reflecting the higher catastrophe losses in 2017.","These results reflect the series of major catastrophe events that are driving both the quarter and the year-to-date figures for both 2017 and 2018. In the third quarter of 2018, the group saw $240 million of net pretax catastrophe losses compared to $1.4 billion in the third quarter of 2017.","The breakdown of the pretax loss estimates by event is as follows: Hurricane Florence was $90 million. Typhoon Jebi was $80 million. Typhoon Trami was $25 million. The 2018 California wildfires were $25 million, and the Japan floods were $20 million.","On a year-to-date basis, the results reflected net pretax estimated catastrophe losses of $837 million in 2018 compared to $1.4 billion in 2017. Excluding the catastrophe events and favorable prior year development, the underlying book continues to perform well with an overall current year attritional combined ratio of 85.8% through the first nine months compared to 85.6% for the same period in 2017.","Our year-to-date group expense ratio remains low at 5.7%, while our commission ratio of 22.1% remains relatively stable. When looking at year-over-year comparisons, it should be noted that the 2017 commission and expense ratios benefited from higher reinstatement premiums arising from the 2017 catastrophe events.","For investments, pretax investment income was $161 million for the quarter and $441 million year-to-date on our $18.7 billion investment portfolio. Year-to-date investment income was up $47 million or 12% from one-year ago.","This result continues to be driven by the increase in limited partnership income, which was up $29 million from the first nine months of 2017. However, $13 million of the limited partnership income this quarter came from a distribution of one investment and will not reoccur in the future.","The pretax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.2% compared to 3.0% one-year ago, as both investment grade and alternative fixed income yields are up year-over-year. The new money rates are now in excess of our total portfolio yield. This will boost future net investment income.","On income taxes, the tax benefit we recorded was the result of the amount and geographic region of the losses associated with the catastrophes. The effective tax rate is an annualized calculation that includes planned catastrophe losses for the remainder of the year. We expect to report a tax benefit for the full-year since additional catastrophe losses are anticipated in the fourth quarter.","Positive cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $544 million for the first nine months of 2018 compared to $1 billion in 2017. The year-over-year decline reflects a higher level of paid catastrophe losses in 2018 from the 2017 catastrophe events.","Shareholders' equity for the Group was $8.3 billion at the end of the third quarter and was essentially flat compared to year-end 2017. The $40 million slight decline in year-to-date shareholder's equity is primarily attributable to the $255 million mark-to market impact on the investment portfolio and capital return for $159 million of dividends paid as well as $75 million of share buybacks offset by $486 million of net income.","As a result of the share buybacks and dividends, the Company has returned 48% of net income to shareholders to date in 2018. The Catastrophe losses in 2017 and 2018 have had no impact on our strong capital position.","Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide a review of the Reinsurance Operations.","John Doucette","Thank you, Craig. Good morning. Everest Re continues to focus on relevance to our customers, global spread and line of business diversity in our expanding portfolio and proactive and efficient use of our capital.","Our strategy is focused on long-term profitable growth, sustainability and responsiveness to our clients and brokers. We are built to withstand the volatility that we manage for our clients, whether that is from increased frequency of property catastrophes, short losses and casualty, and professional liability classes, credit risk, mortgage risk, or any other risks needing mitigation.","Although we manage volatile risks, we are disciplined and thoughtful underwriters, expanding our business by offering tailored products and solutions across our global underwriting platform and in all property and casualty lines.","In Q3 of 2018, we had $240 million of losses, net of reinsurance from the events in the U.S. and Japan. This continued frequency of catastrophe losses has put upward pressure on rates and as a core reinsurer, we are positioned to capture the benefits of any market uplift.","That being said, the cumulative compression of property margins over the last several years has had the corresponding impact of stabilizing the casualty reinsurance market and some other non-property lines of business, which can no longer rely on rate subsidization from the property cat lines of business.","Overall, we have correspondingly deployed more capital across many long-tailed and short-tailed line, which exclude cat exposure, highlighted by our underwriting profit from non-cat exposed classes, reaching $190 million through nine months in 2018, up $70 million over the same period last year from similar lines of business.","Recognizing this improving market dynamic for non-cat exposed lines, we targeted inbound several large casualty treaties this year at attractive ROEs. And we know that several more new casualty treaties are coming to the market soon, both from large global clients and smaller regional companies, which could continue to improve overall reinsurance terms going forward and expand the opportunity set to profitably deploy capital.","Similarly, we are viewed as a premier and disciplined reinsurance partner in the expanding mortgage space as well as in specialty lines and structured reinsurance products and continue to see new opportunities in these lines.","As I have said before, this new paradigm of capital restructuring in SureTec and technology innovation, and other disruptive forces impacting our industry. Collectively, we'll continue to test all insurers and reinsurers, and only those such as Everest with our longstanding global franchise, an access to profitable diversified business through an efficient operating platform will continue to thrive in this new world.","Now, I will turn to our quarterly and year-to-date results. In Q3 2018, overall the reinsurance division grew gross written premiums year-over-year by 7% to $1.7 billion. When removing effects of foreign exchange and reinstatement premiums last Q3 due to the catastrophes, it is up 18%, primarily due to increases in both property and casualty quota share business.","Our overall Q3 combined ratio was 100.1%. This breakeven underwriting result was driven by an elevated cat loss ratio of 17.4%, primarily due to Hurricane Florence, California, Wildfires, Typhoons Jebi and Trami, and the Japanese floods. Year-to-date, our gross written premium were up 20% to $4.5 billion. And the overall combined ratio was 100.1%, which includes all cat losses incurred during the year.","As pro rata business has become more attractive due to a combination of better original insurance rates in certain lines and improving ceding commissions and other reinsurance terms. Our business mix includes more pro rata than in prior years. Pro rata typically carries less volatility than excess of loss business, but offset by higher ratios. This is highlighted by our property pro rata premium contributing roughly half of the premium growth this year, but with tightly controlled limits including low occurrence limits as a percentage of premiums.","Additionally, casualty quota share and other non-property quota share lines also accounted for roughly half of the premium growth seeing this year. Notably, our attritional loss and combine ratios were only up slightly to 55.1% and 82.3% respectively. We also closed more deals in credit structured reinsurance and the mortgage reinsurance space, allowing profitable capital deployment, facilitating premium growth.","And we believe that we have a solid runway in front of us. In these respective areas to continue to grow and profitably diversify our writings in non-cat exposed lines of business over the coming years and therefore we would expect to see continued material growth in the underwriting profit margin contribution over the coming years from non-cat exposed business. As we saw the high double-digit annualized growth in underwriting profit margins so far year-to-date compared to last year in these classes.","So while we saw a slight increase in attritional combined ratio percentage. Our notional dollars of underwriting profit from these lines are up and we expect this trend to continue in 2019 and beyond in these non-cat exposed lines of business. Year-to-date, the U.S. reinsurance operations had a 14% increase in gross written premium to $2.2 billion adjusting for reinstatement premiums and foreign exchange, written premium grew by 20%..","The increase in premium was driven by some large casualty quota share treaties, including capital relief deals and mortgage reinsurance writings. In addition, some large global clients purchased additional reinsurance including casualty and property pro rata, after reassessing internal risk targets following the cat events of 2017. These buyers seek reinsurers that can holistically address their reinsurance needs in multiple classes around the world. In Everest with our global footprint, was in a solid position to win attractive business.","The U.S. combined ratio was elevated at 107.5% due to catastrophe losses incurred in 2018. While our attritional loss ratio improved slightly to 55%, our attritional combined ratio is up 1.6 points to 81.6% due to higher ceding commissions. But this is an exchange for tight occurrence limits and other risk mitigating features in the treaties. The Bermuda Operations grew 34% to $1.2 of gross written premium year-to-date.","Zurich and London were primary contributors to this growth with increased casualty and multi-line sessions from large global clients. Expanded European Casualty and Motor Treaty business and growth and maturation of our political risk, surety, trade credit book. The loss ratio declined 16.7 points to 60.9% due to the lower amount of cat losses year-on-year.","The attritional combined ratio decreased by almost one point to 87%. The international reinsurance operations also grew significantly to $1.1 billion. Gross written premium year-to-date increased by 21%. The growth included additional Latin American, Middle Eastern, African and Asian writings, providing Everest with broad-based international diversification.","In Latin America and in the Caribbean, post the 2017 cat losses, we saw rate increases and some new additional opportunities both at 1\/1\/2018, but also throughout 2018 during other renewal dates for loss affected treaties. In Asia, we saw opportunities in crop and facultative business offset by a reduction in Chinese property pro rata business which we non-renewed due to deteriorating margins.","The International segments combined ratio dropped to 97.7% from 133.4% in the prior year period. Year-to-date, 2018 has been affected by catastrophe losses from Jebi, Trami and the Japanese floods. However, the attritional combined ratio is essentially flat at 79.2%.","Looking forward, it is too soon to tell, how exactly the market will respond to this year's losses, following the record losses of 2017 and active 2018 third quarter and most recently Hurricane Michael. However, with approximately $115 billion and claiming of market losses over the last 18 months. Retraction and dislocation across various lines in Lloyd's and other markets, outsized losses in the energy market, prior year cat development from several reinsurance clients, and shrinking casualty reserve redundancies.","It is hard to see how it cannot be some upward pressure on rates heading into this major renewal season. We do not predict rates, but we plan to be able to identify, respond, and successfully execute in a variety of market conditions which may vary by line, by territory, and by product around the world.","Thank you, and now I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations.","Jonathan Zaffino","Thank you, John and good morning. Everest Insurance has just completed another quarter of continued progress and solid execution. With each passing quarter, we gained traction and see growth across our various portfolios fueled by our deep specialty product set, the continued addition of talented colleagues, strength of relationships, and a strong balance sheet.","We are seeing a stable and resilient combined ratio aided by the maturation of the many businesses launched over the course of the past three years. As premiums continue to earn in and as we realized the impact of decisive underwriting actions taken to dampen the impact of more challenging lines of business, the overall business mix changes for the better and we see the benefits in the form of a less volatile combined ratio. Once again, we are emerging from a third quarter marked by significant cat activity, and once again, we can report that the Everest Insurance franchise has proven to be resilient, standing ready to respond to our customers' needs in the face of these natural disasters.","Overall, we remain pleased with the continued growth and development of our global insurance platform. As we've shared in the past, our vision to organically build a world-class specialty diversified insurance organization that is relevant within the global specialty P&C industry is being realized. Underwriting profit for both the quarter and year-to-date period, growth and gross written premium, improvement and the attritional loss ratio and continued expense discipline is evidenced that the strategy we have defined is sound and we have the right talent on board to execute on our plan.","I'll turn now to the financial highlights in the quarter. Following this, I\u2019ll provide brief comments on the cat activity experience within the insurance operations along with our views of the operating environment forward. For the third quarter of 2018, the global insurance operations produced $517 million in gross written premium, an increase of $37 million or 8% over third quarter 2017.","Year-to-date, we achieved $1.7 billion in gross written premium, representing growth of $184 million or 12% over the comparable period in 2017. These strong growth rates have been achieved despite several underwriting actions that have resulted in our controlled exit of various lines of business.","As in prior quarters, contributions remain balanced across the diverse group of underwriting operations, particularly the direct broker units within the Everest Insurance global platform. This also represents the 15th consecutive quarter of growth for global insurance.","Turning to net premiums, net written premium for the quarter was $385 million, and increase of $15 million or 4%. Year-to-date, net written premium was $1.2 billion, growing by $61 million or 5% over the prior year period.","Net earned premium in the quarter was $419 million, an increase of $43 million or 11% and $1.2 billion year-to-date, an increase of $157 million or 15% over the prior year period. Our GAAP combined ratio for the quarter was 99.6%, significantly lower than last year's quarter, which included the historic 2017 cat events.","Excluding the current quarters 2.8 point of cat activity, the attritional combined ratio was 96.9%, which compares favorably to the third quarter 2017 attritional of 98% and continues a two year trend of improvement over the third quarter, 2016 attritional of 99.5%.","Encouraging \u2013 and as anticipated, Everest Insurance has now produced an underwriting profit in six out of the last seven quarters. The underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for the third quarter of this year was 66.4%, a two point improvement over last year, 68.4% and a 3.4 point improvement over 3Q 2016 of 69.8%.","On a year-to-date basis, the GAAP combined ratio was 98.1% inclusive of 1.4 points of net cat loss, both delivering $23 million of underwriting profit, a $171 million improvement year-over-year. Year-to-date attritional combined ratio for the global insurance operations produced a 96.7%, essentially flat over the year-to-date 17 period yet 60 basis points below the 97.1% for the comparable period in 2016.","The main variance here is the expense ratio, which came in at 30.5% in both the third quarter and year-to-date periods, which was up 90 basis points and 1% respectively over the same period last year. As we've stated in prior calls, an expense ratio at roughly 30% remains very competitive in a specialty insurance segment and is in line with our plan.","Importantly, the underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio showed the 70 basis point improvement year-to-date, coming in at 66.3% versus the prior year period of 67%. The key point year-over-year, we are seeing a downward drift and the attritional loss ratio. This is a result of improved and mix of business, the benefits from our contingent commitment to add profitable lines of business to our portfolio and the strategic underwriting actions of the past three years.","Let me offer a brief word on the third quarter cat activity. Despite an active quarter for industry cat losses are 2018 results are favorable as compared against several metrics. Everest Insurance booked at $12 million or 2.8 points net cat losses in the quarter, mainly from the impact of Florence and a smaller amount for California wildfire.","The volatility from these events were well managed across our various underwriting operations. Our many underwriting actions and hedging strategies implemented over the past two years have proven effective, similar to any participants within the specialty PNC industry, we are not immune from the impacts of severe weather. However, with the growth and maturation of our platform, our ability to manage the volatility has indeed improved.","Turning to the trading environment forward, the condition is exhibited in the prior quarters, remained largely unchanged. Certain lines of business continued to achieve needed positive rate, namely commercial, auto and property, and as respect property that's a common on both the attritional and cat side. Other lines of business are showing signs of improving, namely umbrella and excess. And yet other lines are showing positive rate, but not at the magnitude needed. This includes the general liability markets in many of the professional lines.","Workers compensation continues to experience rate reduction as a reflection of the positive underlying fundamentals in the line. Outside of workers compensation, our composite rate increases in the quarter were at positive 4.3%, bringing our year-to-date total to a plus 4.8%. The slight decline in the quarter is as much a function of changing mix of business as it is reflective of a slowdown in rate.","So in conclusion, we remain pleased with the continued progress we are making in the establishment of a world-class specialty insurer. The nearly 90,000 submissions we have received year-to-date, speak to our relevance. Further, the underlying performance of our diverse books of business remains encouraging and hence we feel we are well positioned to create value for all of our constituents in the evolving market ahead. We look forward to reporting back to you on our progress next quarter.","And I'll turn it back to Craig for Q&A.","Craig Howie","Thanks Jon. Jonathan, we are ready and you can open the line for any questions that we may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning. My first question, you guys have shown pretty strong growth in your Reinsurance business, which continued in the third quarter, about 17% if you back out reinstatements, these statements from both periods. So I guess my question is do you think that this growth can be sustainable? Obviously, just assuming more or less stable kind of January 1, 2019 renewal season, because I guess more of the growth has really come from pro rata business and shifting away from cat into other casualty lines. So can we continue to see high double-digit growth from here?","Dominic Addesso","Certainly into the fourth quarter as that premiums continues to earn in, you'll see those kinds of percentage. But into next year, I certainly wouldn't put that high of a growth rate on our Reinsurance business. But we still think we're entering a part of the cycle where there are opportunities emerging outside of cat. We do see increased demand from global ceding companies, we're seeing increased demand in mortgage space and opportunities there.","So there are opportunities, whether or not it would reach double-digit teens into next year, that's hard to predict. But certainly we would expect to continue to see growth opportunities in the marketplace. The secondary question, of course, is whether or not those opportunities will meet our underwriting guidelines in terms of pricing, terms and condition et cetera, so it's still unknown, but perhaps a growth year into next year, but certainly we don't believe at this pace.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then in terms of margins, so you guys \u2013 the underlying loss ratio deteriorated in the third quarter. You guys kind of made the point it's due to the shifting of the mix to pro rata and casualty business. And that typically does run at higher loss ratios. The second quarter saw a little bit of a different trend, the loss ratio did improve on an underlying basis. So is it the right the way to look at year-to-date? And I guess as the mix \u2013 the business continues to earn in, in the fourth quarter into next year, would you expect I guess at year-to-date about a 50 basis points or so deterioration in your underlying commodity ratio?","Dominic Addesso","So first thing is let me comment on the second quarter, just to go backwards and I want to refresh everyone's memory that the second quarter, we had a very low frequency of what we call non-cat cats. So that had a positive impact on the second quarter loss ratio. And we do think that it is more appropriate to look at the combined ratio on a year-to-date basis.","And we do think that our combined ratios, frankly, on a year-to-date basis, has not changed all that much. In fact, on an attritional combined ratio, year-to-date September 2008, 85.8%, that compares against the year-to-date a year-ago of 85.6%. So two-tenths of a point movement in that, that's pretty stable, and that's kind of where we would expect it be through time, very stable.","John Doucette \u2013 and it's worth reemphasizing mentioned in his remarks, the underwriting profit, I think this is why we emphasize it, sometimes can be misleading to just work from a combined ratio metrics, although we use them as well, but of course you have to use them against the right premium base.","And I think that's frankly what \u2013 were some of the misses have been, there's been using the higher combined ratio, but not applying it to a higher premium base. And that's why, again, it's worth highlighting the actual notional dollars of profit that we've improved year-over-year.","So this year we've had $190 million of underwriting profit from our non-cat portfolios on the reinsurance side and insurance, and last year that was $120 million. So an improvement of $70 million and sometimes when you just use the combined ratio statistics that \u2013 and you misapply the combined ratio to the wrong premium base, you miss the underwriting profit pickup. So rather a long answer to your question Elyse, but I hope that that addresses your question.","Elyse Greenspan","Yes, that was very helpful. And then just one last question. Particularly for Jebi, can you just let us know what level insured losses you're using? AIR and RMS come out, you've kind of in that $2 billion to $5.5 billion range. And then further, is your exposure there mainly XOL or aggregate or both? And of industry loss estimates rose for that event as we're hearing some chatter in the market, could your net loss that you guys set up this quarter be impacted negatively?","Dominic Addesso","So first our exposure to that loss is predominantly an XOL, it's not solely an XOL event. And in each of the events that Craig highlighted in his remarks, we use either the high end of the estimate, the highest end of the estimate, in some cases above the high end range from the industry estimates.","Now clearly, it's still early with many of these events and we're not saying that losses can't change. Of course, they could go in either direction. But we think in the aggregate, we've done a pretty conservative job of reserving these events. There is no read across the last year because it's a much different path pattern. So we're very comfortable with the estimates. But with the absolute caveat that events can change, but even with what you've described depending on the severity of it, you think we've got that covered in large parts.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning. Just first question follow-up to Elyse question on the attritional combined ratio. You mentioned the decline, mostly because of mix change to pro rata and casualty lines. I just wondered, could you comment on the pricing trends versus loss cost trend, is there any impact from that as well? ","Dominic Addesso","Well, as John Doucette indicated that across many of the lines of business that we entertained, particularly in the casualty space, there has been a primary space. There's been generally rate increase, and of course, Jon Zaffino highlighted that as well, of course absent a worker's comp.","And when we look at, I know your comment or question, I think was focused on the reinsurance side, when we underwrite those accounts, we build in our trend. So we do have trend built into our assumptions about where the market is going. And remember that on the pro rata business, the biggest benefit that we've seen or the improvement that we've seen from a reinsurers perspective is on ceding commissions. That's just over the previous five years, ceding commissions were on the rise and it was making that portfolio not suitable to put on the books.","And again it's worth reminding everyone that Everest has been \u2013 I think terrific at cycle management. We took our \u2013 half a dozen years ago, we took our casualty portfolio down to just a few $100 million, I\u2019m taking again on the reinsurance side. And of course now as market conditions have been improving, not only in primary rates, but also on ceding commission terms we've now founded suitable to reenter that space. So again, good underwriting cycle management, these are all things that we adhere to. I don't know if that answered your question.","Kai Pan","That\u2019s very helpful. And could you quantify how much benefits you're getting from the reduced ceding commission?","Dominic Addesso","Not specifically. Again, I'll just come to the underwriting profit numbers that I cited earlier that across all of our portfolios, that underwriting profit increased $70 million to $190 million.","Kai Pan","Okay.","Dominic Addesso","That\u2019s a nine-month comment, but year-to-date number.","Kai Pan","Okay. My second question, on Hurricane Michael, do you have any preliminary estimates by the losses and then you can talk about relative to Florence, and also how do you approach a reserving of that? Do you see the LAE issues or AOB issues continued to be an issue as we seen in Irma?","Dominic Addesso","So answer to the first question is, we don't have a reliable estimate that that we can disclose at this point. It's still early days. At this point, we've only received frankly some level of detail from only one client.","Other information that we're seeing is based on model results and the process that we will go through to reserve that event will be using industry estimates, using our models, using underwriter estimates, market share and generally reserving towards the higher end of those picking the highest of those individual aspects.","We do believe that from what we're hearing and observing that the event is towards the higher end of the estimates we've seen out in the street, but yet we've not been able to translate that into a loss estimate that we can put forth at this point.","As far as the issues that arose in Irma, we do not think that they will be the same. Certainly the AOB threat and the carry on effect of losses will always be there. Of course in this particular case, there are more total losses than what we saw in Irma. So that theoretically should have a less \u2013 should be less of an AOB issue. The loss adjustment expense issue will be less of an issue as well, even though we will reserve that at with a market surge \u2013 demand surge a factor.","Kai Pan","Okay. That's very helpful. And last one if I may, given the Michael losses and upcoming January renewals, how do you approach the buybacks that towards the year-end?","Dominic Addesso","Again, we don\u2019t really telegraph buybacks. We do think we have excess capital to deploy in that space. If we think the price is appropriate, and certainly at these levels, we think it's a certainly a good value. We are obviously approaching the end of the season. So as you know, in the third quarter, we get even though we did buyback some stock. We do get a little cautious given wind season. That's coming is in our rear view mirror.","So that will be potentially an opportunity. We also will look at the opportunity relative to what does occur, 1\/1 as again it's been mentioned, we would anticipate that our capital going into next year we'll even be lower again. So that does decrease some of the volatility, perhaps even freeing up more capital in that regard.","Kai Pan","Great. Thank you so much for all the answers.","Dominic Addesso","Thank you, Kai.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Amit Kumar with The Buckingham Research Group.","Amit Kumar","Thank and good morning. Just maybe a few follow-ups. The first question is going back little bit discussion on capital management? Are you sort of blacked out till we have a better sense of the micro loss?","Dominic Addesso","That's entirely possible.","Amit Kumar","Got it. That's helpful. The second question relates going back to the discussion on pricing renewals and expectations going forward. Do you get the sense of that Irma loss development, the material development for the industry? Is playing a role and will pressure pricing upwards materially for 1\/1 or am I over thinking that component?","Dominic Addesso","We don't think you're over thinking it. We do think that it will that does create some pressure. We've a commentary about material TBT, but I'll ask John Doucette to maybe comment that as well.","John Doucette","Yes, good morning, Amit. Yes, I mean it's a combination of things of which the development there was seen by many companies for Irma, but not just Irma there was a development for a lot of reinsurance client in Maria, particularly in Puerto Rico. So I mean those are some of the things that happened, but in addition to that, we had 150 billion and growing of losses that happened.","And I think that's something that needs to be factored in as well as just the reserve redundancies where do they stand? We've seen a lot of large losses like in the energy market. So there's all those, there clearly seems to be a while there's a lot of capital around there's talks on how much it's going to be stable when it comes to the alternative capital who probably a several of those players probably had two years of not great results.","And so the question is not just can and will it reload. It also, I think will also be the question on what the returns and profitability targets that capital requires to come back in. So there is a lot of different things, there's the two major, major profitability reviews that are happening in Lloyd\u2019s that could affect $5 billion of renewal premium, both individual syndicates with non-performance as well as lines of business across the market that aren't performing well.","I mean, that all sounds like a different macro forces that will look to potentially increased demand and have an impact on supply. And we also frankly see clients that seem to be tired of volatility.","Going back to the earlier question from Elyse, that there are \u2013 we are seeing clients coming back into the market they want to a re-insurer and lock and potentially decrease their own volatility, which means there may be whether it's on the casualty or the property or the specialty side that may be an increase in the buys that happened.","And that as Dom said, it's tough for us to predict what that will do when it comes to our topline. We do think that will stabilize and potentially improve pricing in certain areas. Certainly pockets that we would expect to see some improvement in pricing.","Amit Kumar","That's helpful. The final question on the net investment income. The LP delta from private equity. Can you just remind us \u2013 going back to the K, just remind us, maybe just a bit more color? What exactly are these both investments in? Thanks.","Dominic Addesso","The LP investments that we have are primarily in private equity and or credit. These are investments that we've made over a longer period of time. That have helped us with getting better yield on the overall portfolio. But the amount of investments that we put in place over time has been relatively consistent over the past few years. And what you've seen is, a higher level of returns from these investments over that period of time on that.","Again, no major changes in our overall portfolio. Predominantly the portfolio is made up of investment grade fixed income portfolio, but we do have alternative investments not only in the limited partnerships, but also bank loans which are floating rate as well as high yield \u2013 some high yield investments as well. Our total private equity is about $1.5 billion out of our \u2013 almost $19 billion investment portfolio. So as Craig said, some of that private equity is credit related, mezzanine debt, et cetera.","Amit Kumar","And is there like an additional commitment to LT investments which you have to make or is the steady state from here onwards?","Dominic Addesso","We have committed funds to the private equity space that would carry out into the succeeding years, but that would not be an outsized percentage relative to how we anticipate the total investment portfolio to grow.","Amit Kumar","Got it. Thank you.","Dominic Addesso","So $1.5 billion would probably likely go up, but not at a disproportionate percentage to the portfolio. Right now the private equity portfolio stands at about 8%. I don't expect that to change remarkably.","Amit Kumar","Got it. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.","Dominic Addesso","Thank you, Amit.","Craig Howie","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski","Hey, thanks. Follow-up to Amit\u2019s question. First, the investment expenses are running $8 million or so higher year-to-date. Is that correlated with the higher alternative investment income or is that a run rate we should be thinking about?","Craig Howie","Mike, this is Craig. It is in line with the investment managers that we use for some of these types of investments. And you could expect that to be at a normal run rate.","Michael Zaremski","Okay, great. In the prepared remarks about U.S. reinsurance and I might be getting this little wrong. You talked about tighter limits and I know you mentioned, Dom, risk mitigation features. I think that was you Dom in a treaty. I was just curious, are you referring to a deal that the media reported earlier this fall, and maybe you can also explain what a \u2013 at a high level, what risk mitigation features means? ","Dominic Addesso","That was not me. That was John Doucette, and therefore I\u2019ll ask him to respond.","Michael Zaremski","Sorry about that. Thanks.","Dominic Addesso","Although, keep in mind that we\u2019re particularly sensitive to talking about individual clients. So with that, I'll ask John to dance through that.","John Doucette","Good morning, Mike. The comment was more, I think a broader comment. It wasn't deal specific. It was really talking about on proportional business, particularly in the property space. I think that we wanted to highlight that we have \u2013 there's a lot of property quota shares that are out there and we write a few of them, we write them with clients we know and like and respect. But we also \u2013 a lot of the time, those have very tight occurrence limits, cat occurrence limits as a function of the overall premium.","So while the premium growth in property went up, it doesn't correspondingly mean that there is a meaningful change in the P&L for that. That was the main point that we\u2019re trying to get to. And then beyond that, whether it's by line of business, and certainly in some of the structured areas, there will be different contract specific features, and there'll be gives and takes and different parts. And whether that's what the contract says, some swing rating, different supplements, things like that. That could happen. And that could be across basically any classes of business that we see.","Back to what Dominic said at the beginning, we were more bearish than a lot of our competitors for a long time in the casualty space. And we think our view of the world for out as we cut our book tremendously. And we are seeing opportunities that we hadn't seen in awhile in the casualty space in general.","Also the global clients are coming back in and they can \u2013 and that's lumpy, but they are looking for people that can trade with them in multiple classes all around the world. And we have the ability and expertise to deploy underwriting capacity in all property and casualty lines all over the world, and so we are seeing continued to see traction with the global. And again, what the contract features are will vary tremendously contract-by-contract.","Dominic Addesso","By the way, and that's answer. The one other narrowing of risk mitigate features could be narrowing reinsurance, which is another thing that this is booked as an underwriting feature of many of these accounts that we put on the books.","John Doucette","Meaning ensuring the insurance that our clients buy.","Dominic Addesso","And we stand with them, with the protections that they get either built in actually into the contract or deemed into the contract that we will have our recovery rate that matches the \u2013 that will match the terms attachment point limit of the coverage that they buy. And we factored that into our risk assessment as we try to decide if it's an attractive deal on a risk-adjusted basis to deploy capital in that.","Michael Zaremski","Okay, that's helpful. And just have follow-up on that, in terms of being less bearish on casualty \u2013 is that partly due to the new money rates being higher than the portfolio yield or is this simply due to just the non-investment income opportunities you guys are seeing?","Dominic Addesso","Underwriting first, yourselves as an underwriting shop and that's the number one priority.","Michael Zaremski","Okay, great. ","Dominic Addesso","Underwriting margin.","Michael Zaremski","Okay. And lastly, I'm just curious there's been a \u2013 I'm not an expert on the mortgage insurance space, but there's been a flurry of kind of a reinsurance capital market, bonds and deals announced in recent months, or just curious, does that compete with the traditional mortgage reinsurance that you guys have been a leader in?","Dominic Addesso","I'll take that one. So we write mortgage reinsurance related to the GSEs, write for the MI and we also write a little bit of mortgage reinsurance outside of North America in a couple countries that have high capital loadings such as Australia, France, potentially Germany et cetera. They were looking at that.","But the predominant \u2013 our predominant mortgage book is with the GSEs and then also the MIs. So a lot of them are deploying capa \u2013 risk, are using hedging and risk mitigation strategies in at least two different capacities through traditional reinsurance, as well as through the capital market.","And the GSEs in particular, have a dual mandate to use both the channels and they have a mandate to try to develop the hedging markets whether it's on the capital markets side or traditional reinsurers. And they continue to do that. So I would say net-net, it's a positive, because while they are different products, they are looking to build this out into a more sustainable class of business that. And we think the combination will do that.","Michael Zaremski","Thank you for the color.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.","Yaron Kinar","Hi, good morning, everybody. I guess my first question is just thinking about cat loads. If we look at 2017s events and look at the shift in your business mix since then more into prorate, more into casualty. Do you have a sense of what the loss ratio or book value impact would have been from 2017 events? Have they occurred today?","Dominic Addesso","As the 2017 events occurred today?","Yaron Kinar","Yes.","Dominic Addesso","Not sure I understand that meaning. Meaning, the re-underwriting of the portfolio would be impacting less. So let me answer with this way because I don't know that I have that precise answer. Our cat load not only in combined ratio points, but also in nominal dollars has been coming down over the last couple of years.","Reminder that a few years ago, it was up to 12 points, now it's less than eight or less than nine, likely to be less than eight going into next year. But even in absolute \u2013 and that's partly a result of diversification of our book of business across other lines of business, but growth of the insurance, many growth of the \u2013 the different classes that John Doucette emphasize. So the diversification certainly helps that.","But even in notional dollars, the number has come down. It was approaching $600 million last year. It's in the mid $500 million into this year and it will be lower than that into next year in absolute dollars. In addition, our 100 PML in all of our peaks zones is down year-over-year modestly. But that's the best I can do in terms of answering that question. I don't have a pro forma in terms of overlaying last year's events into this year's portfolio.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. And then you had mentioned some adverse industry development for Irma and Maria that's still ongoing. Do you \u2013 if this continues do you think there\u2019s still a risk that your loss ratios are loss picks for those events could further deteriorate? Or you now at a point that even if there is further industry deterioration, you\u2019ve kind of \u2013 you\u2019re comfortable with these reserves.","John Doucette","We think that our reserve position, can withstand further industry loss deterioration. But as you say on all of these events, you never know. But we think that the way it's a reserved currently we're talking about last year's events now and even this year's events. We think that it can withstand further into \u201cindustry deterioration\u201d.","Yaron Kinar","Got it.","John Doucette","Okay. We heard from some clients and then we factor that into our loss fixed. So the fact that some emergency has happened more recently, that doesn't change her view per se right now.","Yaron Kinar","Great. Okay. So that was already factored in the last quarter update?","John Doucette","Yes.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. And last question just on the casualty market and reinsurance, so if I understood your comments correctly you are a little more constructive on opportunities there today than you had been in the past? Is that more from a pricing perspective? Or is it loss cost? I guess I was just a little surprised to hear more constructive commentary there given that it seems like loss cost trends are deteriorating at least on the underlying side?","John Doucette","Yes. So I mean \u2013 and there's the two worlds, the insurance world that Jon talked about and that it will vary if you want color you get on the primary side. But on the reinsurance side, there's a lot of additional moving parts right. There's the reinsurance terms conditions, what's the ceding commission, a lot of the book that we write out of the \u2013 London and Zurich is done on an excess of loss basis.","So it's a little bit bifurcated from what the original rates are. So then is a rate on exposure of what we are getting and we're seeing improving opportunities on our ability to execute that. But I think in general, it's also just more a supply and demand that we see the large global clients want to do more with a company like Everest. They maybe full on some of the European reinsurers, they may \u2013 a lot of clients are tightening up their credit, their reinsurance security panel. So they are tightening the credit.","So that means there's less supply for some of the long tail lines of business, the reinsurance that they want to buy. And we think that is a positive that happens. We also \u2013 one of the things that we're seeing is again, I think some of the clients who had centralized a lot of their buying, I think they are saying well, there was actually in the older \u2013 we want to take five or six, seven years and before that where there was more engagement between the reinsurance underwriters and the insurance underwriters, not just the ceded redesk of reinsurance buyers, and I think there's more feedback loop.","And I think some of these insurance companies are realizing that there's real value that experienced reinsurance underwriters can add by providing insight because we see across the whole market, we see what lines of business or sub-classes are making money, are losing money, what products are making money or losing money, and it allows us to give that insight when we do underwriting audits which we do a lot of them.","We underwrite our clients a lot. And I think that we are seeing the value of that as a lot of our clients are focused on their volatility, how do they improve their results. And they are looking to use reinsurance as a value proposition, not just get the lower ceding commission, but use it truer to get the better gross underwriting results","Dominic Addesso","And keep one thing in mind and I recognized where your question comes from, which is really more of a beta play. Make no mistake. This is not a beta play on the market. We underwrite each individual account and client and therefore they are likely making improvements in their portfolio that could be different than what you're describing as the overall market.","Yaron Kinar","Got it. That's very helpful. I appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will be taking our last question from Joshua Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua Shanker","Thank you very much. So I've talked to Jon Zaffino in the past and you Dom about the insurance improvement situation. I think a year ago when you're talking about material improvement in the combined ratio for that business, and look, I mean being in the mid-90s, there's nothing wrong with that. But I don't know over the past nine months, have the margins \u2013 underlying margin of that business improved? I can't tell that from the numbers. And is that what your expectations were a year ago or is the turnaround slower than you thought?","Dominic Addesso","I think it's just through the nine months. It\u2019s probably where I would have anticipated it to be. Remember, we've got one more quarter to go here. You've got year-end reserve that used to evaluate. In the main, it is trending and it\u2019s on the trajectory that \u2013 on a trajectory that I'm very pleased with. As you say something in the mid-90s is quite attractive. And I also know that what our loss reserve posture has been in terms of how we go about picking loss ratio. So we think it's conservative. So as we look forward, we're quite enthused about where this portfolio is trending.","Craig Howie","I would just add to that, Josh. I think we\u2019re very encouraged by the growth and the many new initiatives that we've launched over the last several years, which, if you recall, those were carefully chosen selected lines of business. As those continued to make up a larger and larger part of our portfolio as we continue to wind down, as I think I mentioned in my remarks, certain portfolios that we are exiting in a controlled way, which they're still obviously an earned premium lag in the P&L. As you see that transition continue to happen and gain momentum, in addition to what Don mentioned, taking a prudently cautious view of current accident years, we're pretty encouraged by where we are.","Joshua Shanker","And you mentioned, Dom that you still have year-end reserve reviews to go. In the past couple of years the fourth quarter prior year reserve releases have been quite significant. At that time, have you also been rebasing the current accident year ever been in the past, 4Qs material changes to your in-year accident pick in that fourth quarter?","Dominic Addesso","No, generally not. The only thing we look at that has to do with current year accident fix would be on the property side to the extent that we've had. We've either had, will be called non-cat cats. And if we've had some then we keep those reserves there in place. If we haven't had any non-cat cats like we did in the second quarter, and then we would adjust that current accident year for the very, very short tail lines for the non-cat cat piece. Is that what your \u2013 it\u2019s your question?","Joshua Shanker","Yes, I think so. So well I guess just coming back to the first question, and coming into the fourth quarter, you still have year-end reserve reviews. But we shouldn't expect that's going to significantly impact your combined ratio in the insurance business through nine months or maybe a \u2013 maybe I m missing something there?","Dominic Addesso","Well, any reserve redundancies or additions, obviously are going to affect the combined ratio on a year-to-date basis for the 12 months here. Craig, I think maybe understand\u2026","Craig Howie","Yes, I think I understand what you're asking. But prior year reserves reviews that would be completed would show up on the prior year line and would not be included in the attritional line for the year.","Dominic Addesso","Okay, I\u2019m sorry.","Joshua Shanker","Yes, so I guess the one thing in my view, I was expecting despite good results in insurance. I was expecting 2018 to be better than 2017. So far it's been, equivalent, which is fine. But I'm just trying to understand like maybe the fourth quarter might change that. I'm just trying to understand how the fourth quarter might, anything could change of course, but is there something that I'm not understanding about the fourth quarter, I guess?","Dominic Addesso","And I think the way we're answering your question is more about how we're viewing the profitability of the book and of course we don't \u2013 as we've outlined in the past, we hold reserves for periods of years as it relates to the current accident year. So you don't see those improvements coming through that we believe are there. They take a couple years go merge.","Joshua Shanker","Okay, the ultimate might be lower than the current pick.","Dominic Addesso","You got it.","Joshua Shanker","Yes. Okay, thank you.","Dominic Addesso","Thanks, Josh.","End of Q&A","Dominic Addesso","Okay, sorry for going over. But we're glad to do it. Thanks again for your interest and your questions. We spoke this morning about the lots of things. I believe it's worth emphasizing that Everest is a franchise is not only as thrive over the Michael's \u2013 over the market cycle with above average total shareholder returns.","But it's one, it's a franchise which is evolving and diversifying, based on where the future market opportunities are. And we've talked a lot about that this morning. Our goal remains the same, deliver above average returns on capital as we have done through time. Again, thank you for your interest this morning. I look forward to speaking with many of you over the weeks ahead.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"8595":["Everest Re Group, Ltd. (NYSE:RE) Q4 2013 Earnings Conference Call February  6, 2014 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Beth Farrell - Vice President, Investor Relations","Dom Addesso - President and Chief Executive Officer","John Doucette - Chief Underwriting Officer","Craig Howie - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","Greg Locraft - Morgan Stanley","Meyer Shields - KBW","Operator","Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Call of Everest Re Group Limited. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Beth Farrell","Good morning, and welcome to Everest Re Group's fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer; John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting Officer; and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements.","Now let me turn the call over to Dom.","Dom Addesso","Thanks, Beth. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. We're very pleased to report record earnings for the fourth quarter and the year. There were many elements of our portfolio that performed very well and others less so. However, with over $1.3 billion in earnings and a 20% ROE, it is a great result overall.","Certainly a factor was the absence of any major catastrophe, but it is worth noting that the year was not without losses. In fact, there were $195 million or $170 million net of cap losses during the year.","Growth by diversification of 21% or $900 million growth in premium during 2013 enabled the company to draw the reasonable level of loss events, while still expanding margins. New products and growth in many of our traditional lines have all contributed to margin expansion.","Growth in our core businesses was noted in treaty casualty, treaty property, facultative and specialty insurance line. In particular, our property strategy continues to be fluid, meaning that we allocate our capacity to those products offering the best return profile. This translates into more primary insurance and some additional pro rata in US reinsurance segment.","As cat XOL rates were trending down, we have been shifting to a different product mix. We're moving capacity to the better price layers. The ability to adapt and react quickly to changing market conditions remain the core competency of the Everest team.","The continued management of our portfolio mix resulted in a 4 point improvement in the combined ratio to 81%. All of this improvement came in the reinsurance portfolio. On the other hand, our insurance business underperformed relative to our expectation.","Crop losses and prior period development overshadowed many underlying improvements in this business. Excluding crop, the underlying accident year combined ratio improved to 94.6% in 2013. John and Craig will go into further details, but in summary, the crop losses were primarily due to a significant decline in the price of corn. Our estimate at the end of the third quarter did not sufficiently take into account yield factors, which were unknown at that time in our larger states.","The loss development we continued to see was in lines of business that are some of the most difficult to assess, as can be observed generally in the industry. In fact, much of the development we saw emerged on business we had terminated several years ago. The good news was that our overall reserve position was redundant. And therefore, the specific development had no impact on overall earnings. We continue to feel confident about our overall reserve position, but recognize that any one of our numerous reserve buckets could prove inadequate, while at the same time many others will result in savings. That is the nature of the estimation process within our portfolio of reserves, key to the overall adequacy.","Let me finish it up with some commentary on the overall market. As many observers point out, there're many challenges that we face. Nothing new of course to those of us who have been around awhile. Today's headline topics are declining rates and capital markets invasion, but on top of that, a low investment yield environment, and you have a recipe for lower overall returns to the industry. The key is of course not to get your company stuck in the averages. Our performance has been anything, but. ","Yes, US cat XOL rates were down in 2013 and at 1\/1\/, they were down in the 10% to 15% range. However, this view of the market and how it applies to us is too binary or one-dimensional. These factors are just a slice of the market.","In other parts of the world, particularly in the loss affected areas, rates were up, and in many other regions, rates were flat. In addition, primary pricing is still holding and we access this business through our direct insurance platform, facultative operations, and through pro rata deals in the reinsurance portfolio. Other examples include new products.","As I mentioned previously, we have and will continue to deploy capacity to those areas and others, including new products that provide the best risk-adjusted returns. Yes, the capital market is a factor, but frankly, we see it as a tool, not a threat. John will speak to that when he discusses our facility, which for us is another form of capital that can be used to deliver well underwritten products.","Nevertheless, capital market is not a perfect fit for all risks, and this is where company capital can be deployed to new products and risks not well suited to the capital market structure. The world is changing as it always has. It's how one adapts that determines if you can beat the averages. Our business plan and strategy anticipate that we can continue to replicate similar returns to what you have seen over the last two years.","Thank you. And now Craig will cover the financial results followed by John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting Officer for the operations review. Craig?","Craig Howie","Thank you, Dom, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report that Everest had a record quarter of earnings, with net income up $365 million or $7.54 per diluted common share. This compares to net income of $59 million or $1.13 per share for the fourth quarter of 2012. Net income includes realized capital gains and losses. For the year, Everest had record net income of $1.3 billion or $25.44 per share compared to $829 million or $15.79 per share in 2012. The 2013 result represents a return on equity of 19.5%. Operating income for the year was $1.1 billion or $21.47 per share. This represents a 58% increase over operating income of $13.62 per share last year.","These results were driven by a $480 million increase in underwriting income, representing a 185% increase year-over-year. As you will hear from John Doucette, there're a number of strategic initiatives that are driving these improved results. This increase in underwriting income was partially offset by higher income taxes and lower net investment income compared to 2012.","The results continue to reflect the improvement in the overall current-year attritional combined ratio, which has declined a full 4 points from 85.0% to 81.0% for the year. This measure excludes the impact of catastrophes, reinstatement premiums, and prior period loss development. The total reinsurance attritional combined ratio was 75.5% for the year compared to $80.9% in the prior year.","The insurance segment attritional combined ratio was 101.4% for the year compared to 100.9% in the prior year. However, removing the crop results, which show a 94.6% attritional combined ratio for the insurance segment compared to 97.2% in 2012. All segments reported increases in premium volume for the year and all reinsurance segments reported underwriting gains for the year.","Total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $390 million for the quarter compared to $48 million underwriting loss last year. For the year, total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $877 million compared to $327 million gain last year.","The insurance segment reported an underwriting loss of $156 million for the quarter compared to a loss of $46 million last year. For the year, the insurance segment reported an underwriting loss of $147 million compared to a loss of $68 million in 2012. The 2013 results reflected prior period reserve development and the crop loss for the year. John will discuss the crop insurance results in more detail.","Mt. Logan Re's financial position and operating results were consolidated into Everest beginning July 1, 2013. These results were included in a separate segment and reflected a $9 million underwriting gain for 2013. Everest retained $3 million of the income and $6 million was attributable to the non-controlling interest of this entity. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $238 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting loss of $94 million in the same period last year. For 2013, the underwriting gain was $739 million compared to a gain of $259 million in 2012.","These results reflect $30 million of current year catastrophe losses in the fourth quarter of 2013 related to Typhoon Fitow compared with $325 million of cats in the fourth quarter of 2012 related to Sandy. For the year, catastrophe losses were $195 million in 2013 compared to $410 million in 2012. Our reported combined ratio was 84.5% for the year 2013 compared to 93.8% in 2012.","On reserves, we completed our annual loss reserve studies. The results of the studies indicated that overall reserves remained adequate. In the fourth quarter, we booked the prior year development in the insurance segment, which was more than offset by favorable development in the reinsurance segment. The $125 million of prior year reserve development in the insurance segment is largely related to workers' compensation, construction liability and umbrella business. The construction liability and umbrella were programs the company discontinued several years ago.","The $142 million of favorable prior-year development in the reinsurance segments mostly related to treaty casualty and treaty property business both in the United States and internationally. These redundancies have developed over time, but we don't react until the position becomes more mature. We continue to hold our estimates for the more recent years.","Our investments pre-tax investment income was $126 million for the quarter and $549 million for the year on our $16.6 billion investment portfolio. Both the quarter and the year investment income amounts were below last year, as anticipated. This result was primarily driven by the low interest rate environment, the decline in limited partnership income and the amount of cash flow used for share buybacks and the redemption of debt. However, for our investment strategy that diversify into high yield bonds and dividend paying stocks enabled us to exceed our planned investment income for the year.","The increased allocation to equities was also a benefit to net income, as the year reflected $197 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $140 million last year. These gains are mainly attributable to fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio. On income taxes, the effective tax rate is primarily driven by lower than planned catastrophe losses in the year, resulting in higher than expected taxable income for the year. For 2013, operating income effective tax rate was 14.9%. This 14.9% effective tax rate for the year is in line with our expectations and yield with much lower than planned cat losses, as mentioned last quarter.","Total cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $1.1 billion for the year compared to $695 million in 2012. This is primarily due to our premium growth and lower catastrophe loss payment.","As you previously hear, Mt. Logan Re successfully completed its initial capital raise and now has over $360 million of assets under management. This serves to validate Mt. Logan's business model, as investors recognize the value proposition of partnering up with a leading global reinsurer.","Shareholders' equity for the group was $7 billion at the end of 2013, up 3.5% compared to $6.7 billion balance at year-end 2012. This is after taking into account capital return for $622 million for share buybacks and $107 billion of dividends paid in 2013. The company announced a 56% increase in its regular quarterly dividend and paid $0.75 per share in the fourth quarter.","Additionally, we repurchased another $28 million of stock after the year-end close. These purchases will be effected in the first quarter 2014 financial systems. Book value per share increased 12% to $146.57 from $130.96 at year-end 2012. Our strong capital position leaves us with capacity to maximize our potential business opportunities as well as continued share repurchases.","Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide the operations review.","John Doucette","Thank you, Craig, and good morning. As Dom highlighted, we had a solid Q4, finishing a successful year. Our group 2013 gross written premium was $5.2 billion, up $908 million from 2012, with growth coming from all segments of the reinsurance and insurance.","For our reinsurance segments, total reinsurance gross written premium was up 21% in 2013, with new opportunities globally, and all reinsurance segments had increasing gross written premium led by our US reinsurance segment up 38%. We benefited both from a continued [ph] credit quality and Everest being one of the leading US domestic property reinsurers. With over 50% of the global property cat premium emanating from the US, this is an important sustainable competitive advantage for Everest. We write US cat business from the US with the ability to seamlessly provide capacity in any form, excess or loss, pro rata, pro risk, all underwritten by the same underwriting team.","We grew topline on several attractively priced treaties with clients seeking capacity exclusively from domestic traditional reinsurers. In particular, we wrote several large multi-line treaties with US regional companies, a targeted market for us. Total reinsurance bottomline had a $549 million improvement in underwriting profits for the year to $877 million, benefiting from the successful rollout of new product initiatives such as Purple, Everest's pillared product; increased capacity to property pro rata deals where we saw improvement in original pricing, terms and conditions; and new credit related opportunities in multiple places.","Globally, we saw the benefit of Mt. Logan Re in 2013, as we chose to deploy larger lines on deals and increased our cat capacity for key clients. Logan allowed us to manage our net P&L, while growing our topline and having additional flexible capital management such as Logan gives us more flexibility to manage our P&L before winter season. As Dom said, we view capital markets more as a tool than a true competitor.","In several cases, providing clients with more property capacity resulted in securing better signings on deals we wanted in other classes. As a leading multi-class reinsurer, we have the ability and expertise to underwrite all lines of P&C business. This is important to note as less than 25% of our overall business is property catastrophe related.","We wrote several new prop reinsurance and weather deals globally and these performed well in 2013. We continue to develop capabilities here and view weather and agriculture as long-term strategic core competencies.","In 2013, we also wrote some large quote shares both internationally and in the US across various lines. These were strategic transactions with some large global clients. The premium on these deals has not yet been fully reflected in earnings.","We continue to execute on several large one-off transactions from new and existing clients, which require significant reinsurance structuring capabilities, the ability to combine underwriting skill sets across multiple lines of business, manuscript policy awarding expertise, and global capabilities with multiple jurisdictional expertise and paper. We can bring all of this to bear and our ability to execute nimbly and in size with a highly rated balance sheet has been a key differentiator in this competitive market.","Globally, we deployed more fac capacity, increasing shares on well rated program and enhancing our product offering to our fac and treaty clients. To summarize, we are a leading global multi-line reinsurer and we have the culture and organizational structure to react quickly to changing market dynamics and identify strategic opportunities that can enhance the long-term franchise of the group.","Now turning to insurance operation, our premium grew by $195 million in 2013, primarily driven by crop, workers' comp, non-standard auto, property E&S and casualty. However, insurance calendar year results underperformed, as Craig indicated, driven by prior year loss development and a difficult US crop season. The result was an underwriting loss of $147 million. Our crop insurance had an underwriting loss of $57 million in Q4, resulting in an underwriting loss of $68 million in 2013. This was driven by fall in commodity prices, particularly corn, as well as final crop yields that were lower than we originally expected and even what we expected a quarter ago. We saw crop yields fall below average in some areas, where we have a large footprint such as Southern Minnesota due to excess moisture, and in Texas due to abnormally dry conditions in the areas we write in.","We anticipate improved underwriting results in our crop book in 2014 as we continue to build out a more diversified geographic footprint, increased operating efficiencies and roll out new systems. As I stated earlier, ag and weather are long-term strategic focuses for us and the crop business we write through this platform complements that well.","We have a great team at Heartland. We believe that under more normalized circumstances, our crop insurance book will achieve profitable growth along with our ag and weather reinsurance products. Our California workers' comp book saw a 13% rate increases in 2013, continuing the double-digit rate increases for the last several years, providing a compound rate change of over 60% since 2009. Workers' comp writings increased $50 million, mostly from rate increases.","Our current accident year workers' comp combined ratio is in the mid-90%s. Our non-standard auto book grew nicely, given broader geographic mix and economies of scale. And our property E&S book continued to see rate increases, growing over $30 million in 2013 with additional geographic diversification.","Our financial institution book remains profitable, but growth was flat as we remain cautious in light of increased competition. Our casualty and environmental facilities achieved rate increases throughout 2013 and we grew these books.","Other recent insurance initiatives, including our primary A&H, Canadian insurance and contingency business, all continued to enhance the capabilities with new hires, new products and new distribution channels and are poised for profitable growth in 2014 and beyond.","Finally, some color on January 1st reinsurance renewals, which represents approximately 45% of our annual reinsurance premiums. Some key themes we saw at one-one. First, it has become a stratified reinsurance market of haves and have-nots. Everest is solidly in haves and we have found new business opportunities, had strong signings on existing treaties and in some cases differential pricing.","Second, there has been a globalization and consolidation of treaties by several global insurers seeking to both narrow their reinsurance panel to improve security, but also diversify their credit exposure with a broader panel of high-quality reinsurers. This has generally been positive for companies such as Everest with strong ratings and high quality balance sheet.","Third, we are successfully competing with and winning against non-traditional capacity everywhere. In many instances, Everest won placements despite offering higher prices due to our ratings and diversified 40-year-plus franchise, the breadth of our trading relationships with clients globally and our ability to tailor solutions to meet clients' needs and to design products that benefit from structural advantages we have over competitors, which have all proven to be significant competitive advantages.","Furthermore, unlike the non-traditional markets, Everest's promises to pay does not expire, nor do we force a collateral release mechanism into products earlier than the natural expiry of the liabilities being reinsured. Specifically, on one-one renewals, casualty was challenging, especially pro rata, due to demand for expanded terms and conditions. As a result, we did withdraw from some contracts and deployed capacity at higher layers on others. On the other hand, despite headlines on property conditions, we had a successful renewal of our property portfolio globally.","Net written premiums for property grew by $150 million this January 1. Over all territories and all products, our property book combined ratio increased by a couple of points at one-one, but we still saw margin expansion across the whole book at this renewal, as we continue to grow at what we consider to still be attractive returns. Across all classes, we grew reinsurance premium by $300 million or 18% on our one-one reinsurance removal block. And our net reinsurance premium grew by 6%. We accomplished this growth by expanding shares with existing clients on desirable treaty layers, plugging new call to shares at attractive terms and conditions and increasing our marketing of new product and deploying capacity to them.","For example, our Purple premium was up significantly at one-one 2014, as our long-term clients clearly preferred to buy this product from Everest's highly rated traditional balance sheet. The ability to flexibly move between products has been critical to our one-one success. We trade with our clients in many different products in every P&C line of business around the world. We are not beholding to excess of loss or pro rata, nor to reinsurance, retro or insurance. And we will dynamically reallocate capacity to where the best risk-adjusted returns exist. We are not restricted to any product class, premium size. And we continue to roll out many new insurance and reinsurance products in 2014.","Thank you and now back to Beth for Q&A.","Beth Farrell","We are open to questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We will move to our first question from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","In the insurance segment, I am just wondering if we could talk about what book specifically, what year that related to, and can you tell us in the case of the affected books, what is total case in IB&R that you are currently holding? Thanks.","Dom Addesso","","Michael, the first part of your question kind of cut out. Could you just again --?","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs"," ","The reserve development in your insurance segment, you mentioned work comp, construction, and umbrella, so could you give us some color on what accident year is that related to? And just from a magnitude perspective, what's the total case in IB&R that you're currently holding after development for those books?","Dom Addesso","In the insurance segment, we had about approximately $45 million of development in work comp, a little over $40 million in construction liability, and $17 million in umbrella. The construction liability and the umbrella, those are programs that we discontinued several years ago, so that should not be something that we see in our future results. In the workers' comp, part of the development related back to some earlier years, the early part of the 2000 period when we first got into the program, and it's just a matter of some severity in a handful of clients that we saw from the early part of the decade.","We also though did see some increase of frequency of some smaller claims in the later years, primarily in '09, '10, and '11, I believe. And in that particular case, what we've seen in that increased frequency has been contemplated in the more recent accident years, so our more recent accident years do reflect that increased frequency, and I might point out those most recent accident years are profitable.","John Doucette","Mike, I just wanted to add that the majority of the workers' compensation adverse development came from years before our rate increases started to kick in four years ago. We've been getting double-digit rate increases since then as well.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Has that been related to case reserves or do you still hold IB&R for those older years?","Dom Addesso","We still hold IB&R for those, yes. I don't know that we have our disposal right this minute, but it is a split between case and IB&R, so --.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","And then have you had any adverse development, you mentioned, Dom, recent years, was that comp or I'm just curious, because we've heard some commentary about recent professional liability years. Have you seen any adverse development either in recent comp or recent professional liability years specifically?","Dom Addesso","No, we have not seen any development in recent years for professional liability in particular. As I mentioned, the comp where we saw the development on the insurance side was really in the more recent years, was '09, '10, and '11.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","On the renewal comment, this is for John, you seem pretty optimistic about opportunities in property cat. I'm just curious, how are you thinking about opportunities heading into mid-year renewals? I mean do you think that your structure, your market position, or some other differentiator is allowing you to achieve terms in pricing that are materially better than the market? Thanks.","John Doucette","Michael, as we talked about, I think each of us talked about it in a different way on our crafted response, we do believe that we have given our balance sheet, given our market position, given how we access US catastrophe business and the ability to dynamically move between different structures around the globe that we do have an opportunity to get better than market results. As you may recall, we increased our quota share writings in June and July, and we also increased quota share writings at 1\/1, as well as moving -- repositioning the book to better lines that we like that more attractive prices.","Dom Addesso","Mike, let me add to that. In many cases, we're not necessarily going to get different terms and conditions in market pricing, but there are unique circumstances where with certain clients, we have longstanding relationships, the terms that we do get may be different than the market. So I wouldn't say that it's universally in every particular offering that we get terms different than the market. But as John is pointing out, were those terms come to us and it doesn't hit our pricing targets, then we begin to allocate our capacity into other places, whether that be pro rata, facultative, or into the primary space.","So even if terms and conditions are at the market, we still have the ability to not take those terms and conditions, and we can move our capacity into different lines or segments.","Operator","We'll move next to Amit Kumar with Macquarie Capital.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital","I guess two quick follow-ups to the previous question. You had mentioned that some of that piece was from some of the run-off lines. Can you expand on that piece or is that also related to the comp piece?","Dom Addesso","It is not related to the comp piece. These are separate programs. As I mentioned, part of it was construction liability, in particular one program where it's a landscaper's program and because of the additionally insured endorsement that we had on many of those policies, what we are seeing is an increase in expense even though you wouldn't normally expect landscapers to be brought into a construction liability claim, but because of the additional insured endorsement, they are being brought into those matters and it is mostly an expense or defense issue.","The umbrella program again is one that we cancelled a while ago. And again, that umbrella, as you probably know, is a very volatile class of business and we've got hit this year with several large claims, which caused us to increase our estimates in some of the older years.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital","What should give us comfort that this might be hopefully this is the last time that this noise sort of surfaces? What will you say to that?","John Doucette","Well, I guess, Amit, I would say that it's not going to be noise at all. We had $10 billion of reserves. We actually reported an overall reserve redundancy coming through the numbers. And because I've mentioned on previous calls, we manage some 200 different reserve buckets. And there are pluses and minuses in all of those buckets each and every year. These estimates in these particularly are well within the actuarial ranges. It's not anything unusual to those of us that have been around the reserving process for a long, long time that I've been. But I think we're proud to point out that our overall reserve position as a group is positive and our accident year development, if you go back in time for the entity, has been a pretty stellar record relative to how each accident year has ultimately developed at the group level.","Dom Addesso","But here again, you're managing a portfolio and you have individual buckets or lines of business that sometimes develop poorly. And on the other hand, offsetting that would be lines of business that develop redundancy. That is the nature of the beast.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital","The discussion on the increasing cat premiums growth on 18% and net 6%, do you have corresponding P&L numbers, which might have been update post-renewals?","Dom Addesso","Well, we could get into that detail later. Renewals are up about consistently with those premium increases we cited. It's in different regions. It doesn't mean that will end the year, as John pointed out in his opening comments. We have the ability to go into the market before winter season and change that if we so desire. But right now, given our capital position, we're quite comfortable with where our P&Ls are at. And as you probably have noted, through the years that what we carry is our net P&L for (inaudible) are pretty conservative relative to the industry.","Operator","We'll move next to Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Going back a little bit on the reserve issue, I just wanted to understand the process that you go through. Is there an annual reserve that comes in the fourth quarter and this is sort of how it came to be? What's the process right now at Everest Re?","Dom Addesso","We review reserves throughout the year. At the beginning of the year, though, the reserve buckets that we review tend to be the less material buckets. And then as we get into the fourth quarter, we're evaluating our largest lines of business or largest classes of business beginning for most recent data, meaning as of September timeframe. In other words, all the claims data up through September, is accumulated in order to do our year-end reserve review. And that's the process since I've been here in 2009.","And if there is anything, for example, during the year that comes up with some of those smaller classes of businesses, we would certainly book that into our numbers. But generally, given the size of it, it's generally not an issue. And then of course, the larger, more material lines, as I mentioned, we wait until the fourth quarter to accumulate all those studies. Is that what you're asking about?","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","The charges that you took, are they more prone to changing hues on a frequency or severity?","Addesso","As I mentioned, we saw both, but not out of the accident periods. The more recent years, '09 and '10 and '11 was predominantly due to frequency of smaller claims. It's hard to tell maybe due to economic conditions, but nevertheless what we have done is we've factored in that increased frequency into our most recent accident year pick. So that influences the entire booking of all of our results. The severity that we encountered was due to business that has since been discontinued. So there really wasn't any need to make any dramatic adjustment for severity relative to our current book.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","And finally, in speaking about the price kind of reinsurance, going forward, do you see an opportunity for Everest to buy more coverage in mid-year or even thinking about a long-term reinsurance protection plan for the company?","Dom Addesso","As I mentioned in the answer to the previous question, John even made some reference to it, we have the opportunity between now and winter season to look at various structures.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Part of the reason that we decided to start that and are very excited about that is it gives us a lot more flexibility in terms of how we position our footprint and how we manage our capital and our cat P&Ls. And with Mt. Logan Re and other capital market initiatives, whether it's traditional reinsurance or otherwise, we think we can grow the overall book very profitably and keep the P&L to a level that we're comfortable with. And it will be accretive to our shareholders.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Vinay Misquith with Evercore.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","The first question is on the adverse development on the construction liability and umbrella. Curious as to what the liabilities are. So [ph] Rainwater's programs discontinued. So when we can see the end of these claims?","Dom Addesso","Well, on the construction liability, I believe that the seven-year period after which the policy was issued, I don't recollect the exact date, but it was the 2008 was the last policy that was issued. I think the claims can be made in a period of seven years after that date. Obviously our reserve addition was sufficient to answer your question about seeing the end of it. But as you know, again, reserves can always move around. But again, in the context of our overall reserve posture, we don't believe it's going to be a problem.","Umbrella on the other hand, it doesn't have a fixed discovery period, if you will. So umbrella claims can come in for a long time, again a volatile class, but we feel as if what we book is reasonably conservative. And again in the context of our overall reserve position, we don't feel that either one of these classes or lines of business will present a problem for our future financial performance.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","And when was the umbrella program discontinued?","Dom Addesso","Four years ago.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","And then moving on to crop, you said $68 million of losses. I believe crop premiums was about $300 million-ish last year?","Dom Addesso","Yeah.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","So just looking at the combined ratio, that seems to be about 122% combined ratio. Just curious why it would be that high on the crop?","Dom Addesso","Well, our technical ratio was about 112% and then the rest of it's just expenses. And we're a little higher than the industry, at least what's been reported to date, just because of some of the concentration we have in particular as John mentioned in Minnesota and Texas, being some of our largest states, which in fact relative to the industry helped us in better stead last year. Minnesota, for example, has a long history of being very, very profitable state.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","And for '14, what's the targeted combined ratio for the primary insurance corporations, because I believe that on the workers' comp, you said it's mid-90%s. Are the rest of the book representing 94.6%. So looking at '14, what's your targeted combined ratio for the primary business?","Dom Addesso","We believe that the numbers in the low to mid-90s would still be achievable and perhaps better. But for now, I'll leave it at that.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","I think you're changing your business mix, just a tad moving to pro rata versus excess of loss business. Should we see an uptick in the accident year a loss ratio ex-cats because of that business mix shift?","Dom Addesso","Not necessarily. There might be an uptick in certain lines of business due to rate movements, but also as we move the portfolio into other lines of business, particularly new products, that's actually having the impact of lower our attrition in combined ratio. So I'm not going to give you a number at this point, because we don't give guidance. It depends on what the final at the end of the year comes in at, but we're not anticipating an increase in that number. I'll leave it at that.","Operator","We'll move next to Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Greg Locraft - Morgan Stanley","I'm just looking at the profitability out of the insurance segment, and it hasn't been profitable on an underwriting side for many years. I certainly understand the reasons why this particular year, but how do we think about net investment income allocation of this segment? Is it just kind of pro rata with the premiums or is there more investment income being earned out of this book of business?","Dom Addesso","We don't really do a specific allocation if we could talk about it in this call, but I would think about more in the context of a premium allocation.","Greg Locraft - Morgan Stanley","For those of us that are looking, they're not making any money in underwriting, the reality is you're making, call it, $100 million-plus probably in investment income as well, if you would actually break it?","Dom Addesso","But our focus, quite, Greg, is on the underwriting account. That's where our attention is. And we don't rely on the investment income, because at today's yield, that's not really giving you the appropriate return. And as I mentioned, our current year attritions are very good positioned. And given the rate increases, we'll continue to get in California comp, what we're doing in the property in that space, our other strategic initiatives, reinsurance platform, we're quite bullish on it. So the profitability issues that you're seeing are things that relate to frankly a lot of which was discontinued four, five years ago.","Greg Locraft - Morgan Stanley","In crop as well, yeah.","Dom Addesso","The crop in particular, remember, when you look at that, not unlike we look at our reinsurance catastrophe business, right. And also, even though it's reported within the insurance segment, we have capabilities now globally, as John somewhat mentioned in his comments, we look at whether any crop in other jurisdictions kind of jointly have capabilities that we can look across the organization on how we're doing in crop, even though they're reported in two different segments.","Greg Locraft - Morgan Stanley","And then turning to capital management, on the one hand, you bought back 9% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the year, so it was a robust buyback in a strong year. On the other hand, there's only 68% of capital returns via buybacks in dividends on a year. So in a way, you held back. Looks like you haven't done much in the month of January. You've done a little bit, but I'm sort of wondering, stock is below book value. What's keeping you from doing more on the buyback front?","Dom Addesso","We were in January as long as we could be in the month of January. Of course, as you know, at some point, during a month, we begin to know the numbers and we were basically restricted from being in the market. So that's really the only thing that held us back in the month of January. In the fourth quarter, we were buying stock even at above book value. But we couldn't get all of the stock that we wanted at the prices that we wanted it at. So we continue to be bullish on share repurchase, balance that up against what the market opportunities are. As we pointed, we've had a strong one-one and we'll consider that and the upcoming four-one as we evaluate and the price of the stock as we evaluate what our share repurchases will be in this quarter and the upcoming quarters.","But I think it's fair to say that we're still very interested in share repurchases.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields - KBW","Is there any way of ballparking, given the growth that we had in one-one, how much more capital do you think you need this year compared to last year?","Dom Addesso","Well, I guess if you wanted a ballpark that you could relate to P&Ls is in the premium growth.","Meyer Shields - KBW","Was there any adjustment to the accident year '13 losses for workers' compensation in the quarter, given the adverse development on recent years?","Dom Addesso","No, there was none.","Meyer Shields - KBW","Are you confident with the level of pricing that you've been implementing over the last six months?","Dom Addesso","Well, our reserve numbers that we picked in more accident year is what I call bridge off of the previous accident years. So it's taking into account the experience of those years, plus they run top of that rate increases that we've had, and as John pointed out, over 60% cumulative rate increase since 2009, and then subtraction from that would be assumed loss cost trends. So our most recent accident years are a reflection of the development we've seen, plus pricing.","Meyer Shields - KBW","Right. But I guess the question is that you don't know pricing for a while, but the base seems like it would be higher.","Dom Addesso","I'm not sure I understand that question.","Craig Howie","I think what's happened here as well is that you're essentially picking a conservative number to begin with. And we have not let that number come down just because of the pricing.","Operator","And I'll now turn the call back to presenters for any additional or closing remarks.","Dom Addesso","Thank you all for participating on the call. As you've heard, we're quite bullish on our opportunities and trajectory going into 2014. We think we have the capital to take advantage of market conditions, while at the same time continuing our interest in share repurchases.","So again, thank you for your interest.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"8436":["Everest Re Group Limited (NYSE:RE) Q1 2012 Earnings Call April 26, 2012 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Elizabeth Farrell \u2013 VP, IR","Joseph Taranto \u2013 Chairman, CEO","Dominic Addesso \u2013 President, CFO","","Analysts","Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie","Howard Flanker \u2013 Flanker & Company","Ron Bobman \u2013 Capital Returns","","Operator","Good day, everyone and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited First Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Beth Farrell. Please go ahead ma\u2019am.","Elizabeth Farrell","","Thank you, Jim. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group\u2019s first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Taranto, the company\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Dom Addesso, our President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today\u2019s call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements.","Now, let me turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph Taranto","","Thanks, Beth. Good morning. We are pleased with our first quarter results as we generated an annualized operating ROE of 17% and annualized net income ROE of 21% and group book value per share adjusting for dividends by 7%.","Including other comprehensive income, we made over $400 million for the quarter. We bought back a $125 million of our shares, paid $26 million in dividends and still increased our surplus by $260 million.","This increase adds to the already strong excess capital position we had established. Our balance sheet has never been stronger with high quality, low performing assets and reserves that continue to test well. Even though by no means of hard market, we have positioned our portfolio to take the best the market has to offer. We have continued to find opportunities in the property catastrophe market where losses in the last 18 months have driven improved rates, terms and conditions.","Although our expected margins have increased, we had not materially increased our P&Ls in any of the peak zones year-over-year. Since our last call, we have completed the April 1st Japanese renewals and we were pleased with the results. Rates on earthquake excess of loss treaties had increases ranging from 20% to 60% compared to 2011 and from 40% to 150%, when compared to the pre-earthquake 2010 rates. Wins excess of loss treaties experienced rate increases of 10-ish percent following 5-ish percent increases from the year prior. Japanese interest to buy proportional covers were improved to exclude natural perils, which increased the demand for specific excess of loss coverage on these overseas risks.","The next important renewal date for us will be June 1st, when we have our Florida renewals. We anticipate that that will go very well, given the following dynamic. First, the new RMS-11 model increases the need for most buyers to buy more reinsurance at higher model prices while it reduces the risks \u2013 the risk capacity of many of the sellers. Second, the state of Florida will be providing less reinsurance, which will increase the need for professional reinsurance capacity. And third, the underlying homeowners\u2019 insurance rates have been permitted to increase allowing for a bigger healthier premium base.","Moving on to casualty reinsurance, we continue to take a conservative position, essentially keeping our book to long-term declines that we have made money with. Many insurance executives are anticipating meaningful improvements in this market and we hope they are correct, in which phase we would adjust their appetite, but for now, we will continue to hedge our best. ","Our insurance operation continues to show improvement, whereas it ran to a 101 combined ratio for the first quarter, we expect continued improvement for ensuing quarters as rate increases achieved last year and this year on California Workers comp business works its way into the earnings, and our crop premiums which are seasonally in nature will be much heavier in subsequent quarters. Our financial institution D&O, our medical stock loss insurance and our property insurance both continued to produce an underwriting profit. ","On the investment front, we continue to perform quite well despite lowering our duration to better insulators from an upward movement in interest rates. Strong cash flow continues to build our invested asset base. As previously announced, Craig Howie has joined us as Executive Vice President and will become CFO following our first quarter SEC filings. Dom and I, Andrew the large number of qualified candidates for the position, and we were delighted that we were able to attract our number one choice. ","Dom remains CFO for the first quarter and accordingly he will present the financial report this quarter. Craig will be on the next call presenting the second quarter financial report. Now that Craig has joined us, Dom will be able to spend most of his time on the operational side of our business.","Our management team has never been stronger with Dom as President, Craig as CFO, John Doucette as Chief Underwriting Officer for Worldwide Reinsurance and our many strong executives around the world like Mark de Saram, who oversees Bermuda, Europe and Asia, and Ron Diaz, who oversees Latin America and the other international areas.","Last quarter I said I was optimistic about 2012. Clearly now I\u2019m only more optimistic. I like our team, our plan and our portfolio. We have achieved a compounded 13% growth in book value per share including dividends through our 17 year history as a public company. Given our first quarter we are hopeful we will exceed that historical average this year. Dom?","Dominic Addesso","","Thank you, Joe. We are very pleased with the performance in the first quarter. In comparing the results to last year consideration must be given to the catastrophes experienced in 2011. Over the long-term despite the catastrophe levels in recent years, our returns have been quite favorable and this quarter has moved our compound annual growth and shareholder value back towards our historical average.","This most recent quarter with $7.31 growth in book value per share was 6.5% reflects an underlying 21% net income ROE. This return is reflective of the reinsurance attrition combined ratio excluding the impact of restatement premiums, improving 2 points from 85% to 83.2%. It should be noted that the 2012 results include a $20 million provision for the Concordia loss and as adjusted for this would mean that there was an underlying four-point improvement in the combined ratio results.","Rate increases are primary driver of this improvement as well as the portfolio shift and pro-rata to excess contracts in heavily taxed close regions. The favorable impact of rate increases earning through is expected to continue during the year as rate increases on cap exposed business began picking up momentum starting last April after the Japan earthquake.","In this first quarter of 2012, property cap excess of loss in return increased over $15 million or 17.5%. An overall cap exposed premium is up 12% about meaningful increases in CML or peak zones. Premiums in the reinsurance segments were up approximately 9% after adjusting for reinstatement premiums and foreign exchange. This increase was less than the percentage rate increases decided due to shifts in geographic mix as well as shift in capacity to excess of loss from pro-rata.","So, this quarter in addition to the attritional results, there was a catastrophe loss $30 million for the February and March tornados. Despite these events, the reinsurance underwriting gained for the quarter as a result of portfolio change and rate increases as mentioned was at $112 million. On the insurance fund, there has been a similar improvement in the attritional combined ratio when compared to the full year run rate. Insurance operation ended the full year of 2011 at a 106 current year attritional combined ratio.","This year\u2019s first quarter is as expected showing dramatic improvement over that run rate with 101.2 combined ratio. This improvement is in part being driven by over two years of rate increases, most notably in California Worker\u2019s compensation.","Rate increases in casualty and worker\u2019s comp have continued into the first quarter. In addition the insurance portfolio was benefiting from a shift in mix with new products such as crop and ANH insurance and a reduction in certain casualty programs. Insurance premiums are down quarter-over-quarter due to runoffs in certain program business and a light quarter for crop premium.","Last year\u2019s crop business was recorded evenly throughout the year as reinsurance premium. With the shift to the insurance, this business now has a certain seasonality which resulted in only $8 million of first quarter net premium. Nevertheless, we expect approximately $150 million of crop premium for the balance of the year. With an expected combined ratio in the low 90s even more normalized weather (inaudible).","Turning to investment income for the quarter there was $152.4 million of income compared to $178.7 million one year ago or a decline of $26.3 million. The difference is primarily due to the income from limited partnerships. After adjusting for the impact of the $24 million decline in income from the partnerships, core investment income is down by approximately 2% or $2.5 million.","This as a result of declining reinvestment rates offset by new cash flows, which continues to be positive at $166 million this quarter. Capital gains were quite strong for the quarter at $99 million pre-tax and were reflective of the rising equity markets in the first quarter.","The combination of solid investment performance and strong underwriting results, produce net income before taxes of $343 million. Taxes for the quarter of $38 million results in net income of $305 million or $5.68 per share. Operating results, pre-tax equal $244 million and $240 million after-tax. The low effective tax rate on operating income of 1.7% during this quarter was a result of the impact of large realized gains in the quarter on the analyzed effective tax rate calculation and other onetime adjustments. It is expected that the tax rate on operating income will normalize with an overall effective rate for approximately 6% by yearend.","Turning to other miscellaneous items, the $6 million gain on derivatives was comparable to the prior year\u2019s $7.5 million. Again this quarter was a reflection of the rise in equity markets. Other expenses which are mostly foreign exchange losses were just slightly ahead of the prior year are still relatively minor at $6 million. There was no meaningful change in corporate expenses and other underwriting expenses increased by $3.5 million due to timing certain expenses.","Commissions were increased by $2.6 million due to the change in accounting deferred acquisitions costs. Commissions are therefore down on a like-for-like basis due to the shift XOL business which carries lower commissions. This accounting change was adopted prospectively and will impact each of the next four quarters through commission expense for a similar amount.","Adding to our income position this quarter was $80 million of unrealized gains after tax from our bond portfolio as a result of declining yields. When added to our net income plus foreign currency translation gains we totaled $402 million as comprehensive income. After taking into account $25.6 million of dividends, $125 million of share repurchases and ended the quarter at $120.30 at book value per share. Our total capital position of $6.2 billion leaves us with capacity to maximize our business opportunities as well as continue share repurchases.","We\u2019re also pleased to report that our A+ rating from S&P was recently affirmed with a stable outlook.","Thank you. And with that I\u2019ll now turn it back to Beth for Q&A.","Elizabeth Farrell","","Tim, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.","Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan","","Hi, a good morning everybody. Couple of \u2013 just a couple of quick numbers questions before a bigger picture question which is just the Concordia loss what segment was that in or it was spread across multiple?","Joseph Taranto","","It\u2019s U.S. reinsurance.","Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan","","Okay. And then the reinstatement premiums in the quarter, what segment are those booked in?","Joseph Taranto","","International.","Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan","","Okay.","Joseph Taranto","","And they were mostly from last year\u2019s events.","Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan","","Okay. Mostly are from last year. Okay, and then the clock premium that earn the rest of the year, is it fair to assume that probably about 90% of that will earn and the second and third will be written in the second and third quarters?","Joseph Taranto","","The bulk of that will be yes.","Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan","","Okay. And then your tax rate comment I was a little surprised by 6% because that would imply basically no tax on underwriting income if I am doing the algebra correctly. So did I hear that right and is that 6% to run rate and if so why \u2013 what\u2019s the significant change there?","Joseph Taranto","","We are anticipating obviously our effective tax rate to grow to 1.7% to 6% by the end of the year. And that calculation would be any other anticipated adjustments that we might have to attract the tax expense during the year.","Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan","","So, is that like favorable resolution or prior year tax matters, things like that.","Joseph Taranto","","So we shouldn\u2019t play for forward, let\u2019s say in the next year.","Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan","","Probably not. That\u2019s all \u2013 and then, big picture, Joe on Florida \u2013 just with respect to the demand picture because I think one of the \u2013 there are clearly some increased demand citizens though it look like you the capital markets for a bit more of the program that people were anticipating, there\u2019s obviously been a lot of third party capital setup alongside companies and of course in cars and other rather rated entities. I\u2019m just \u2013 how I\u2019d curious if you could just talk to the supply side, I mean how that\u2019s changing relative to demand side?","Joseph Taranto","","You\u2019re right, Matt. There certainly are some moving parts and some go one way and some go the other. Citizens it does seem as if there will be more into the bond market. It\u2019s unclear if they are by and more or less out right reinsurance did. They\u2019d be populating of course with more risk than exposure into other companies and create more meaning for reinsurance. I think the big things are, RMS-11 and the fact that the premium base of reinsurance level is getting healthier. On the supply side, again RMS-11 for many reasons starts to limit the amount of capacity that can provide. I am not seeing any sort of groundswell and our new companies that I think is going to create any sort of meaningful additional capacity for the marketplace. So we do look at the whole equation, I think it will continue to be improvements for re-insurers at 61, that\u2019s my expectation.","Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan","","Okay. And do you think for your portfolio that means \u2013 I mean does that mean growth in terms of \u2013 does that mean growing just with your existing clients let\u2019s say you get rate pass through on pro-rata and maybe with maybe with de-popping just a little bit of up growth in their books, are you expecting on top of that to be putting new accounts on the book as well?","Joseph Taranto","","Well, I would like to see there maybe some new accounts and existing clients will certainly come first. And the limitations will be that we don\u2019t really want to increase our P&L in any significant way in Florida. Of course if there is rate increase, we will be pleased about that.","Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan","","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","","We will now take our next question from Joshua Shanker from Deutsche Bank.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Yes, thank you. I was hoping you might accompany out by walking through reinstatement premiums of 1Q 2011 by segment and then may be talking about exposure growth by various segments reinstatement premium exposure that way?","Joseph Taranto","","Okay. Let me just \u2013 all right reinstatement premium for this year?","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","For the comparing. I\u2019m trying to sort of normalize this year\u2019s numbers with last year\u2019s by segment?","Joseph Taranto","","Okay, just keep in mind that we do have what we are trying to do is looking at the attritional combined ratios excluding the effects of reinstates, we can give you those if that\u2019s easier. But\u2026.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","I\u2019m actually interested in your growth in where you are taking more risk, where you\u2019re taking less risk. It\u2019s hard to describe that with premium, but I would like a qualitative on top of the quantitative I guess?","Joseph Taranto","","We got in U.S. reinsurance this year $337,000 against 16 million reinstate in premium in last year in the first quarter. International $4 million this year versus $9 million a year ago. And Bermuda zero this year against $5 million a year ago. So that brings a total reinsurance of a little over $4 million against a little over $30 million a year ago. ","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Okay, that\u2019s great, Dom. Can you talk about where are you taking more exposure, where are taking less exposure, where and where is the likes for justifying that and what not? I mean can you handle that anyway you want I guess?","Joseph Taranto","","So as we mentioned earlier, in all of your peak zones, our PMLs have not change in many meaningful way. Any exposure growth or stretching at a rag has been primarily in the Midwest with a \u2013little bit of growth in the northeast, but most of our exposure growth has been in the Midwest. ","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","And is that in terms of translate tornado or like new mattered earthquake?","Joseph Taranto","","It would be all (inaudible).","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Okay, okay. ","Joseph Taranto","","There maybe pockets like down just decided where we done more. Again, reacting to the rate changes that happened post the tornado at place last year, but in the name when you get to the big zones and in Japan, and Europe and California and Florida, we really don\u2019t have at least an increase first, at least subject to one sharp loss.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","And then in the Midwest it doesn\u2019t feel one of those zone and it\u2019s as one of the big tree?","Joseph Taranto","","It\u2019s not a big item for us, but it\u2019s a bigger than what is was before, but a sudden known to the peaks own area now.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, very good. I appreciate all the talk.","Joseph Taranto","","(inaudible)","Dominic Addesso","","Josh, there has been other areas where we decreased as well of course.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","And do you want to highlight that I mean, I\u2019m just trying to get much as information as possible?","Dominic Addesso","","No, a little bit of a reduction in quake, some modest reductions in Japan wind, Canadian British Columbia quake, things of that sort.","Dominic Addesso","","I can give you some broad executive summary and it\u2019s broad. Last call I mentioned that we expected to write an additional $100 million to $150 million in pure cat premium on our book of business that still looks to be a pretty good number and yet if you ask me in terms of just worldwide exposure I think if anything were down a bit because terms and conditions they are much better and again the rates being up that\u2019s where I think the premium growth comes from.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Well, appreciated. (Inaudible) very good quarter.","Dominic Addesso","","Thank you.","Operator","","Moving on, we\u2019ll take our next question from Greg Locraft from Morgan Stanley.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Hi, good morning and congrats on a great start to the year. Wanted to just follow up on the commentary regarding book value growth this year, you mentioned you\u2019re hopeful that you can exceed the long term 13% average for the corporation. How do you think about catastrophe losses from here or how do you \u2013 yeah how do you think about catastrophe losses and equity market or partnership returns within that commentary?","Joseph Taranto","","Are you asking about each of them separately or collectively Greg, I\u2019m not sure.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Separately because obviously that\u2019s where the volatility can come in to achieving or missing that target and I\u2019m just curious how you guys both modeled it internally as you think forward. Knowing that it\u2019s impossible to present with (inaudible)?","Joseph Taranto","","Okay. I mean we obviously carry capital against all of the risks in our portfolio and not listed which are the ones, but you mentioned thinking about equity returns for example what we try to do is carry a balanced investment portfolio particularly coming out of 2008, 2009, we saw opportunities to expand our investment portfolio, if you will not within any undue risk. So, we generally would like the direction that our position or the posture of our portfolio and it has obviously performed well over the last couple of years and quarters and particularly in the first quarter.","But we\u2019re not going to necessarily dramatically change let\u2019s say our investment portfolio front of allocation from here but you would like to (inaudible). In terms of the cash degree risk, we still manage our catastrophe risk through about 11 after tax s basis to largest events through about 11%, 12% of the capital. We\u2019re not looking to meaningfully change that. And...","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","I guess tell me if I\u2019m wrong, I think what I\u2019m trying to get\u2026.","Joseph Taranto","","Its (inaudible) business you get some volatility with that. We usually put in about nine points in our plan is to what we would expect in terms of anticipated catastrophes. Obviously, we were below that for the first quarter and when I start looking forward I am going to put back in the average expectation if you will for the future. I think considering that less volatility on our books this year than we had last year. Again between changes in terms and conditions which have been happening both at the insurance levels and at the reinsurance level.","And I think if multiplied to make for a very, very meaningful change. When we start replaying even events like last year at $100 billion under varying scenarios, we just come out with much better answers and much less volatility. So trying to kind of get to the bottom line for you question, yes I\u2019m very expect to have or hope to have good results for the next nine months that give us yearly results that is much better than the historical average. And that certainly will encourage us to continue to buy back stock as well. And I think it will lead good answer, if to say if it\u2019s a year that\u2019s not average if in terms of various catastrophes.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Okay. And then let\u2019s suppose 9 points is what you budget for on tax and then is the equity market assumption like a 7, and 8, and 9, how do you think about that on the investment side? And knowing it\u2019s not perfect?","Joseph Taranto","","The equity markets are going I think even probably guess that is what we have guessed is that it\u2019s been a good place for to us be in the last year. We have an investment meeting every month to decide what we chart to do going forward, but I think we will leave it to you to put expected increases on the equity markets.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Perfect, fair enough. So again on that 13% growth number, if \u2013 and I know it\u2019s a historical and it\u2019s hopefully you beat it and obviously you\u2019re off to a decent start, but that points to earnings of north of 14 bucks a share to get to that level. Streets not even close today to that. So as you guys look at our models what are we missing with regards to the earnings power of Everest Re. ","Joseph Taranto","","Well I think you\u2019re \u2013 what you\u2019re missing currently is the improvement in attritional results. Essentially we\u2019ve highlighted this as an example the additional cap premium we\u2019ve had just in the first quarter. Already taking into account April those that number is now approximately $100 million. Joe mentioned that we expect that 100 to be an increase by the year end over $150 million. So that\u2019s how the dramatic improvement on our attritional combined ratio is. In addition the shift from (inaudible) excess change in terms of conditions is all pointed towards driving that attritional lost ratio down lower.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","And I would add insurance on top of that improving. So put it all together it really improved underwriting with some help from the markets especially in the property catastrophe side, it\u2019s not so much any changes on investments or even future taxes. Share buyback of course will sweeten things but I guess Greg it was being this was what Dom just said improvement on the underwriting side. ","Joseph Taranto","","Perfect. Okay. Great. And then one last one if I could on capital deployment, it was nice to see the buyback in the quarter. Should we be thinking about buybacks plus dividends being at or below operating income going forward and what is your appetite well I guess still 83% of book value now after today\u2019s move given the growth. ","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Look our apatite\u2019s buyback we haven\u2019t issued forecast, but \u2013 and we won\u2019t just we want flexibility but we will continue to buyback and at 83% we think it\u2019s very attractive to buyback. The fact that we have had very good earnings and certainly are hopeful of continued good earnings only encourages us to buyback more. So that\u2019s our formula with net earnings buyback.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Joseph Taranto","","Thank you.","Operator","","Moving on with our next question from Amit Kumar from Macquarie.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie","","Thanks and good morning. Maybe just going back at the discussion on California comp, I wanted you to refresh us, as to what you think is the gap between the earned premium rates versus lost costs?","Joseph Taranto","","Going from the light. Rates that we\u2019re achieving versus how much lost cost are going up?","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie","","Yes, one of the written rate and it\u2019s earned over time. So there is a gap. There is a lag. It lags. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to figure out, do you think that on an earned basis the margin is positive or negative or you know you\u2019re looking to get to at end of 2012?","Joseph Taranto","","We feel that by year\u2019s end we will see positive margins in our California comp book.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie","","May be a sign of the loss cost trends?","Dominic Addesso","","Yeah, let me help. We certainly grade it down. We achieved I think something like 9% increases about two years ago. This rating period increased last year, I believe we averaged 15% and this year, to the first quarter we are averaging 10% and these all compound and we think they are well in excess of plain cost inflation. It\u2019s far to put a number on what plain cost inflation is exactly, but if you want to use half of that might be close to my best guess. That means as the rates continue to play out, we are surpassing plain costs to buy pretty decent margin and that\u2019s why we think each quarter just on the back of that should be better and by the end of the year if not sooner we\u2019ll be booking underwriting profits on (inaudible) income.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie","","Got it. Okay that\u2019s helpful. I guess the other question was just going back to the discussion on fixed one and your P&Ls being flat at 12% or so. I\u2019m curious just based on the market opportunities you\u2019re talking about, why not move that number higher, just based on the margin you might be getting on that?","Dominic Addesso","","It\u2019s a good question and certainly we debate it. But we have some other great opportunities like buying stock back and so we want to limit volatility to make sure that we can act on that front as much as we want to as well. So I think it\u2019s just a question of how much did we build on the various opportunities that we have.","Joseph Taranto","","There\u2019s also opportunities to deploy our capital as I mentioned earlier and spread our aggregate to other parts of the U.S. and around the globe and continue to balance up that portfolio as rate increases outside of Florida present themselves and we like deploy our capital in the most diversified way. So that helps us to do that as well.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie","","Got it. Okay thanks. Thanks for the answers.","Operator","","We will now take our next question from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Thanks. Just couple of questions I guess, one is starting at the insurance segment trying to understand talking about 2012 premiums versus 2011 so, you had to star fade out 2011 and you had a family crop was booked as reinsurance in 2011 I\u2019m assuming it was in this segment, and now it\u2019s going to be written on your own paper in 2012. I mean, you have the new NAH business, so just trying to think about, what is that look like growth at the 2011 \u2013 just kind of with all these puts and takes from just the top line perspective?","Joseph Taranto","","I would anticipate that it would be kind of flattish by \u2013 for the year on the insurance front.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Okay. And then, with crop, I\u2019m guessing that the expense in loss ratio kind of look differently than the rest of the book. Should we assume then that the combined ratios look differently in the center and kind of a two center quarters of the year versus the edges or are there \u2013 are there contributing factors that would make that less relevant?","Joseph Taranto","","I think that you are right. I think what you\u2019re focusing on is the expense ratio on the insurance side was obviously challenged a little bit, not probably so, but a little bit by the fact that the crop premium in particular was not heavy number in the first quarter. So as that begins to emerge to \u2013 back towards that annualized $150 million or $160 million number, we\u2019ll enjoy the benefit of a lower expense ratio in the succeeding quarters.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Great. One question I guess just on capital end, you\u2019re (inaudible) clearly biologically big in the first quarter not relative to last year, but just even going back further in that, it was a large quarter for buybacks. You talked about writing more cap business in your PMLs and not reason, I guess, just kind of wanted to understand \u2013I am guessing as you were saying before, geographic concentration. But would you expect, as you go through the year to see PMLs rise either from driving more business at June 1 or just the impact of continuing to buyback your own stock?","Joseph Taranto","","I don\u2019t anticipate any wrath, I really like the formula that we\u2019ve been using which is we don\u2019t want increases in exposures if anything we probably want less, but we want more margin and more premium. I think that\u2019s the sign of an improving market, I think that\u2019s what we want our underwriters to achieve.","Again, this is all coming on the back of lot of losses that were paid last year and so I think it\u2019s proper. So I\u2019d just like \u2013 I just like to be planned as it currently is and at least for this year I\u2019m not envisioning any increase in P&L, certainly not in the (inaudible).","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","So I \u2013 what are you expecting this to see, I mean out of four, I mean if \u2013 it sounds like you mentioned that conditions are improving, you\u2019re optimistic heading into 61. So should we read that to mean that you \u2013 if everything worked out the way you wanted to your exposure wouldn\u2019t change, you would just be earning more on that business and I guess the question is \u2013 is there a rate at which you would write more of that business than you are currently expecting if conditions are better?","Joseph Taranto","","It might be something modestly more, but it won\u2019t be something tremendously more, I think what \u2013 where we are looking for is less volatility, more profitability and the ability to again to continue buy back the stock. So I think it\u2019s a good spot, I think that\u2019s the sweet spot for us at this point. So we are not looking to any significant way to increase cash exposure in the peak sums. We have found opportunities in resilience that we didn\u2019t have log exposure, Dom mentioned the Midwest where we weren\u2019t there before the last year or so. And we will continue to look for other opportunities around the world, but we don\u2019t expect any big increase in P&L in Florida, even though we do expect improved conditions.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","","Moving on we\u2019ll take our next question from Howard Flanker from Flanker & Company.","Howard Flanker \u2013 Flanker & Company","","Hello, I have two questions, one in your usual releases your loss ratio differs from the loss ratio in the 10-Qs, why is that?","Joseph Taranto","","You have to be more specific in\u2026.","Howard Flanker \u2013 Flanker & Company","","For example, I haven\u2019t looked through this year 10-Q, but last year in the 10-Q the loss ratio was 120.4, and in your announcement was 123.6, and that\u2019s happened for a number of quarters, so you are using some different measures, I want to know what the difference could be\u2026.","Joseph Taranto","","There could be reinstatement premiums, the impact of reinstatement premiums.","Howard Flanker \u2013 Flanker & Company","","Wouldn\u2019t you know that when you announced your quarter?","Joseph Taranto","","Of course we do, but I don\u2019t have the specifics in front of me, so I\u2019m struggling a little bit with\u2026.","Howard Flanker \u2013 Flanker & Company","","Well, I don\u2019t know what the loss ratios is going to be in the 10-Q, but this year you said the loss ratio was 60.4 and last year the similar number is 123.6, correct? First page of your release, but if you look at the 10-Q on the table that 123.6 became what did I say 124.4.","Joseph Taranto","","I should flip the pages. ","Howard Flanker \u2013 Flanker & Company","","Yeah, it\u2019s on page 28 in the Q and there is a difference, so I do not understand the difference.","Joseph Taranto","","I don\u2019t have the data with me.","Dominic Addesso","","We would be happy to call you back and do the reconciliation.","Howard Flanker \u2013 Flanker & Company","","Okay. And then you used the term, that where I\u2019m not acquainted, it\u2019s not run off but rates of the premium, I forgot the word my memory slipped me.","Joseph Taranto","Well I was referencing on the insurance side, I was referencing the run off of certain programs and essentially what I was referencing there was this is that was terminated and of course using the term run off applying that premiums would be coming down each and every quarter, as that\u2026","Howard Flanker \u2013 Flanker & Company","","That I understand. That\u2019s not the word I was thinking. There\u2019s another word you used and I haven\u2019t heard it used very much. It wasn\u2019t underlying premium, it was another word, I\u2019ll probably have to get back in queue and I\u2019ll ask\u2026","Joseph Taranto","","We\u2019ll go through when we chat with you.","Howard Flanker \u2013 Flanker & Company","","Okay, thanks.","Joseph Taranto","","Thank you.","Operator","","And moving on we\u2019ll take our final question from Ron Bobman from Capital Returns.","Ron Bobman \u2013 Capital Returns","Sounds like you (inaudible) I wanted to talk about with Howard after the call. I just had a follow up \u2013 sort of more qualitatively than anything specific about your exact reserves. Qualitatively about Thailand I\u2019m just sort curious as to what\u2019s happening there claim wise? Obviously more time has passed since the flooding, is there a lot more certainty, I know is a strong word, but sort of the risk of variability in claims \u2013 claim amounts et cetera, could you just talk about what\u2019s transpired over the last I guess, almost six months or so. ","Dominic Addesso","","That\u2019s a fair question. Of course \u2026","Ron Bobman \u2013 Capital Returns","Thanks, Dom.","Dominic Addesso","","Right up until year-end of course it was obviously saw a lot of upward pressure on claims from Thailand, late reporting et cetera. We did it of course a deep dive on the events there in closing out the yearend. We\u2019ve had and of course we do the same thing every quarter with all of our events. And I\u2019m happy to report that this particular quarter has been very stable.","As you do know that the yearend, we had some additional provisions that we made, given the uncertainty of 2011 around all of those events, I\u2019m also pleased to say that we\u2019ve not seen any movement around that number. So that\u2019s been stable, we had no reason to quite frankly utilize that IBNR at this point. So it still exists there in the event that there is some volatility around those results, but pleased to report that it\u2019s has been very, very stable. Does that answer..","Ron Bobman \u2013 Capital Returns","Yeah, I was a little sort of a little sort of qualitative and specifically about any risk or actual movements in your numbers just there\u2019s all sorts of claims that following, immediately following these events, people talking about BI, CBR, the linkages and I was just sort of qualitatively to answer Joe\u2019s thoughts?","Joseph Taranto","","Yeah, I do think that in the case of CBR for example, I think the industry is obviously very worried about that early on, and that seems to have tempered quite a bit. I don\u2019t think the loss is actually reached a level that the industry had feared. ","Ron Bobman \u2013 Capital Returns","Okay. Thanks a lot for your thoughts. Appreciate it and best of luck. Hope that continues.","Joseph Taranto","","Thank you.","Operator","","And at this time that will conclude today\u2019s questions-and-answer session.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Beth Farrell","Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, and welcome to Everest Re Group's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting Officer; and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and alike are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements.","Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.","Dom Addesso","Thanks, Beth. Good morning. We are very pleased to report record operating earnings for the year and quarter. Net income was slightly below that in 2013 due mainly to less realized gains on investments. However, as a result of share buybacks net income on an earnings per share basis was higher year-over-year at just under $26 per share.","Most of our areas of our operations had excellent results which contributed to the overall result. The reinsurance segments continue to be the main engine and another good year was posted with the absence of many cats. The underwriting result was flatting year-over-year and while the combined ratio slipped two points, the portfolio was still generating above average returns. This slippage and combined ratio points will be discussed in great detail by Craig and John but a couple of general factors accounted for this increase. These would include the business mix shift and in our international operations a higher attritional loss ratio due to shock losses and storm losses not classified as cats.","Declining rates overall are also a factor but we have muted much of that by moving attachment points to more attractively priced layers and buying external reinsurance in the capital markets and from traditional providers.","The flexibility and adaptability to the market has been one of our point, in fact in many cases due to our capital structure which effectively includes Mount Logan and our sponsored [indiscernible]. We have the ability to put out more capacity with the same or less net peak zone P&L exposure and better risk-adjusted returns.","Overall, the net returns on the cap portfolio in 2-14 were higher than the gross returns due to efficient capital management with the purchase of third-party reinsurance. As a result, the absolute margins on our property portfolio on an expected basis were up despite an annual expected loss from tax of approximately 12 points on our underwriting combined ratio. This resulted in an increase in the ROE in this business as we deployed our aggregate across the more diversified portfolio rather than expanding net exposures in any of our peak zones.","One of the few challenges in the portfolio last year was our crop book which suffered $64 million on loss, primarily due to a severe commodity price decline, which accounted for $36 million. But the remainder coming mostly from crop hail losses.","Over the past couple of years, the industry has suffered a bit in this class but over the longer term it has been a good business. The crop division caused our insurance operations to incur an underwriting loss for the year. However, the improvement in the balance of the book has been notable. Excluding crop, the insurance operation produced an underwriting profit of $15 million. On an [indiscernible] basis that portfolio was now running around at 95% combined ratio. This has been a good turnaround story.","Worker\u2019s comp continues to benefit from rate increases in our growth initiatives and property and casualty ENS lines and speciality lines are all contributing to premium growth and profit. ","Among other notable items in the quarter was the adjustment in our various reserve positions.","Overall, the impact from reserves was minimal but yet favorable. We did add approximately $140 million to our [indiscernible] reserve enabling us to increase our survival ratio to its historical levels.","It had recently dropped due to an increased level of payment activity during year. This area is difficult to estimate but we felt that prudent to increase the reserves to be a more conservative position.","Other reserve adjustments were in the insurance segment for run-off lines. These various charges, however, had no meaningful net impact on results due to redundancies in other areas. Overall, a very sound reserve position with a track record of favorable access New Year development in each of the last ten plus years. ","Investment income continues to trend downward due to low rates in the fixed-income markets. However the fourth quarter was a bit stronger than earlier quarters due to limited partnership income in our alternative asset category. We have no immediate plans to make significant shifts in our allocations so with these interest-rate levels, we should expect the downward trend in book yield to continue into 2016. The impact on net investment income of declining yield will be somewhat offset by any increase in investable assets.","The rate of premium growth into 2015 will likely slow the decline reinsurance price environment and are increasing selectivity. However, we continue with new products in the reinsurance segments and our insurance segment will continue to be an area of great [indiscernible]. Of note is that more than half of our expected underwriting profit after consideration for normalized catastrophe losses is derived from non-cat expose business","These other lines of business have therefore been an important area to focus as mitigated rate pressures as well as providing for a more diversified portfolio.","Share buybacks continued in the fourth quarter, as well as an increase in our dividend. Capital return to shareholders totaled almost $650 million in 2014. Nevertheless, equity capital increased $500 million dollars during the year which gives us capacity for growth opportunities during 2015 and beyond.","Given the market conditions ahead, we would expect to continue share repurchases in 2015. Since 2006, we have repurchased 36% of outstanding shares and returned $3.4 billion of capital and at the same time through equity of 46% from $5 billion to $7 billion. The level of share purchases in the future will of course be dependent on business opportunities.","We remain committed to finding profitable growth through new initiatives and increasing our returns from capital alternatives. Our responsive, flexible and adaptive style will no doubt continue to create opportunities in the year ahead.","Thank you and now to Craig for the financial report.","Craig Howie","Thank you, Dom and good morning, everyone. Everest start another strong quarter earning with net income of $340 million or $7.47 per diluted common share. This compares to net income of $365 million dollars or $7.54 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014. Net income includes realized capital gains and losses. For the year, Everest had net income of $1.2 billion dollars or $25.91 per share compared to $1.3 billion or $25.44 per share in 2013. The 2014 result represents a return on equity of 17%.","Operating income for the year was $1.1 billion or $24.71 per share. This represents a 15% increase over operating income of $21.47 per share last year. These record operating results were driven by a strong underwriting result, foreign exchange gains and lower income taxes compared to 2013. The increase in underwriting income was partially offset by a lower derivative result and lower net investment income compared to 2013.","The results reflect a slight increase in the overall current year attritional combined ratio of 82%, up from 81% last year. This measure excludes the impact of catastrophes, reinstatement premiums and prior-period loss developments.","All reinsurance segments reported underwriting gains for the quarter and for the year. Total reinsurance reported in underwriting gain of $275 million for the quarter compared to $390 million dollars underwriting gain last year.","For the year, total reinsurance reported in underwriting gain of $862 million compared to an $877 million gain last year. The insurance segment reported an underwriting loss of $36 million for the quarter compared to a loss of $156 [ph] million last year.","For the year, the insurance segment reported an underwriting loss of $49 million compared to a loss of $147 million in 2013. The 2014 results reflected a crop loss of $64 million for the year, comparable to last year, but lower prior period loss reserve development in the insurance segment.","The Mt. Logan Re segment reported a $26 million dollars underwriting gain from the quarter compared to $4 million underwriting gain for the same period last year. For the year, Mt. Logan reported an underwriting gain of $73 million compared to a $9 million gain in 2013. Everest retained $14 million of the underwriting income and $59 million was attributable to the non-controlling interests of this entity in 2014.","The overall underwriting gain for the group was $265 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $238 million for the same period last year. For 2014, the underwriting gain was $887 million compared to a gain of $739 million in 2013.","These results reflect $15 dollars of current catastrophe losses in the fourth quarter of 2014, related to the Brisbane, Australia hail storms. This compares to $30 million of cats during the fourth quarter of 2013. The fourth quarter of 2014 also included favorable development on prior year cap losses, primarily from Sandy losses in 2012. For the year catastrophe losses were $62 million in 2014 compared to $195 million in 2013.","Our reported combined ratio was 82.8% for the year 2014 compared to 84.5% in 2013. The 2014 commission ratio of 22.0 was slightly up from 20.6% in 2013 primarily due to higher contingent commissions on several years of profitable results.","Our expense ratio remains low at 4.6% for the year compared to 5.0% in 2013. Everest has one of the lowest internal expense ratios in the industry. We believe each point of lower expense ratio translates to about a half point of hire ROE. This is truly a strategic competitive advantage for Everest.","On reserves, we completed our annual loss reserve studies. The results of the studies indicated that the overall reserves remain adequate. In the fourth quarter, we booked prior year development in the insurance segment and for asbestos which was more than offset by favorable development in the reinsurance segment.","The $20 million dollars of prior year reserve development in the insurance segment during the quarter was largely related to construction liability and umbrella business. These run-off programs were discontinued by the company several years ago. The $30 million of favorable prior-year development in the reinsurance segments reflects $167 million of favorable development. This was offset by $137 million increase in asbestos reserves.","The asbestos charge can be split into two components. First, the reserves associated with the company\u2019s assumed reinsurance business were strengthened by $100 million after completing our normal exposure analysis. In part to bring the survival ratio more in line with our historical trend. Second, the asbestos reserves related to Mt. McKinley's direct insurance business were increased by $37 million.","Everest has entered into a letter of intent to transfer the Mt. McKinley asbestos reserves to another company. The proposed transaction indicated $37 million dollars of funding would be required for the other company to assume the liabilities, so no additional increase will be needed should the transfer be completed.","The $167 million of reinsurance favorable development, mostly related to treat the casualty and treaty property business both in the United States and internationally. These redundancies have developed over time but we don't react until the position becomes more mature. We continue to hold our estimates for the more recent years.","For investments, pre-tax investment income was $134 million for the quarter and $531 million for the year, a $17.4 billion investment at total. Investment income was below last year as anticipated. This result was primarily driven by the low-interest environment and the decline in limited partnership income. Also, the cash flow used for share buybacks and the redemption of debt contributed to this lower income.","The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.2% as compared to 3.5% in 2013. Limited partnership income was down $6 million year-over-year. However, our diversified investment strategy enabled us to exceed our planned investment income for the year.","The increased allocation to equities was also a benefit to net income, as the year reflected $55 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $197 million last year. These gains are mainly attributable to the fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio. A derivative loss of $60 [ph] million was recorded in the fourth quarter reflecting a change in the estimated valuation of our equity index put option contracts to include a better estimate for expected future dividends. This change resulted in cumulative catch up loss adjustments over the seven open option contracts.","On income taxes, the 2014 operating income effective tax rate was 12.2%. This 12.2% effective tax rate for the year was in line with our expectations for a year with much lower than planned cap losses and the addition of foreign tax credits utilized. ","Strong cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $1.3 billion for the year compared to $1.1 billion in 2013. This is primarily due to our premium growth and lower catastrophe lost payments","Shareholder\u2019s equity for the group was $7.5 billion at the end of 2014, up 7% compared to the $7 billion balance at year-end 2013. This is after taking into account capital return for $500 million of share buybacks and $146 million of dividends paid in 2014. The company announced the 27% increase to its regular quarterly dividend and paid $0.95 per share in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we repurchased another $36 million of stock after the year end close. These purchases will be reflected in the first quarter 2015 financial statements.","Book value per share increased 14% to $166.75 from $146.57 at year-end 2013. Our strong capital balance positions us well for potential business opportunities as well as continue share repurchases.","Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide the operations review.","John Doucette","Thank you, Greg. Good morning. As Dom highlighted we had a strong Q4 finishing a very successfully year. Our group gross written premium for Q4 was 1.4 billion up 7% from Q4 in 2013 with the growth coming from all reinsurance segments.","Our group net written premium was $1.3 billion which was up $40 million or 3% over Q4 2013. For the full year, our group wide 2014 premium was 5.75 billion up 530 million of 10% from 2013. Our group net written premium was 5.26 billion up 250 million or 5%.","Let me start with our reinsurance segment. I will focus more on the full year results for 2014 then turned to our January first renewals to give you some color on what we are seeing in the market and some themes as to how we are navigating it.","For our global reinsurance segments including both Total Reinsurance and Logan, gross premium was $4.5 billion up 15% with growth coming predominantly from our U.S. and international reinsurance segments. Net premiums were $4.2 billion up 7% as we continue to pursue our retrocession strategy to lay off some of our catastrophe exposure and lower our cost of capital.","Our reinsurance book including Mt. Logan generated $935 million of underwriting profit, a 5% improvement compared to 2013. These results highlight the success of the initiatives we have put in place over the last couple of years to achieve profitable, reinsurance growth, including the introduction of several new reinsurance products such as Purple Everest Color Product.","Deploying increased capacity to pro-rata deal where we saw attractive original pricing terms and conditions. Pursuing new credit related opportunities to various territory, developing new strategic relationships across the globe with several key reinsurance clients, increasing line capacity on several attractively priced property catastrophe treaties aided by Mt. Logan Logan. Developing increased penetration and breath of our international faculty of book, growing our regional footprint and leveraging our competitive strength to become reinsurer on various treaties in multiple countries allowing us to drive terms and conditions. These initiatives have broadened and enhanced both our broker and client relationships which in turn has provided new opportunities to expand our writings, whether it is on new program or layers or larger shares of existing treaties with our long-standing clients and despite a challenging rate environment, we achieved profitable growth as evidenced by the results of 2014.","So what are we say in for 2015? Certainly it continues to be a challenging market with rate offs between 5% and 15% depending on the line of business and territory but having said that we were able to achieve better than market results, given our rating, long-standing client and broker relationships, broadly diversified portfolio and our underwriting diligent and flexibility.","We take an objective view of each deal at renewal and will scale back or non-renew deals we do not like and redeploy capacity to deal in layers which we find to be better priced. This mitigated the downward impact on our portfolio.","Let me provide you a bit more color on January first reinsurance renewals in which we wrote about $2.1 billion of treaty premium which represents approximately 45% of our annual reinsurance treaty premiums. Catastrophe excess of loss business represented roughly 25% of this renewal. This is an important point that you have all heard market participants expound on the double-digit rate decline in this sector while we are not immune to these pressures, 75% of our renewal was in line outside of property cat excess of loss which speaks to the diversity of our portfolio and a mitigate to just following the general market down.","We also have Mt. Logan which provides efficient capacity to support this line. We continue to see robust, ongoing investor appetite for the Everest Logan value proposition highlighted by Logan's best in class, risk-adjusted returns to investors.","As of 01\/01\/2015 we raised approximately $270 million of additional funds and Logan now stand at about $690 million dollars of assets under management and 100% of Logan\u2019s capacity was fully deployed at the 1\/1 renewal.","During 2014, Logan generated approximately twenty eight million dollars of earnings for Everest, including fees. Property related and short tail business outside of catastrophe excess of loss represented another 50% of the renewal writings and while much of this has a cat component, it is balanced by risk premium.","Putting up larger capacity on short-tail deals we like, and in general moving up attachments on property excess of loss players soften the impact of some of the rate reduction.","Our 1:1 [ph] cat-expose premium saw a couple of points of deterioration in the combined ratio but both are expected cat premium and dollar cap margins are approximately flat compared to last year,","USA rates held up pretty well but we saw more competition this renewal in Latin America, Canada, and China. Rates in Europe were also under pressure. For Purple, we saw some undisciplined competition in that space so we redeployed some capacity away from purple to some of our long-standing [indiscernible] clients. Overall, we did see three point drop in our expected ROE at this 1:1, one a worldwide property actual book as the deal that many of the clients are now buying are more capital intensive. We believe this highlight and validates our property retrocessional strategy with the increased use of Logan, Kilimanjaro issuing $950 million of cap on and other non-traditional and traditional sessions to manage our net cat PMLs and lower our cost to capital. As a result of these strategies, our net ROE continues to be greater than our gross ROE on our worldwide property cat book.","Casually remains challenging, especially pro-rata due to demands for expanded terms and conditions. As a result, we continue to withdraw from some contracts, move from quota share excess loss and deploy capacity at higher layers on others. We saw a new opportunity that at 1:1, outside of the mainstream that meaningfully added to our top line. This includes a large motor, quota share in Europe, a large international professional liability quote share, increased lines for some of our global client that were only offered to Everest and surplus relief deals that were not widely marketed too many reinsurers.","These new deal offset some of the premium from the quota share deal and excess of loss deals which we non-renewed at 1:1 2015. Four themes helped us this 1:1. Number one, we have one of the lowest internal expense ratios in the industry with our total reinsurance segment carrying only a 2.9% expense ratio. Therefore, we get more dollars of margin and a higher ROE on the same premium than others do. Number two: we are more diversified than most of our competitors, we use our capital across more zone and perils and that naturally lowers our internal cost of capital. Number three: the retrocessional strategy of Logan, Kilimanjaro Cat on, IOWs and other traditional and non-traditional sessions lowers our cost of capital further. And number four: our reinsurance operational structure is another sustainable competitive advantage.","Everett has one view of risk around the globe but we deploy capacity to our clients by senior lead market experienced underwriting team in a decentralized fashion and empower those teams to make decisions. This allows us to know our customers very well and move quicker and in scale better and faster than our competitors who write only few lines of business or who right out of one, only one or two offices.","Across all classes on a constant foreign exchange basis, our gross reinsurance premium at 01\/01\/2015 was approximately flat compared to last 01\/01. Our net reinsurance premium declined by about 2% this one 01\/01 as we reassured more of our book with the growth in Mt. Logan at UM and the capacity provided by the Kilimanjaro caps on. In addition to increase use of other traditional reinsurance to effectively protect our net position. We are to be the outcome of our 1:1 renewal despite market condition and expect 2015 to be another, strong year for our reinsurance book.","Being innovative and providing ideas and solutions to our clients as well as our ability to execute quickly and incise it is now more important than ever. Our focus on new business opportunities, new products, new distribution sources and leveraging our competitive strength remains key to our underwriting success.","With our balance sheet, ratings and ability to nimbly deploy both rated capacity and unrated capacity inside the support our business, we have more tools in our toolkit to compete and win against non-traditional capacity as well as other traditional reinsurers.","Now turning to our insurance operations, we wrote $300 million of insurance premium in the fourth quarter and wrote $1.2 billion for the year for both the quarter and the full year that is down about 5% compared to the same period last year but removing crop insurance both the quarter and the full year are up approximately 10% in premium with growth coming from each large insurance units.","The insurance growth initiatives that we have put in place over the last couple of years have been providing benefits to the top and bottom line, these include staffing up underwriting operation and expanding both the relationship, both property and casualty, increasing our property insurance geographic footprint, driving international insurance expansion, including growing our existing Canadian platform and building out new product distribution and strategic relationships within our specialty insurance operation both in the U.S. and internationally.","The insurance calendar year results [indiscernible] lost due to our crop results which is consistent with what we've been discussing on prior earnings calls. Excluding crop, our insurance operation ran to a $50 million underwriting profit. This was almost a 100 million dollar improvement in underwriting results year-over-year.","Our crop insurance book had an underwriting loss of $22 million in Q4 resulting in a calendar year underwriting loss of $64 million in 2014. These results were driven by four issues: lower commodity prices during 2014 particularly for corn, below average result in Minnesota, our largest state and typically are most profitable, significant losses and crop hail due to an unusual number of hailstorms throughout the Midwest, higher expenses associated with new technology and IT initiatives.","We anticipate improved underwriting results in our crop book in 2015 with a larger, more diverse book of business and increased operating efficiencies derived from an updated systems infrastructure.","In other lines of business in terms of rates, we continue to see rate increases in her California workers comp book of about 7% but the rate increases have slowed as more competition is coming to that space.","General liability was up about 7% for the quarter. Professional liability rates were down about 5% and property insurance rates were also down about 5%. As before we continue to roll out many new insurance and reinsurance products in 2015, we are hopeful for meaningful growth in our insurance operations as we capitalized on opportunistic expansion both geographically and cross product lines.","Thank you and now back to Beth for Q&A.","Beth Farrell","Yes Kelly, we are open now for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] we have our first question from Amit Kumar from Macquarie. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Amit Kumar","Congrats on the quarter. Just a few clarification type of questions. Number one, just going back to the discussion on Mount McKinley. How much -- what's the size of the reserve status being shipped off from that?","Dom Addesso","Now McKinley is about $150 million in reserves that would be transfer.","Amit Kumar","And that\u2019s in Q1?","Dom Addesso","Well, we don't know when the transaction will close. We have to go through all the regulatory approvals and things like that but I would suggest that it probably would be the beginning of Q2.","Amit Kumar","Okay, that's helpful. The other question I had was on, this goes back to the discussion on renewals, and thank you for the expanded commentary this quarter. In terms of some of the new opportunities which you talk but I think you mentioned a motor quota share and a large international account, do you have some sense of, why was it shifted to you and how did it perform previously. I am just trying to get a sense why it was non-renewed by the previous reinsurer.","Dom Addesso","I am not sure Amit that we can really get into that level of detail relative to prior are reinsurance, in some cases it might not be into the transaction that it had been in the market. A number of these deals that John has went through, are surplus driven or financially driven transactions and probably they do have transferring them of course but it's capital relief type products in some cases and in another cases it is helpful companies as they have managed their capital at various subsidiaries around the world. So they are all different. Why is Everest the company of choice? Some of things that John mentioned, I think are important to us. I think in community at large, I think we hope that we're viewed as an innovative market and the market that is quick to respond, flat organizational structure so that any significant transaction can quickly get to John's desk or my desk if it needs that level of approval and strong writing and the global footprint. Now those are all reasons that we have been emphasizing and that's what we found as why are a market of choice in many of these unique transactions.","Amit Kumar","I guess what I was trying to figure out is and I am just a bit surprised that you have had these opportunities for few quarters. And I'm just trying to figure out if it's a size issue why some of your peer companies have not been able to capitalize and find similar opportunities.","Dom Addesso","It's hard to generalize. I do think in parts, it\u2019s the size issue, it could be a ratings issue, it could be the fact that these are not the types of transactions that this company has shown an interest and had a risk appetite for. It's hard for me to explain what the reason might be.","Amit Kumar","Okay. And just finally, any change in the buyback philosophy versus as it relates to your discussion on premiums, should we anticipate that to be any different versus what we've seen in the past. Thank you. ","Dom Addesso","I think what I've tried to emphasize in my comments was that we bought back a significant return to significant amount of capital in the several years. I would anticipate that we continue to do that given the current market conditions but obviously if the market changes, then change direction on how much capital would it return. So I don\u2019t anticipate any major change at this point. This is what I think be the short answer to your question.","Amit Kumar","Got it, thanks for the answer and good luck for the future.","Dom Addesso","Thank you, Amit.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open please go ahead.","Michael Nannizzi","Thanks, just a couple of here if I could. The expense ratio in international reinsurance in Bermuda in particular lifted in the fourth quarter. Was there something that happened that was kind of fourth quarter-specific in particular in Bermuda, or maybe there was some other driver. Thanks.","Craig Howie","In the fourth quarter, we typically had compensation related accruals at year-end and I hope you recall. Again, we had a record quarter of results in the fourth quarter as well. ","Michael Nannizzi","Okay but even with the year-over-year comps and the fourth quarter of the last year was pretty good too. So that's all just incremental comp that we should be thinking about, and it's just specifically in Bermuda?","Craig Howie","No, the majority of it is, where you are seeing it may be even in total segments, compared to third quarter into fourth quarter.","Dom Addesso","Michael I wouldn\u2019t look too much into individual segments because each of those are subject to individual accruals and year-end adjustments. I think the main topic is the overall group and the difference in the fourth quarter was what Craig specified which was predominantly compensation adjustments as relates to putting them on with our year-end results. So the individual segments can be, [indiscernible] of factors that are local.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay, great. Thanks. And then, Dom, you mentioned the net ROE versus the, I am sorry John mentioned the net versus gross ROE. Just trying to understand, I imagine that includes the difference is in part Mt. Logan because you seed some business to Mt. Logan. So just trying to understand the relationship over the ROE at Mt. Logan versus the ROE at Everest","John Doucette","Good morning, Michael this is John. We have talking about this for several quarters that there is difference by having rated and unrated capacity, there is different constraints to different capital requirements and it is not just cost to capital but it is also that there is different ROE for a rated company is impacted by how rating agency think of the capital that you need to hold to support the businesses and so it gives us the ability to find right fit for business but dealing across the portfolio, Logan is very critical for that but it is also part of a broader strategy than involved the cap on and other traditional sessions that we have and it allows us to kind of and also within Mt. Logan we have different investor appetites, low-risk, medium risk, high risk that results and lower return, medium return and high return and having that combination gives us a lot more flexibility to be able to deliver the most value for our client and have the best in that position for Everest.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay and then Dom, I think you had mentioned, in your opening remarks that cat business represents about half of the underlying profit or of the profit on a run-rate basis, I guess, when you adjust for model cats. Can you share what was that percentage in 2014 on an actual basis? Do we have that?","Dom Addesso","The number is probably somewhere between $300 million and $400 million of underwriting profit, non-cat.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay, got it. Great. Thanks. And then last one if I could sneak one more in. I think John, you mentioned last quarter that you were seeing some 20% return opportunities in, I think, somewhere more on the financial side in terms of those types of transactions. Just would love an update on that, is there still an opportunity to generate that level of return in that part of the portfolio? And thanks so much for all the answers.","John Doucette","The short answer is yes. We continue to see you and again we have been talking about this for a while, not just do we have a large balance sheet and high rating but we also a have a lot of underwriting expertise bringing, underwriting, accounting tax, legal contract wording and an actuarial and brining that all to the mix and solving client\u2019s client need and creating some run-off structures and we continue to look for those and I think in general we think the more, it's less commodity with plain vanilla that seems to be under more pricing pressure to having the ability to execute kind of multijurisdictional insurance, reinsurance combination deal give us the ability to really solve client\u2019s problems and use a lot of the different competitive advantage that we have and we continue to think that there's a lot of our runway for that.","Michael Nannizzi","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vinay Misquith from Evercore. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Vinay Misquith","Good morning, the first question is on the increase of the combined ratio for next year, that's 2015. You talked about, I think, a couple of points increasing the combined ratio from the cat business. So was just curious as to -- so when you shake it all together for the other lines of business because pricing is down. Where do you see it sort of coming out to?","Dom Addesso","What was the last part of that...","Vinay Misquith","So for the cat business, I believe you said that the combined ratio would increase maybe about a couple of points for the cat business. I was wondering also for the non-cat business. So if we shake it all together for the Company as a whole on the reinsurance side, how many points of an increase on the combined ratio do you think you got of the January 1 renewals?","Dom Addesso","you are really leaning us more towards giving earnings areas guidance which we really try not to do. I think, we expect, let me say this way, we expect our insurance operations combined ratio to improve, I am not really going to give any guidance on what that expected combined ratios would be in the insurance portfolio. On the reinsurance portfolio, a lot of that is dependent upon the types of transactions that we see. Certainly we will strive to maintain the combined ratio targets that we have been accustom to. And that will likely mean that some of the transactions that we were on in \u201914 will probably not renew and they will look for other types of transactions. As John mentioned, we are doing some new product -- expanded our capabilities into the credit area and a lot of that reinsurance we expect to run it better combined ratios than are traditional reinsurance book. So part of it is dependent upon the mix of and that's the best answer that I can give you at this point.","Vinay Misquith","Sure. Fair enough. And on the cat business, you said that it's going to be about a couple of points higher, but pricing seems to be a lot lower. I was just wondering what the difference is -- the difference, the retro that you guys are buying. ","John Doucette","No the retro really is the capital issue. The combined ratio on a gross \u2013 those were gross basis comments and what it did, a lot of that again and we keep trying to articulate as to the ability to move between product between layers, between clients to redeploy capacity from one product segment to another as we try to utilize the cat capacity that we are willing to deploy at any renewal and really be able to move seamlessly between that and one example is within our treaty property department. it's the same team that writes so lot of risk, cat and retro and that having the ability to dynamically allocate capacity to help where the client needs are and where we think the best pricing is as well as moving up and down attachment points within the layer and ask again, we think because of our market position we have the ability to get more defining in the layers want and that really helps drive what you're seeing.","Vinay Misquith","Sure. So it's a mix issue besides the pricing...","Dom Addesso","The mix influences the combined ratio of them.","Vinay Misquith","Sure, sure. Fair enough. Then just the 50,000-foot view, we've seen a lot of M&A in the industry. You guys are about an $8 billion market cap Company. Curious about your thoughts on M&A.","Dom Addesso","What thoughts and what regard?","Vinay Misquith","Are you interested in combining with others, do you think your size is large enough that you don't need to and also, do you think you're going to get some more opportunities if you guys don't combine and the others do. Do you see some more opportunities within the industry for your premiums?","Dom Addesso","I think we have emphasizing our scale and diversity for some time. So obviously I think it has been communicating that we think we have sufficient scale, so we don\u2019t really see that necessity, urgency for combinations. Others, others may view it differently but I think in essence what you're seeing in the marketplace in that regard somewhat validates one what would be have been the adverse advantage. So that's what I will say about that. In terms of the combinations and what it needs to the marketplace in general, it all depends on execution. Many times these combinations can be disruptive. Maybe they won't be. We will see, they can affect market, they can affect shares of programs with the teams of people.","There's always some churn that will occur as the result of any kind of merger in any industry so time will tell and we will see how that will evolve over the months ahead. Perhaps it creates opportunities, perhaps not. But I will say is that in some regards, this could be good for the industry in the sense that perhaps some of the capital does come out of the business and creates further discipline. So that could be a good outcome, some of these combinations.","Vinay Misquith","Fair enough. And then just really on Mt. Logan Re, so it appears you guys have increased capital by maybe 60% because you raised about $270 million more. Correct? So would it be fair to assume that the premiums also would be up a similar amount because you've already deployed all the capital as of 1\/1?","John Doucette","Yes, we would expect there to be a some increase in the [indiscernible] to Logan. ","Vinay Misquith","Okay, alright. Thank you.","Dom Addesso","Vinay, one more thought relative to your side question. Keep in mind as you mentioned $8 million market cap company, we are also adding the Logan piece and the sponsor cat also we have, so essentially you can almost argue that they were operating more like $10 billion capitalized company.","Vinay Misquith","Fair enough, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank ","Josh Shanker","Good morning, everyone. I think you made a very compelling case about your expense advantage compared to your competitors on this call this morning. I don't know if that translates necessarily to the insurance business, though. Why is Everest better in the insurance businesses than their peers? And we've seen some variable results from different reporters of crop insurance. Why have your results been weak this year while some others haven't seen such weakness? ","Dom Addesso","I will let John talk about the crop piece because I think he include some of those points in his prepared remarks but let me just perhaps admit that I don't know that we are better than the industry on the insurance side. Our comment about the expense ratio was a reinsurance company and why were they getting superior returns, there.","John Doucette","Okay, go ahead Dom and then we will come back.","Dom Addesso","So in terms of crop insurance, we have a great team at Heartland but we know that we need to grow that book, we need to diversify the book. A lot of it is fixed expenses, those high fixed expenses and if infrastructure and systems. And so we know that\u2014so in all a lot of things we are talking about what were going on. The reinsurance side. We are trying to do that with various books including the Heartland Corp Book. And we would expect that with the better geographic footprint than we have a bigger and better geographic footprint will give us more diversification, more better risk-adjusted returns, that allows to economics to scale and I think some of the competitors may buy quota shares, we do not and bipolar shares as then they get an override from the reinsurers and that may be impacting their expense ratio as well.","John Doucette","We have some work to do there but again to remind you that significant portion of the crop lost from Crop Hill and they are not just NPCI.","Josh Shanker","That's a great answer. And then coming back, if you are not necessarily better than your peers in the insurance business, does it make sense to you to continue in that business? I'm not telling you have to sell it or anything. But when you think longer-term, might it be worth more to somebody else than it is to you?","Dom Addesso","Right now, we think it is a good diversifier for a platform, you have the ability to deliver we think again because of the diversification fact, he greater ROE is also a source of business and for us into any capital markets that we talked about earlier as well, so we do hear again when we talk about our net ROE being the gross ROE. There is an opportunity to leverage that as well. So for the time being we think that the diversification and access to risk being able to build out that platform is important to the future of the Everest.","John Doucette","We spent a lot of time looking at the trends and we know buy each other business units that we have in the trends available. We've been growing up footprint whether it\u2019s A&H operation, the safe operation, our property facilities around the group, the workers comp, BFI and professional teams the casual and environmental teams. The trends have been favorable and we are going to continue to extract to keep those teams support and capacity and help them grow their footprint and help them get an economy as the scale. Additional we can commonly use the scale and leverage again, the financial strength rating and an ability to execute that Everest pride itself there.","Dom Addesso","The enforced portfolio, is a little bit great results for us now we recognize what have had over the last couple of years and drag from discontinued books of business and obviously as you can tell from this year been, that has been greatly diminished and so we think it\u2019s a bright future there.","Josh Shanker","Well, congratulations. Certainly a great year overall.","Dom Addesso","Thank you, Josh.","Operator","At this time I would like to turn the call back over to Mrs. Beth Farrell for closing remarks. I will turn the call over to Dom Addesso for closing remarks.","Dom Addesso","Thank you and thank you from participating in today\u2019s call. Now we talk, today we continue to emphasize about our competitive advantages which have yielded above market returns. These are a competitive manager of global franchise and scale, diversified portfolio, we have talented staff and as we mentioned very competitive expense ratio.","Market conditions are difficult to trend is difficult but we have proven our ability to deliver superior results.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Beth Farrell","Thanks, Ken. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting Officer and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements.","Now let me turn the call over to Dom.","Dom Addesso","Thanks, Beth and good morning to all. We're pleased to report another excellent quarter; in fact, a record quarter in operating earnings as a result of a strong underwriting result. All segments of our business contributed positive margin in the underwriting account. Quarter-over-quarter, underwriting income was up slightly, even though the combined ratio slipped to 81.9% from 80%. This was a result of higher earned premium in this year's first quarter compared to last.","The increase in the combined ratio was solely in the reinsurance segments, where competitive conditions are continuing to push rates lower and commissions higher. Nevertheless, we have maintained our margins with our strategies of first, moving our capacity to better price layers; two, diversifying our exposure; three, expanding capabilities in new lines of business; four, using capital markets outlets; and finally, maintaining an extremely competitive expense structure.","Offsetting the increase in the reinsurance combined ratio was an improvement of over 2 points in the insurance combined ratio. This is due, in part, to a primary rate environment, while stable overall is increasing in certain classes. A more significant factor in this improvement has been the success of efforts over the last couple of years to wind down portions of the portfolio and reshape the insurance operation.","The build out of new classes of business, along with expanding certain others, is beginning to pay dividends as growth quarter-over-quarter was 48%, reaching $340 million in 2015. We still have much more to do in this segment and we have bolstered our management and underwriting ranks so that we may continue the progress. In addition, we have embarked on a process to begin to build out our international insurance presence.","Overall, while operating income was positively impacted by underwriting results, there were other factors contributing to the record results for the quarter. Foreign exchange negatively impacted our premiums written, but it had a positive impact on earnings as our foreign currency-denominated liabilities or loss reserves were converted to the stronger U.S. dollar.","Also as Craig will explain, income taxes quarter-over-quarter were lower by $12 million. Investment income quarter-over-quarter was flat, but given where current yields are, we believe that to be a reasonable result and certainly not unexpected.","Looking forward, the market will remain challenging as competitive pressures persist. Market movements are difficult to predict and therefore, we rely on our flexibility to respond accordingly and modify our tactics as appropriate. These include as I mentioned previously, nimbly shifting our capacity, seeking new business opportunities, using third party capital, buying in stock and staying expense-conscious.","As a result, we have been able to maintain a strong ROE which, at 18%, is at a meaningful spread to the market. Consequently, we're uniquely well-positioned to manage through market weakness and therefore maintain returns above our cost of capital, while others may not.","A market turn would seem inevitable, should it drift down to this level. Until then, we will maintain our competitive position and continue to be identified by clients, brokers and analysts as a core lead market reinsurer and meaningful trading partner. In fact, one rating agency recently cited Everest as one of four reinsurers best positioned to succeed despite the prevailing market conditions.","This attribute is one that has been earned over the last several years as we have evolved our culture and the portfolio. New capital and operating income as a result of intelligent underwriting by our teams, has built our capital base to a size where we can deploy meaningful capacity. At the same time, while building towards $7.7 billion of equity plus third party capital of $1.7 billion, we have returned $3.5 billion of capital to shareholders since 2006. This is a record we're proud of and one that deserves the market's attention.","Thank you and now to Craig for the financial report.","Craig Howie","Thank you, Dom and good morning, everyone. Everest had another strong quarter of earnings with after-tax operating income of $330 million or $7.34 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2015. This compares to operating income of $281 million or $5.93 per share for the first quarter of 2014.","Net income for the first quarter was $323 million or $7.19 per diluted share compared to $294 million or $6.21 per share in 2014. Net income includes realized capital gains or losses and represents an annualized return on equity of 18%.","Solid underwriting results, sizeable foreign exchange gains and a lower income tax rate relative to the first quarter of 2014 contributed to these strong results. All segments reported underwriting gains for the quarter. Neither this year nor last year included any catastrophe losses in the first quarter.","Total Reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $205 million for the quarter compared to a $215 million underwriting gain last year. The Insurance segment reported an underwriting gain of $11 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $4 million last year. Each year reflected an underwriting loss for crop insurance in the first quarter, due to the seasonality of crop premium against a full quarter of expenses.","The Mt. Logan Re segment reported a $21 million underwriting gain compared to a $10 million underwriting gain in the first quarter of 2014. Everest retained $5 million of income and $16 million was attributable to the non-controlling interests of this entity in 2015. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $237 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $228 million in the same period last year.","Our reported combined ratio was 81.9% for the quarter compared to 80% in 2014. The overall current year attritional combined ratio of 82% was up from 80.4% at the first quarter of 2014 but equal to the 82% at year-end 2014. This measure excludes the impact of catastrophes, reinstatement premiums and prior period loss development.","The first quarter commission ratio of 22% was slightly up from 21.5% in the first quarter of 2014, but remains stable compared to year-end 2014. Our low expense ratio of 4.6% continues to be a major competitive advantage for Everest. On reserves, our overall quarterly internal reserving metrics remained favorable. For investments, pretax investment income was $123 million for the quarter on our $17.8 billion investment portfolio. The investment income was essentially flat compared to one year ago.","Despite the declining rates, our investment portfolio continues to perform well. The pretax yield on the overall portfolio was 2.9% with a duration of just under three years. The quarter reflected $7 million of net after-tax realized capital losses compared to $13 million of capital gains last year. These losses were mainly attributable to impairments on the fixed income portfolio in 2015.","Foreign exchange is reported in other income. For the first quarter of 2015, foreign exchange gains were $47 million compared to $2 million of foreign exchange losses in the first quarter of 2014. This reflects the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to other world currencies and equates to about $1 per share this quarter.","There were $200,000 of derivative losses during the first quarter compared to $2 million of derivative losses last year. This is related to our equity put options and is mostly a function of the change in interest rates during the first quarter.","On income taxes, the 12% effective tax rate on operating income is on the lower end of our expected range for the year. The low rate is primarily related to foreign exchange, the geographic region where the income was earned and higher foreign tax credits. Stable cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $455 million for the quarter compared to $367 million in the first quarter of 2014.","Shareholders' equity for the group was $7.7 billion at the end of the first quarter, up $216 million from year-end of 2014. This is after taking into account capital return through $75 million of share buybacks and the $42 million of dividends paid in the first quarter of 2015.","Book value per share increased 4% to $172.63 from $166.75 at year-end 2014. Our strong capital position leaves us with capacity to maximize our business opportunities as well as continue share repurchases.","Thank you. Now John Doucette will provide the operations review.","John Doucette","Thank you, Craig. Good morning. As Dom highlighted, we have continued our trend with another favorable quarterly underwriting result starting off 2015 on a very strong footing. Our group gross written premium for Q1 2015 was $1.4 billion, up 12% from Q1 2014 with growth coming from segments within both our U.S. and international operations and from virtually every insurance profit center. This 12% growth would be 14% on a constant foreign exchange rate basis.","Our group net written premium was $1.3 billion or $56 million -- up $56 million or 5% over Q1 2014. Starting with our reinsurance segment, I will cover underwriting results during the quarter, then provide color on major renewals, predominantly [indiscernible] including a discussion of the market and insights on ways we're navigating these challenging times.","For our global reinsurance segments, including both total reinsurance and Logan, gross premium was $1.1 billion, up 4% or up 7% on a constant foreign exchange rate basis. Net reinsurance premium was $980 million, down 4% with increased sessions on our catastrophe business consistent with our retrocessional strategy.","Our reinsurance book, including Mt. Logan, generated $226 million of underwriting profit in Q1 2015, a slight increase over Q1 2014. These strong underwriting results validate our reinsurance strategy which we have articulated for the last several quarters, leveraging our core sustainable strength, including global reach and comprehensive product offerings, expanding our opportunity set to capture profitable growth and utilizing additional capital structures to match risk with the most efficient form of capital while generating fee income.","April 1 renewals represent approximately 10% of our reinsurance treaty premium. April 1 is a key renewal date for Japanese and other Asian business and for some Latin American and U.S. regional property business. The reinsurance market remains challenging with average market rates off between 5% and 15%, depending on the line of business, product type and territory. However, globally, large fires in Japan, Australia and other regions are consolidating their panels of reinsurers, focusing on a few core trading partners, including Everest.","These sophisticated buyers are not focused strictly on price, but are also seeking stable, long-term relationships that can provide both meaningful capacity and comprehensive risk solutions. This benefits Everest as we gain preferential signings and in some cases, better than market pricing or terms, allowing us to sustain attractive risk adjusted returns. Conversely, regional clients around the globe are increasingly placing business locally, rather than just in global reinsurance hubs, especially in the current softening market.","Everest's centralized view of risk with a decentralized distribution enables us to capture local market business. Individually, these deals are not always that large, but in the aggregate, this is sizeable premium for us and is more insulated from global competition. Our strong ratings, longstanding client and broker relationships, broadly diversified portfolio, efficient expense ratio, underwriting expertise and capital flexibility are critical elements for achieving better than market results.","We continually optimize our portfolios which allows nimble deployment of capital to where risk-adjusted returns are best. At the same time, we're scaling back or declining deals that do not meet our return hurdle. Where accretive, we use alternative capital support. This flexible underwriting strategy has mitigated the impact of rate pressures.","Mt. Logan continues to attract strong investor appetite with $60 million of new inflows from external investors at 4\/1, bringing third party capital and Everest funds in Logan to about $750 million. Logan is one of the fastest growing convergence vehicles, highlighting Everest's ability to access and deploy third party capital and improve Everest's internal returns.","Now, turning to our insurance operations. We wrote $340 million of insurance premium in Q1 2015, up 48% from last Q1, partially due to prior period negative premium adjustments in Heartland last Q1.","Removing this, our insurance operations gross written premium for Q1 is up 32% quarter-over-quarter. Important to note, this growth is diversified and originating from 10 separate insurance profit centers in a deliberately constructed portfolio of short tail lines, long tail lines, regional and state-specific insurance portfolios.","Now, some detail on the business composition and what we're seeing in each market. California workers comp, one of our largest segments of the insurance book, was almost $100 million in Q1, up over 20% compared to the prior Q1 and had a 94.3% combined ratio.","Our renewal retention rate stayed relatively steady and pricing remains favorable with moderating rate. We continue to selectively add underwriting talent to support growth efforts throughout the state with recent additions to our Northern California team.","Professional liability premium, largely financial institutions, was $45 million for Q1 2015, up 43% over the last Q1. The FI market is stabilizing after a year price decline and we captured several new opportunities while maintaining a high renewal retention rate and grew with selective expansion to other lines for FI; however, we remain cautious for commercial D&O as rate pressures are evident.","Other casualty business, including our environmental and casualty facilities, was up 25% to approximately $40 million. Our direct facilities are ramping up with new agency appointments and increased staffing, resulting in increased submission and quote activity and driving new business growth. Renewal retention rates are about 80%. We're bullish on our opportunities in longer tail insurance line.","Turning to short tail, including property, DIC and contingency business, written premium was $65 million, an increase over 60% from last Q1. Focused growth initiatives have been successful. We added offices and underwriters in Atlanta and Chicago to strategically grow and geographically diversify our property insurance book and we plan to further expand geographically.","Specialty insurance group, our contingency business, has also expanded offices, hired underwriters and forged several new strategic partnerships. SIG products are highly complementary to other insurance product offerings, providing synergies across lines. DIC premium is flat as competition has lowered rates and relaxed terms; however, we will continue to adhere to our pricing targets and leverage our significant capacity to maintain our position. Non-standard auto grew over 25% to $26 million with rate increases over 5%.","Our strategic partner, Arrowhead, is providing select geographic expansion opportunity. We're currently implementing predictive analytics to further enhance this portfolio. Accident and health premium was up in Q1 with submission and quote activity very high. Our future deal pipeline for A&H is strong and we anticipate continued growth throughout 2015.","Regarding crop, we compare favorably to last year, due to prior period negative premium adjustments in 2014. While it is still too early to predict our final full year crop rating, we made several strategic hires and are seeing favorable year-over-year volatility factors. We also could benefit from disruption within several transitioning crop companies.","Overall, the insurance segment ran to a 95.9% combined ratio for Q1, a 2.3% improvement over last year, with meaningful diverse top line growth. This demonstrates the success of the strategies to drive profitable growth that we have been communicating over the last several quarters.","We continue to build on our strengthening insurance franchise through selective hires, both in the U.S. and international. We're bringing additional products to market, opening new distribution channels and enhancing existing ones. We're diversifying geographically as we bolster our relevance to our insurance customers and key distribution partners and provide meaningful solutions for their evolving need.","In summary, we have made significant strides over the last couple of years to reposition our insurance operation as evidenced by the noted improvement in results. We're poised to take our insurance operations to the next level with our strong and dynamic insurance team. Reinsurance has long been Everest's tradition, but over the next several years, we will build an insurance operation that will complement our reinsurance franchise and strengthen and diversify the overall organization.","Thank you and now back to Beth for Q & A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan","First question is on the recent catastrophe losses. Do you have any potential exposure in the Nepal earthquake, the terrible earthquake that happened and also any potential exposure from the riot at Baltimore?","Dom Addesso","In terms of Nepal, no. We have no material exposure, if any, there. In terms of Baltimore, I don't have an answer for that at this point. Certainly, there might be some risk exposure, individual risk exposure there, but I would not expect that to be material.","Kai Pan","And then on your insurance side, it looks like you're making tremendous progress out there. I just wonder is the 96%-ish combined ratio you have said in the past few years, basically ex some items, the underlying is really, ex-crop, has really run 95%-96%. Is that kind of still the target combined ratio for the insurance segment going forward?","Dom Addesso","The target combined ratio for the insurance segment would be lower than that and I would anticipate that we could continue to drive that combined ratio lower from here.","Kai Pan","Okay. My last question is on your capital management, it looks like you have record earnings for the quarter. The payout ratio is in the 30%s. And also if you look at first quarter last year, you had much larger buyback. I just wonder, given the market condition, do you think that the payout should be higher than you currently are paying out or are you looking for growth opportunities incurring both organic in the primary insurance area or potential acquisitions?","Dom Addesso","Yes to a couple of those questions. First of all, I think our share repurchase program, we look at our capital position over a very long time horizon. Certainly, we look to grow the business where we can profitably and I think, just as an example as we've mentioned in the prepared comments, we've returned almost $4 billion of capital to shareholders since 2006. Almost 40% of that, in terms of share repurchase, 40% of our shares have been repurchased since 2006, but it's over a long time horizon.","During that time period, all of us, including yourselves, might recall that we have had certainly significant pressure to buy in more stock, certainly from the street. But what we have been able to do is balance that out between profitable growth and maintaining sufficient capital to expand the business profitably.","I think we've demonstrated that we've been able to produce a quite respectable and superior return on equity by moving in that direction. To your question about going forward, given where the market is today, certainly if the market continues to slip further from here, we would be less optimistic about premium growth and perhaps push a little bit more in the share repurchase, but that is something that, again, we look at over the very long term. Our purchases of stock in the first quarter, frankly, we were in the market and really the stock just kept moving ahead of our price targets in the first quarter; otherwise, we likely would have purchased a little bit more.","Again, we don't have any specific targets that we've communicated to the street nor do we intend to. Again, it's always looking at a balance between profitable growth and maintaining the right level of capital and those things will always be moving in tandem as we move forward in time. I hope that answers your question, Kai.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi","Just maybe follow-up a bit on the insurance book, just trying to -- as far as the growth that came from crop versus your other lines, I think, John, you kind of outlined some of the specific items, but I know the seasonality of crop is a little bit different. Just trying to think about how we should be looking at premiums for the rest of the year on an earned basis? Any context would be really helpful there, thanks.","Craig Howie","For the overall growth, Michael, the position that has come forth is from a whole bunch of different areas within that area and it's across the page. I don't have those numbers, specifically, in front of me.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay.","Dom Addesso","Michael, let's first recognize that the growth year-over-year, we had a premium adjustment last year that's kind of amplifying the percentage growth that we're seeing in that crop number. We won't know the actual premium number, but I wouldn't expect any huge increase year-over-year as we finish the year because a couple things are going on.","We certainly do expect to expand. We have expanded our distribution. We're writing more business and geographically spreading with more agent and more territories, so that's a positive. Offsetting that, of course, will be the effects of pricing or the expected effect on premiums from commodity price declines, so that's a negative to the premium account.","And then a positive will be as John mentioned in his comments, it was the volatility factor which could help premiums go up. So all that being said, we're not providing a prediction on the premium, but that gives you some flavor of the factors that will affect the premium.","Michael Nannizzi","I guess just trying to understand a little bit more in some of those target areas. Is it because Everest is able to be more tactical in finding opportunities that you're able to grow and grow at attractive levels of profitability? Just because some of our other companies are more focused on optimizing retained books and we just haven't seen elevated growth.","So I'm just trying to understand or maybe you can give me an example of, if possible, opportunities where you're able to kind of pick off new business in this sort of low to mid 90s range, if weather conditions or there's some displacement in those target areas? Thanks.","Dom Addesso","Is that a question on the insurance operation or reinsurance operation?","Michael Nannizzi","Mostly on the insurance, just because we had the big growth and the underlying was a couple points better than we had, for example.","Dom Addesso","Well first of all, excluding the impact of crop, I think the number would be insurance premium growth probably in the low 30s.","Craig Howie"," Yes, 32.","Dom Addesso","So let's recognize that first of all. Second, there are markets that others aren't in. So California comp is one example where we continue to grow and that's not something that the rest of the industry is, more broadly speaking, has been a factor in.","We've got a very good position in that marketplace, so we're able to grow that. Same thing would apply with respect to California DIC. Again, given our appetite predominantly as a reinsurer, that's a risk that we feel nicely fits into our balance sheet where, with many primary companies, it may not.","The same thing would apply to our property E&S operation which is certainly very strong up and down the Northeast Coast or in the East, I should say, up and down the entire Eastern seaboard. So a lot of companies and distribution partners look to place their property exposure with A+ carriers, so that's is certainly a reason why we're growing.","Same thing would apply in the excess casualty area. Remember that these are not, today, huge businesses but again, distribution partners looking for A+, large balance sheet partners, that's very helpful. Then finally, in the contingency space, the hiring of a new team in a specialty niche, again, something that we have built up some unique expertise in and not everybody is in it. Same thing could apply to A&H.","You could go down each business that we're involved in as John mentioned and you could look to a unique offering that we've made to the marketplace, a unique appetite that others may not have and a strong balance sheet. These are all things that are attractive to distribution partners.","Michael Nannizzi","I see. So in some of these insurance lines, so your rating and your sort of unique appetite, those are differentiators that allow you to see business and buying business that may be better than peer profitability?","Dom Addesso","That's correct.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay and then one question, Craig, if I could, one more here on the FX impact on the revaluation reserves. I was just trying to understand, should we be thinking about that relative to premiums or thinking about that relative to asset marks that run through AOCI, because I was just looking at that.","We had a bigger markdown on assets in the fourth quarter and then we had a smaller revaluation reserve and then no real impact on AOCI this quarter relative to last, but then we had the FX impact on reserves. I was trying to get an idea, should I be thinking about those two next to each other or should I be thinking about more of the reserves relative to the impact of FX on premiums? Thanks.","Craig Howie","Michael, it is more relative to the reserves, but overall, I think we've mentioned this before, but we try to maintain an economic neutral position with respect to foreign exchange; so essentially matching those assets within the local jurisdiction to the same currency in each jurisdiction. ","What you have is a mark-to-market type adjustment here at a point in the balance sheet which is causing what's flowing through the income statement. That's the $47 million gain that you see in other income, other expense lines. Offsetting that are foreign exchange losses that you just mentioned coming through OCI. So on an overall basis, it's almost completely neutral from a book value standpoint for the quarter.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay, so the AOCI that we see on the balance sheet, that includes the investment marks and FX and then, but the investment marks were more than the FX headwind, so that obscured that $46 million we would have seen on the asset side?","Craig Howie","That's correct Michael.","Dom Addesso","That means, Michael, in reverse, to the extent the currency reversed in course, then you'd get the opposite effect, right? Craig has highlighted, it's economic, neutral to book value essentially.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker","My first question regards to Kilimanjaro and trying to understand the structure. In the event of a loss that triggers Kilimanjaro, does Mt. Logan also receive protection under the Kilimanjaro umbrella or is it just the Everest Re book?","John Doucette","It would just be Everest Re that gets the protection under Kilimanjaro.","Josh Shanker","That also does not include your equity participation -- your equity participation in Mt. Logan is under their terms as well?","John Doucette","If I understand your question correctly, Everest's participation as an investment in Mt. Logan stands pari passu with the investors in Mt. Logan.","Josh Shanker","And so now we're through April 1 renewals, obviously into the big Atlantic CAT wind renewal, but the -- I was sort of wondering, when you think about the investors' appetite for third part capital, now that's a big renewal, is there more room for Mt. Logan or a similar vehicle to grow in this environment?","John Doucette","Josh, we really can't comment on other vehicles.","Josh Shanker","I'm saying Everest, does Everest's possible third party participation stand to grow I guess? Is the appetite for the market broadly out there for more third party capital participation at current prices?","John Doucette","Well, we can answer the question tied to Mt. Logan and Everest and the answer is yes. We have investors, we've been building our investor base in terms of number of investors. We have investors that have been looking at it for a long time and a lot of them it's a slow process in terms of getting comfortable with the underwriting, the team, the analytics, the portfolio, the construction, the value proposition that we put forth.","But ultimately, we feel bullish that will continue as we feel we have built a meaningful and significant and differentiating proposition for third party capital. So yes, we expect to continue to have increased appetite into Mount Logan.","Josh Shanker","And does it -- equally in the sort of 15% kind of return characteristic business and the 6% type of return in characteristic or is the demand more so in one area of the market than the other?","John Doucette","It very much depends on the investor and what their risk profile is, what their return mandates or targets are and what their overall investment philosophy is. So it really depends on which investor and which type of investor invests and wants to put money to work in Mt. Logan.","Josh Shanker","Sorry about all of the Logan questions, I'm always learning. Do you need both kinds of investors for Mt. Logan to be really successful? Do you need someone to take the severity risk and someone to take the frequency risk or can you grow one pool without growing another?","John Doucette","What we've been doing -- Mt. Logan is a core strategic part of Everest capital management and property catastrophe management and we will have this for many years to come, but it also is not the only thing we do. You mentioned Kilimanjaro cat bonds, so we balance across the cat bonds, traditional reinsurance protection, traditional retrocessional protections, ILWs and Mt. Logan and the combination of those suite of hedges and cat management structures gets Everest to what we're comfortable with in terms of a net catastrophe PML position.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields","Two quick reserve questions, if I can, first, Gallagher was discussing the TPA business and they noted close to 5% existing client claim increases year-over-year. Are you seeing that sort of trend in California workers comp where there's a slight in claims frequency?","Dom Addesso","Was that a frequency trend that they saw or a severity trend?","Meyer Shields","That was frequency.","Dom Addesso","I can't say that we have seen that, no. Not that kind of trend.","Meyer Shields","Is there anything going on in the severity side?","Dom Addesso","That has not been what we've seen over the last couple of years. It's been relatively, I don't want to say benign, but it's consistently emerging in the manner that we predicted it would in our loss reserve and process.","Meyer Shields","Broadly speaking, when you look internationally and your writing business outside the United States and you've got these currencies weakening against the United States, does that translate into a higher required loss trend? In other words, do you have to have higher inflation in those other regions?","Dom Addesso","Not per se. certainly, a lot of what we do overseas is first party cover, cat exposed cover, so it's less casualty-focused and more property-focused. If you think about global demand, U.S. obviously being the most casualty intensive place in the globe and of course, second behind that would be Europe, but no, not particularly noticing any. We're not fearful of any particularly troublesome inflationary trend, no.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith","A couple questions here for you guys. The first one, Craig, was there any FX impact on the investment income or the fixed income investment income in the quarter or is this decline solely related to the lower yields?","Craig Howie","So in the investment piece, would actually come through OCI, Brian.","Brian Meredith","Okay.","Craig Howie","So that's reflected in the number down below the line.","Brian Meredith","So nothing would come by? So that's purely just lower investment yields in the quarter, the 6% decline in the fixed income. Okay. Second question, just on the cat losses, once again, there was a couple of European windstorms kind of at the end of the quarter that fell into the second quarter. Was there any exposure there and can you tell us if those were booked, if you had any exposure in the first quarter?","Dom Addesso","We don't anticipate anything at this point. We're not anticipating any losses getting into our cat, what we could consider a catastrophe. And we classify a catastrophe as above $10 million. It doesn't mean we won't have losses, but at this point, it's looking as if that would -- any of those events would be below $10 million.","Brian Meredith","Got you. So they're going to be relatively modest, got you. Dom, have you seen any impact or seen any business yet from this kind of M&A wave going on right now in the reinsurance industry or if you're going to see it, when do you expect you might see that, some of the spillover?","Dom Addesso","Well, you see it in a few pockets. I mean, I would not say that it's, at this point, it's a huge impact. You do see it in terms of human capital as well, though. There's certainly more chatter in the marketplace about that and that -- it would take many months for it to have any material impact, for sure.","Brian Meredith","So that's what we should be looking for is like teams of people leaving and that could indicate the movement of business?","Dom Addesso","That would be one factor. It doesn't mean, necessarily, that we or anyone else, frankly, would be picking up teams because we think we have, certainly, the resources to underwrite that business. I'm just saying that could be a factor, maybe not for us, but certainly it could be for others.","Brian Meredith","And then just lastly, any kind of early thoughts on what you think the Florida renewals are going to look like?","Dom Addesso","Well certainly, there will be pressure on the Florida renewals. There was some pressure on what we thought was the appropriate premium base for the cat fund. In fact, we put out a fairly big line on the cat fund and we ended up not, our rate was not accepted and as a consequence, we took a very tiny line. So if that's any indication, it's possible that the market could start to fall below what our pricing metrics would be.","And by the way, just to give some context to all of that, for us, even though we're obviously listed as one of the largest writers in Florida, a lot of that is pro rata premium. Our excess of plus loss premium for the Florida only companies now which would represent the June and July renewals, because we do have other Florida exposure coming from nationals and other sources that have different ex-dates, but our XOL business in Florida is approximately $150 million. So any rate movement that you think about needs to be thought about in the context of that premium base.","John Doucette","And just to add a little more color, we're not sure what's going to happen as we head into June 1 and July renewals, but we do feel very comfortable that we're positioned well to execute our plan how it happens, where it happens. Again, moving as we've talked about to go back the last couple of years, we've moved between pro rata and cat very easily.","Risk, we moved from Florida-specific to nationwide covers and super regional covers, in terms of deploying more or less relative capacity as we look at those. We write property insurance in Florida. We write reinsurance. We write retrocessional protections, we write purple. So we have the act to access Florida exposure in many different ways and we take advantage of that.","We also have the ability to hedge and manage the net PML in many different ways as ","Dom Addesso","That's a great point that John makes. One offsetting factor to what I've described as potential rate pressures, at least with obviously, the first client that's come to market, large client, is that there is also some evidence that there will be increased demand coming from the market. So that could dampen any of the rate pressures that we're all fearful of. But we will see as the market evolves, but as John described, we have many different levers to pull and many ways to access profitable business.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Amit Kumar with Macquarie.","Amit Kumar","Just maybe two quick follow-up questions, the first question maybe goes back to Meyer's question. Is the California comp book still running at an AOI LR of the mid-90s or has there been any shift in that?","Craig Howie","Yes, that book is still running in the mid-90s. Amit, this is Craig. We feel as though we're seeing exactly what we expected to come out from a reserving perspective. Those metrics are still running well as well, so that book continues to perform as we would expect.","Amit Kumar","Got it. I guess just going back to Brian's question, in your opening remarks, you were talking about I guess how insurance will complement reinsurance and you're talking about the franchise. You talked about the other opportunity, but how does M&A factor in into this picture or are you more on the sidelines right now?","Dom Addesso","When you say how does this factor into what picture, Amit?","Amit Kumar","In terms of a strategy and if you look at the list of companies out there who might be looking for a buyer?","Dom Addesso","Well, Amit, first of all, we'd look at many things and we've looked at many things over the last couple of years. So it's not that M&A is not something that we don't consider but clearly as we've looked at many different things over the last couple of years, we've ultimately determined that the path that we're on relative to what the other opportunities have been was the best path, meaning to build our own platform, continue to build out our talent, build it one brick at a time, so you know what you have.","It doesn't preclude looking at properties that might be a better fit or allow you to get to a place faster than you otherwise would, but of course, that's all relative to pricing as well. So none of those things are off the table but clearly, we have as we've gone through the strategy time and time again, we've opted to continue to grow by building it one brick at a time. If something comes along that's a terrific fit, then we will consider that for sure. But right now, we think been able to build the right platform on our own.","Operator","And we'll take a follow-up question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi","Just a couple quick ones here, if I could. One thing I had a question was the tax rate, Craig. I thought normally like when the cats were lower, the tax rate would be higher, just because you had more profitability maybe in the U.S.. Was there something else inside that tax rate and how should we be thinking about that part?","Craig Howie","Michael, the way that the tax is calculated is based on a full year annualized tax rate. It's an effective tax rate for the year, so in essence, we still have catastrophes planned for the remainder of the year in our plan so that's what goes into calculating the tax.","If in fact, we didn't have catastrophes like we've had in past years, that tax rate will inch up because you'll have higher taxable income and have to pay higher taxes. But at this point in the year, it's on the lower end of our range because of the fact that we still have three quarters of catastrophes planned for the remainder of the year.","Michael Nannizzi","And then on the international reinsurance segment, you mentioned some fires, I think in the prepared comments. How much -- could we quantify how much the one-timer-type stuff impacted the underlying there or was it significant? Maybe it wasn't, I don't know?","Craig Howie","For this year, those numbers are not significant from the standpoint of reaching the level of a catastrophe loss. In other words, it was several fires or several losses that fell below that $10 million threshold that we have for catastrophe losses. But the number, the amount of those fires added up to about $40 million so far this year.","Last year, that number was substantially higher which is the reason that we increased our loss estimate selection for the international segment back in the third quarter of 2014. We continue to keep that loss selection a little bit higher as we go through the year, just because of these types of losses.","Michael Nannizzi","And then just last one if I could, just thinking about the cats being a little bit lower, we get a little benefit tailwind from taxes, the FX item. How do you think about the current ROE relative to your own cost of capital, just given your own historical context and how you're thinking about results at this point? Thanks.","Dom Addesso","Well, clearly at an 18% ROE, we're well above our cost of capital, so I don't know that's necessarily a pressing issue. Even though this may not be answering your question directly, Michael and if it's not please follow-up, but we have as I said, an 18% ROE. We benefit of course, from light cat years, but certainly, so does the rest of the market. If you take our expected cat load which we think about as like 12 points, combined ratio points, that's about 6 points of ROE.","And even at that level, we're well above our cost of capital and clearly, we're outperforming the market. Frankly, even after that cat load, I would almost argue that we're outperforming the market even if you put that number in, comparing to the rest of the market with no cats. So we're not bumping into or getting close to, even at those levels, to our cost of capital.","The point I made in my opening comments was that it seems to me that as an industry, we're getting pretty close to that, but we're not there yet and not even there. But so that should have some, you would think, it would have some impact on pricing.","Dom Addesso","Okay. So I think we're done with the questions. I don't think there is anyone left there with a question, so let me just thank everybody. In closing, I would like to emphasize our underlying core results are strong, both in the reinsurance and in our insurance segments. As I said clearly, we benefit from light cat years, but again even with an expected cat load, we're still very much outperforming the market.","And this frankly is a result of portfolio diversification and an effective use of capital both internal and external as we've kind of highlighted on this call and frankly in conversations we've had with many of you, previously. So I would like to thank you all for your participation on the call and look forward to speaking with many of you in the weeks ahead. Have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference call. We appreciate your participation."],"8607":["Everest Re Group Ltd.

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Call of Everest Re Group Ltd. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Beth Farrell","Thank you, Jessica. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group\u2019s fourth quarter and full year earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, our President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, President of North American Insurance Operations.","Before I begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today\u2019s call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements.","Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.","Dom Addesso","Thank you, Beth and good morning to all. We are pleased to provide our final report for the 2016 year, where we closed the year with a record fourth quarter and an industry leading 13% ROE for the year. There are many moving pieces in those results, which my colleagues will take you through. But let me highlight a few key themes.","In the quarter and a year that saw a heightened level of cat activity relative to the prior year, yet the overall impact of these events was easily absorbed into our results, given the benefits of our diversified global platform that provides for premium across many geographies and lines. Notably, we reached a new high this year with over $6 billion of gross premium written. In addition, we realized the benefit of sizable reserve redundancies this quarter, a reflection of our conservative reserving practices, which we have been pointing to for some time now. While we had sizable reserve releases from our reinsurance portfolio, our insurance portfolio did experience some unfavorable loss reserve development. But this was largely isolated to construction defect claims arising out of runoff books of business. The size of the charge this year reflects our best effort to fully fund these liabilities and put this behind us.","We also topped up our asbestos reserves. This reserve addition was not the result of any change we have experienced in the underlying claims, but rather reflects a reallocation of reserves to the segment that is fraught with uncertainty. Despite all these reserve movements, the net result was a positive $209 million to full year earnings. As a result of these reserve savings and frankly many other important factors, our core operations have done very well as you will note in the numbers. Overall, reinsurance generated an underwriting gain of over $900 million, bettering last year\u2019s number by almost $40 million. While it is a challenged market from a rate perspective, as seen in the top line, we continue to expand our product set, shifting our risk appetite to achieve better risk-adjusted returns. These achievements are not one-off. There is a consistency to our performance relative to the market where our returns on capital have measurably outperformed. Albeit while returns are creeping down as a result of market conditions, I think it is pretty clear that the overall market will reach its breaking point before us.","In the insurance front, we remain extremely satisfied with our progress. Premium growth, excluding our crop business, which was sold earlier this year, has been in excess of 20% due to new product and business launches. The benefits of these increased writings have not yet been fully captured due to the lag in earned premium. The underperformance in 2016 reflects this lag in earned premium and its impact on the expense ratio as well as the reserve adjustments I previously mentioned. However, we remain confident that the new business that will come through earnings in the year to come will outperform the historical record.","Why this optimism in such a tough market for both reinsurance and insurance? First, the inevitable law of gravity and the race to the bottom, that is one race we don\u2019t intend to win and already have shown we are far behind. Based on industry returns relative to cost of capital, the race is almost over. That race includes third-party capital, where our future of higher investment rates will cause those markets to raise their targets. Second, the scale of our organization and scope of our relationships allows us the opportunity to selectively grow and introduce our new products and businesses. And finally, great people in a culture that inspires smart underwriting and risk selection with an eye towards being creative and entrepreneurial in everything we do, a lean organization that allows us to be nimble and quick to the right trade in the most expense-efficient rate possible. These are the qualities we continue to emphasize and that will continue to generate market leading returns.","Thank you, and now to Craig for the financial highlights.","Craig Howie","Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. Everest had an excellent end to 2016 and a record quarter of earnings with net income of $374 million helped by reserve releases that impacted both current and prior years. This compares to net income of $357 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Net income for the year was $996 million compared to $978 million in 2015. After-tax operating income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $363 million compared to $353 million in 2015. For the year, operating income was $993 million compared to $1.1 billion in 2015. The primary differences were catastrophe losses and foreign exchange partially offset by favorable reserve releases.","The overall underwriting gain for the group was $689 million for the year compared to underwriting gain of $787 million for 2015. The results reflect a slight increase in the overall current year attritional combined ratio of 85.5%, up from 84.8% last year. This attritional measure increase of less than 1 point reflects a higher expense ratio as we anticipated, with the build-out of the insurance platform and our Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate. In the fourth quarter, Everest saw $185 million of gross current year catastrophe losses. Of the total, $150 million related to losses from Hurricane Matthew, $20 million related to earthquake activity in New Zealand and $15 million related to the Tennessee wildfires.","Net of reinsurance, the current quarter catastrophe losses amounted to $169 million. The fourth quarter of 2016 also included favorable development on prior cat losses largely from the 2015 year. Therefore, net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $150 million. Net catastrophe losses for the year were $301 million in 2016 compared to $54 million in 2015. For 2016, gross catastrophe losses were $420 million but were offset by reinsurance and $87 million of favorable development on prior year cat losses, primarily from the 2015 Chile earthquake and U.S. storm events, the 2013 U.S. storms and Toronto flooding and the 2011 Japan earthquake.","Our reported combined ratio was 87.0% for the year 2016 compared to 85.1% in 2015. The 2016 commission ratio of 22.3% was essentially flat compared to 2015. Our expense ratio of 5.7% for the year is up from 4.8% in 2015. The expense ratio for the Reinsurance segment remained low at 3.1%, while the overall expense ratio was influenced by the build-out of our insurance segment.","Everest maintains one of the lowest internal expense ratios in the industry. This is a strategic competitive advantage for Everest. On reserves, we completed our annual loss reserve studies. The results of the studies indicated that overall reserves remained adequate. In the fourth quarter, we booked $205 million of favorable, prior year reserve development. This included prior period development in the insurance segment and for asbestos, which was more than offset by favorable reserve development in the reinsurance segments. The $160 million of prior year reserve development in the insurance segment during the quarter, as referenced by Dom, is largely related to construction liability and umbrella program business. These run-off programs were discontinued by the company several years ago.","The $365 million of favorable prior year development in the reinsurance segments reflected $419 million of favorable development, partially offset by a $54 million increase in asbestos and environmental reserves to replenish our position at the beginning of the year. The $419 million of reinsurance favorable development during the quarter, mostly related to property and short tail business, both in the United States and internationally. These redundancies have developed over time, but we don\u2019t react until the position becomes more mature. We continue to hold our loss reserve estimates for the more recent years.","For investments, pretax investment income was $150 million for the quarter and $473 million for the year on our $17.5 billion investment portfolio. Investment income for the year remained flat compared to 2015, which was better than expected. We have been able to maintain investment yield without a dramatic shift in the overall investment portfolio. The recent rise in interest rates drove bond prices down and had a negative impact to book value during the quarter, related to the unrealized capital losses in our bond portfolio. However, this increase and the expected rising interest rates during 2017 will have a positive impact on the net investment income over time. The pretax yield on the overall portfolio was 2.8% and duration remained at just over 3 years.","Other income and expense included $21 million of foreign exchange losses for the 2016 year compared to $61 million of foreign exchange gains in 2015. Both of these results are unusual and representing $82 million pretax swing year-over-year. For 2016, foreign exchange losses resulted from the relative strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other world currencies, primarily the British pound. Overall, we maintained an economic neutral position with respect to foreign exchange, matching assets and liabilities in most major world currencies. Other income also included $11 million of earnings and fees from Mt. Logan Re for the year 2016 compared to $28 million in 2015. The decline in 2016 essentially represents the higher level of catastrophe losses in 2016 and the corresponding reduction in incentive or profit sharing fees.","On income taxes, the 2016 operating income effective tax rate was 10.3%. This effective tax rate for the year was lower than our expectations for the year. The tax rate was lower due to the amount and geographic region of the income associated with the loss reserve releases in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we closed the U.S. tax audit during the quarter and allowed the utilization of foreign tax credits from years 2009 through 2012. These credits reduced the effect of tax rate by about 2 points. Strong cash flow continues, with operating cash flows of $1.4 billion for the year, up $276 million compared to 2015. This is primarily due to our continued premium growth.","Shareholders\u2019 equity for the group was $8.1 billion at the end of 2016, up $467 million or 6% over year end 2015. This was after taking into account capital return through $386 million of share buybacks and $195 million of dividends paid in 2016. The company announced a 9% increase to its regular quarterly dividend and paid $1.25 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Book value per share increased 11% to $197.45 from $178.21 at year end 2015, generating 13% growth in shareholder value, including dividends.","Our strong capital balance leaves us well positioned for business opportunities as well as continuing share repurchases. Thank you and now John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations.","John Doucette","Thank you, Craig. Good morning. We are pleased to report an outstanding quarter and a record year, with $903 million of reinsurance underwriting profit despite catastrophe activities. Our earnings reflect our strengthening position in the global reinsurance market and are a testament to our continued disciplined efforts to build a diverse and profitable portfolio. Globally, REITs were under pressure except where material catastrophes occurred, such as Canada. Our position as a large, global, nimble, highly rated and long standing reinsurer allows us to successfully underwrite through this tough rating environment to grow profitable business and once again, to achieve market beating results.","Before discussing renewals, here is some color on the fourth quarter and 2016 results. Total gross written premium for the fourth quarter was $1.1 billion, a decrease of 1% compared to last year, but flat on a constant dollar basis. Year-to-date, global reinsurance premiums of $4.2 billion were down 3%, but flat after eliminating the currency impacts. For the quarter, the loss ratio increased to 36.3% from 33% in prior Q4 and included 12.5 points of cat losses and also about 5 points of asbestos strengthening, both of which were more than offset by 38 points of favorable prior year reserve releases. The impact of fourth quarter cats was $139 million, which included $158 million of Hurricane Matthew, the Q4 New Zealand earthquake and the Tennessee fires, offset by reductions of $19 million for prior year cat events.","The favorable prior year reserve development emanated across the portfolio, weighted towards our shorter tail lines. The level of these releases demonstrates the strength and diversity of our global portfolio, the foundation for our strong balance sheet. For the full year 2016, our reinsurance loss ratio improved from 50.6% a year ago to 50.1%. Excluding cats and prior year development, the current year attritional loss ratio was down slightly to 53.5%. Each year was impacted by a significant risk loss, with 2016 having $40 million of loss for the Jubilee Oil platform and 2015 having $60 million for the Tianjin, China explosion. Note, in 2016, our prior year reserve adjustment reflected the release of $43 million of that $60 million Tianjin loss estimate.","The 2016 reported combined ratio and the 2016 attritional combined ratio, excluding cats and prior year development were also lower relative to the prior year, reflecting our disciplined underwriting approach and rigorous expense management. Bottom line, our reinsurance profit produced an all-time high underwriting profit of $429 million in the fourth quarter and $903 million for the full year 2016, placing us among the best performers in the reinsurance industry. We believe we have one of the very best reinsurance teams in the industry. In addition to a very strong technical staff, we have talented, experienced, smart underwriters who know their markets and clients well and with outstanding skills to underwrite risks, build profitable books and grow the long-term franchise, collectively enabling Everest to continue to outperform the market.","In our U.S. Reinsurance segment, 2016 gross written premium was down slightly to $2.1 billion. Changes year-over-year were caused by a decrease in our property writings as we walked away from a significant volume of under-priced pro rata business. However, this was offset by our new strategic property insurance deal and the continued growth in alternative risk products, including credit-related business such as mortgage reinsurance. Our alternative risk capabilities remain a differentiating bright spot in a difficult market where more sophisticated clients increasingly seek bespoke products for capital relief, unique risks and often multiple lines of business.","Everest\u2019s lean and agile operations, coupled with our broad experience and expertise, quickly provide solutions to both our long-term trusted partners and new clients seeking a creative solution. The 2016 combined ratio of the U.S. Reinsurance segment was up 6.6 points, while the accident year attritional combined ratio of 78.4% was up only 2 points. The attritional increase, in large part, was caused by the increased crop reinsurance writings, which generally requires less capital to write, but produces a slightly higher combined ratio.","Our International Reinsurance segment premium was $1.2 billion, down 8% for the year, but only 5% on a constant dollar basis. Lower premium across many of our regions, Latin America, Middle East, Africa and Asia was due to both rate pressure and termination of under-priced business. For 2016, this segment produced $314 million of underwriting profit, up 86% over the prior year despite increased catastrophes. This was largely due to a significant level of current and prior year reserve releases, highlighting the conservatism in our reserving process. Excluding cats and prior year losses, the attritional combined ratio for 2016 was down 4 points to 80.4%, with the improvement due to the impact of Tianjin losses in 2015 and a lower level of attritional cat losses, catastrophes that do not reach our $10 million threshold, to be classified as a cat in 2016.","Our Bermuda segment premium was $890 million, up 1% for the year, but on a constant dollar basis actually had growth of 5%, driven primarily by casualty reinsurance. The combined ratio was up about 1 point, but excluding cats and prior year development, the accident year attritional loss ratio was down 2.4 points to 89%. This was the result of changes in business mix and the impact of the Tianjin loss in 2015.","Moving on to the 1\/1 renewal, Everest was well-positioned to withstand the market pressures. Globally, our clients are demanding solutions that address their operational breadth, the increasingly complex capital requirements and unusual risks. We have the expertise, responsiveness and capital to meet these demands quickly aided by our unique and client focused operational structure, geographic and product breadth and diverse capital sources, including Mt. Logan, Kilimanjaro, catastrophe bonds and other hedges. In the property markets, we continue to perform well in face of heavy competition. Facilitated by robust relationships, we re-underwrote our property portfolio substantially at 1\/1 reallocating capacity from under-priced business to more attractive layers and programs, while supporting our core clients and newly marketed programs. We will also explore new structures that will strengthen our core client relationships well into the future. Overall, the market property rates were down at 1\/1, on average mid single-digits across most markets unaffected by material losses.","Our portfolio fared better than that, where the combined ratio of our 1\/1 renewal portfolio had modest slippage of less than 1 point compared to last year\u2019s portfolio. In our casualty markets, the 1\/1 pressures were mixed, with the reinsurance terms easing somewhat, but economics in certain underlying segments are still tracking in the wrong direction. We achieved improvements on classes with material losses and increasingly focused on structured and credit-related deals. Our London operation saw excess of loss rates declined from 2.5% to 5%, although some other international markets are seeing decreases of 5% to 10%. On the positive side, Solvency II is causing a demand uptick in London in European markets, specifically the pro rata structures.","Overall, Everest reinsurance operations remain optimally diversified by product, distribution, geography, client mix, and capital sources giving us the ability to quickly identify and move from market weaknesses to market opportunity. We recognized the markets may face continued pressure from the supply demand imbalances. But as reflected in our results, we are well equipped to adapt and excel in the new reinsurance world order. Thank you. And now, I will turn it over to John to review our insurance operations.","John Doucette","Thanks, Jon and good morning. 2016 was the transformative year for the Everest Global Insurance operations. The year finished on a strong note despite the impact of profitability from elevated levels of natural catastrophe losses and as you have heard from Dom and Craig, prior year reserve development originating from the one-off books of business. Nonetheless, we are pleased with the underlying performance of our portfolio, particularly so in a difficult trading environment. Further, we continue to make significant progress on our journey to organically build a world class specialty diversified insurance organization. I will provide further commentary on this progress later in my remarks.","Similar to last quarter, due to the divestiture of Heartland in late third quarter of 2016, I will be discussing our results, excluding this business. The full results of the Insurance segment, inclusive of Heartland, are covered in our financial supplement released yesterday. Additionally, for reference, we have also included a supplemental exhibit with the quarterly insurance results, excluding Heartland.","For the full year 2016, the global insurance operations achieved record premium levels, registering nearly $1.6 billion in gross written premium, an increase of $274 million or 21% over 2015. It should be noted that this result exceeds 2015 gross written premium, including the result of Heartland. This strong top line performance is an acknowledgment of the value our clients, brokers and insurers alike recognize in Everest insurance. Further contributing to this strong top line performance were nearly a dozen new underwriting divisions that steadily contributed throughout the year. For the full year, these new divisions, which have been selectively added to the portfolio, contributed nearly 7% in total 2016 gross written premiums. This represents over $100 million of new premium within desired segments and classes of business. A result we are certainly encouraged by, as many of these divisions are not yet a year old.","For the quarter, we registered $423 million of gross written premium, an increase of $89 million or 27% over the prior year period. This represents the eighth consecutive quarter of growth for our operations. Each division within the North American segment contributed to this growth, with the U.S., Canada and asset and health teams each growing in excess of 20%, along with meaningful contribution from our Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate. We remain encouraged by this balanced contribution across the diversity of the underwriting platform.","Net written premiums for the year were slightly over $1.3 billion, an increase of $180 million or 16% over 2015. As discussed in prior calls, net written premium growth slightly lags gross written premium growth due to a marginally more conservative reinsurance position we have taken to support our many new underwriting divisions. For the quarter, net written premium increased by $50 million or 17% over the prior year quarter, reflecting a strong end to the year and solid momentum from all of our businesses. I do want to make a quick comment as respect to net earned premiums in the quarter. Net earned was down 14% due to the sale of Heartland and the accompanying loss portfolio transfer of this business from the Insurance segment to the Reinsurance segment. Again, excluding Heartland, earned premium was up 14%, which is directionally similar to the trend at net written premium, however, slightly lags due to the significant growth in the portfolio over the past couple of years.","Turning to the combined ratio, the GAAP combined ratio for the year, again excluding Heartland, was 116%. As we look back on 2016, there are two notable impacts to our performance. First, was the prior year development of various runoff books of business, principally related to construction defect exposures that contributed 14 points to our loss ratio. Second, the insurance results were impacted by a year of significant cat events across North America, from the Fort McMurray wildfire, a number of Texas hail events, the worst experience over three decades, and finally, Hurricane Matthew. These cat events contributed slightly more than 4 points to our loss ratio in 2016.","Taking at the look of the attritional results. The ongoing global insurance operations delivered a 97.9% combined ratio for the year, in line with our expectations, however, elevated from the 93.4% attritional from 2015. Let me breakout some of the factors driving this increase. First, our expense ratio was 29.9% for the year, which again is inclusive of the expenses associated with the build-out of our U.S. and Lloyd platforms and is expected to moderate as we continue our expansion. It should be noted that this expense ratio remains very competitive within the specialty P&C environment. Second, for the full year, the loss and loss expense ratio was 68% compared to 67.1% in 2015. The slight deterioration in the attritional loss ratio for the year is attributable to a number of factors, predominant among these are the adverse impact of various non-cat weather events in \u201816, a slight deterioration in our U.S. auto book, and also some additional pressure on the loss ratio due to the growth in our A&H segment, which carries a higher loss ratio than our P&C products. That stated we are very pleased with the ultimate results of this book.","Let me now turn to offers and commentary on the performance of our major insurance portfolios, again starting with the North America P&C book which is our largest business. Year-over-year, the core P&C portfolio grew 15% or nearly $174 million. The momentum within our P&C operations steadily increased throughout the year, again reflective of our significantly enhanced underwriting capabilities and increased market profile. In fact, the fourth quarter represented the strongest performance of the year, registering growth of 21% compared to the comparable quarter in 2015. We experienced meaningful growth in our short tail portfolios and our casualty lines, while specialty grew more moderately.","Further, our new business lines launched in the U.S. again contributed nearly 11% to gross written premium in the quarter, a similar figure to last quarter. Our assets in health group also delivered another solid quarter of growth, with a 44% increase over the prior year comparable quarter. Our efforts to thoughtfully grow our medical stop loss segments within key geographies and business segments proved successful. Our new A&H products also contributed to growth throughout the year and we anticipate this to continue. We have recruited very capable distribution partners and as a result, expect to grow in the senior market segment into 2017.","Our Lloyd\u2019s operation also continued its expansion. The syndicate contributed $10 million to insurance growth in the quarter, building on the momentum from the third quarter. While still early in its growth cycle, this platform, despite a difficult trading environment, is performing as expected. For 2016, the syndicate has delivered $45 million of premium to the insurance segment, yet only $16 million of earned premium, which again, temporarily impacts the expense ratio.","Turning to the operating environment, we see a similar picture to what we experienced throughout much of 2016. With that stated, there is an early emergence of some trends within various lines of business that we are watching closely. I will comment on the dominant lines of business, starting with commercial auto, which continues to be a challenging line of business. Building on the prior three quarters of 2016, we again achieved positive rate across commercial auto lines, with a low double-digit mean increase for the quarter. Over 85% of our book is receiving rate increases. Internet tends to address the frequency and severity trends that we have experienced across the line. That stated, our exposure to commercial auto is somewhat limited and this line of business represents less than 5% of our overall P&C premium. The primary general liability and umbrella markets continued to remain in a tight rate range and are slightly positive for the year. As with the prior quarter and really all year, the professional liability market remains competitive, with rate decreases in the mid single-digit range.","Let me spend a minute on the U.S. property market. This market remains very competitive. However, it is our sense that the market is trying to find the bottom on the rates. The elevated frequency of natural catastrophe losses, are acting as a resistance towards continued large decreases. Further, in many occupancies and geographies, we believe the industry has reached the juncture that there is simply no additional rate reduction to be had. Perhaps this is driving the exit of some catastrophe from the space, but we feel there is a large story here that we will keep an eye as we move forward. That stated, we continue to find opportunities to deploy our capacity in a manner that meets our risk and return objectives.","Finally, workers\u2019 compensation, our largest line of business by premium size, experienced moderate rate pressure throughout the year in the mid single-digit range, which was largely expected. The favorable underwriting results in the largest work comp market, California, were greeted with steady rate pressure throughout the year. Other markets reacted similarly, although with moderately less rate pressure. So again, the environment trended predictably in \u201816 and we expect much of the same, with the exceptions noted in \u201817.","Wrapping up, we are very pleased with the many efforts undertaken in 2016 to position us for future success. We entered 2017 with our leadership team in place, our market profile expanding, a portfolio aligned to our business objectives and a significantly enhanced operating platform. We are confident we will carry our strong top line momentum into 2017 as our many new underwriting initiatives continue to gain scale both within North America and at Lloyd\u2019s. Yes, it remains a challenged operating environment, yet the growing diversity of our platform, again with the top line expanding by over 20% and a firmer handle on our existing portfolio, positions us well for the future.","With that, let me turn it back over to Beth for Q&A.","Beth Farrell","Thank you. That ends our prepared remarks. And we are now open for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Elyse Greenspan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning. First off, if you could just spend a little bit more time just I know throughout you guys have kind of said that you booked on some of these insurance programs following on the reserve review kind of to give you confidence that you fully addressed this. What are you booking on the construction liability and umbrella programs to and what really changed this year that gives you confidence that 12 months from today we won\u2019t see another charge stemming from some of these runoff programs again?","Dom Addesso","This is Dom. Thank you for your question. I think each year, when we have examined these portfolios we have been booking to what I would call the expected results from our actuarial review. And as Craig or someone else could comment on what we are actually booking at to, I don\u2019t know if your question was on loss ratio question, which I don\u2019t really think is relevant, but perhaps this answers it. This year, after undertaking that reserve review, frankly we asked ourselves the same question. We don\u2019t want to be sitting here next year and the year after and taking another charge, of course what drove the higher estimate this year was just an increase of frequency and severity. So hopefully, comeback in this year we selected the upper range of the actuarial estimates. So therefore, we have some confidence that it\u2019s ever an absolute, but of course therefore we have some confidence that they should be behind us. And again, keep in mind this is in the overall context of overall reserve position. And I know it sounded like a broken record, but when we have over 200 different reserve buckets and what we are most concerned about is our overall reserve adequacy at the balance sheet level, because this is clearly a run off business, this not a concern over our existing portfolio. And as evidenced by the reserve release we have this year in addition to other years, you can see that our overall reserve position is solid and in fact was redundant. So that\u2019s what we are most concerned about. But to answer your more specific question, this year we run a little higher in the range to give ourselves the comfort that we can hopefully put this to bet.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then as we think about the margin kind of outlook for your segments, I know within the commentary you guys kind of pointed on the property reinsurance side, slippage probably about 1 point on the combined ratio, how do you see the overall kind of reinsurance margin just in context of tying what you see on the casualty side and also do you \u2013 I guess we should expect some kind of slippage on the combined ratio as you bring the crop business to the reinsurance side, I am just trying to kind of tie all your commentary together to really how you see the margin profile of the reinsurance book in 2017?","Dom Addesso","Well, what we have been trying to \u2013 the message we have been trying to make sure everyone understands is that this is a book of business that is not dependent upon property cat business. And of course what you have seen in our margins has been some shift in the attritional and the shift in the attritional still we are getting improvements as a result of new products that we offer. So as John Doucette highlighted in his comments, diversifying it to different product lines and geographies and more importantly product lines, so for example, take credit reinsurance more specifically, mortgage reinsurance, those obviously are carrying much lower loss ratio fits and better combined ratios. So that\u2019s helping to offset some of the declines and actually business that we will let go in the more traditional areas. So we are not necessarily seeing any dramatic change in our attritional going into \u201817.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then in terms of just capital return, I knew you guys have always said you look to return less than your earnings, share repurchase, it seems like you guys did not buyback any stock since your last call, so how do you kind of think about I guess just the level of potential capital return for 2017 and any things kind of change on your capital return philosophy over the last three months?","Dom Addesso","No, nothing has changed, Elyse. And part of the reason that you didn\u2019t see us do anything last quarter, fourth quarter was the fact, that we had Hurricane Matthew sitting out there and clearly, we had information, more precise information so we become a little reluctant to we buy in shares given the fact that there is major events hanging out there that we are not clear as to what the final outcome will be. So that\u2019s what was driving that, but certainly, there has been no change in our, the way we manage capital. We have a very good long-term track record of doing so that of course gets balanced with what we see as the future business opportunities and the need for capital. And I think we have been, yes, we buy in less than earnings, growing our capital base because we continue to see new opportunities. And that\u2019s \u2013 and we look at this from a very long-term perspective. It\u2019s not just any one year, any one quarter for sure. And we will look out to more than just where are our projections are for book value currently or the current book value, we will look out six months or so to determine where our threshold might be for buying in stock. So essentially, it\u2019s a long way of saying, no change in our philosophy on how we think about capital management.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you very much.","Dom Addesso","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning. First question on reserves, so the 2016 reserve release that was actually the largest in your history. And Dom you mentioned that since you came on Board, you are taking probably more conservative reserves stance, so is that \u2013 there is the question is really, why now certainly big reserve it is, basically because their basic reserve cushion build-out over time, now you have to release it and also how sustainable is that reserve releases going forward?","Dom Addesso","Yes. Kai, I mean I have \u2013 for several years now that we have taken a more conservative view of picking the current loss year, in terms of big loss ratio. And that\u2019s frankly driven out of some of uncertainties as do \u2013 in the current market conditions an increased level of uncertainty. But that of course has resulted in some of those older years coming in part of the and positively. And that\u2019s \u2013 it was a good thing. What we tend to do is we handle the casualty and the property. We hold a couple years on casualty studies and we hold less years on the property side. So this release reflects the release from a few years ago from accident years a few years ago. And that will \u2013 that is kind of the process that we go through and we will continue to go down that path. And our \u2013 we still continue to feel that our current reserve position is very strong and adequate. And I can\u2019t sit here and give a prediction as to what the level of reserve releases are not, might be into the future, but as I said, we still remain very confident about our reserves...","Kai Pan","So the release, most are related short tail lines in last few years and not sort of some of the potentially long tailed line you have booked since late 2010?","Dom Addesso","I am sorry can you repeat that, you broke up a little bit on that question.","Kai Pan","Yes. The question was, is that the reserve release is most related to short tail line of business rather than some long-tail line?","Dom Addesso","Kai, the process has not changed over the years. As Tom mentioned, what we do is we set a conservative loss pick and then overtime, we are slow to react to any favorable development, but we are very quick to react to any unfavorable development. So what you are seeing right now, most of what was released at this point in time were short-tail business more than 2 years ago. Short tail lines and property lines of business was what the majority of what was released. But there was some casualty in there. And I should also mention, because I know there has been a lot of focus on the insurance adds, we have to make, but it should be noted that we did have some current book of business within the insurance actually did produce redundancy coming through the results in 2016. Net-net, it was a reserve ad, because of the construction defect of umbrella that we highlighted earlier, but it should be pointed out that the current book of business is beginning to produce some releases.","Kai Pan","Great. Then second question on the insurance side, the 2016 attritional combined ratio 97.9%, I just wonder, given your gross like projection, you are still growing the business expense ratio probably still a little bit elevated and then there is a business mix shift, some potentially to your high combined ratio, so do you see 2017, 2018, these attritional loss combined ratio going to improve or going to deteriorate before it would becoming improving?","Dom Addesso","Our expectation is that it would improve. Again, just to highlight again the things that why it came in at that level. We had some of it was A&H, the growth rate in A&H relative to some of the other lines. We had the non-cat \u2013 heightened level of non-cat events in 2016, which drove that. We had a little bit of auto. Frequency and severity that drove that, which as Jonathan highlighted is lots of rate increase coming on that line of business. And beyond premium catch-up to the written should begin to benefit the results. The expense ratio hasn\u2019t improved yet, because we have actually accelerated some of our business development efforts later in 2016, more so than we anticipated that we would do it, all a good thing, but I would have expected the expense ratio to improve by now, but it hasn\u2019t because of an up level of investment relative to our initial plans.","Kai Pan","Great. Thank you so much for all the answers.","Dom Addesso","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sarah DeWitt","Alright. Good morning and congrats on a good quarter. Just following-up on the insurance business, what do you view as the underlying run rate combined ratio in the quarter ex some of these one-time items that you outlined?","Dom Addesso","For \u201816, it would have been in the mid-90s.","Sarah DeWitt","And is that in line with your target combined ratios in this segment or do you target something lower?","Dom Addesso","We will be continuing to target something lower than that. We would expect improvement in that over time.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay. And then, separately just want to talk \u2013 get your thoughts on some of the macro issues following the U.S. election, if we got U.S. corporate tax reform, how much would Everest Re benefit and are there any implications from border adjustments for Everest Re?","Dom Addesso","I know this is a question that\u2019s hot in everybody\u2019s mind, but it\u2019s a little difficult, not knowing what the final outcome would be to give you any view. But let me just say this. For the last 2 years, we really \u2013 if you take in tax \u2013 lower tax rate plus the cross border tax adjustment, it would have been very minimal impact if any on our overall effective tax rate in the last 2 years. But the bigger question comes in a year where cat losses you are not expected or maybe even higher than expected, that\u2019s the great unknown. But we have got different platforms globally that we could trigger in different ways in which we could really underwrite business. So it\u2019s not \u2013 I can\u2019t give you a clear answer on that other than the fact that we don\u2019t think that it would have any meaningful impact at this point.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay, great. Thank you.","Dom Addesso","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Josh Shanker","Yes. So, good morning everyone. One off, we can talk in numbers about bridging the expense to build out the insurance press and Lloyd\u2019s and whatnot and the timeline for what we think that should be in \u201817 and should even be there in \u201818?","Dom Addesso","What will be there at all on \u201818?","Josh Shanker","The increased expense \u2013 spend associated with the build-out?","Dom Addesso","Is that a Lloyd\u2019s question or an overall insurance question?","Josh Shanker","It\u2019s the 300 basis point gap between the \u201816 expense ratio and the \u201815 expense ratio and I take \u2013 I understand your reasons behind that, I am wondering how long I should model that to persist?","Dom Addesso","I would expect that just to drift down slightly in 2017, and frankly, then level out maybe slightly again in the \u201818, but then level off from there. I don\u2019t believe that we will get back to our historical expense ratio. I mean, you have to remember that we now have the different distribution model. So previously, we were primarily an MJ focused insurance operation, there were more of a direct brokerage operation, which by definition forgetting even the commission element of it, just a general expense ratio element of it requires different types of resources and different systems. So \u2013 it will not get back to maybe what you would have as seen historically from us. Having said that, I think if you could our expectation would be as we even today, we have a much better expense ratio than the industry, we expect that gap doing work to remain.","Josh Shanker","Okay. And I am going to go through the 4Q \u201815 trends once again, read about the insurance reserve charge there. I can\u2019t remember exactly where the overlap is between where the charge for this quarter that was charged for 1 year ago. Is there some whack-a-mole sort of situation that while you have taken take you think what\u2019s problematic that you saw in \u201816, can there be other things that come out in \u201817, do we have some limits in place to give us specific comforts or are you surprised 1 year later from the \u201815 charges that you have these charges today?","Dom Addesso","We are always surprised because if I said we wanted surprise, then we would have put out a higher number back in 2015. Yes, it is a surprise. And with reserves, you will never know what an increased level of frequency or severity might in fact due to you. But as I mentioned, our other pieces of our portfolio that are active are in fact running at the fast year, produce the redundancy. So we are confident that those reserves are frankly in good order. But again in the context of our overall balance sheet, our reserve position is quite strong. And I think that applies to the various segments as well even though I know I keep emphasizing the overall balance sheet, which is important and worth emphasizing. We do go through each of our segments to make sure that we have got positive reserve or strong reserve position in each of those segments.","Josh Shanker","And then finally, I guess in terms of the Heartland premium coming into the reinsurance segment, given that you sort of explained the economics of Heartland as insurance contract, how different are the economics of it as a reinsurance contract?","Dom Addesso","John, you answer that. John?","John Doucette","Good morning, this is John. So a couple of things, the strategic relationship we entered as a reinsurance opportunity with the buyer of Heartland is it has a couple of advantages for us. First of all, it runs, we believe to a meaningful improvement in expenses and because of just economies of scale that we were unable to achieve on our own book, given the size of the premium. And then secondly, we also had struggled in our insurance book to develop a broad, diversified portfolio. And so individual localized weather events were causing more problems for us and caused more volatility in the book as an insurance play. What we are going to get is the benefit of a much, much larger book, a share of that book on a reinsurance quota share basis. So we think we are going to run to a better combined ratio, meaningfully and we think there is going to be less volatility in the results.","Josh Shanker","One of your competitors in the crop business has said this is 89%, 90% combined ratio business, do you think that\u2019s adequate or fair?","Dom Addesso","I don\u2019t know specifically, what you are talking about and if you are talking about it as an insurance player or as a reinsurance play, we would think as a reinsurance play, it\u2019s low-90s.","Josh Shanker","Okay, that\u2019s excellent. Thank you for the color.","Dom Addesso","Thank you, Josh.","John Doucette","Thank you, Josh.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Quentin McMillan with KBW. Please go ahead.","Quentin McMillan","Hi. Thanks very much guys. I just wanted to tie together something that you have historically said versus what we saw today, so Dom, you mentioned that 2016 is a heightened year of cat loss activity at a little over $300 million in cat losses on a net basis and then I think Craig mentioned $420 million on a gross basis when we net out prior year cat losses, but that $300 million number, it\u2019s about \u2013 it\u2019s a little under 6 points on the cat loss ratio and historically you guys have said that you expect about 10 points of cat losses in a normal year, so can you help to sort of tie those thoughts together of this being a heightened loss year, yet you were running much better than what that cat loss would indicate?","Dom Addesso","I am actually going to ask \u2013 I am going to make a few comments and then ask John to set the comment on it as well, but keep in mind that the asset was a heightened year, many of the losses though were low in the attachment point, a lot of the losses were assumed by primary. And what is consistent with what you have said is through the last couple of years given risk-adjusted pricing in order to maintain our level of risk-adjusted pricing we have moved attachment point, gotten off in certain things that we didn\u2019t like the pricing on and we believe that, that\u2019s had an impact on our result relative to what the overall level of tax were in the industry. So, I think that\u2019s just a general comment and maybe John Doucette might have something to add to that.","John Doucette","Yes, Quentin, I think a couple of things. The reinsurance strategy, we continue to look to how we can improve the book and deploy and take cat risk better and deploy and build a better and better portfolio and taking into account market conditions but also the buying habits of local companies, regional companies and global clients. So to the extent that we \u2013 the global clients \u2013 take the global clients, to the extent that they are looking to do more across the board and across multiple lines of business at multiple territories with companies like Everest, we are deploying more cat capacity to them. And that usually means given the retentions that they want to take in order to control the pricing of the reinsurance program, they typically are protecting against the real major losses, very big earthquakes, very big hurricanes, etcetera. And so that wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact us as much in a year like this, with the exception of the Canadian wildfires and Hurricane Matthew. And then we also, as Dom said, we are trying to shift our book and we have been moving not in every case, but generally, we have been moving up the tower. That also means it takes larger losses to affect us. But then I would also highlight the different hedges that we have in place, including Mt. Logan. And Mt. Logan continues to be a strategic platform for Everest and we saw some benefits from that in 2016, with recoveries that we saw from both Matthew and Fort McMurray wildfire losses in Canada as well as some other smaller losses around the group. So, we think that, that helps mitigate some of the cat loss activity that Everest faces on its inward book of business through the various hedges that we have in place as well.","Quentin McMillan","Great. That\u2019s very helpful. And just on a capital-related question, you guys paid out about 60% in the form of dividends and share repurchases and I know you don\u2019t have a specific capital plan that you are going to guide us to. But how much of the remaining 40% of the operating earnings that you produced was used to fund the strong growth in the insurance segment this year on Jonathan\u2019s side?","Dom Addesso","I am going to answer that as really an overall question as opposed to specifically to insurance. Overall, we still have about the same level of what we call excess capital. And so all of the metrics that we used to measure what our economic capital needs to be remain about the same. So that capital growth basically is supporting all of the lines of business both insurance and reinsurance remembering that we are doing some different things on the reinsurance side that consumed different levels of capital.","Quentin McMillan","Okay, very hopeful. And then sorry to sneak out last in, in terms of the investment portfolio. Obviously, there is a big move and you guys did have a mark-to-market loss as everybody did unrealized loss as everybody did in the quarter. But the yield in the portfolio looked like it ticked up a little bit. Did you guys shift anything around? Can you just talk about what the new money yield is versus where they, I believe Craig said that portfolio pre-tax yield currently is 2.8% so maybe versus that currently?","Craig Howie","This is Craig. Quentin, we did not make much of a shift. What we did do was shift it a little bit as I mentioned last quarter within the alternative capital or our alternative investment buckets. But overall the portfolio remains very stable, very high credit quality investment grade volumes. It makes up the majority of the portfolio. And then we have alternative investments. The new money rate that you are suggesting is about the same, about 2.8% compared to what the current yield is, at 2.8% as well.","Dom Addesso","And the returns, the yield that you are referencing essentially what happened in the fourth quarter, it all depends on timing of the limited partnership and alternative investment income and that can get a little lumpy. So, we are pleased that frankly, year-over-year investment income was flat. We think that was a pretty terrific outcome.","Quentin McMillan","Perfect. Thanks very much guys.","Dom Addesso","We are going to expand a little bit, because I know we are running over. But perhaps, we\u2019ve got a little worry in our opening remarks. So we will extend beyond our usual hour and if there is one or two more questions and perhaps we can entertain, I am sure you won\u2019t mind.","Operator","Yes. We will go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jay Gelb","Thank you. I was hoping you could comment on the M&A environment broadly within insurance and reinsurance and any update on Everest view on consolidation? Thanks.","Dom Addesso","Well, I still think the same factors are at play, scale being one of the more relevant factors, continues to put pressure on many of our competitors who seek partners and that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. And I think that will continue to be the trend going forward, scale and efficiency. For us, as you know, our strategy remains the same. We are not a big fan of putting a ton of good role in the books. And frankly, acquisitions are difficult to \u2013 in our view, others have certainly \u2013 could have a different business model, but in our view, acquisitions are difficult to assimilate and with it comes perhaps elements of the portfolio that you don\u2019t wish to be engaged in. It will require some remediation. And we think it\u2019s a lot cleaner to get the talent that we think we can secure the good talent and build out the portfolio in the manner and shape that we feel is most desirable. So that\u2019s kind of our continued strategy. If there are things that we don\u2019t think we can build out on our own successfully meaning elements of the different lines of business, very, very focused areas, we have continued to look at things, but I am not giving it a highlight that would be \u2013 you would see something in that regard, but I wouldn\u2019t rule it out completely.","Jay Gelb","Thank you.","Dom Addesso","Thank you, Jay.","Operator","And we will go take our final question from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brian Meredith","Yes, thanks for putting me in. Just two questions here for you. First, Dom, John, do you have any exposure to changes \u2013 potential changes in the [indiscernible] rate table?","Dom Addesso","Brian, I think you said the [indiscernible] rate table\u2026","Brian Meredith","Yes.","Dom Addesso","You broke up a little bit, yes. So we write business all over the world. We write a very little bit of motor business in the context of our overall over $4 billion of premium. It\u2019s not material to us. So the short answer to your question is, it\u2019s what we watch that. We look at the rates. We are probably a little less \u2013 we are probably a little more pessimistic on that over the last couple of years, so we have not deployed that much capital in that respect of area. So, we do not think its material to us.","Brian Meredith","Great, thanks. And last question, John, I was intrigued by your comment that you said, that you are exploring new structures that will strengthen kind of core client relationships well into the future. Are you referring to new multiyear kind of reinsurance agreements? Can you give us some examples of what you are talking about?","John Doucette","So we have \u2013 it really applies to a lot of different things. It applies to strategic relationships that we are trying to dealt with some of our core clients. We have added some of those in 2016. We have \u2013 some of are doing half a dozen and a dozen of these kind of core strategic relationships. We are looking to expand that and continue to deploy that where we really become a strategic partner to the clients and not just a large reinsurer to them. And that\u2019s worked out very well for us. We continue to deploy and really holistically deploy capacity with the global clients and we see that as the big opportunity for us in the future as they want to trade more with companies like Everest and less with others, either because of too much concentration with some of the big directs or they want to narrow their reinsurance panel. We are spending more time really strategizing about how we, as one of the very largest broker market reinsurers, how we can grow more with the brokers in the reinsurance area and we think that\u2019s something that won\u2019t be to the benefit of both of us and we expect to continue to make headway in that in different products that they have different initiatives and different strategies with that going forward. And then frankly, just a lot of these new alternatives really building out what we called the nontraditional space for this product, new products, new distribution, new clients and we are making good headway there, both hiring people, developing resources internally and have had recently some few nice wins in that space. And we look to continue to deploy that going forward.","Brian Meredith","Great. Thanks for the answer.","Dom Addesso","Thank you, Brian and thanks to all for participating in this morning\u2019s call. Apologies for going a little longer, but we had the questions in queue. We obviously were pleased with our performance this past year. And we recognized as to you that it\u2019s very challenging market, but we are still quite confident that we can outperform on a relative basis and an absolute basis. My colleagues here this morning kind of outlined some of the new things we are doing and I have highlighted our balance sheet strength, the reserve position, which certainly bodes well for the future. So, we are very confident that we can continue to perform well. And that\u2019s not without taking an increased level of risk. It\u2019s continuing to do what we do. It\u2019s underwrite through the different parts of the cycle and diversifying, diversifying into new products and new areas and continue to expand our franchise, in particular, expand the insurance franchise, which we think is one of the ways forward as well as product diversification on the reinsurance side. So thank you very much for your interest and your participation this morning. We look forward to seeing you probably over the next several weeks. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time."],"8439":["Everest Re Group, Ltd.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Beth Farrell. Please go ahead.","Beth Farrell","Thanks, Tim. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2012 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Joe Taranto, the company\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dom Addesso, our President; and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today\u2019s call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations, and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements.","Now let me turn the call over to Joe.","Joe Taranto","Thanks Beth. Good morning. I am pleased to report that in 2012 Everest increased shareholder value by 18% and had comprehensive income of $1 billion. These results were achieved despite losses from Sandy and the crop insurance industry having one of its worst years ever. Achieving these results despite these losses demonstrates the strength of our franchise.","We were pleased with our January 1 renewals. On our reinsurance business, rates, terms and conditions were relatively the same as in 2012. We did add some new business. Accordingly, the expected margins remained quite good for 2013 and up from 2012. Dom will provide more detail on this momentarily.","For our insurance operations, we continue to see double-digit increases in workers\u2019 compensation and general liability and single-digit increases in D&O and property. We believe the workers\u2019 comp business is positioned for profit and that continued rate increases will provide for growth. For our crop book, we are expecting a much better year. Further, our net crop premiums will increase meaningfully as we no longer purchase quota share reinsurance. Again, Dom will provide more detail.","Our investments performed very well in 2012 and are off to a good start in 2013. Craig will provide more color on this. We bought back $40 million worth of stock in the fourth quarter and $38 million in the first quarter of 2013. We wanted to buy a great deal more, but Sandy kept us out of the market for much of the quarter. It is our plan to buy when our window reopens.","We have achieved a 13% increase in shareholder value compounded over an 18-year period. In 2012, we did better than our historic average coming in at 18%. Given these returns, our current quality portfolio and solid balance sheet, our stock being below book makes no sense to us, meaning we are most happy to buy more and fully expect the price to book to correct. In summary, I\u2019m bullish on 2013. Our franchise has never been stronger. Dom?","Dom Addesso","Thanks, Joe and good morning. The financial details regarding the quarter will be covered by Craig, but it is worth highlighting the areas that address how we have positioned the portfolio and what that means for current and future performance. The attritional combined ratio continues to improve in both the reinsurance segments and the insurance segments.","For reinsurance, this primarily reflects the increasing proportion of excessive loss business versus pro rata, in particular for catastrophe exposure business, as well as increasing rates in 2012. The calendar year combined ratio for the reinsurance book, despite Superstorm Sandy and the other catastrophe losses earlier in the year, came in at 90.1%. This result reflects a 102.1% combined ratio in the U.S. book due to the losses incurred for Sandy, offset by a 75.4% and a 91.5% combined ratio in our international and Bermuda portfolios respectively. This overall outcome reflects our balanced and geographically diversified book of business.","During 2012, there was a continued emphasis on excess-of-loss business, particularly in our non-peak zones. This allowed us to diversify or spread our aggregate exposure more broadly without any material impact on our average annual loss. Along with rate increases, this strategy helped grow our catastrophe premium by $150 million to approximately $1 billion. At this level of premium, we\u2019re well positioned to absorb any infrequent, but significant industry event, such as Superstorm Sandy. This strategy has also been instrumental in expanding our customer base, thereby improving diversification both by client and by line of business. Broadening of the customer base has supported some growth in the treaty and facultative casualty lines, as rates are beginning to firm. Overall, we expect margins to improve in these areas, while rates in the treaty property area begin to moderate. Nevertheless, margins there are still favorable as evidenced by the results this past year.","New products developed in 2012 should continue to push momentum in 2013. At January 1, we had already seen approximately $150 million of premium growth in property business as a result of these efforts. The development of our capital markets platform will continue to support this growth with the ability to bring more capacity to the marketplace.","In the insurance segment, the improving current year attritional results with 100.9% combined ratio are due in part to continued double-digit rate increases in workers\u2019 comp and select casualty classes. Also, growth in our shorter tail books including primary accident and health stop loss business and our property E&S operation have provided for improved results. These businesses, along with the professional liability book and the California DIC business have consistently produced underwriting profits. And when coupled with a rapid decline in our historical program oriented casualty book that resulted in an overall improvement in the attritional results.","It should be noted that the drought conditions that adversely impacted crop results are included in the attritional results and 119.1% combined ratio, which had a 3.9 \u2013 3.8 point impact on the overall insurance combined ratio. Excluding crop, the current year attritional combined ratio stood at 97.2%. Ongoing trend for workers comp and general casualty rate increases along with continued growth in accident and health and an expected improvement in crop insurance should reflect positively into 2013.","The insurance operation is expected to expand this year on the back of a number of new initiatives. Our non-standard auto business will grow with the establishment of a new strategic relationship to be announced within the next month or so. Canadian platform will expand with the recent hire of a key executive there. And in the U.S., we\u2019ve added an experienced underwriting and marketing team with a specialty focus.","These initiatives, coupled with the growth in our existing portfolio due to rate increases, new business and a higher retention of the crop business with the elimination of the quota share arrangement will grow our top line premium.","The insurance results were impacted by prior year development, mainly in California workers comp and construction liability. However, it should be emphasized that the contractors program has been in runoff for some time and in the case of workers comp the amounts are relatively benign considering that our profits from this line of business have approximated $1 billion since inception. This is a long-term business that is emerging profitably as rate increases, our earnings grew.","Moving onto investments, we\u2019ve continued to dynamically allocate our portfolio in order to maximize returns and minimize risk. Overall, we\u2019ve maintained above average credit quality in the portfolio and have shortened the duration to reduce potential interest rate risk. Our allocations to equities and fixed income investments has resulted in pre-tax investment income and realized capital gains of $764 million in 2012 versus $627 million in 2011, a $137 million increase.","Despite significant cat losses from Sandy, we achieved a 12% operating ROE and a 14% net income ROE. This was accomplished while still carrying a capital book, providing us with one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. We prefer this because it provides a competitive advantage by allowing us the ability to respond aggressively into the market when the unexpected occurs.","While some in our industry are accepting single-digit ROEs, because of the interest rate environment, our strategy is to position our underwriting portfolio to achieve improved returns, and mitigate the loss of investment income. As I\u2019ve been discussing, we have been strategically shifting our portfolio towards shorter tail, higher ROE risks, but managing the potential volatility of this strategy by broadening our footprint and managing accumulations.","Our benchmark is focused on total shareholder return. We seek to achieve returns that provide a mid-teens compound annual growth and book value per share adjusted for dividends. That has proven successful with a long term return of 13% to our shareholders despite catastrophe losses and other challenges that have confronted the industry.","Over the last year, we have established a number of new initiatives including our newest Mt. Logan. I\u2019m quite optimistic that these efforts will enable us to profitably expand our operation over the years to come and continue to provide our shareholders with double digit returns. Along with our talented employees, global footprint and financial strength, we remain one of the strongest franchises in the business.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Craig for further details on the financials.","Craig Howie","Thank you, Dom and good morning everyone. We\u2019re pleased to report that Everest had a very strong year with after-tax operating income of $715.2 million or $13.62 per diluted common share. This represents an operating return on equity of 12.2%. I won\u2019t be comparing these results to last year given the record catastrophes experienced in 2011.","Operating income for the fourth quarter was $41.7 million or $0.80 per diluted share. Net income for the fourth quarter was $58.8 million or $1.13 per diluted share. Net income includes realized capital gains. Net income for the year was $829 million or $15.79 per share. These results reflect the continued improvement in the overall current year attritional combined ratio which has decline a full three points from 88.0% to 85.0%. This measure excludes the impact of catastrophes, reinstatement premiums and prior period loss development. The total reinsurance attritional combined ratio was 80.9% compared to 83.5% in the prior year. The insurance segment attritional combined ratio was 100.9% compared to 105.8% in the prior year.","However, eliminating the effects of the primary crop book, this ratio would have been 97.2% compared to 105.3% in the prior year. These improvements, both on the reinsurance book and the insurance book should continue as rate increases earn-in over time. Also providing better margins is the shift in our reinsurance portfolio from quota share to excess-of-loss.","Gross written premiums of $1.15 billion for the quarter were up 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. This increase was primarily related to the insurance segment. Gross written premiums for the year were $4.3 billion. This represents an increase of 2% after adjusting for reinstatement premiums and the effects of foreign currency movement.","Earned premiums of $1.12 billion for the quarter were up 9% compared to the same quarter last year after adjusting for reinstatement premiums. Earned premiums for the year of $4.2 billion were also up 2% on the same basis. The reinsurance segments reported earned premiums of $3.3 billion for the year, up about 1% from 2011.","Insurance segment earned premiums of $852 million, were up 4% year-over-year. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Heartland and the growth in primary accident and health staff loss business.","The fourth quarter underwriting results were impacted by Superstorm Sandy. Total reinsurance reported an underwriting loss of $48 million for the quarter, but an underwriting gain of $327 million for the year. The insurance segment reported a $46 million underwriting loss for the quarter and a $68 million loss for the year. These results reflect a crop loss of $23 million for the year and loss reserve development which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment. The overall underwriting loss for the group was $94 million for the quarter, but an underwriting gain of $259 million for the year.","Our reported combined ratio was 108.4% for the quarter and 93.8% for the year. The commission ratio of 22.9% for the year is down 0.3 points compared to the prior year. However, after eliminating the effect of reinstatement premiums, contingent commissions, and several one-time adjustments, the commission ratio would have been 21.2%, compared to 22.7%, in the prior year, on a similar basis. This loss ratio reflects the shift from prorated excess loss contracts, which generally carry a lower commission. The expense ratio of 5% for the year is up 0.6 points compared to last year. This increase primarily relates to the increased accrual for personnel costs and incentive compensation.","For the year, we reported $325 million of gross current year catastrophe losses for the quarter. These losses were related to Superstorm Sandy in U.S. this quarter. The pre-tax Sandy losses were $287 million after reinstatement premiums. This estimate has not changed since our preannouncement in December. Our gross cat losses totaled $410 million for the year or 9.8% of earned premiums.","On reserves, we\u2019ve completed our annual loss reserve studies. The results of the studies indicated that overall reserves remained adequate. In the fourth quarter, we booked some prior year development in the insurance segment, which was offset by favorable development in the reinsurance segments. The $48 million of prior year reserve development in the insurance segment related to construction liability and workers compensation. The construction liability relates to landscape of programs that the company no longer writes. The $51 million of favorable prior year development in the reinsurance segments mostly related to treaty casualty and treaty property business both in the U.S. and internationally.","For investments, pre-tax investment income was $146 million for the quarter and $600 million for the year, on our $16.6 billion investment portfolio. Investment income for the year declined $20 million from one year ago. This decrease was primarily driven by declining reinvestment rates, partially offset by higher limited partnership income for the year.","Despite the declining rates, our investment portfolio continues to perform well. It is conservative, well-diversified portfolio with high average credit quality. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.5% with a duration of three years. The quarter reflected $21 million of pre-tax realized capital gains and $17 million of gains after tax. For the year, we had $164 million of pre-tax revised capital gains and $114 million of gains after tax. These gains are mainly attributable to fair value adjustments.","On income taxes, the 7.7% effective tax rate on operating income for the year reflects one-time adjustments during 2012 and the impact of the realized capital gains on the effective tax rate calculation. It is expected that the tax rate on operating income will normalize toward an overall effective rate of approximately 13% in 2013. This rate depends on the geographic region where the income is earned, the tax rate in that region and the impact of realized capital gains or losses.","Strong cash flow continues, with operating cash flows of $664 million for the year compared to $660 million in 2011. This is despite the high-level catastrophe loss payments over the last two years. We\u2019ve earned almost $1 billion of comprehensive income this year. This primarily reflects $829 million of net income for the year plus unrealized appreciation on securities of $154 million and foreign currency translation adjustments of $23 million.","Turning to capital management, in addition to dividend payments to shareholders of $25 million, we repurchased 371,000 shares this quarter at a total cost of $40 million. For the year, we\u2019ve repurchased 3 million shares at a total cost of $290 million. Additionally, we repurchased another $38 million of stock after the year-end close. These purchases will be reflected in the first quarter 2013 financial statements. Company has 4 million shares remaining after these January purchases under a share repurchase authorization from the board of directors.","Shareholders\u2019 equity increased to $6.7 billion this year, up 11% from $6.1 billion at year-end 2011. This is after taking into account the $290 million of stock repurchases and the $100 million of dividends paid in 2012. Book value per share increased 16% to $130.96 from $112.99 at year-end 2011. Our strong capital position leads us with capacity to maximize our business opportunities as well as continue share repurchases.","Thank you. And now I\u2019ll turn it back to Beth for Q&A.","Beth Farrell","Tim, we\u2019re ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Good morning. I realized your holding us a little bit in suspense about a partnership coming up, but can you explain a little bit about how partnerships overall are going to be able to transform the business and how transformational it can be?","Dom Addesso","Yeah, relates, Josh this is Dom, what I was referencing, I can\u2019t get into the details because we have not concluded on the transaction, but essentially it\u2019s going to leave us with the ability to take our non-standard auto book which is currently running at about $30 million of premium and it\u2019s anticipated that that could grow to as much as $80 million in to 2013.","This will give us much better scale in that business, which it is a business that needs scale. And as a consequence not only the ability to improve our underwriting account meaning by the loss ratio, but also gives us an expense advantage. So that \u2013 without getting into the details of the structure and the who, that\u2019s the intended outcome.","Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Understood. And you may have seen one of your former peers was railing against sidecars as potentially it raises a issue that will ultimately lower the profits for the industry. Where do you think the industry is five years from now and as you participate to some extent in that, what\u2019s the right business mix over the long-term?","Joe Taranto","Well, I\u2019ll start with that Josh. Clearly, we see more alternate capacity coming into the marketplace; some of it is sidecar, some of its pension fund and other ways. And we intend to participate in that market and frankly we intend to make some fees on that market. In the beginning, the fee part of our book is going to be quite small compared to the risk taking part that we\u2019re currently on. But at the end of the day, given our ratings and our offices around the world, our people, the fact that we know clients for many, many years, we see a lot more business especially on the cat side than we can accommodate or want to accommodate given the fact that we want to keep PMLs to a certain degree.","So we have a tremendous opportunity to write a lot more business share it with some partners and make fees in the process. Yes, that kind of brings more capacity into the marketplace especially as others do it as well. And it may make more competition, although there\u2019s always competition. And we still think all the money that\u2019s coming in and any of the money that we bring in will only want to come in from profitable business, and so we think it will be a good model. In terms of ultimately what \u2013 how much will be fee and how much will be risk taking, that remains to be seen but clearly for now it\u2019s going to be mostly \u2013 most of our earning is going to be on the risk-taking side.","Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And then given that you guys have extra capacity along those lines (inaudible) but you certainly could write more business if it became available. Are you giving up profitability in order to make a footprint in the alternative capacity market?","Joe Taranto","No, we\u2019re not looking to take away from anything that we would want to keep for ourselves. That really is the design. Now we\u2019ll try to put ourselves in the same position with our new partners, so they feel as if it\u2019s really a equal trading. But we are not looking to give away $1 worth of business that we would normally write for ourselves.","Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Is there any risk to that? I mean that\u2019s always been my concern that, of course you don\u2019t want to give any way that, there\u2019s a risk of that happening, am I mistaken about that?","Joe Taranto","I don\u2019t see that Josh. We really kind of measure our appetite quite keenly nowadays and would continue to do so. And I think again given the opportunities, we\u2019ll be able to fill our plate with everything that we want. And then have more that we can share with others on a fee basis.","Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Well, thank you. I appreciate the answers.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Amit Kumar with Macquarie.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie","Thanks and good morning. Maybe just going back to the discussion on capital, obviously you have all these new opportunities. How do you think about capital management for 2013? The reason why I\u2019m asking is that relatively it has been lower than some of the other companies. What sort of math do you use? Is it buybacks plus dividends would equal net income or is there something beyond in terms of how you look at 2013 in terms of capital management?","Joe Taranto","Well, I think we start with what are the opportunities that we see and we certainly see plenty of that including some new opportunities on the business side. As Dom noted, we certainly want to be prepared for future opportunities that arise if the world changes and it has a habit of doing that. But at the same time, we look at our stock, where it\u2019s trading, the current portfolio, the people, the future. And we feel very good about buying back a whole lot more stock.","Now, we were kind of prevented from doing that in 2012. We took ourselves out of the market for hurricane season. We\u2019re keen to get back into the market in the fourth quarter and then Sandy happened. And we did not want to get back into the market until we put out an estimate on Sandy, which took us late into December. So, we bought some after that and a bit early January. But as I noted, we\u2019re keen as soon as the open window comes to get back into the market and buy some more. So, we are going to foster earnings and ROE in multiple ways, some of it in business, some of it in new business, some of it stock buyback.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie","So, it seems that just based on the ranking, it seems to be of lower relative importance. Just based on how much you\u2019ve grown excess capital in 2012, it seems that you\u2019re saying that let\u2019s look at the opportunities and maybe further down the list, you\u2019re looking at the stocks multiple, because clearly, there\u2019s value which can be created in terms of a buyback right now, but it just seems that it\u2019s somewhat down the list, is that a fair assertion?","Joe Taranto","No, I wouldn\u2019t put it that way. We bought back about 25% of our stock in recent years. We bought back close to $300 million in 2012 and would have bought back a bunch more if it wasn\u2019t for Sandy. So, no, I think it\u2019s still important in the sense that we think it\u2019s a great opportunity for us to buy. And we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to last forever quite honestly, so we\u2019re keen to do a fair amount now. But there are opportunities out there; both in the existing business and new business, and again what else may come about. So, it\u2019s always a bit of a juggling act, but we\u2019re happy that we\u2019ve both levers to press to increase the ROE for next year. And I would not say that it\u2019s of less importance.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie","I guess, my offset to that point would be why even look at non-standard auto opportunities based on the history, just based on the stock multiple right now?","Joe Taranto","Well, that\u2019s a business we\u2019re already in. We have a small company that operates out of Georgia. We\u2019re looking to be able to add to that and add to the margins by the construction that Dom took you through. And frankly it\u2019s just an add-on and that requires very little capital quite honestly and we believe it will increase profits. We like the proposed business plan, but in the scheme of capital usage, it\u2019s really quite small.","Dom Addesso","And it meets our return objectives in terms of how we think it can perform.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie","And what is the return objective?","Dom Addesso","12% to 13%, 14% return on capital.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie","Okay. The only other question I have is a lot of the other companies have talked about \u2013 they\u2019ve given sort of a flavor in terms of 1\/1 renewals, and you sort of have broadly alluded to it. How much do you expect your prop cat book to grow for 2013? I think previously we\u2019ve talked about maybe $1 billion plus number, generally how do you think about that for 2013?","Dom Addesso","Well, as I mentioned in my opening comments, we\u2019ve already at 1\/1 increased our property premium by $150 million. So, that was essentially 15% growth if you will.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie","Okay. I\u2019m sorry I was on another call.","Dom Addesso","The annual number \u2013 shame on you.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie","I guess related to that, did you discuss your PMLs? Did I miss that too in terms of how do you expect the risk profile to shift with that growth? I think previously the number was 11%ish.","Dom Addesso","Well, you didn\u2019t miss that because we didn\u2019t discuss our PMLs. And they will go up slightly, but as a percentage of capital they\u2019re not expected to move at all.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie","Got it. Okay, that\u2019s...","Dom Addesso","But nominally they will increase of course.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie","Nominal, okay. That\u2019s all I have for now. Thanks so much.","Dom Addesso","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Mike Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Just want to understand, Dom, maybe in the insurance book, can you tell us like what percentage of the business is crop, maybe this year and now with all the noise out the way in 2013? And how big is that book as a percentage of the total?","Dom Addesso","Well, for 2012, of the top of my head, I\u2019d say around 20%.","Mike Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay.","Dom Addesso","And going into next year, we would expect that to increase, because of not only growth objectives and the hiring of some underwriters and marketing teams, and the elimination of the quota share, that\u2019s likely to grow by $100 million, at least.","Mike Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay.","Craig Howie","Be about 30% to the overall book. Yeah.","Dom Addesso","Right.","Mike Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. Okay. And then, do you expect the rest of the \u2013 like the non-crop insurance book to grow as well, or do you expect that to kind of \u2013 because it sounded like you\u2019ve got a lot of puts and takes, lot of moving parts, some new initiatives, some things kind of going away, I\u2019m guessing the program business is kind of done in terms of the net change?","Dom Addesso","Yeah, the runoff for the program business is not going to have any major impact. But yeah, we will have growth in our excess casualty book, the initiatives that we started, environmental book of business that we have announced. The nonstandard auto was already mentioned. We\u2019ve started up a new specialty unit that will grow \u2013 will have a modest amount of new premium maybe $20 million in 2012, but that could rapidly grow from there in the years beyond and as well as, as I mentioned, expansion of the Canadian platform. So, we\u2019ve got a number of oars in the water all over the place in for the insurance space. And as the California DIC will be growing our professional liability book as well, and then of course the double-digit rate increases for workers comp. So, it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re quite enthusiastic about that space right now.","Mike Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And you think, I mean if your double-digit rate on the 80% \u2013 70% or 80% of the book outside the crop, crop gets back to, I don\u2019t know, high 80% or maybe 90%. I mean is low 90s% feasible for 2013 in the insurance business, is that possible?","Dom Addesso","With the good crop year, I suppose that\u2019s possible, sure.","Joe Taranto","Yeah, I would say yes with the good crop year. Comp continues to trend very nicely. We continue to get very sizeable rate increases and that continued into January and Dom touched on all the other areas which we really feel quite good about as well. So the answer is yes.","Mike Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great. And then last question, not to beat on the buyback, I mean I guess I mean in my math, I get about $100 million of buybacks in the beginning of the year next year, book value goes up a buckish. I mean what math when you think about deployment outside of buybacks gets you to that sort of book value growth? I mean if you assume that you\u2019re writing business against $100 million for example like, what is the kind of tradeoff as you see it internally? Thanks.","Joe Taranto","Well, you get into where you can invest it and where you can use it against the business. And we can get into what\u2019s the timing as to when you want to use it, if you don\u2019t buy back on Monday, you can always buy back on Tuesday so it\u2019s not like the opportunity necessarily goes away. But I\u2019ll say that the levels that we\u2019ve been trading at really are pushing us to do more sooner as opposed to later. But frankly we don\u2019t believe it\u2019ll stay at these levels.","But having bought back 25% is a good chunk to begin with. And again the fact that we bought back $300 million, we\u2019re looking to buyback more and kind of telling as soon as we can we\u2019re going to jump into the market, tells you that that\u2019s certainly part of what we plan to do as well.","Mike Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners","Hi. First just a numbers question within the U.S. primary insurance operation, the commission expense ratio was really low this quarter. I was just wondering if there was some one-time items in there?","Craig Howie","Primarily related to crops, in other words contingent commissions that would have had to be paid out given that a poor crop year took place were taken down in the quarter.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners","Sure, so we should just move it backup to the normal about 17.5% for the future, correct? Okay.","Craig Howie","That\u2019s correct.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Secondly, on the margins, as you look at the various opportunities, do you expect your accident \u2013 your combined ratio to improve further from these levels? I mean they\u2019re certainly very good right now.","Dom Addesso","Yes we do.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay. And that\u2019s driven by business mix change or is that pure pricing?","Dom Addesso","Well, some of the pricing that I referenced particularly in the insurance space and in cat, general casualty rate increases as it affects our treaty books. And then of course continued push towards write more excess-of-loss business spread our cat aggregate laterally if you will. And that will have \u2013 should have a furthering impact \u2013 positive impact on the attritional loss ratio.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And the one final thing if I may, just looking in terms of cats, could you say that this year is \u2013 last year, sorry, was a normal year in terms of cats or do you think it was higher than normal year in term of cats and ag losses?","Dom Addesso","That number was approximately what we project as what we call our average annual loss. And that does...","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners","Right.","Dom Addesso","I don\u2019t know that there is an average angle. But over the long-term that would be considered a theoretical average year.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay, that\u2019s fair. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS","Yeah, good morning everybody. Couple of questions here, first the property growth that you\u2019re seeing, where is that coming from? Is it cat business, is it international, U.S.?","Dom Addesso","The cat business, it\u2019s....","Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS","Is it property cat, when you refer to property $150 million?","Dom Addesso","Yes, property \u2013 U.S. and Europe, that\u2019s predominantly.","Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS","Okay. Great. And then I\u2019m just curious what your thoughts are on the opportunities in Florida as we approach the midyear renewals with the depopulation at Citizens?","Joe Taranto","Well, we think this will be some very good opportunities there. Certainly, the market at the insurance level continues to get healthier with rate increases, so it will be a bigger pie. There\u2019s still an awful lot of companies down there that are very much in need of reinsurance. You saw what Citizens did last year. So I think it\u2019s a big pie, it\u2019s an explosive pie and the people are somewhat cautious as to how they fill up. It tends to be everyone\u2019s number one zone in terms of PML. It is for us. So I think it\u2019ll continue to be some very good opportunities down there for companies like ourselves in June.","Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS","Joe, is that a place that you\u2019re more likely to use a sidecar you think at this point?","Joe Taranto","Yeah, it\u2019s not a sidecar that we\u2019re putting together and that\u2019s in the sense that sidecars tend to be operations that are put together for one and two years and then they\u2019re kind of designed to go away. We\u2019re putting something together that would be in place permanently. But Florida is exactly the kind of opportunity where we\u2019re going to have a PML that we don\u2019t want to exceed and we\u2019re going to have a ton of business beyond that that we could write if we wanted to.","Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS","Great. And then last quick questions here. Is Heartland much of a player in the winter wheat area? I know they\u2019ve been having some issues with wheat crop this year?","Joe Taranto","It\u2019s in that space. It\u2019s probably about 10% of the book. Soybean and corn is bigger, but it\u2019s in that space and so yes, that is started. And it\u2019s early days, but looks fine so far.","Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS","Great. Thank you very much.","Dom Addesso","Thank you, Brian.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our final question from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, thanks. Just wanted to open up the reserve side of the equation. It\u2019s been in the past, a concern of some in the investment community. It seems like you exit 2012, it\u2019s a third year of very, very low reserve moving either way. How are you feeling on this line? Our work suggests you have considerable excess here. Many in the industry have been releasing, I guess on the good side that isn\u2019t a headwind going forward because you don\u2019t need to pull from reserves to hit your target ROEs. On the other hand, you haven\u2019t been releasing, it seems like you\u2019ve been holding back. So, how do you feel on reserves as you enter 2013 and beyond?","Craig Howie","Greg, this is Craig. I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve completed our annual loss reserve studies and we\u2019re comfortable with our overall position that we remain adequate. You know we posted our global cost development triangles for the past couple of years, and they also appear adequate. I\u2019m comfortable with this position and I\u2019m also comfortable with respect to the practices and the procedures that we\u2019ve put into place to come up with such a good reserve position.","I think this company produces good results without those releases in place. I think one of the things that I like also is the fact that we\u2019re \u2013 we take our time to react to favorable development. Some of these redundancies that you\u2019ve seen have developed over time, but we don\u2019t want to react until that position becomes more mature. So, we continue to hold the more recent years and we expect to do the same going forward as well.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. So, actually the peers that are releasing, it\u2019s not that you\u2019re any different; it\u2019s just that you\u2019re holding back. Philosophically you\u2019re holding back more than they are?","Dom Addesso","We can\u2019t speak, we can\u2019t speak to.","Joe Taranto","We\u2019re not going to get into what others do. We don\u2019t know what they do, and we\u2019re not here to comment on that.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then just last one this is \u2013 has the reserving practices of the corporation changed at all in the last few years? And again, it was never a big issue; it just seemed to break against shareholders more frequently several years ago, than it has happened in the last several years. So, I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s a shift at all?","Craig Howie","Well, Greg, that\u2019s a good question. I think the reserve practices did change a few years back to create this position that we\u2019re in today. I think the practices that we\u2019ve put into place by meeting on a quarterly basis, and setting up these estimates on a quarterly basis, it\u2019s difficult to estimate what these numbers should be to begin with. But the practice that we put into place is pretty conservative. We look at prior year losses, look at the prior loss review, and then we compare and put loss trend on top of that. And then we also take note of any rate increases or decreases in the marketplace at the same time. But what that does is gives us appropriate data to look and set of our reserve position at given point in time. But that same process has been taking place for the last three years.","Dom Addesso","It\u2019s a kind way of saying, Greg that is my fault.","Joe Taranto","Let me chime in. I was about to say we had a great CFO by the name of Dom Addesso who started this process, did an excellent job in making out process more robust.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Great. And I do just want to clarify. Your forward view on ROE and everything that includes no reserve moving either way, right?","Joe Taranto","Yes, I think that\u2019s correct. We do not put that into any thoughts that we give you with regard to the targets we\u2019re shooting for.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Awesome. Okay, good. Thanks and solid year. I appreciate it.","Dom Addesso","Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll turn it over to our presenters for any closing remarks.","Beth Farrell","I\u2019d like to thank everybody for participating on the call and talk again next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference call. We appreciate your participation."],"8603":["Everest Re Group, Ltd. (NYSE:RE) Q4 2015 Earnings Conference Call February  4, 2016 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Beth Farrell - VP, IR","Dom Addesso - President and CEO","John Doucette - Chief Underwriting Officer","Craig Howie - CFO","Analysts","Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","Sarah DeWitt - JPMorgan","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Operator","Good day, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2015 earnings call of Everest Re Group Limited. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Beth Farrell","Thank you, Holly. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer; John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting Officer; and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from our current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements.","Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.","Dom Addesso","Thanks, Beth, and good morning. I'm pleased to report record operating earnings per share for 2015 of $25.04 per share. This translates into an operating return on equity of 15%.","The underwriting account produced record underwriting results of $912 million as a result of continued discipline and portfolio shifts undertaking in a very challenging market.","Of course, the absolute number is stronger than expected, due to the low level of cats. However, it is noteworthy that in a declining rate environment, the combined ratio remained relatively stable at 83.4% versus 82.8% one year ago. The slight uptick is due to the growth in the insurance portfolio. In fact, the reinsurance combined ratio stood at 78.5% in the last two years.","In 2015, reserve releases helped, but other contributing factors were portfolio shifts, expanding mortgage credit ratings, increased facultative business, and profits derived from our Mt. Logan operation. All in, we have been extremely pleased with how the organization has navigated through this market.","On the insurance front, it very much remains an improving story, although the overall results at first glance continue to look challenged.","The attritional combined ratio improved eight points and came in at 94.3%, demonstrating that our current strategies are producing the desired outcome. Nevertheless, the overall result came in at 106.3%. This was due to prior year development, once again coming from two of our run-off books of business. One is an excess casualty program book and the other is a construction liability account experiencing late reported construction defect claims.","While this has been a difficult sector to reserve, it should be noted that our overall reserve position was more than adequate to absorb these developments resulting in an overall reserve release of $36 million for the year. Going forward, we remain confident that our overall reserve position is sufficient to handle developments in any of our many lines of business, but more importantly we feel the same as it relates to the Insurance segment specifically.","The Insurance segment has made great progress during the past year, and key additions have been made to our executive management, underwriting, and distribution ranks. Overall premiums grew by 26%, led by our property, E&S, and crop lines as well as A&H, casualty, D&O, and our sports and entertainment business. We continue to build up these sectors as well as some new areas that will come online in 2016.","Profitability in each of these sectors is strong despite some rate climbing. John will get into some of these details in his report, but overall we would expect continued momentum in the Insurance segment into 2016 and beyond.","Overall, we were very pleased with our underwriting results and initiatives in both reinsurance and insurance. A bit of a continual challenge, however, remains on the investment front. As we all know, the low interest rate environment continues, and new money rates are less than the yields for maturities rolling off. In addition, certain sectors have been more recently challenged, and in particular, the energy sector along with emerging market debt and high yield generally.","As we along with others have well-diversified portfolios, we are not immune to some of these impacts. As a result, investment income is down mostly driven by lower limited partnership income impacted by the aforementioned factors.","In addition, there were some realized losses due to write-downs taken on certain oil and gas investments. The factors in the investment markets also had an impact on book value, where growth was constrained due to a decline in the unrealized account. Nevertheless, book value per share grew 7% to $178.21 from $166.75.","In general, as I mentioned previously, this was another successful year. We are appropriately navigating through continual competitive pressures, and going forward, we expect to maintain our utilization of alternative capital to maximize returns.","In addition, we expect continued growth in specialty risks in the North American insurance platform as well as in continental Europe through our new Lloyd's Syndicate.","No doubt, the rate pressures we saw at 1\/1 will further challenge us and the industry, but we remain confident in our ability to outperform.","Thank you, and now to Craig for further details on the results.","Craig Howie","Thank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. Everest had a terrific end to 2015 with one of our strongest quarters in history, helped by reserve releases that impacted both current and prior years.","For the fourth quarter of 2015, operating income was $353 million or $8.17 per diluted common share. This compares to operating income of $331 million or $7.28 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. The 2015 quarterly result represents an annualized operating return on equity of 19%.","For the year, operating income was $1.1 billion or $25.04 per share compared to $1.1 billion or $24.71 per share in 2014. Net income for the year was $978 million or $22.10 per share compared to $1.2 billion or $25.91 per share in 2014. Net income included $130 million of net after-tax realized capital losses compared to $55 million of capital gains last year, or a difference of about $4 per share year-over-year.","The 2015 capital losses were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio and impairments on the fixed income portfolio. The impairment is mainly related to credit write-downs on energy investments. The results reflect a slight increase in the overall current year attritional combined ratio of 82.9%, up from 82% last year. This attritional measure increase of less than one point includes higher than expected current year losses in the Reinsurance segments, including $60 million of estimated losses for Tianjin and numerous weather-related losses that did not meet our $10 million catastrophe threshold.","In the fourth quarter, Everest saw $20 million of current year catastrophe losses related to the U.S. storms that occurred during the last week of the year. The fourth quarter of 2015 also included favorable development on prior cat losses, largely from the 2013 year. Therefore, net catastrophe losses for the quarter were negative $4 million.","Catastrophe losses for the year were $66 million in 2015 compared to $62 million in 2014. For 2015, gross catastrophe losses were $100 million, but were offset by $33 million of favorable development on prior year cat losses, primarily from the 2013 German hailstorms, European floods, typhoon Fitow, and U.S. storm events.","Our reported combined ratio was 83.4% for the year 2015, compared to 82.8% in 2014. The 2015 commission ratio of 21.9% was slightly down from 22% in 2014. Our expense ratio remains low at 4.9% for the year compared to 4.6% in 2014. The expense ratio for the Reinsurance segments remained flat at 2.9%, while the overall expense ratio was influenced by the build out of our insurance platform. Everest has one of the lowest internal expense ratios in the industry. This is a strategic competitive advantage for Everest.","On reserves, we completed our annual loss reserves studies. The results of the studies indicated that overall reserves remained adequate. In the fourth quarter, we booked prior year development in the Insurance segment and for asbestos, which was more than offset by favorable development in the Reinsurance segments.","The $121 million of prior year reserve development in the Insurance segment during the quarter, as referenced by Dom, was largely related to Umbrella business and construction liability. These run-off programs were discontinued [technical difficulty] our position becomes more mature. We continue to hold our loss reserve estimates for the more recent years.","For investments, pre-tax investment income was $111 million for the quarter and $474 million for the year on our $17.7 billion investment portfolio. Investment income was below last year as anticipated. This result was primarily driven by the low interest rate environment and by the decline in limited partnership income.","On the fixed income portfolio, income was down $30 million year-over-year. Limited partnership income was down $26 million year-over-year, primarily due to energy-related investments. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 2.8% compared to 3.2% in 2014, and duration remained at three years.","Other income and expense included $61 million of foreign exchange gains for the 2015 year, compared to $30 million of foreign exchange gains in 2014. The foreign exchange gains resulted from the relative strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the other world currencies.","On income taxes, the 2015 operating income effective tax rate was 14.5%. This effective tax rate for the year was in line with our expectations for the year. Operating income does not include capital gains or losses.","Strong cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $1.3 billion for the year, essentially flat, compared to 2014. This is primarily due to our continued premium growth.","Shareholders' equity for the Group was $7.6 billion at the end of 2015, up $157 million compared to year end 2014. This is after taking into account capital returned through $400 million of share buybacks and $175 million of dividends paid in 2015. The company announced a 21% increase to its regular quarterly dividend and paid $1.15 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our strong capital balance positions us well to continue share repurchases.","Thank you, and now John Doucette will provide the operations review.","John Doucette","Thank you. Good morning. As Craig mentioned, we had a very strong Q4 finishing a successful 2015 year. Our Group gross written premium for Q4 was $1.5 billion, up 6% from Q4 in 2014, predominantly driven by growth in insurance. Our Group net written premium was $1.4 billion, which was up $70 million or 5% over Q4 2014. For the full year, our Group 2015 gross written premium was $5.9 billion, up almost $130 million or 2% from 2014. Our Group net written premium was $5.4 billion, also up 2%.","Let me first review our Reinsurance segments, starting with 2015 full year results, then give some color on January 1 renewals and how we are navigating the market. For our Global Reinsurance segments including both total reinsurance and Logan, gross written premium for 2015 was $4.3 billion, down 4%, but adjusted for exchange rates, it is essentially flat year-over-year.","Net premiums were $4.1 billion, down 3%. On constant currency basis it is closer to flat. Our reinsurance book including Mt. Logan generated $991 million of underwriting profit in 2015, up 6% compared to 2014. This is noteworthy given a similar amount of property catastrophe losses in 2014 and 2015 as well as some other large losses this year including the Tianjin Port loss.","These record reinsurance underwriting results, despite the soft market, highlight the successful execution of the strategy and initiatives that we put in place over the last couple of years. These expanded our opportunities and reinsurance profits by developing new and enhancing existing strategic relationships with key reinsurance clients across multiple lines of business, deploying capital to credit opportunities and other new products worldwide, offering meaningful line capacity on attractive property catastrophe treaties utilizing both Mt. Logan and cat bonds, and growing both our regional and facultative books.","These initiatives broadened and enhanced both our broker and client relationships, and continue to provide new opportunities to expand with longstanding clients, whether on new deals or larger shares of existing ones. Offsetting this, we are scaling down on non-renewing treaties which inadequately compensate us for putting our capital at risk.","In the current market, this causes significant churn in our renewals. This combined with a dynamic allocation of capital to the best priced business resulted in the out-performance of our portfolio relative to the broader market.","Now, some color on the January 1 reinsurance renewals. We wrote about $2.1 billion of premium across all reinsurance lines, which was down 3% compared to last 1\/1. As we continue to face currency headwinds, on a constant dollar basis premium was roughly flat.","Our catastrophe exposed property book saw a risk adjusted rates down low single digits for U.S. business, but down more in other areas such as Europe, Asia, Australia and some Latin American countries. We moved to higher attachments where risk adjusted rates were generally better. Globally, our expected combined ratio was up about 1% for our property cat XOL book compared to the 1\/1 renewals last year.","Overall, our 1\/1 cat XOL premium was about flat, driven by increased signings in the U.S., but offset by reductions in some emerging markets and Europe due to FX and softer rates.","Our purple book which has had strong results shrunk this 1\/1 due to elevated competition, which drove rates down to inadequate levels. Consequently, we redeployed some capacity to better priced reinsurance fields.","We did have some wins at 1\/1 in our traditional casualty book with several large quota shares for strategic clients. But generally, this area remains challenging. In particular, we continue to deemphasize management and professional liability. On the positive front, casualty pro-rata seeding commissions began stabilizing. We also found attractive opportunities in the credit space, and we continue to enjoy meaningful opportunities with key P&C clients where we have the ability to offer multi-line capacity.","We executed on new opportunities at 1\/1 that added meaningfully to our top line, including several solvency II surplus relief quota shares, increased lines on existing treaties with several global clients, as well as new layers for the same customer group where they are looking to reinsure their growing global retentions. In aggregate, these new deals offset some of the premium lost on deals that we non-renewed.","We continue to utilize Mt. Logan, cat bonds, and traditional hedges, which have allowed us to grow our gross portfolio over the last few years while generally keeping our net P&Ls on our 1\/1 renewal book fairly stable relative to our capital base.","During the fourth quarter we sponsored another $625 million of cap bonds protecting us from wind and quake losses in both the U.S. and Canada, where we have a dominant lead reinsurance market position, and enjoy preferential access to and signings on favorable deals. This brings the total multi-year protection provided by Kilimanjaro cat bonds to $1.6 billion.","As of 1\/1, Mt. Logan's assets under management was up to $860 million, a growth of 25% in AUM from 1\/1 last year. Once again, 100% of Logan's capacity was fully deployed at 1\/1 renewals.","During 2015, Everest's common shareholders earned $27 million from the Logan platform including fees. The combination of cat bonds and Logan have added $2.5 billion of off balance sheet capacity for deployment in the property cat market, which has enhanced our competitive position in this very important class.","As highlighted before, Everest possesses sustainable competitive advantages that continue to position us well for success in this reinsurance market. These include, number one, we have one of the lowest internal expense ratios in the industry, at 2.9% for our total reinsurance segment. Therefore on the same rates, we have higher dollar margins and higher ROEs than our competitors.","Number two, all across zones and perils, we are more diversified than most competitors, which naturally lowers our internal capital charges and improves our risk adjusted returns.","Number three, our scaled up retrocessional strategy, including growing Mt. Logan, upsizing Kilimanjaro cat bonds, and utilizing traditional hedges also lowers our internal capital charges further and increases our risk adjusted returns as well.","And number four, our operational structure and culture, decentralized, but controlled. We empower experienced leading underwriting teams to provide responsive service and direct customer access to decision makers. Unconstrained by narrow geographic scope or overly centralized approval processes, we deploy highly rated capacity faster, more creatively, and in scale. We are pleased with the outcome of our 1\/1 renewal despite market conditions. And we are off to another strong start this year for our reinsurance book.","Now, turning to our insurance operations; we wrote about $360 million of insurance gross written premium in Q4, and wrote $1.5 billion for the year. This is up 17% for Q4 and up 26% for the 2015 year compared to prior periods. Our direct operations including our property, casualty, professional liability, and contingency businesses were up 23% year-over-year.","Our specialty operations, Heartland, our crop insurer, EVCAN, our Canadian company, and accident and health, each saw a meaningful top line growth in 2015, achieving gross written premium increases in excess of 40% year-over-year.","Our focused growth initiative in each of these sectors has provided an improving opportunity set. While calendar year results for insurance were marred by prior year development on run-off books of business, the 2015 accident year results have been improving and showing a strong bottom line result. This year, we had a notable 94.3% accident year combined ratio, translating into $73 million of underwriting profits meaningfully improved from the $102.3% combined ratio for 2014 accident year.","While this improvement was driven in part by better results on our crop business, we are continuing to see improvement in the accident year results of our other businesses as well. Excluding Heartland, this business had 1.6% improvement to the accident year combined ratio, lowering it to 93.4%; a very strong result.","We have successfully attracted talented underwriters in many segments, added a new distribution team, and hired operational staff to enhance our processes and technology to support the scale, diversification, and geographic scope of our growing insurance platform. We are also launching several new product lines in excess casualty, private company D&O, and in the marine with additional new products planned for 2016.","Regarding the rating environment, in 2015 we've seen slightly positive pricing in most lines led by commercial auto at about 7%. However, we saw negative rate trends in financial institution and commercial management liability, which both remained very competitive due to excess capacity.","Insurance property rates were down slightly, but margins remained adequate to deploy capital. We are bullish about our opportunities despite the challenging market and are excited by the development of our insurance platform, and the launch of our new Lloyd's Syndicate.","We continue to leverage the strengths in both our reinsurance and insurance books to be the best-in-class manager of capital in the new insurance globe order.","Thank you. And now back to Beth for Q&A.","Beth Farrell","Thanks, John. Holly, we are open for questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Vinay Misquith. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Vinay Misquith","Hi, good morning, and congratulations on a very strong quarter and a super year. The first question is on the primary insurance operations. Was there some favorable reserve development, prior quarter favorable development that happened in the fourth quarter of this year? ","Craig Howie","I'm sorry, Vinay, was there a favorable development in the Insurance segment?","Vinay Misquith","Yes, prior quarter, because \u2013- right, because you get a 66.6% accidental loss ratio ex-cat. So was there some prior quarter reserving true up that was favorable?","Craig Howie","There was some favorable prior year development that came through as well in this segment, but it's very small in comparison to the reserve charges that we took for construction liability and Umbrella. That's what represents the majority of that.","Vinay Misquith","All right, I was talking about from prior quarters, but never mind.","Dom Addesso","Prior -- Vinay, this is Dom; prior quarters, that would just be movement in the expected loss ex with the current accident year. That wouldn't relate to any prior period development or any reserve studies set forth [ph].","Vinay Misquith","Right, okay, okay\u2026","Dom Addesso","Mixed business, portfolio shifts, and assessment of what the current year loss trend is.","Vinay Misquith","Sure. Now, on the primary business you've certainly grown the top line very strongly. We've heard press reports of you making a lot of hires. Dom, what are you doing in that business to ensure that the new business you're getting is priced appropriately?","Dom Addesso","Well, there are several things. First of all, as mentioned in my comments, and John referenced as well, we are adding underwriting talent across the organization, but that also includes a separate office of - or Chief Underwriting Officer within that unit. And John, as the Group Chief Underwriting Officer, is in regular contact with him as we expand our writings, as we talk about the underwriting template, and the underwriting box, if you will, and our risk appetite. So that occurs at the individual insurance level, and then of course monitored at the Group level. That's the first thing.","The other thing that we have is a very strong price monitoring process. So we're able to understand what's going on at the transactional level from a great adequacy point of view, that all of our business units report appropriately to us on a quarterly basis. So those are some of the factors, in addition to the regularly scheduled underwriting audits and risk management committee that we have, not only internally, but also reported up through the Board of Directors. So it is a comprehensive process.","Vinay Misquith","Okay, that's helpful. And on the reinsurance side, I think what was mentioned was that the new business on January 1 was written at a 1% higher combined ratio. Did I hear that correctly?","John Doucette","Vinay, this is John. Yes, that was a -- that was for our overall worldwide property catastrophe XOL book.","Vinay Misquith","Okay, that's great. So it would be lower than the rate declines that we're hearing in the markets. So, was that because of a mix change that you did this year?","John Doucette","Right. So it's a combination of things, but as we alluded to in our script, one of things we found at this 1\/1 was that higher layers in general were priced, we thought had a better pricing to them. So on average there's exceptions to this, but on average, the attachment point of our property cat book went up. And that helped mitigate it. But I also think -- you know we've talked about this before, when it comes to signings across the program, given Everest relationship, 40-plus-year relationship with our clients and brokers, and given our balance sheet and high ratings, we get a lot more selection of the layers that we like than others. And that allows us to mitigate the overall market rate softening.","Dom Addesso","Another factor there, Vinay is that we are down generally in all non-U.S. territories, and in the U.S., being a better price of that that portfolio mix, while your question is why is the commodity ratio only -- expected to combine down 1\/1 [ph] maybe what we reported in terms of generally rate decreases might suggest otherwise. So a little bit of mix shift on a geographic basis is part of the answer there as well.","Vinay Misquith","Okay, that's helpful. And the last question is on capital management. This year I think we saw about 50% of earnings being returned to shareholders. Just curious about 2016, and it seems that your primary business growth going pretty meaningfully. I would have thought that that would be diversifying versus reinsurance. So curious why you're consuming capital for that growth?","Dom Addesso","Vinay, I'm glad you were the first one to get that question out of the box. And clearly we expect it at every call. And look, we don't telegraph what we're likely to do in terms of share repurchases. Yes, we look at operating earnings. Yes, we look at the opportunities that are ahead of us in the marketplace, and look at the growth opportunities. And all, and look at our rating agency capital requirements, as well as our own internal economic capital.","What I'll say is that we continue to remain bullish on repurchasing shares into 2016. We did do some in the fourth quarter. But then of course price kind of got away from us a little bit, and we probably did a little less than we might otherwise would have. But we still will be repurchasing stock into 2016, but I'm not going to be giving any forecast of what that might be.","Vinay Misquith","Thank you.","Dom Addesso","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today comes from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Michael Nannizzi","Thanks. John, I have one question on the insurance business, you mentioned 160 basis points of improvement excluding crop. I was just trying to figure out what was the basic in switch you were looking at that number? And maybe I got that wrong, but I thought that's what you said.","John Doucette","Good morning.","Michael Nannizzi","Hi, good morning.","John Doucette","It's basically the accident year combined ratio, attritional combined ratio looking this year for our insurance book excluding Heartland compared to last period. And the reason we gave that number was because there was a meaningful improvement in the Heartland results from last year to this. So we wanted to identify that it wasn't just the improvement in the Heartland results.","Dom Addesso","So Michael, the net written premium for the insurance group for the year is 1.325 billion, of that 250 million approximately was Heartland, if that's getting to your question.","Michael Nannizzi","Yes, that helps. I mean, is there anyway, John, to know sort of what the number is in terms of 160 basis points, like, could we know what that number was last year just to have some idea of -- just because there's obviously been a lot of change, there's new business. There's been a lot of mix shift in that book. So it would be just helpful to sort of square what that sort of baseline looks like, or maybe give the Heartland piece, and then we can figure out the other side.","Dom Addesso","Right. So this is Dom, Mike. And I gave you the 2015 -- the 2014 Heartland premium number\u2026","Craig Howie","It was 130 million.","Dom Addesso","Right, does that help you figure that out?","Craig Howie","So excluding Heartland last year -- and Mike, this is Craig, excluding Heartland last year it was a 95% -- 95.0% combined. And this year it's 93.4% [ph] excluding crop. This year crop had a profit. Last year crop was running at a loss.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay. So 95 to -- you'd cut out for a second there, 95 to 90.4\u2026","Craig Howie","Last year, the combined ratio excluding crop on the insurance book was 95.0. That number is now 93.4. That's the 1.6 points of improvement that John mentioned.","Michael Nannizzi","Perfect. Okay, great. That really helps. Thank you so much. And then John, the 800 million or so in Mt. Logan, just so we can right-size it, what was the comparable dollar amount for 2014? Was that -- I mean, obviously you'd raised a 600, but was that -- I'm guessing there was some retirement of bonds as well. So I just want to know what was the comparable number there last year?","John Doucette","So it's up about 25% -- this is Mt. Logan, not the bonds that I'm answering.","Michael Nannizzi","Correct. Yes.","John Doucette","Mt. Logan is up 25%, so bringing it to $880 million.","Michael Nannizzi","Excellent, that's what I needed. And then just last one, just on the commentary about 1\/1 renewals and the higher attachment. So the rate online was better on the high-attachment versus low-attachment. Should we take that to understand that there's just less competition at those higher levels or is there some other aspect of the landscape just from an operational perspective that would contribute to that dynamic?","John Doucette","I think a lot \u2013- that's really where there's more limit purchase. So from a demand point of view that's higher. Typically how the programs are laid out, the lower layers are smaller. And then increasingly, as you go up the tower, the dollar limits that are purchased are larger. So there is more demand at that point. And to the extent that our business is being impacted by alternative capital, those higher layers have lower rates online, which are more challenging for alternative capital, unrated capital to find an attractive return for that. So I think that's partially playing into that too.","Michael Nannizzi","Got it. That's great. Thank you so much.","Dom Addesso","Thanks, Michael.","John Doucette","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question now comes from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Kai Pan","Good morning. Thank you. Just a follow-up on Mike's question, could you tell the other piece in your insurance, basic crop, basically we're trying to understand what's your, like, current year commodity ratio running at. And I just wanted to see if that's your mid to long-term average, or it just is like -- is better than expected?","Craig Howie","This is Craig, Kai. Current year crop is running at a 99. That is certainly better than our long-term average because this is a profitable year for us in crop. It is not where we expect to be over the long-term. This business needs scale and geographic diversity. And that's what we've attempted to do this year. We've grown the premium, and we've grown it diversifying it into other states as well. So that will help you -- that will help you\u2026","Kai Pan","I'm sorry.","Craig Howie","[Indiscernible].","Kai Pan","I'm sorry. So there is still room for improvements. It's not like you have anomaly like a good year on the crop side.","Craig Howie","There is still room for improvement, yes, but we did show a profit this year for the first time.","Kai Pan","Okay, that's great. And then on the reserve charge, $120 million in the Insurance segment, the two run-off business, could you tell us how big is the remaining reserve on the book?","Craig Howie","The remaining reserves on the book for insurance overall or\u2026","Kai Pan","No, for these two run-offs?","Craig Howie","For these two run-offs, this is what we are attempting to do with these is look at where we expect these reserves to be over time, and I don't have that number in front of me, Kai.","Kai Pan","Okay, that's fine. And then it looks remarkable that, Dom, you mentioned that you'd be able to keep the underlying combined ratio stable in your Reinsurance segment despite the pricing pressure. Part of that might be business mix. I just wonder on the -- like, accident year loss ratio peak side on the loss trend inflation, what trend do you see there in your major line of business?","Dom Addesso","Well, I mean the underlying combined ratio on the reinsurance side is comprised of several factors. We have obviously a property cat book. We have a property pro-rata book, a casualty pro-rata, casualty excess, facultative mortgage credit etcetera. And all of those things when combined together obviously produce the overall combined ratio. Our expected combined ratio on property cat XOL year-over-year in terms of what was slightly up, but of course with no cats then that has a very positive impact on the results.","Our treat casualty results have been improving year-over-year. We've been expanding our facultative operations, which typically have had higher margins than the treaty book of business. And the mortgage credit of course has been something that we've mildly added to our portfolio, also contributing to that.","So to point to any one factor is difficult, but it's just the composition of the portfolio, and as it evolves, we're able to maintain a decent level of profitability and return on capital as a result. And partly to your question if you're asking about trends, it obviously depends on the line of business, but clearly in all of our businesses and all the lines of business, business' trend is not -- it's not strong. There isn't a high loss inflation factor that we're seeing in any of our lines of business.","Kai Pan","So, do you book to the lower like cost trends or you're taking probably more longer term approach on your assumption?","Dom Addesso","Well, I mean loss gross trends generally are going to be more of a factor in casualty than anything else. And what our underwriters are looking at, and actually they're looking at -- it depends on the client's book of business, and those loss gross trends are the average trends that we've seen over the last couple of years. It's not anything -- I wouldn't describe it as being at the low-end of the range or at the high-end of the range, it's essentially based on the experience that we've seen in the market place over the last five or six years.","John Doucette","And Kai, it's John. Just to add to that, you know, we have a very experienced actuarial pricing team that have priced all property and casualty lines of business all over the world and have been doing that for 20 plus years. And we've added over the last several years more talent to that team and enhanced the analytics. So we feel pretty comfortable that we understand what the trends are, what the loss picks are for the reinsurance business that we're putting on the books.","Craig Howie","I think I'll add one other thing that maybe -- will hopefully answer the question and maybe provide you some comfort relative to that question. And that is if you look over the last 12 years at our accident year -- initial accident year pick combined ratio, every year in the last 12, that accident year combined ratio has developed positively. In other words, each accident year has had redundancy in it. So that basically tells you that our expected loss pick in the [indiscernible] account is a conservative pick.","Kai Pan","That's great. And lastly, Dom, can you talk a little bit more about some of the growth areas, including Lloyd's?","Dom Addesso","Well, Lloyd's, of course we just got off the ground at January 1. It was a process that we were able to move relatively quickly on into Lloyd's, and I think we got it done in near record time. But given our scale in the marketplace I think it was a win-win not only for us, but I think also for the Lloyd's as a market in general.","So we're pleased with that. And in that space, and Lloyd's in particular as a growth area we're looking at primarily continental Europe. In addition to Lloyd's will be a platform that will help us in some of the Asian markets, particularly China and Australia, where it's advantageous to issue Lloyd's paper is contrasted with what we had been doing was issuing paper at Everest Re; just some cost advantages to that. It also provides a facility for U.S. business that might have multinational exposure. So those are the opportunities for Lloyd's.","Generally in the insurance base, as we mentioned, property E&S is a big growth area for us, A&H, commercial D&O, private company D&O -- we've got an inland marine team. We're doing some -- we're looking at growth in the excess casualty in environmental areas. Our work comp book particularly in California has been growing. And we're looking at how we can possibly use that capability in other jurisdictions that are favorable as far as work comp is concerned.","So there's just a number of areas, whether it be lines of business or segments that we're focusing on. The contingency business, our sports and entertainment as well, I mentioned, is growing nicely. So it's across a number of different areas.","Kai Pan","That's great. Well, thank you so much for all the answers, and good luck.","Dom Addesso","Thank you, Kai.","Craig Howie","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sarah DeWitt of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Sarah DeWitt","Hi, good morning, and congrats on a good quarter. The underlying combined ratio for the whole company, you've done a good job keeping this stable in 2015 versus '14, despite some rate pressure, as well as growing the insurance business. Could you just talk about your ability to maintain margins going forward or should we expect any deterioration?","Dom Addesso","Sarah, this is Dom. And I think clearly with the rates going down, I mean, it's fairly obvious that margins are no doubt going to be under pressure. The way we look at it, as opposed to looking at it from a combined ratio point of view, maybe just give you a high level view. Based on what we say 1\/1 and perhaps what we could expect through the balance of the year, and also factoring in where we see insurance pricing as well, which is generally more flattish than it is in the reinsurance base. We would expect an overall impact of about one point in our [ROE 00:02:05]. And that's essentially how we think about -- maybe that's the best way to answer the question that you've asked.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay, that's helpful. And then on the insurance reserves strengthening, why do you think we could turn the corner on that runoff business? And can you give us any color in terms of what's the duration of these claims, how much has been paid out? Anything that gives you comfort that we might be reaching inflection point on this would be helpful.","Dom Addesso","Well, let me first say that what I think is more important, and what I pay most attention to is our overall reserve adequacy of the entire group. Which I think personally has been improving over time. Part of the evidence of that is what I referenced earlier in response to Kai, in terms of how our accident year combined ratio or loss picks have developed.","Right now your question is very focused on the insurance side, and understandably so, you never know in any of these lines of business. We have a couple of hundred different IBNR groups clearly summer -- in each year we have redundancies in some, and deficiencies in others. So this is a natural occurrence in the complete reserving process. So I can't emphasize enough that the overall reserve position is what we really stay focused on.","As I said in my comments -- opening comments was that we're reasonably confident that our overall insurance position, again as a group, is sufficient. But with reserves, it's one of those things that you never know as it relates to any individual class within the segment. But as I said, I think our overall insurance portfolio is well reserved.","Craig Howie","Just to add to that, during the reserve process this year, when we went through the insurance segments, we did consider the severity of scenarios, as well as volatility assumptions in those calculations that were done during the reserve studies. And Management did elect to book a higher number than the actuarial indicated estimate for both of these books of reserves, both the Umbrella book and construction liability book.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay. And was that the major factor that changed versus last year, when you did the study at this time?","Craig Howie","One of the major factors that changed this year was we did a claim review for the Umbrella book. We had done a claim review earlier in the year. And we used -- utilized those results that came out of that claim review to take into account that impact and that was considered during the actuarial studies for that book of business.","On the construction liability side, this relates to run-off landscapers program that we stopped writing back in 2008. The company no longer writes this book of business, but these are not indemnity type claims anymore, were considered an additional insured. Claimants have 10 years to file claims against the general contractor.","So again, they are not indemnity claims at this point. They are mostly legal fees. So, it is a little bit more difficult to wrap your arms around this other than looking at not only frequency but also severity of those cases.","Sarah DeWitt","Thanks, it's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.","Dom Addesso","Thank you.","Operator","We'll now move to our final caller for today's Q&A. This is Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Josh Shanker","Hey, good morning everyone.","Dom Addesso","Good morning, Josh.","Josh Shanker","Good morning. I would guess that on average I ask question about the insurance business about once every three quarters. And Dom, you were named CFO in 2009, President in 2011, CEO in 2013, if Everest had chosen any of those times to dump the insurance business, would that have been a mistake?","Dom Addesso","Yes.","Josh Shanker","Why should we think that Everest in long term in a great position to be in insurance business?","Dom Addesso","And obviously with the premise of your question you are referencing the reserve outcomes.","Josh Shanker","I am also noticing that -- I am also like current accident years are running about 100% anyways.","Dom Addesso","No, they are not. We looked for the current accident year is running at 94 -- 94.3.","Josh Shanker","But this year -- I mean maybe that's the new trend I guess. I mean look at over a 10-year period I guess.","Dom Addesso","Well, look, we have significantly modified the method in which we are doing business in the insurance space. The historical insurance footprint of Everest was a program based book of business. Today, that book of business is dominated by direct brokerage book of business. One in which we are primarily driving the underwriting as opposed to an MGA driving the underwriting. That does not mean by the way that we don't have some favorable and significant MGA relationships that we still maintain. But predominantly the book has been driven by desk underwriters that are employed by Everest. That's the significant change.","And I think we've been able to demonstrate over the last couple of years improvement in the accident year in calendar year -- or accident year combined ratio. But clearly, there's been a challenge with reserves that come up from books of business that have been terminated, as Craig pointed out, that have been terminated 2008 and earlier. There's nothing that current management can do about that except focus on building out a first class insurance organization, which we believe we are doing today.","Josh Shanker","And so, your view is over the next two or three years, you'll be surprised if the insurance industry is not a contributor to profits the way the reinsurance business has been?","Dom Addesso","Absolutely. Now, by definition in cat for year, the Reinsurance segments are going to produce a better combined ratio than the insurance space, but the insurance sector is much stable in that perspective, But I think the current year attritional ratios demonstrate that already.","John Doucette","Josh, it's John. Just to add a little more color, I think also in the context of one of things we've really been focused in the last several years, Dom and the executive management team, is expanding our opportunity set and trying to figure out how we can get profitable growth.","That's why we've been hiring very talented teams of people or individuals that can hire teams of people and can access business on the insurance side. That's why we are getting into Lloyds. That's why we are setting up the alternative capital to give us more capacity to deploy in other areas.","So around the globe whether it's insurance or reinsurance, whether it's in the U.S. or internationally, we are looking for ways to expand our opportunity set. I think that's my job, that's the senior leaders in insurance and insurance team to develop new products, new distribution, new opportunities. And that also is one of the reasons why -- as we develop that, one of the reasons why the combined ratio has stabilized and our goal is to hopefully improve even in this market condition.","Dom Addesso","And Josh, look, say the decision that -- thank you for your recollection of all my stints at Everest, but I -- had we made maybe the decision that you're suggesting to let's say dispose the insurance sector, these reserve developments that we've seen would not have gone away. All right, those are things that would have been there regardless of whether we have chosen to go forward on the insurance sector or not. And in fact, I think if anything the insurance sector based on the new strategy has been accretive to earnings regardless of the prior year development. That prior year development is -- was baked. There is nothing that we could have done about that.","Josh Shanker","Good luck. I hope it ceases in the future and we'll see what happens.","Dom Addesso","We will see.","Josh Shanker","Thank you.","Dom Addesso","That was the last question\u2026","Operator","That was the last question in the queue. So I would like to hand back to our speakers now for any additional or closing remarks.","Dom Addesso","Well, thank you every much. Again, we're very pleased to report record quarter and outstanding year particularly compared to generally what's going on in the overall market. We appreciate your questions and certainly understand even the tough ones. We think that we have demonstrated over the past couple of years that our strategies that we embarked on a couple of years ago are beginning to demonstrate that we can produce returns that are above market returns -- above the market.","So again, thank you for your questions and your interest in Everest, and we will talk to you in the months ahead.","Operator","Thank you. That will now conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect."],"8799":["Everest Re Group Ltd. (NYSE:RE) Q2 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call July 30, 2019 10:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Jon Levenson - IR","Dom Addesso - President and CEO","Craig Howie - EVP and CFO","John Doucette - EVP, President and CEO, Reinsurance Division","Jonathan Zaffino - EVP, President and CEO, Everest Insurance Division","Conference Call Participants","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs","Mike Phillips - Morgan Stanley","Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Mike Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Amit Kumar - The Buckingham Research Group","Ryan Tunis - Autonomous Research","Meyer Shields - KBW","Brian Meredith - UBS","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jon Levenson, please go ahead, sir.","Jon Levenson","Thank you, Sinead, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.","The Everest Executives leading today's call are Dom Addesso, President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, EVP and Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, EVP and President and CEO of the Reinsurance Division; and Jonathan Zaffino, EVP and President and CEO of the Everest Insurance Division.","Before we begin, I need to preface the comments on today's call by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in Everest's SEC filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures these items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement.","With that I turn the call over to Dom Addesso.","Dom Addesso","Thanks Jon. Good morning and welcome to our call this morning where we are pleased to outline the excellent results we had for the quarter.","As you've no doubt seen by now, our net income per share for the quarter was $8.39 resulting in an ROE of 16.1%. This combined with the first quarter equaled almost $17 per share and a 16.5% ROE. The quarter saw a continued underwriting profitability in both our Reinsurance and Insurance divisions along with a very strong level of investment income.","My colleagues will give many of the details underlying our success, but let me say that we continue to execute successfully on our strategy. For Reinsurance, it has been a diversification effort and over time, has seen growth in casualty, mortgage and non-cat property and of course our strategic repositioning in the insurance space which began just over four years ago is now hitting its stride.","Given our scale, ratings, global franchise and diversification in all our businesses, we can capitalize on the rate momentum we are now seeing in the market. Rate activity, we are seeing; however, is still spotty and in several instances not yet at levels they need to be. Nevertheless, this certainly appears to be a market that will continue to see Re.","Our observation of capacity pullbacks and an increasing flow into the facultative market and the E&S markets are encouraging signs, perhaps not a classical hard market but given industry reserve positions, capital levels and frankly better analytics. The amplitude of prior pricing cycles is likely being replaced with more timely actions.","I believe that is in part what we are seeing now. An element of this is also in reaction to loss trend. There has been much discussion about loss trend over the last couple of weeks. No doubt it is evident in many classes but to varying degrees and while everyone is looking for a Point estimate, there will undoubtedly be varying numbers based on book profile, class, attachment point et cetera.","As a general comment our rate increases are for the most part, above trend. In addition, we would expect that loss trend to continue and accordingly rate increases will likely persist. My colleagues will get into the many details on our results. But it is worth emphasizing that over the past several years, we have continued to diversify and reduce volatility. One measure of that is our expected annual cat loss which just a few short years ago was 12 points as a percentage of premium and now stands at approximately 6.5 points.","The end result is less volatility and improved profit targets. Our reinsurance division has successfully diversify this portfolio. As I mentioned earlier and our insurance segment now at over 30% of our business. Is growing profitably. At its current pace, as I mentioned in last quarter the sum of the parts should prove to be quite positive. Thank you.","And now to Craig for the financial highlights.","Craig Howie","Thank you, Dom, and good morning everyone.","Everest had another solid quarter of earnings with net income of $343 million in the second quarter of 2019. This compares to net income of $70 million for the second quarter of 2018. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $692 million compared to $280 million for the first half of 2018. Net income included $100 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $9 million of capital losses in the first half of 2018.","The 2019 capital gains were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on the public equity portfolio. After-tax operating income for the second quarter was $321 million compared to $40 million in 2018.","Operating income year-to-date was $603 million compared to $260 million for the first six months of 2018. The 2019 result represents an annualized operating income, return on equity of 14.4%. These results were driven by a strong underwriting performance across the Group, stable core investment income, a higher contribution from private equity investments and lower catastrophe losses compared to the first half of 2018.","The overall underwriting gain for the Group was $393 million for the first half compared to an underwriting gain of $20 million in the same period last year. In second quarter of 2019, the company reported $30 million of net adverse catastrophe development. The catastrophe losses were primarily reported in the international reinsurance segment and related to Typhoon Jebi, which occurred in Japan during the third quarter of 2018.","The industry loss estimates for this event rose significantly again this quarter. The initial estimates for Jebi were $3 billion to $7 billion and at that time, we estimated a conservative estimate based on an $8 billion industry loss.","We have now reestimated our share of the Typhoon Jebi losses in line with the high end of the new industry range of $14 billion to $16 billion. Although we have number of loss events in the quarter, including U.S. storm events, none of these events breached our $10 million catastrophe threshold and as such are included in our attritional loss estimates. On a year-to-date basis, the results reflected catastrophe losses of $55 million compared to $597 million during the first half of 2018.","Partially offsetting the catastrophe losses was $22 million of favorable prior year reserve development related to non-catastrophe reserves. This prior year favorable development was primarily identified for reserve studies completed in the second quarter of 2019. These reserves related to casualty and property reinsurance business both in the United States and internationally.","The redundancy determined from the reserve studies was recognized in the second quarter given the magnitude of the overall indications. These redundancies have developed over time, but we don't revise estimates until the reserve position becomes more mature.","We continue to maintain our loss reserve estimates for the more recent years excluding the catastrophe losses and favorable prior year reserve development the underlying book continues to perform well.","The overall attritional combined ratio through the first six months was 88% compared to 87% for the full year of 2018. The attritional loss ratio of 59.5% and the commission rate ratio of 22.8% were up slightly compared to the same period last year. Primarily due to business mix in the reinsurance segment which has been writing more casualty business over the past several quarters.","The Group expense ratio remains low at 5.7% for the first two quarters of 2019. This is flat compared to the same period last year. Our year-to-date reported combined ratio of 88.9% was driven by the strong underwriting performance of both our reinsurance segment and our ... insurance segment.","Before moving onto investment income, I'd like to point out that we included two new pages in our financial supplement Pages 6 and 11. These pages detail gross written premium by major lines of business, for the total Reinsurance and Insurance segments. This provides background detail to the business mix shift and the resulting combined ratio changes we've been referencing. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $179 million for the quarter and $320 million year-to-date on our $19.8 billion investment portfolio, a new record portfolio size for Everest.","For the year-to-date, investment income was up $40 million or 14% from one year ago. This result was primarily driven by the increase from the investment grade fixed income portfolio which had a higher asset base this year.","Additionally, we've seen a recovery and limited partnership income which was up $11 million for the first half - from the first half of 2018, as we expected and mentioned in the first quarter. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.4% compared to 3.1% one year ago, as both investment grade and alternative fixed income yields are up year-over-year.","The duration of the portfolio remains at just over three years. On income taxes, the 12% effective tax rate on operating income is associated with the amount and geographic region of the underwriting gains and the investment income, expected to be earned for the full year.","The effective tax rate is an annualized calculation and includes planned catastrophe losses for the remainder of the year. Lower-than-expected catastrophe losses would cause the tax rate to trend higher than the current 12% rate.","Positive cash flow continues with record operating cash flows of $854 million for the first half of 2019 compared to $133 million in 2018. The increase reflects our growth in premiums and a lower level of paid catastrophe losses in 2019 compared to 2018. Shareholders' equity for the group was $8.9 billion at the end of the second quarter, another record for Everest, up almost $1 billion or 12% compared to year-end 2018.","The increase in shareholders' equity. In the first half of 2019 is primarily attributable to $692 million of net income and the recovery in the fair value of the investment portfolio, partially offset by capital return for $114 million of dividends paid as well as $25 million in share buybacks. Everest continues to maintain a very strong capital position with industry low debt leverage and high liquidity in our investment portfolio in addition to our robust cash flow. The strength of our balance sheet is critical to the success of our business.","Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations.","John Doucette","Thank you, Craig. Good morning.","We are pleased to report another strong quarter for the Reinsurance Division with $178 million of underwriting profit in Q2. And further diversification of our portfolio providing stability and balance to our operation. Our global franchise is well positioned and new initiatives, underwriting actions and rate increases. We are finally seeing both the property and casualty reinsurance markets move positively.","Reflecting a combination of recent catastrophe losses, capacity shortages, trapped capital, pockets of poor loss experience and new found discipline from some of the largest players in both insurance and reinsurance. The upshot is improving original insurance rates which Jon Zaffino will touch on later and better reinsurance rate terms and conditions in several parts of our portfolio.","In Florida, we were pleased with our June renewal. Overall, the market was rational with pricing up. We saw a more risk adjusted rate increases on loss affected treaties and increases on many others, but there was a wide range of outcomes with some programs remaining underpriced. I think of this not as a hard market but as a reasonable market.","Finding its way back to a sustainable balance between serving clients needs and generating appropriate returns on reinsurance capital therefore, we continued our practice of allocating capital to long-term strategic clients and the deals with the best returns.","Our underwriting and modeling teams did a great job positioning Everest to capture more of the best business while shedding less attractive deals, the end result was a reduction of Everest exposure to property gap and an effort to encourage rate discipline through scarcity of our capacity. On some deals we achieved tighter terms and conditions such as LAE cap and lower current limits on proportional treaties.","Consequently, we are encouraged with the direction of the Florida market, but more improvement is needed given several years of Deterioration, rate pressure and loss cost inflation. Nevertheless, the bottom line for our Florida book is a higher ROE and a reduced model cat loss. We achieved portfolio rate increases that outpace the overall market by strongly differentiating programs through disciplined underwriting.","We are pleased that model profitability remains relatively flat despite meaningful reductions to our catastrophe exposures. Switching to July 1st, outside of Florida, U.S. property, renewals were orderly and directionally positive. Rates were up mid-to- high single-digits on a risk adjusted basis. Property business at July 1, outside of the U.S. was generally stable.","With rate increases driven by loss activity or the reunderwriting mandated from some of the Lloyd's Syndicate. As mentioned previously, during the April 1st renewals for Japan, Everest did employ more capacity there given the improved rates. And the Japanese market is preparing for potentially further rate increases for upcoming renewal.","Due to recent loss experience particularly the industries loss creep on JEBI. In the U.S. casualty lines trends remain positive. Despite plentiful potential capacity, the market has grown more discipline in both reinsurance and insurance, as primary rates improve across most line.","Casualty reinsurance terms are stable for non-loss affected business; however, poor performance and increasing loss trends over the last several years are prompting reinsurers increase rates and decreased commission because of Everest, 40 plus year history, strong balance sheet and ratings, large market presence, robust, long-term client relationships and responsive underwriting we continue to garner preferential access on casualty reinsurance business.","As we have previously discussed, until about 18 months ago. We have been reducing our casualty writings over the last several years prior to that due to the deterioration in both the insurance and reinsurance casualty markets.","This has helped us avoid much of the poor loss experience that has emerged and we are now very well positioned to deploy our underwriting expertise and capacity as the casualty markets improve. In addition to casualty we have significant opportunity in mortgage business shown by the 16% growth in mortgage writings during the first half of this year.","Also of note is the evolution and strong growth of our facultative book globally over the past several years. We have several very experienced fact teams worldwide who are product experts and local market specialist. We now have over $430 million of facultative reinsurance premium in-force, covering property casualty, professional, specialty and order lines across Miami, New York, New Jersey and several other offices in the U.S. as well as in Toronto, Singapore and London.","This is an all-time high gross written premium for our facultative book after meaningful growth during the last few years. And it is well diversified as our global back book is broadly split by line approximately 60% casualty and 40% property. And it is also split geographically 60% international and 40% U.S. meaningful improving back opportunities emerged following dislocation in Lloyd's the 2017 and 2018 cat losses and general decrease in D&F capacity.","Tax submission flow is up significantly in all territories in line highlighted by the 26% year-to-date increase in U.S. that fac casualty submissions. On the demand side, our fac clients are seeking both short and long tail limit reduction and exposure management, particularly in auto due to poor experience increased demand is broad based across back including property, casualty, individual risk auto fac, U.S. placements and placements from abroad.","Our growth in facultative business exemplifies our ability to capitalize on opportunity around the globe. Writing all P&C lines of fac in key centers all over the world requires a robust global infrastructure and it's hard for competitors to replicate which gives us a sustainable competitive advantage.","Our strong growth in fac is more evidence of an improving overall reinsurance market as Dom mentioned earlier, because fac renewals happen much more often than treaty renewal they are good leading indicators of market trend. We are bullish that this improving trend in fac will continue well past 2020, particularly as tough exposures meet limited capacity in the firming treaty market.","During the second quarter Everest purchased an aggregate property retro program that will help protect us from a large catastrophe loss or series of mid-sized losses. This retro program was designed to refine the shape of our portfolio by further diversifying our capital structure, reducing that volatility, adding flexibility to deploy our capital for interesting and unique opportunities.","This retro purchase aids to be better positioned to capture improvement opportunities in the property space, including at January 1, 2020, given the retro market dislocation and trapped capital while managing the volatility of our property book with the combined financial strength of our shareholders.","Common equity, Mt. Logan capital Kilimanjaro cat bonds ILWs, facultative retro protection and now this additional aggregate retro capacity, we are well capitalized and not reliant on any one capital source to finance our underwriting risks.","Moving on to our year-to-date results, our global reinsurance operations at growth of 3% on written and earned premium during the first half of 2019. Growth came from U.S. operations with increased casualty and mortgage writings offset by slightly less premium in treaty property as we push rate and in Bermuda due to some non-renewal of some - of a few large deals .","we booked in 86.6% combined ratio for reinsurance operations with cat losses of $55 million which included losses from the Townsville monsoon, Australian flooding and some loss - some additional loss development from Typhoon Jebi as the market loss worsen significantly just as Craig mentioned earlier these cat losses mostly impacted our international segment. Excluding catastrophe losses, the underlying loss ratio of 57.4% for reinsurance operations increased by 0.4 points compared to the full year of 2018.","Given the greater mix of casualty and pro rata business in our portfolio. We continue to be viewed by clients and brokers all over the world as a core go-to trading partner and garner increased opportunities particularly with dislocations of capacity around the world in multiple lines of business. These dislocations and pressure on supply of risk capital include one dislocation due to lower large scale rationalization impact and direct and facultative capacity","And many international portfolios helping to drive improvements in the E&S Primary and facultative books, two ongoing trapped capital from 2017 and 2018 losses and the subsequent market loss deterioration are pushing ILS investors to retrench, withdraw capacity for demand better pricing and terms the resulting dislocation in several property reinsurance market and global retro capacity will likely continue for the upcoming January renewal.","Three, some European reinsurers have been pulling back casualty and professional reinsurance capacity decreasing authorizations on specific programs were pushing casualty rates and terms, which is leaving potential in some clients treaties and creating some upward pressure on casualty rates both of which provide attractive opportunities.","Four, some reinsurers our now bumping up against internal risk capacity limits or rating agency constraints for mortgage causing reduced involvement on new mortgage deal. We believe this mortgage reinsurance capacity constraints for some rated carriers will continue or even grow. Each of these or taken separately and certainly together present robust prospects for profitable growth opportunities for a large global reinsurers with strong capital high ratings and dry powder.","In summary, we are pleased with not only our year-to-date results but also with our strategic positioning for the future. Despite this evolving market we remain focused on building long-term value for our shareholders while being the first call for our clients and broker partners.","Thank you and now I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations.","Jonathan Zaffino","Thanks Jon and good morning.","Our global specialty insurance operations delivered another solid quarter of performance. We continue to experience high quality, profitable growth within our many retail and wholesale underwriting divisions across North America and several international markets. Our growth remained balanced and diversified by geography, product segment and distribution channel.","Our insurance operations are well positioned to continue on this path of growth and profitability as clients increasingly rely on Everest Insurance to offer solutions to help them address a growing range of complex risk issues.","Our leading balance sheet formidable global infrastructure and outstanding talent, nearly 1,000 strong are increasingly in demand in this transitioning market. The second quarter brought some notable performance achievements highlighted by record reported gross and net written premiums as well as net earned premium.","We also experienced the highest level of quarterly submissions across our retail and wholesale operations coupled with the strongest renewal retention. We have experienced, and more than five years and our U.S. direct operations. This speaks to the growing role Everest Insurance plays in the global specialty market.","The second quarter also continued a nearly five year trend or 18 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth in our business. This focused growth is the result of increased scale and relevance within the many underwriting divisions across our global property and casualty and accident and health operations.","We believe significant additional scale can be achieved within our chosen product areas. Allowing us to maintain excellent growth rates into the future. Of course, market conditions dependent.","Most importantly and this quarter builds upon the underwriting profitability achieved in the first quarter of this year and brings our year-to-date underwriting profit to $38 million, a 72% increase over prior year first half. Our second quarter underwriting profit was $19 million, a more than two fold increase over 2018 second quarter and $16 million more that our 2017 second quarter performance.","Further, nine of the last 10 quarters have now produced an underwriting profit, the lone exception being the 3rd quarter of 2017. An area of continued focus for the insurance operation is the attraction of industry-leading talent. Everest Insurance and the greater Everest organization remains a highly desirable home for talented professionals.","Across a range of disciplines in fact, hundreds of talented colleagues have chosen to join Everest Insurance over the past several years and we are proud to welcome them into the Everest family. These talent acquisition efforts continue to fuel our growth, enable our capabilities and differentiate us by ensuring we have the right people in place to support our strategic initiatives, our ever expanding books of business and most importantly our growing client base.","The evolution of Everest Insurance is a long-term effort and there is always room for further improvement yet we are certainly encouraged by our trajectory to date and are optimistic about our opportunities in the market ahead.","Turning to the financial results for the quarter and year-to-date period. For the second quarter of 2019, the global insurance operations produced $757 million in gross written premium, an increase of $111 million or 70% Over second quarter of 2018. Year-to-date, gross written premium rose to one $1.4 billion, a $201 million or 17% increase over the same period of 2018.","Our net written premium growth matched our top line growth at 17% year-over-year increasing by $80 million to $549 million. Net earned premium in the quarter was $474 million, an increase of $65 million or 16% for the year-to-date period net earned premium increased to 899 million an increase of $97 million or 12% over the prior year period.","The growth in earned premium has been anticipated as various business ventures incepted over the past several years, begin to earn through the P&L at a greater rate. Turning to the combined ratio, for the quarter, the GAAP combined ratio was 96%, a 170 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2018 and a 310 basis point improvement over the same period in 2017.","Year-to-date, the GAAP combined ratio was 95.8%, a 150 basis point improvement over the comparable prior year period and a 300 basis point improvement over the first half of 2017. The attritional combined ratios for the quarter and year-to-date period are 96% and 95.8% respectively.","On the year-to-date basis we see an 80 basis point improvement over 2018 year-to-date results of 96.6%. The quarter's loss and loss adjustment expense ratio improved 290 basis points from the prior year period to 65.8% from 68.7%. This includes the benefit of no cat losses in the current quarter, a result of thoughtful positioning of our various property portfolios.","On a year-to-date basis, the 2019 attritional loss ratio of 65.4%, an 80 basis points improved over last year's 66.2%. Our expense ratio was stable in the quarter, and consistent with the full year of 2018 performance. We continue to take advantage of our improved scale to invest in people, technology and new locations in key markets across the globe.","For the year-to-date period the expense ratio was 30.4%, down slightly from the 30.5% in the comparable period of 2018. As we expect that we are seeing the stabilization of our expense ratio year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter as earned premium continues to come through as our businesses mature.","Turning to the operating environment I would echo the sentiment you have heard from other companies, namely that the trading environment and trading conditions globally continue to improve, as respect to pricing I would break this down into three areas.","First, we are seeing improved underlying pricing across all lines except workers' compensation. Second, we see accelerating price improvement in several areas across property, liability and professional lines.","And third, for the first time in many quarters, our aggregate renewal price change, which includes exposure change has moved into positive territory registering 2.9% for the quarter, inclusive of workers' compensation. Excluding workers' compensation Everest Insurance produced an aggregate renewal price change of 8.1% in the quarter, which is the strong as we have seen in seven years.","Year-to-date, the renewal price change as they likewise excellent 6.3%. Further, this continues the upward trend and non-workers' compensation rate change that began in the beginning of 2017. And in fact the underlying rate change increased to 7% in the second quarter.","In general, I would say the same themes we have discussed in prior calls are continuing to play out. However, the notable change is the increased momentum. Property lines, cat and non-cat exposed alike continue to gain meaningful rate as does commercial auto, both were up in the low-to-mid teens this quarter. The liability lines Primary and Excess are also beginning to achieve more significant rate, generally in the low-to-mid single digit range, as are the professional and financial lines.","The financial lines initially lag other areas in terms of rate achievement, but are quickly beginning to adjust to the new reality of much needed rate to absorb increased loss cost. So overall, we see a much more constructive environment and as our renewal premium changes indicate, we are optimistic that this trend will continue in the quarters ahead.","In conclusions stated simply, this is another quarter of strong growth, increased profitability and meaningful advancements toward our strategic objectives. We look forward to reporting back to you next quarter.","And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Sinead for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Yaron Kinar","My first question goes to the underlying or - your loss ratio and reinsurance. I guess we are seeing about 5.5 points of deterioration year-over-year. You called out business mix loss trend and non-cat weather. Can you maybe help us think about the magnitude of each of those drivers and then maybe as a follow-up to that, how should we think about the 87% underlying combined ratio that you had talked about in the past given that I think it was a little bit in excess of that this quarter?","Dom Addesso","This is Dom. I'll start and ask Mr. Doucette to - and Craig to complement wherever I say. But first of all, I think the comparison against the year ago quarter is a little bit difficult because of the number of adjustments that we made in the second quarter of last year. So we think the more appropriate comparison is to look at the full year, December of '18 against the six months of '18. So the gap that you described is much narrower.","Again it's business mix shift, it's certainly conservative loss picks, less of a factor is any loss cost trend, but those are the main drivers of the movement and the other thing to keep in mind is that through six months we still carry fairly good size non-cat, cat loads so that's also reflected in the six months numbers.","We're in the full year that tends to get equalized out. So those are some of the factors, I don't know if Craig or John want to add anything to that.","John Doucette","Yes, it's John, good morning. Just one thing, I think we had about $32 million of reinstatement premiums in last year's Q2 which also skews, the comparison of just isolating the quarter-over-quarter comparison.","Yaron Kinar","And then my other question is just with regards to premium growth in reinsurance. So I appreciate the color and the opening statements, and I realize that there are a bunch of offsets there. But, and this may be Monday morning quarterbacking here, but I guess I'm looking at the prior year had 137% growth and gross premiums, about 47% growth in net premiums, definitely saw a slowdown here even as rates have improved I guess how should we think about the rate, the premium momentum here and I guess, in hindsight, was the capital deployment in 2018 maybe too aggressive leading to some needed to slow down growth and '19?","Craig Howie","Yaron, and this is Craig. Just, just to kick this off and then I'll let John jump in as well. But this is something that I think you have to look at. So, you mentioned the growth in the prior year. What I would say to you is the growth this year on a year-to-date basis is actually 5% if you exclude foreign exchange, so you're actually growing on top of that growth from prior year so that's, certainly something I'd ask you to look at.","Yaron Kinar","Yes and too, I don't think this has anything to do with capital in terms of our deployment, it really is opportunity set and where we see it. And there's a - there is a - these are core renewal portfolio, there are some large one-off deals and this year, there were a couple of those deals that we didn't come to you know the renewal terms with the clients and so that again skews the numbers, which is one of the reasons we think it's better to look at the year-to-date numbers as opposed to the quarterly numbers. And we're actively talking to some clients about some large, complicated deals now, and so it could move the other way as well. So I - but it's absolutely not capital related. Okay.","Dom Addesso","And one of the things I'd add to that, Yaron, is that you know reinsurance by its very nature can be a little lumpy, so I wouldn't necessarily look at any year-over-year increases in premium as some kind of a forecasting tool, if you look at our property pro rata. For example, that moves around a fair bit and to John's point if you can't come to term with a client on a particular deal then you've got to slug a premium that - pro rata can be lumpy.","So you can have a slug of premium that can be here one year and gone the next. It's not particularly troubling. For us, again our franchises is one in which we continue - each and every year, we gained momentum in the marketplace across many different product sets. So the momentum is still quite fair.","Operator","And now take our next question from Mike Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Mike Phillips","I wanted to touch on the insurance side. I appreciate all the color there at the end with the conditions are improving. You mentioned - you mentioned three reasons why, I mean you said liability and professional lines, low-to-mid single-digit rates but much in it - much needed and loss costs are still rising. So, I guess all that in, if you look at the past. I don't know, 7, 8, 9 quarters. Your core loss ratio or your core combined ratio was around 96 or so and really hasn't moved much from there, I guess how do you think about, given the rate and loss trend environment in the insurance, when do you expect any kind of movement and improvement in that core loss and core combined ratio?","Dom Addesso","I'll start and ask Mr. Zaffino to answer that. Our combined ratio and loss ratio is here again, also driven by mix. So in the insurance operation - by the way is a great, a great result and we're quite proud of it. But we've got this additional rate activity, rate increases coming into the market, we have not pull down our loss ratios to account for any of that we tend to be more conservative in our loss picks.","So we continue to pick the same loss ratio on a higher premium base on the other hand, again to reflect some level of conservatism where comp with rate decreases we've actually increased our loss pick and will come, given the fact that they were rate decreases that we're facing.","So we've kind of short sighted ourselves in a way there and then I guess the last point you mentioned or I mentioned already, but mix, so we have a bit more risk management business in our portfolio than we anticipated, which just by - and accident and health business, which by its very nature, books at a higher combined ratio still very profitable, consistently profitable business.","So that's some of the reasons why perhaps we're not seeing as much movement as you would otherwise have expected in the combined. But nevertheless we are still anticipating continued improvement over the quarters and years ahead. So Jonathan, you have anything to add.","Jonathan Zaffino","I think that's well said. I would add to that remember, if you look at our strong growth rates from quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year to Dom's point, this can create mix changes that are hard to read from any specific quarter and Dom mentioned our risk management business, which is an excellent business, which tends to run in that sort of mid-90s levels that was a bit of a - a bigger contribution this quarter.","As I also mentioned in my prepared remarks, you know, the earned premium from various new products, new underwriting divisions over the past few years are beginning to earn in and some of the dissipation if you will, of some areas that we had identified as a run off or those that we were deemphasizing our earning out, you're starting to see that intersection happen and we expect that to continue to happen in a beneficial way as we move forward here.","So we're focused on delivering underwriting profit. We're going to be conservative in our views of how we recognize Dom's point, some of the rate changes that are earning through but I think those variety of factors are, what you're seeing is the reason for the mid-90s","Mike Phillips","I guess more generally then there has been some concerns affecting the overall industry. And kind of rising toward activity and litigation activity and I guess anything you've seen there and if I - kind of your business and if so, anything that we would see from maybe the paid activity that we can look at it from your Loss Triangles?","Jonathan Zaffino","No, - this is John again, we're obviously looking at the same dynamics that are being discussed across the industry. It's very difficult to broad-brush any one line of one area, each portfolio is a bit different, how companies address sort of where they hold certain acts - here it's a bit different. I would say as a general tone we are keeping a close eye on this it's often discussed in the general liability area. We write general liability for instance, across many different areas many different industry segments, each with different dynamics.","And we talk about loss trend remember, there is two parts of that, there's frequency and severity, so they're going to differ from area to area. We're keeping an eye on it. We're encouraged by the rate levels that we're starting to see. Net trend is a little bit more muted with some of the exposure growth going on, but whether it's financial lines that's going to be a bit of a different mix, whether you're in Primary or Excess areas, same with the GL, autos has been talked about for quite some time.","So overall, we take a look at the portfolio every quarter, really every day, trying to learn from what we're seeing out there, but I would say we feel pretty comfortable about where we are and even more comfortable as rate starts to build over the ensuing months here.","Craig Howie","And fair to say we do not see an explosion in trend. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, what we see in our portfolio and differs by company but what we see in our portfolio is trend is well within our rate increases.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan","My first question is going back to the margin conversation and really this is on the reinsurance side of things. So I know it's reflective of your business mix and Dom, I think you said we should look at the full year '18 and kind of compare the second quarter there, but I guess I'm thinking more about going forward, do you expect the mix to continue to tilt more toward casualty and away from property and should we think about the reinsurance At 86, attritional combined ratio is how we should think about modeling going forward or the half year. Just kind of margin expectations on a forward basis.","Dom Addesso","Right, so the - for the first half it's 85.4 not 86, not to get too precise, but for on the attritional side. And look at in the reinsurance business it's difficult to predict where the mix will go because as we've talked about many times over many, many quarters, we'll put our capital to where we think the best opportunities are and what emerges next year is a better opportunity. Who knows, but I would say that where we are mix wise today is probably balanced, where we would expect to be over the remaining quarters.","Certainly we would expect more writings in mortgage, which as you know carries a lower combined ratio I don't know that we necessarily see any explosion in casualty from here relative to our other lines of business.","So I think the mix is kind of fairly stabilized in terms of where it is today and I will. I would like to emphasize. And I know this is in the point you were quite making here but certainly what we've seen in any of the write-ups the headline of margin deterioration and again, what I'd like to point out is with the growth in premium.","It might be a deterioration in the ratio but the overall absolute dollars of underwriting margins have increased over time. And in combination with a lower in cat load frankly, that gives us, and also I think about the investment income flow without - over $800 million of positive cash flow in the first half of the year.","All of those things are we think improving our profit target, overall profit target, so - and with the decreased level of volatility. I know that isn't quite more than perhaps you asked but I think where we are now.","John Doucette","And Elyse, this is John, just to add a little more color. I mean, we're close to done within the treaty world of what we're going to put on the books for this year. They will still be facultative throughout the year. And there'll be the odd treaty deal.","But obviously not that far along is January 1st and so we'll be watching closely obviously what happens in wind season as well as what we think the capital situation is the supply demand balance and that will dictate how much capital we deployed going forward and you know there continues to seem to be some dislocation and capacity shortages and trapped capital and related - related events","As I talked about earlier. So we'll watch that and that will influence mix as well as we head into the New Year.","Elyse Greenspan","And then my second question on - if we look at your premiums writings on across the property lines. That was helpful disclosure that you guys added to the supplement, they've gone down and if we think about what happened. Obviously, now we had two successive years of high cat losses in your - John in your remarks, you mentioned some pretty good rate that you guys did see in Florida, but then we don't see that running through the premium written line.","With that there were some accounts that were still under priced that you had to come off . Like how do we reconcile. I guess the fact that there were some pretty good rate in Florida and even in other areas of the world and your property rating - property writings, sorry, have come down?","John Doucette","You're absolutely right, I mean we pushed rate and one of the ways that the market is going to get hard is - or okay - and less people willing to walk away from things and we pushed and we pushed and in some cases, we came off. We also did move up particularly in Florida, we moved up the tower, which again we thought that was a better place, better risk adjusted place to play and that that could be less, less premium, but it doesn't mean that it's less profitable risk adjusted profit.","So we were pleased with how we reposition that book and then there certainly been up a couple of pro rata deals where we, we pushed for certain ceding commissions and the current summits and things like that and we didn't get there, but again we're bullish.","We're not retreating from property at all. We thought after $200 billion, $250 billion losses maybe we had a view on what the right rate was to deploy capacity and something we talked about before is, we're also looking at is not in isolation of just property.","We're also looking at it has the opportunity set for us to deploy capital whether that's into the casualty space where we see in an emerging situation, obviously the insurance, the facultative both casualty, and international property as well as the mortgage which we remain very bullish on. So we're also, we're looking at it beyond just a property comment. We're looking at it across the whole global portfolio.","Dom Addesso","And as far as the shift that John was talking about. Generally, and this is mainly a Florida comment, the layers down low, lower traction limits we're frankly under-priced in our view and the increases there was nowhere near appropriate and also emphasize that we have increased some of our cat book outside the U.S., so John mentioned specifically Japan as one example.","John Doucette","So particularly on the Florida part, Elyse, it's John, again And particularly on the Florida part where the view of the increased risk from some of the social inflation aspects we thought were more prevalent on the lower layers.","Elyse Greenspan","And then lastly on the tax side, Craig. I think you said you know cats are lower, the tax rate should trend higher, I thought the expectation was for 13% for the year, it was a little bit light - lighter than that in the Q2 with low cats. Was there something impacting that in the current quarter?","Craig Howie","Yes. In the current quarter, we actually had more income and more foreign source income that came through. So we were able to use more foreign tax credits against that income, Elyse. So that's the reason it dropped to 12% for the first half of the year.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Josh Shanker","I guess, and this is for Jon Zaffino. You mentioned that your rate overall, your renewal rate pricing was up 2.9% and I think you said it was up 8.1% excluding workers' comp, workers' comp is about 20% of your portfolio. I'm trying to reconcile those numbers, did I understand you correctly?","Jonathan Zaffino","Yes, it's a little more than that. Josh, it's work comps is probably closer to 30%.","Josh Shanker","And then I guess, the number of assortment. So the, everything, example, workers' compensation of eight point - I mean, I know I did I just can't make the math work with numbers like that.","Jonathan Zaffino","Well, here's what you have happening. Number one there is a lot of rate being had now in the property and auto lines. Some of our auto ratings are up year-over-year. We're seeing again increased rate in a number of other areas from financial lines to other liability. Comp, you're getting some exposure look at an increased rate then to what you are in other areas as well.","So some of that shows up in renewal price change versus pure rate, so there's a number of - and then you get mix differences in the quarter as well, so the waitings could be a little different based on timing. So for instance, in the second quarter, we write a few large risk management deals you might see more of the impact on the work comp thing you might - it might mitigate some of the other areas and the opposite happens as well. So all those things kind of moving together.","Josh Shanker","And you're still growing comp, I think comp probably is pretty healthy. But what is your flexibility if comp margins begin to change? How quickly can you move in and out of the comp markets?","Jonathan Zaffino","Yes, it's a good question. I - look, I mean we see still a very favorable underlying dynamics and workers' compensation, we are watching more closely the of course the rate pressure in the impact that it has to overall profitability. Some of our growth and work comp has come from again some of the areas that we underwrite loss sensitive programs.","So you're getting the benefit of the installation of deductibles in different areas. If we see work comp starting to get to the point where it's not meeting our profitability objectives we will turn the dial well, - we will move out of some of those, particularly some of those model line areas where we're constantly adjusting rates regularly across the various different statutory companies we have and so on and so forth.","Comp is a smaller part of our book than it's been in a while. Some of that is the relative growth rates of other areas. So we will watch it closely. We feel comfortable with where it is today, but if the economic scenario dips. Further, we will selectively start to move out of different pockets but feel comfortable - these are the pockets will - where we will be able to maintain some insulation from underlying loss cost trend.","Josh Shanker","And can you give any color on where margins are year-over-year in comp and accident year and calendar year basis, you going to give numbers like us - can we talk about - has there been a difference and where the initial marks are on comp business?","Jonathan Zaffino","Fair to say that at this point comp is still very profitable, we don't, - we don't give specific my ratios disclose that anyway Craig that --","Craig Howie","We have not. We've said that it's run in the low '90s. In the past.","Jonathan Zaffino","I think frankly that's where it's being booked but we think it's better than that.","John Doucette","And just to echo Dom's comment earlier, we did take a little bit more of a conservative view of this year in the comp line in relation to some of the increased rate reductions that we were seeing, so feel pretty confident we're sort of in that range today.","Operator","And now take our next question from Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Mike Zaremski","First question, in terms of the cat load coming down over time. Is there a dynamic of increasing reinsurance, retro purchase which is flowing through the financials and causing the underlying combined ratio did increase a little bit or is simply diversification and kind of shifting up the tower and whatnot?","Craig Howie","Yes, Mr. Doucette to comment as well, but it's mostly about diversifying into other lines of business is growing those more quickly. In this particular six month period. Certainly, as Jon has pointed out we've come off a number of programs that didn't hit our pricing targets that had an impact. Jon made reference to the retro. We did purchase in his opening comments.","In part that's part of our typical risk management of our book. We have in the past purchased ILWs and we have cat bonds and Mt. Logan so that's all has been part of the equation. And as you point out moving up the tower certainly decreases premium but gives us similar a better risk adjusted return and you want to add to Jon.","Jonathan Zaffino","Just on the margin, the hedging, we have a very holistic broad brush hedging strategy and structure. And on the margin that can change the attritional combined ratio. But really, what's driving it is mix shift and growth in certain areas and growth in non-cat areas is driving it more than the hedging.","Mike Zaremski","Next on the expense ratio just clarification, I think it was up 140 basis points year-over-year. I know, I think, Craig cited and multiples people cited, it's kind of moving into more casualty is so were there any one-time items there are kind of this is, was a clean quarter. When we think about it.","Craig Howie","It's purely a mix shift and ceding commissions on pro rata casualty and product.","Mike Zaremski","And lastly, any update, do you expect the Board to make a succession decision in near-term?","Craig Howie","Yes. I and by the way, I appreciate everyone's restraints 4-5 callers to get to that question. But the simple answer to that is yes. And of course, I can't expand on that any further.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Amit Kumar from The Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Amit Kumar","Just a few quick follow-ups. The first question goes back to the growth in casualty reinsurance segment. I was just trying to better understand, if I look at casualty reinsurance pro rata. And I guess look at the definition in the K. Can you maybe you can just talk about some of the sub-segments. The growth is coming from, I guess I'm just trying to get some comfort that it's not skewed toward lines such as other liability et cetera. where there could be potential slippage in the tort climate?","Dom Addesso","Jon, you have anything on that - The casualty in the reinsurance side, I will let John to comment I don't know if he has the specifics at hand this morning but clearly casualty includes work comp, includes professional lines, the liability businesses well, it's all included. I don't know if you have a mix handy. We don't have the specific number but up a 1,000 foot view, I would say that the heavier casualty is really about 20% of the portfolio. Recognizing at more we write this in kind of the U.S. in the London market et cetera.","But then we also do write it all over the world. And then a lot of those other world of other areas. It's a, it's a lot more of the softer casualty as well and we are seeing opportunities there and we're seeing opportunities, as I have mentioned before in the back of which our book is 60% casualty and at 60% international.","So also kind of diversifying away from that really heavier casualty book. But we do write a fair bit of comp in there. Embedded in some of the program, environmental and there is a pretty diversified portfolio that we have both in territory and sub lines.","Amit Kumar","And maybe just related to that this might be for Dom or are you, do you have a view on the discussion on social inflation right now.","Dom Addesso","Look as we recognize that and that we primarily see this, what we're seeing in the inflation area with the loss cost trends. Is mainly in coming from our insurance book reinsurance book given the varieties of treaties that we write. It's hard to call a trend because it can vary by the type of business that you are in the class of business the territory, et cetera.","So we frankly rely on what we're seeing and the insurance side, at least in the early days. And clearly we see a loss cost trend. Hard to determine whether that's what you're calling social inflation or just traditional severity and frequency.","Amit Kumar","Got it.","Dom Addesso","I don't know, don't see any - necessarily any huge jury awards, if that's what you're getting at coming through our insurance book and or coming through our reinsurance side.","Amit Kumar","Yes, that's what I...","John Doucette","And this is John Doucette. I would just add that and also - within reinsurance. I mean, we have a lot more flexibility in terms of our ability to respond. So first of all, we have been writing long tail business since the '70s in all over the world and we have a lot of experience, a lot of experienced underwriters. A lot of people that understand the markets and we have a lot of data and we've seen, and we've seen things move.","And we have seen - looking at inflation and social inflation and different loss cost trends and things like that. All over the world and we also have the ability to then move by product, by attachment point move in and out of classes that gives us a lot of comfort that we're able to, with our data our expertise, our underwriting capabilities to be able to recognize that and respond to it and we do that all over the world.","And so we feel is something that we need to focus on and we do focus on, but we feel we have to keep the right capabilities to be able to respond appropriately and timely to it.","Dom Addesso","So to sum that up. I would say that we don't necessarily see any \"shock to the system.\" coming from what everyone is identifying as loss cost trends. But it is something that we and the rest of the industry frankly are addressing and are dealing with and recognizing that it's a factor in reshaping portfolios, taking a look at rates et cetera. And I think everyone is being very deliberate about that.","Amit Kumar","The only other question I had was on Mt. Logan. The AUN fell and there is obviously talk about in the past on regarding Stone Ridge's redemptions. How are you thinking about the future of this entity?","John Doucette","Yes, this is John. So, it's what at - Mt. Logan is a core strategic vehicle for us as we - as we manage our catastrophe risks, but it's one of them and we look at, we have the cat bonds we buy traditional reinsurance, we buy traditional retro for Facultative for treaty. We now have the new aggregate retro. So it's - will turn dialed up and down.","Based on that we have continue to add and look to add investors into the mix and normal course of business we will continue to do that, but we're not trying to grow for the sake of growing. It's one of the strategic dials it has very specific values to Everest, but, so do some of the other ones. And so we look across all of these as part of the holistic hedging strategy and structure that we have and you know we have the ability to turn up and down other deals as well.","Amit Kumar","And what's the Investor percentage. If you could just remind me, that's the last question I have? The percentage. I think previously you've given that number. Thanks.","John Doucette","I don't recall ever given that number.","Amit Kumar","I think it was 85. I'll follow up offline. Thanks for the answers. And good luck for the future.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take our next question from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Go ahead.","Ryan Tunis","I guess my first question is just on how - you said the PML exposures are down June 1st. Just curious if you could give us an order of magnitude around that?","John Doucette","So I mean, it varies - we track 75 zones. It varies a lot by territory and by return period and based on what products that we offer and where the attachments are, you get very different answers to that along the way.","Ryan Tunis","Is it - the property cat premium it showed down on a gross basis, is it fair to assume that on a net basis, it was down a similar amount or as a steeper decline?","John Doucette","Can look at premium if you're trying to look across the premium, to determine of PML decrease?","Ryan Tunis","No, I'm just curious in terms of - I can see the gross reduction in property cat premiums. I'm just trying to think about what profitability looks like in later cat type season. So I'm trying to get a figure, a sense of how much of that premium came down?","John Doucette","I think we don't have that split out, but I think across the entire reinsurance. I mean, I think they are directionally moving about the same.","Ryan Tunis","And then my last question is just on, I couldn't help but notice that there were no Kilimanjaro cat bond deals in the first half of the year and I. I think we've seen those in the past few. And I think that there is about $0.5 billion of limit maturing at year-end, I guess kind of same thing that Amit asked on Mt. Logan, how are you thinking about the affordability of those programs and in this environment. How are you thinking about those upcoming maturities?","John Doucette","I think the answer is it's too soon to tell what we would want to do as we had to the exploration which happens in November in December and it will depend on pricing. It will depend on the wind season and things like that. And we do track the cat bond market and the pricing spreads widened for a while and then they came in a little bit.","So it will be one and there'll be a lot of factors that we look at what is our gross book looks like, what are the alternative hedges look like. But right now we're not in a position to know whether what we would do for that or any of the other hedges.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Meyer Shields","And I appreciate your patience on this call. I don't know - I'm guessing just a quick question for Craig. I was hoping you could walk us through the earnings impact of the decline in Mt. Logan, assets under management?","Craig Howie","So the earnings impact from the fee income that we receive that shows up in our books and records is relatively immaterial. And what I mean by that is for the quarter. It was down about $1 million overall for the year, we are up about $2 million. So relatively immaterial and that comes through other income, other expense.","Meyer Shields","And then second, I guess, I'm trying to balance the year-to-date decline in interest rates with the growing presence of longer-tail lines of business in gross written premiums. Should we anticipate net written premium - I'm sorry. Net investment income going up or going down as we consider those factors?","Craig Howie","Or into next year are you talking for the remainder of this year?","Meyer Shields","I was thinking next year, but happy to hear how you're thinking about it.","Craig Howie","Well, with strong cash flow, as I pointed out, when my previous answers - the first half of the year. Certainly increased asset base will be a bigger driver we think and kind of maybe what the Fed does, but we think then what interest rates do. So to that - to that degree than we would anticipate a growing investment income number.","Operator","We'll now take our final question from Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Brian Meredith","It's a couple of quick ones hopefully here. First one, Craig. What is new money yields look like right now versus kind of your book yield?","Craig Howie","On an overall basis it's about 3.5%. Brian, but it really depends on what you're investing in, investment grade is probably slightly below that. But any bank loans or high-yield investments that we have alternative investments would be higher than that.","Brian Meredith","Right. Obviously, yes. So, okay. So still pretty positive good.","Craig Howie","Thanks.","Brian Meredith","Second question - I'm just curious, it's thoughts on kind of the crop environment outlook here given kind of what's been going on with crops in the Midwest late planting and seeding et cetera?","John Doucette","Yes, good morning Brian, it's John. So...","Brian Meredith","Yes.","John Doucette","So it was obviously a late start to the season, given the weather conditions and there was some prevented planting, and I know there's been some talk of that the prevented planting claims that you know they are - they are likely to some there, which will have - potentially have a - an upward pressure on the, loss ratio. But you know it's still early days that can recover.","We don't know what's going to happen. It's both yield and revenue. And so the yield and recover, it's maybe a little bit more focused on or depending on what happens late in the year in terms of the temperatures on what's going to impact the harvest and in terms of what the crop prices are? We don't know, I mean that you know, if we knew that we are going to do a reinsurance as well.","Brian Meredith","And then last one for you, John. Just curious, you made a comment that you thought that the I guess alternative capacity alternative capital, the reinsurance would continue to be somewhat constrained going into one more renewals, just curious why you think that is?","John Doucette","So I think it's a combination of things. I think both some trapped capital that's still exists. And we think, well, but it's also I think the development that the markets on Irma, the development now that the markets on Jebi and I think - and then you have weather is a surprise or not maybe would depend on who is looking at it, but the situation with a couple of the alternative cat managers and how - what's happened to them, but so I think the sentiment among investors has been strained over the last couple of years.","Having had five years of no-cat, basically, a very low cat, below average cats and then to have the two years with the losses. And then also have the development, I think has really focused a lot of the old alternative investors particularly ones that we call tourists that are really just they're just in it because it sounds different and interesting I think are really focusing on whether this is something they want to do.","And I think all of that will map to a healthier reinsurance market and healthier retro market as the alternative investment manager is going to be held the higher standards on transparency, rate change, collateral lease and things like that. All that points to us to a healthier property market in 2020 at January one and beyond.","Dom Addesso","Thanks everyone, for your dialogue this morning and patients and a little over, but that's fine. And I can't help but wanted to emphasize that the strategic journey that we've been on is proving successful. I just caution us all to sometimes not to focus one individual metric and for us I think the focus on the fact that our increased diversification has increased our absolute dollar margin - even though our combined ratios may increase due to a lower proportion of cap business but the advantage there's less volatility along, but along with an overall improved profit target and by the way I include investment income on that. We are a unique franchise, global franchise that is delivering returns at the highest levels of the industry right now. An exceedingly well positioned for the future.","So again, thank you for your interest and look forward to your dialog and questions in the weeks ahead. Take care, have a good day.","Craig Howie","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"8794":["Everest Re Group Ltd.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, please go ahead.","Beth Farrell","Thank you, Derek [ph]. Good morning, and welcome to Everest Re Group\u2019s First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, President and CEO of Insurance Operations.","Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today\u2019s call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements.","Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.","Dom Addesso","Thanks, Beth. Good morning and welcome to the call this morning. As noted in the published financials, the core attritional results of the company continue to be quite favorable. And despite the prior year catch reported this quarter, the operating ROE of 10.5% is quite strong. Our reinsurance book produced a $96 million underwriting profit in the quarter and our insurance franchise more than double this underwriting profit to $12.5 million for the quarter. This reflects a continuing diversification effort due to classes of business that have adequate margins.","With respect to the reinsurance segment, the underwriting profit is a consequence of improving margins in our property book, which I\u2019ll get back to in a minute, but also expanded writings in casually, mortgage and structured products. While mortgage and structured products have generally had excellent margin, we\u2019re finding the general casualty market is now firm perhaps in part due to less than expected improvement in company\u2019s margins on property business. However more prominent in the casualty market is the demand side. As underwriting income and primary market has been under pressure due to the property results, buyers have become more tuned to reducing volatility generally across their entire portfolio, driving more demand for casualty and whole account solutions.","Industry consolidation oddly plays a part in that due to large buyers needed capacity and quality markets that can support that. With respect to the property market in general, the renewal season for reinsurance offered a better terms, but was somewhat below our expectation. This resulted in us reducing our participation in certain areas. However, our first quarter premiums were above the prior year due to rate and select new opportunities. These two factors, of course, need to increase margin per dollar of PML year-over-year.","April is a key renewal for the Japan and Asia markets, which saw a slight improvement in rates, but the bright spot was the Caribbean renewals, which of course were loss affected. On balance, the reinsurance property market remains inconsistent and that there is less business that needs our current return hurdles, but enough that allowed us to increase our margin year-over-year.","Our approach to different parts of the cycle has been to match capacity of the capital at the most efficient point in the curve. That means period of contraction, expansion, attachment point change et cetera whatever suits that particular period in the market. Consequently over time you tend to outperform in the market. We think the reinsurance focus continue that trend here in the first quarter.","Our insurance operation continues its tremendous progress. While it may not be obvious given the similar attritional combined ratio year-over-year in fact the North American operation produced a 95.7 combined ratio in the quarter. The headwind, of course, is the international insurance build out, which was in the plan. During the balance of 2018, we expect the international operation to improve substantially as we are beginning to see our investments there payoff.","Insurance premium growth remains healthy, but this growth creates a pull on earnings as earned premium lags the resource investment required. In addition some of our newer product offerings with lower expected loss ratios have not yet fully have their impact as the earned premium build is still developing. As the year progresses, we expect our expense ratio and loss ratio to improve as the accelerated growth in premium becomes earned in conjunction with a more normalized resource growth.","We are quite optimistic about the ability of the insurance group to increase this level of profitability. The market will likely make that a challenging objective. However, we have demonstrated that our product diversity and scale is one that allows us to find the right opportunities. This is not unlike what I described regarding the reinsurance operation and cycle management. Before I end my comments about the underwriting operations, you surely want my comments regarding the wildfire losses booked this quarter. First let me say that this tragic event was so much more devastating than people imagine.","These record events late last year were obviously hard to evaluate especially as a reinsurer, it was one further step we moved. Our loss selection for any particular event is based on a three prolonged approach that takes into consideration the estimated industry loss, modeled estimates and client discussions. Generally, we placed greater weight on the highest believed outlooks when establishing our reserves for catastrophe events.","The models for these wildfire events were the lowest of the various estimates and as a consequence the reserves were largely based on our clients\u2019 insights into their expected loss. As many of you know our reserving philosophy, we believe that due to our various methodologies, our estimate was conservative. While this turned out not to be the case, we continue to expect that our overall 2017 year end reserve position will prove to be more than adequate to cover all losses that occurred in 2017 and prior, including cats.","Finally, let me touch on investment income, which remains strong and is reflective of a continual evaluation of our asset allocation and a low but rising interest rate environment coupled with increasing volatility in the equity markets. Our slight rotation in allocation to the private equity markets with a bias towards fixed income from public equities has resulted in a pick up in investment income.","Nevertheless, our core portfolio remains investment grade and naturally with the recent rise in rates is negatively affected our market values, thereby constraining our growth in book value. This is a relatively short-term challenge as our portfolio was on the shorter end with duration of three years. This of course means that over time these bonds will accrete to par and we will benefit from higher rates going forward. In summary based on the first quarter and what we see ahead, we remain quite optimistic and would expect to continue to produce a double-digit ROE including an expected cat load. This is a result of our diversified portfolio and strong market position as well as a solid balance sheet. Thanks for your participation this morning.","I look forward to the discussion later and now to Craig for the financial report.","Craig Howie","Thank you, Dom, and good morning everyone. Everest had another solid quarter of earnings with net income of $210 million for the first quarter of 2018. This compares the net income of $292 million for the first quarter of 2017. The 2018 results represents an annualized net income return on equity of 10%. Net income included $19 million of net after tax realized capital losses compared to $32 million of capital gains in the first quarter last year. The 2018 capital losses were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on the public equity portfolio.","After tax operating income for the first quarter was $220 million compared to $267 million in 2017. As previously announced, the company\u2019s reporting of operating income now excludes foreign exchange gains and losses. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $108 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $183 million in the same period last year.","In the first quarter of 2018, Everest saw $100 million of catastrophe losses related to the 2017 California wildfires compared to $20 million of catastrophe losses reported during the first quarter of 2017. In comparing reported losses against our prior year catastrophe loss estimates and the impact of aggregate covers on attachment to specific events, we revised the ultimate loss estimates by event and by segment with no change in the overall loss estimates except the California wildfires as previously announced.","No other events breached our $10 million threshold in the first quarter of 2018, therefore any losses arising from these events were more than covered in our attritional loss estimates, which include a little for events less than $10 million. The overall current year attritional combined ratio was 87.1%, up from 84.5% in the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to changes in business mix and higher retrocession costs in 2018. John Doucette will explain more about these changes and his comments.","Our reported combined ratio of 93% was higher than first quarter last year, primarily due to the higher reported catastrophe losses in 2018. For our investments, pretax investment income was $138 million for the quarter on our $18 billion investment portfolio. Investment income was 13% above last year. This result was primarily driven by the increase in limited partnership income which was up $12 million from first quarter of 2017 and the investment grade fixed income portfolio which had a higher asset base this year.","The pretax yield on the overall portfolio was 3% with the duration of just over three years. Foreign exchange is reported another income. For the first quarter of 2018 foreign exchange gains were $10 million, compared to $4 million of losses in the first quarter of 2017. Other income also included less than $1 million of earnings and fees from Mt. Logan Re, compared to $2 million of income in the first quarter last year.","On income taxes, the 6% effective tax rate on operating income was at the low end of our expected range of 7% to 8% for the full year. The effective tax rate is an annualized calculation that includes planned catastrophe losses for the rest of the year. Should catastrophe losses come in lower than this estimate, it would be expected that the tax rate would go up.","Shareholders\u2019 equity for the group was $8.3 billion at the end of the first quarter, relatively flat, compared to year-end 2017. This is after taking into account the mark-to-market impact on the investment portfolio and capital return through $53 million of dividend paid in the first quarter of 2018. Our capital position remains very strong. Thank you.","Now John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations.","John Doucette","Thank you, Craig. Good morning. The Reinsurance Division delivered a strong first quarter with $96 million of underwriting profit premium growth of 22% and a better risk adjusted portfolio as compared to Q1 2017. After the record loss activity in 2017, rates were up as we indicated last quarter. At this pivotal 1\/1 renewal, we focused on improving the quality of our portfolio, including its diversification by line of business and geography. To this end we were successful. Our clients and brokers increasingly gravitate to Everest as an enduring, relevant, long-term trading partner. Against this backdrop of increasing uncertainty for some of our competitors who are distracted by M&A activity, Everest provides stability and focus to the customer.","Our growing global reinsurance franchise with broad product and distribution capabilities and industry-leading expense advantage and sophisticated capital and hedging capabilities, position us to maximize opportunities born from the continued disruption and evolution of the reinsurance market. This is further enhanced by the growing number of strategic partnerships that we are adding and developing across our entire organization.","Our deepening relationships continue with our core clients and partners and extend beyond the traditional P&C landscape. These strategic relationships come in various forms, including global clients, quality upcoming underwriting organization. Staffed with underwriters we know well and respect cutting edge insurers, brokers with specialized distribution capabilities, niche businesses accessing unique and diversifying risks, highly specialized MTAs and asset managers and alternative capital investors.","Combining the accompanying, enhanced capabilities derived from these partnerships with our nimble execution, we are better positioned to thrive where the continuum of asset risk and insurance risk is blurred.","Before I comment on recent renewals, here is an overview of the Reinsurance Division\u2019s results. Overall, Reinsurance premium showed strong growth at $1.4 billion, an increase of 22% from the first quarter of 2017. This was driven by broad growth across the U.S., Middle East and Africa, Latin America and European operations, including both rate increases and a higher volume from pro-rata contracts. Our loss ratio was elevated by 9.8 points, with 6.5 points due to the $100 million of loss emanating from the California wildfires in our U.S. operations.","Adjusting for these wildfire catastrophe losses and prior year development, the attritional loss ratio is up 3.2 points due to business mix with a higher share of new property and casualty pro-rata opportunities, additional long-tail treaties, some loss portfolio transfer business and higher retrocessional costs in the quarter, compared to Q1 2017.","Our estimates for the Harvey, Irma and Maria losses remain unchanged in total across the group. However, the losses both across business segments and by event have been allocated differently as more data became available. Directionally, we saw upward movement on our estimates due to increased loss adjustment expenses, while we saw reductions on Maria and Mexican earthquake estimates as development has not been as significant as initially estimated.","Now for some additional comments by Reinsurance Division. In our U.S. Reinsurance Division, we saw our first quarter premium increase 11% year on year to $644 million, benefiting from post loss rate increases, additional property and professional liability pro-rata business and increased structured products writing. The attritional loss ratio is up 3.4 primarily due to higher corporate retrocession cost recorded to this segment and the impact of business mix.","The 14-point loss ratio improvement seen in our Bermuda segment and the 22 point improvement in the International segment are due to the aforementioned reallocation of cat losses between segments. Our Bermuda reinsurance segment premium grew 29% in U.S. dollars to $416 million and 25% on a constant dollar basis.","Some of the growth was recognition of written premiums from prior underwriting years with the balance supported by new professional liability and casualty quota share business, capital relief trades and reinsurance opportunities. As many Lloyd\u2019s markets increased their hedging activity, amidst the adjustments to their underwriting strategies. Adjusting for cats and prior year development, the attritional loss ratio was up about five points, mostly due to business mix.","The international reinsurance segment premium was up 38% to $367 million. Premium growth was broad based across Latin America, Middle East and Africa, Canada, Singapore and facultative markets. Some growth was due to timing of premiums on certain accounts.","However, the current year attritional underwriting result was largely stable compared to Q1 2017. In terms of catastrophe capital management, we recently executed on reinsurance protection supported by two new Kilimanjaro cat bonds. These new cat bonds with total capacity of $525 million, replace expiring bonds, protecting us from hurricanes and earthquakes in the U.S., Canada and some areas in the Caribbean. The maturities are split into four-year and five-year terms and all provide annual aggregate protection.","The overall retro costs are up year-over-year, because of the additional Kilimanjaro II cat bonds that were issued in Q2 last year. This additional coverage along with Mt. Logan and traditional reinsurance and retrocessional hedges protect our group\u2019s PML holistically, allowing us to prudently manage within our cat risk appetite across all reinsurance and insurance segments.","Now I will provide a brief update on resent renewal activity. In our property operations, we have captured double-digit rate increases in loss affected markets, while ceding commissions where largely stable. Competition from ILS Capital prevented further rises in rates. At Everest, we focused on improving the risk reward balance as we lead the market with corrective rate increases on deal, while although finding new attractive opportunities.","In casualty markets, there is a modest firming our reinsurance terms. Casualty access rates are generally up in the single-digit and ceding commissions down for our U.S. deal, internationally ceding commissions are stable. April 1 renewals in Asia would best be described as stable pricing with some increase in demand particularly from the larger companies and mutual such as in Japan. We also renewed some loss affected areas such as the Caribbean where prices were up, reflective of the 2017 loss activity. In these areas, we have been able to deploy the same or more capacity at increase rates.","Alternative capital and M&A is a presence in our business. Given this reality Everest has taken the opportunity to step up as a stable partner, capable of navigating the increasingly dynamic reinsurance markets. This resulted in better access to good business through increase signings on layers we found attractively priced including some private deals not shown to the full reinsurance market.","We also provide assistance to some of our clients experiencing operational disruption through both traditional and structured solutions tailored to address the evolving needs. A key lesson so far in 2018 that is already well known, but perhaps underappreciated, is that reinsurers cannot rely on hard markets to offset subpar results in non-loss years.","Having understood this to be the case for some time, Everest will continue to develop its capabilities to maintain relevance namely global breadth of capabilities across various classes of business, while continuing our territorial expansion and developing new products, creative structuring to deliver customized solutions to our clients, meaningful capacity supported by advanced capital and hedging capabilities to Mt. Logan, Kilimanjaro cat bonds traditional reinsurance and retro and ILWs.","All supported by an efficient expense structure and nimble execution in size leveraging our flat and empowered organization. Sustainable franchises must maintain relevance and profitability and the ability to trade forward through major industry losses to ultimately be successful in the long-term.","Thank you. And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations.","Jon Zaffino","Thank you, John, and good morning. We\u2019re pleased to report solid start of the year for our global insurance operations. As measured across numerous metrics, we are beginning to realize the benefits of the many strategic and tactical actions taken over the past several years to completion our insurance operations for sustainable success. This of course, include the achievement of consistent underwriting profits across our steadily expanding portfolio.","Globally growth written premium was $505 million for the quarter, 16% increase over the first quarter of 2017 and as strong as first quarter production we have experienced in the history of Everest Insurance. We continue to invest in thoughtful only focused growth within our chosen product segments across our global operations and this quarter\u2019s results are a testament to that. Most importantly in the quarter, this growth resulted in underwriting profit of $12.5 million more than double the $5.1 million underwriting profit from the first quarter of 2017.","Further, our attritional loss and loss adjustment expense ratio improve 1.7 points to 66.1%, reflecting the continued migration toward the higher value and diversified specialty books of business in the earned premium impact of these businesses into the P&L. These more recently establish portfolios accounted for a record 22% of our net earned premium in the quarter and will continue to expand in the quarters ahead.","We remain confident that our vision to organically build a world class specialty diversified insurance organization is being realized. As we have reported in prior calls, our leadership and underwriting teams in place across the globe continue to execute on their individual and collective mandates. Our teams remain focused and our opportunity set measured by our robust submission flows across lines of business continues to grow. We will look to build on this momentum throughout the year.","Turning to the financial highlights. As mentioned the global insurance operations produced $505 million in growth written premium in the first quarter, an increase of $71 million or 16% over first quarter 2017, another solid quarter showing steady improvement and evidence of our growing relevance in the specialty insurance market. As in prior quarters contributions remain balanced across the diverse group of property and casualty and acted in health underwriting divisions within our global insurance operations. Further, this represents a 13th consecutive quarter of growth across the insurance organization.","Turning to net premiums. For the first quarter of 2018 net premiums grew by 12% to $386 million. Net earned premium in the quarter was $393 million, an increase of $69 million or 21%. Net written premium will lag growth written premium as we continue to take a fairly conservative reinsurance position, which we believe supports our growth across our underwriting divisions.","Our reported GAAP combined ratio for the quarter was 96.8%, an improvement of 1.6 points over first quarter of 2017. The attritional combined ratio was 98% in the quarter, which compares favorably to the first quarter of 2017 attritional of 98.1% and is roughly in line with the fourth quarter of 2017 attritional combined ratio of 97.8%. That stated this year\u2019s first quarter, North American operations were 94% of the premium volume resided achieved a 95.7% combined ratio along with a 4 point improvement in the attritional loss and loss adjustment expense ratio.","The overall reported GAAP loss ratio for the first quarter of 2018 was 64.9%, improving 3.3 points over last year 68.2%. In addition to the attritional improvement the loss ratio was beneficially impacted by 1.2 points of favorable prior year development from 2016 cat activity, again reflecting our conservative reserving position on these events. As anticipated, the downward drift and the attritional loss ratio continues. Again this is a result of an improved mix of business, the benefits from the many new business is launched and a strategic underwriting actions of the past three years.","Turning to the expense ratio. Due to the timing of certain one-time expense items and the lag in earned premium from the build out of new businesses, our expense ratio in the first quarter was 31.9%, up from the 30.2% from the same period of 2017. We expect our expense ratio to improve throughout the year and to remain in a competitive range.","It\u2019s important to remember that we continue to invest in all patterns of our organization, while maintaining underwriting discipline. As a result, written premiums may fluctuate somewhat from quarter-to-quarter as well the expense ratio. However, we anticipate the annual expense ratio to be within our expectations.","I\u2019ll turn now to the market conditions and in particular offer some commentary on the rate environment. As the quarter progressed, we thought improved P&C pricing trend across the organization. Overall rate levels for Everest Insurance were slightly negative decreasing by 2.4 points in the quarter.","However, it should be noted that this rate study was derived from a renewal book that was lighter than usual based on the lower planned retention. The retention softness was influenced by deliberate underwriting actions impacting our U.S. property portfolio and our delegated authority operation Everest underwriting partners.","If we exclude the work comp book, the rate change for the organization was plus 4.6% for the first quarter, with a steadily progressing level of rates being achieved across a number of lines each month. This is more than double the increase from the fourth quarter of 2017, where we experience a 2% increase on the same basis and as the highest aggregate price change we had experienced in ten quarters. This result was led by various lines of business, notably property and commercial auto.","Let me spend a minute on the property book, as it is one area of the market experiencing a notable degree of transition. We currently underwrite property portfolios across the globe with a concentration in the U.S. market through both retail and wholesale channels. But in the U.S. market, we have now experienced six consecutive months of positive rate change in our property portfolio, ending the first quarter at plus 13% on a risk adjusted basis.","As HIM exposed renewals come up in the second quarter, we expect continued pricing improvement of a similar magnitude. Overall, we do believe there is a need for further rate firming within the property market cat and non-cat alike and across other markets as well.","Turning to other lines, commercial auto continues to see meaningful increases, again, in the low double-digit range across our various portfolios. We continued to see slightly positive rate moment for GL and excess lines, each registering positive rate changes in the quarter, we believe continue to rate adjustments are needed within these areas as we moved to 2018. Various professional lines continued to see some rate pressure, although this trend is moderating in the first quarter particularly in March.","And work comp markets remain competitive with single-digit rate decreases being common. We continue to feel comfortable with the composition of our workers\u2019 comp book and margin associated with it in our underwriting strategies going forward.","We have been in this market for many years and will continued to take a cautious view in this or any area of the market should rate pressures continue. The bottom line for us is that we are focused on the need to achieve adequate technical pricing across our portfolio and are working diligently toward that objective everyday.","In conclusion, the momentum we established in 2017 across our global specialty insurance operations has continued into 2018. Strong premium growth and solid profitability are being achieved alongside continued investments across our platform. We continue to thoughtfully invest to ensure we have the talents, capabilities and resources to profitably expand our franchise, while building increased resiliency across our business. We look forward to continuing our momentum and reporting back to you in next quarter.","Now back to Beth for Q&A.","Beth Farrell","Yes, Travis, we are now open for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, ma\u2019am. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joshua Shanker, Deutsche Bank.","Joshua Shanker","Yes. Thank you very much. Post tax reform, I would have thought in my mind that this means that more reinsurance business we were in onshore in the United States. The way you\u2019re stagnant reporting work, it\u2019s seems that the greatest on growths in international and Bermuda. I\u2019m wondering if there is a weakest than U.S. reinsurance. I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s something to that, maybe you can disabuse me of some facts that they have that are incorrect or what not.","Craig Howie","Josh, this is Craig Howie. Technically the tax rate is based on the operating tax, based on geographic region and where that income is coming from. What we have done throughout this year and that includes by the way catastrophes and any reserve development as well. But what you saw in the first quarter and the reason for a lower tax rate is the fact that we had the catastrophe losses were emanating from the United States and the majority of those releases were coming from the other segments, including the Bermuda segment.","Joshua Shanker","Well and not so much on tax which is about where clients put their reinsurance business is more business can be written in the United States going forward just in general post tax reform. Or is that incorrect way of thinking about things.","John Doucette","Hi, Josh, this is John. I think it really \u2013 I don\u2019t know if we can speak for other people, because I think part of it\u2019s going to be a function of the capital. What the capital structures of different reinsurers are. But a couple of things, we have a fair bit of capital both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. and we\u2019re going to continue to try to access the business in the most advantageous way that we see based on our underwriting expertise, based on our connection to brokers and clients and things like that. And that will \u2013 so it really is opportunity dependent as to where we\u2019re going to write the business, whether it\u2019s going to be in the U.S. reinsurance segment, the Bermuda reinsurance segment or the international segment","Joshua Shanker","Okay. And as we had into mid-year renewals compared to what you saw at the beginning of the year. What is the trend on International property and U.S. property, I guess, do we think that will be about the same. Do we think that that one-one deployment was the way to go? What\u2019s sort of your thing on the year at this moment?","John Doucette","So as we talked about last quarter, I think it really depends on geographically, where the business is and what the loss impact was by the specific business. That would drive a lot of what the rate discussions are going forward. So no surprise areas that had been affected by the HIM losses or the California wildfires saw more rate increase at one-one.","As we mentioned earlier in our script, when it came to April 1, which is a big Asia renewal particularly Japan, it was a lot closer to stable. And, but we did see rate increases in some of the Caribbean areas that did have the losses. So I think it does follow the loss events, in terms of where it\u2019s going to go at the upcoming renewals, we think that would also hold directionally true that the areas that had more losses would have upward pressure on rates.","And we\u2019ll see what happens and we\u2019re positioned to take advantage of it based on what the rating environment is and what products that we think is most attractive. And as we talked about and you saw in this quarter, sometimes that\u2019ll be excess or loss sometimes that will be proportional, sometimes it\u2019ll be reinsurance, sometimes it will be retro. And we try to really capture where we think we\u2019re getting the best risk adjusted return, irrespective of the product.","And so that results in some of the changes you saw in this quarter. But we are comfortable that, no matter where the rate changes and the rate pressures are or not. And trends will be able to capture that.","Craig Howie","And I\u2019ll add to that, as I mentioned as well in our opening comments that there\u2019s an improving trend in casualty as well. So increased opportunity there to meet our margin requirements.","Joshua Shanker","Thank you very and good luck for the rest of the year.","Craig Howie","Thank you, Josh.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan","Thank you, and good morning. So I just wonder, could you break down the impact from both mix change as well as the retro \u2013 high retro cost. The deterioration of attritional combined ratio about 260 basis points year-over-year. Just wonder, what are the sort of onetime impact or this could be dragging on for the rest of the year.","John Doucette","The onetime impact from the change in the attritional.","Kai Pan","Yes.","John Doucette","Well I mean, as my colleague\u2019s comment as well, but let me just first make the comment that the change in the attritional is largely due to mix of business. And influx of pro-rata business in the first quarter was driving at the attritional. But remember that overall that our premium will be coming in for the balance of the year and will served increase our overall margin. But even though the ratios might be going up, because of pro-rata business has a lot more premium on the books and therefore that will contribute to an increased underwriting margin. So we have to be careful about whether we\u2019re talking about ratios or margin. So\u2026","Kai Pan","Okay.","Dom Addesso","Wonder that John may have a comment here as well.","John Doucette","Yeah, Kai. just a little more color on that. We also \u2013 we alluded to it a couple of times, but if you recall in Q2 2017, we won \u2013 we issued what was called Kilimanjaro II catastrophe bond. So that was in from second quarter last year and it remains in effect now. It was not in Q1 2017 and that\u2019s part of the elevated, because of that additional issuance of catastrophe bond back in the second quarter, but not in the first. That\u2019s why that Q1-to-Q1 comparison reflects that.","Dom Addesso","And that\u2019s about one full point in the quarter.","Kai Pan","So, the second thing in quarter year-over-year comparison will be one point easier?","John Doucette","It would be more comparative in the second quarter, because it was issued in April of last year.","Kai Pan","Okay. Got it.","John Doucette","In the second quarter of last year.","Kai Pan","Okay. So the point is that the revenue will grow faster, but the ratio, attritional commodity ratio would go higher, because of mix change, but the net, the dollar amounts margin, underwriting margin, expiry margin will be higher.","John Doucette","That\u2019s our belief.","Kai Pan","Okay, great. And then can you talk about that the loss cost trend, especially in the cash utilized.","Dom Addesso","I\u2019ll ask Jon Zaffino, because that\u2019s heavily impacted in the insurance book. But of course, it\u2019s a direct carry-over to reinsurance. So Jon, maybe you can highlight some of the trends we\u2019re seeing.","Jon Zaffino","Sure, Dom. Thanks. Good morning, Kai. As of the usual sort of caveat, loss cost trends do vary widely from a line-to-line, from geography-to-geography, from program structure-to-program structure. And I\u2019ll tell you in general, we see a relatively consistent picture over the prior few quarters. If we would aggregate our book based on premium weightings, the short, medium, long tail lines, I think we feel we\u2019re in about that 3% range, 2.5% to 3% could be higher and it\u2019d be lower in certain areas. For instance, commercial auto, we think is running above that. Some of the comp lines depend on geography territory; it could be a little bit below. But it\u2019s been relatively what we expected and anticipated, we are certainly looking at various frequency and severity trends quarter-to-quarter each one of our various books of business studies that we conduct throughout the year and keeping an eye on that. So, as we expected at this point based on our \u2013 what we thought pricing would be based on where we reserve our books, it\u2019s been kind of in line for our early expectations.","Dom Addesso","So, I think the way to summarize that would be really nothing in excess or out of bounds relative to what we see as general inflation across the entire economy.","Kai Pan","Okay, great. And last one if I may just on the industry consolidation, do you see any opportunities for Everest Re?","Dom Addesso","This comes up frequently, and I think I\u2019ve mentioned many times, we look at probably all of the opportunities that are around in the marketplace, and generally a bit while there will potentially be opportunity certainly nothing that we can speak to today. but generally, we have included in all of these that relative because of \u2013 in part, because of the price of many of these properties. And probably more importantly, the integration challenges in particular and the expense challenge of integrating operations. We tilt towards an organic build. And I think we\u2019ve demonstrated that we can do that successfully and organic build you end up knowing exactly what you\u2019ve got and you can shape and mold the operation to your liking as opposed to having to tear something apart. So that\u2019s our preference, but it doesn\u2019t mean if something wouldn\u2019t come along that would \u2013 that would fit strategically for us in an area that move not yet fully developed, so that\u2019s how I think about it.","Kai Pan","It\u2019s great. Thank you so much.","John Doucette","Just to add a little more color, outside of the M&A question, the fact that there is a lot of M&A, and activity and discussion, we think does present opportunities for us particularly on the reinsurance side. And as Dom alluded to in his opening comments, some of the consolidation results and some of that we\u2019ve seen the large global buying more, and they want to buy from companies like Everest that have a strong balance sheet, and right P&C lines of business all over the world. And so their capacity demands are increasing and we\u2019re seeing some of the large global insurers buying more and buying more in the casualty and professional lines. And so that was part of the reason why we had the growth that we had in Q1.","Kai Pan","Thank you, John.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from our Meyer Shields, KBW.","Meyer Shields","Thanks. good morning. I want to dig in a little bit to John Doucette\u2019s comment on relevance. Am I oversimplifying if I interpret that as implying sort of a desire to more rapidly increase your casualty book in reinsurance?","Dom Addesso","In reinsurance or insurance?","Meyer Shields","In reinsurance.","John Doucette","So Meyer, I think it we \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s, we don\u2019t start with, we want to write more causality business. We start with where can we build the footprint that makes the most sense on a diversified global portfolio across as many lines of business, and make the best risk-adjusted portfolio we can. We are seeing opportunities in the causality space more than we had. We have been fairly negative on casualty and professional liability for the last several years and maybe a little bit ahead of the curve. And we think that was the right call, and we are now seeing more opportunities.","So, it\u2019s more a function of what we think the risk-adjusted pricing is. But the point of the relevance is that we have the ability, we have the underwriting expertise, we have the market expertise in local markets all around the globe. And we have the relationships with the brokers and clients to be able to deploy the capacity in any property and casualty line as we see, witness our clients need to buy. And we think that helps us along with the alternative capital that we can use to deploy in the property space. We think helps us be more and more relevant to our clients.","Dom Addesso","But it doesn\u2019t necessarily suggest that we\u2019re riding business at any cost. I mean, again, get back to whether it\u2019s in the reinsurance of operation or the insurance operation, the heavy emphasis on cycle management and that applies line-by-line. At the same time, we are trying to achieve greater diversification too. So these are all things that I think have led to a more stable result for the group, and we\u2019ll continue to do so.","Meyer Shields","Okay. I didn\u2019t mean to just you were accepting on the price business, I just wanted to know whether strategically clients recognize that there\u2019s maybe more underwriting expertise in Everest than premium volumes themselves would suggest?","Dom Addesso","Well, I think that\u2019s absolutely the case, and even more importantly, that\u2019s clearly the case in insurance, where the brand is being fully \u2013 more fully developed.","Meyer Shields","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And second question if I can, just looking at the comments on larger global insurers looking for more reinsurance, are they a tougher customer to deal with maybe because of an additional specification?","John Doucette","This is John; I think you know there\u2019s pluses and minuses with every type of client that we trade with. They have they bring stability, they bring diversity, they bring again, to our point of trying to have a diverse portfolio they are buying from us in Latin America, in Asia, in Europe and obviously in North America and Bermuda and London. And so it allows us to across that relationship have a more stable relationship. But again, there\u2019s \u2013 some of them are more or less reinsurance dependent than if you go to the other end of the spectrum of much, much smaller clients that are very reinsurance dependent given their capital structure and their writings. So there\u2019s pluses and minuses of all types of clients that we trade with.","Dom Addesso","Meyer, this is really \u2013 I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a negative to have a sophisticated trading partner. In fact, I think it would be quite a positive, because they are more easily recognized the strength and the value that Everest can bring to the transaction. So I view it as a positive and as John was really highlighting, I think we find that having those broader and larger relationships tends to overtime; we tend to have a more stable margin. in any one area, you might be tilted the sideways a bit, but across the entire account, you tend to have greater stability.","Meyer Shields","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you so much.","Dom Addesso","Thanks, Meyer.","Operator","Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning. A couple of questions. my first question in terms of premium growth, I guess this is tied specifically to reinsurance, do you see \u2013 you guys being able to maintain the same growth level that we saw in the first quarter. As you think about these new opportunities that you\u2019re seeing for the balance of the year. And then also if we could just get the color from most of your segments, you really highlighted where you\u2019re growing geographically. a little bit more color by line and how much more crop and even credit mortgage business is within the growth that we saw in the first quarter?","John Doucette","Good morning, Elyse. It\u2019s John. So in terms of the growth, I mean, so a part of the growth is kind of a two-pronged issue. We rode business including proportional business at one-one and we rode more, and we would see that earn-in over the next several quarters. So we will see some growth tied to that, in terms of whether we see new business that incept when we put on the books. in future quarters, we think so, we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be at the same rate that we\u2019ve seen so far. it\u2019s a lot harder for us to predict that, but there is the embedded growth that we\u2019ve had from the business we\u2019ve already put on the books.","We do think that we have been expanding our opportunity set for example, developing political risk and trade credit in our Zurich operation; it\u2019s just one of the many examples around the group that we\u2019ve been doing to try to build out our opportunities that expand that. and therefore that gives the opportunity to grow more.","you mentioned crop. crop was fairly flat. So their growth isn\u2019t really coming there. We are seeing more both in the U.S., Bermuda and in our Bermuda operation in London, we are seeing more casualty professional and some whole account opportunities, and we continue as we\u2019ve said on the last several quarters. We are writing the mortgage business that\u2019s up a little bit or close to flat, but we do continue to see new opportunities in the mortgage space and I think we\u2019ll be able to deploy capacity on an attractive risk adjusted basis there, and as you may recall, a lot of the mortgage deals that are done with the GSEs or multi-year deals. So, we have effectively IBNR premium coming in over the next many years for deals that we\u2019ve already put on the books.","Elyse Greenspan","How much mortgage businesses within the Reinsurance segment today?","John Doucette","We have a run rate of about a $150 million to $175 million give-or-take that shows the new business origination.","Elyse Greenspan","And that\u2019s an annual number?","John Doucette","Yeah.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then in terms of \u2013 you guys didn\u2019t see any reserve development quarterly from the cat. Was there any movements or was just kind of net neutral within all the segments in the quarter?","Dom Addesso","Elyse, we \u2013 as you know, we do our reserve studies that the bulk of our reserve studies in the latter part of the year in the fourth quarter. But of the other metrics that we use to develop to evaluate reserves along the way are at each quarter-end. Something we call actual versus expected were all trending favorable. But it\u2019s a consequence we don\u2019t \u2013 and we don\u2019t make reserve adjustments based on those metrics. We wait for the reserves that\u2019s quite \u2013 but the trends, the metrics that we use are all favorable.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. And then one last question in terms of the primary insurance business, Don, when you \u2013 in your initial remarks, you said that the expense ratio and loss ratio would improve as the year progresses. I guess is the goal, should we think about modeling for the back three quarters that you guys will be in kind of that low 90s overall underlying margin within the primary insurance business.","Dom Addesso","We have said in last quarter\u2019s call, low-to-mid 90s is kind of what our target is. It\u2019s a little difficult to give you a precise number, but it would certainly be an improvement over \u2013 a measurable improvement over the last year.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Dom Addesso","Thank you, Elyse. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further questions in the queue.","Dom Addesso","All right. let me thank you very much. Let me conclude with just a few thoughts. We\u2019re up to a great start for the year. The changing mix, which we\u2019ve talked about already will certainly impact being the attritional ratios, will in fact produce an overall increase to the total dollar margin as the year develops. We fully expect as you\u2019ve heard from my colleagues rates to be improving both property and the casualty areas in certainly sufficient quantity and difficult, class of the business, who will allow us to increase our overall returns here and again, we are confident about our ROEs.","Finally, if you just give me one second, I\u2019d like to close with a tribute to our colleague Beth Farrell, who is retiring in early May after 15 plus years with Everest. I know she has been a valuable resource to those on the call. I certainly appreciate the support she is giving me. We will miss her, but wish her and her husband a full and enjoyable retirement. Thank you so much, Beth.","Beth Farrell","Thank you.","Dom Addesso","And again, thank you all for your interest this morning and look forward to our future discussions over the weeks ahead. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"8593":["Everest Re Group Ltd (NYSE:RE) Q2 2013 Earnings Conference Call July 24, 2013 10:30 AM ET","","Executives","","Elizabeth B.

In that regard I note that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements.","Now, let me turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph V. Taranto","Thanks, Beth, good morning. I\u2019m extremely pleased with our results for the first six months of the year. Our net income was $660 million, producing an ROE of 21%. Our worldwide growth return premium has increased by 25% over 2012. Our worldwide reinsurance premium has increased by 26% and our insurance premiums have increased by 22%. The attritional combined ratio has improved by 6 points to 80.5%. Our attritional combined ratio for our insurance operation continues to improve and was 94.8% for the second quarter.","Our investment income was strong through six months at $295 million, only modestly off last year\u2019s $302 million despite the headwinds generated from today\u2019s low interest rate environment. Through six months, we grew book value per share, adjusted for dividends, by 5% despite falling bond prices and catastrophes.","During the quarter, we completed our April 1st Japanese reinsurance renewals, our June 1st Florida reinsurance renewals and our July 1st International reinsurance renewals. I was most pleased with our overall results, even though we experienced increased competition.","In particularly in Florida, we increased up premiums, but more importantly we increased our expected margins and yet did not increase our 1-in-100 PML, as we bought some industry loss warranty cover, that contained this risk.","Much of our increased margin came from writing pro rata reinsurance on homeowners business. Rate increases on homeowners business and other changes continued to improve the underlying insurance business making it more attractive.","In addition, the fact that Cat XOL reinsurance was less costly for homeowners companies made for further improvement and the net after reinsurance expected results, as these saving inure to the benefit of our quarterly shares.","As always we continued to optimize our portfolio and move towards the best opportunities. Our insurance operation continues to achieve meaningful rate increases in California workers\u2019 comp and other areas.","It\u2019s too early to predict the crop results, but so far so good. The bulk of our crop premiums will be booked in the third quarter and fourth quarter, given the nature of this business.","I am hopeful that we will continue to see quality improving results as the year progresses in this segment. I see the current overall reinsurance, insurance market place as offering reasonable opportunities and where companies that are focused, nimble and disciplined can do very well.","Our client relationships, our long-term client relationships will diversify business platform, and great ratings continue to serve us well. Our focus, nimble culture has produced great opportunity for us. Everest by far has the lowest internal expense ratio in the market. Our studies indicate that we have a 3 to 7 point expense advantage over our competitors. This is an enormous advantage. Our flatter organization has benefited us greatly, as it allows us to react to changing market conditions more rapidly, offer new products and better meet client needs.","During the quarter we saw a spike in the interest rates. We had expected rates to rise and continue to believe that they will rise further, although we do not try to predict when and by how much. We have positioned our bond portfolio to provide the balance between yields and duration that is most sensible.","Our view on interest rate increases is that they\u2019re a net positive for us. Of course they will initially decrease the market value of the bond portfolio. But since we tend to hold maturity, this will sometime undo itself, more important future earnings will rise. In short, given rating agency and regulatory requirements, we will always have the bulk of our assets and bonds and we would rather earn more interest on these bonds than less.","In summary, the first six months have gone well and we are looking to continue our good performance. In those six months, we returned $0.5 billion to shareholders between dividends and stock repurchase, buying back $450 million of stock with represents 7% of the beginning of the year outstanding shares, underscores our confidence in our future.","Dom will now go through the operational review and than Craig will take you through the financial highlights. Dom?","Dominic J. Addesso","Thanks Joe and good morning. The second quarter results were quite favorable despite storm activity in the period. After-tax operating income was $253 million, providing for an annualized operating return on equity of 16%. Strong and growing underwriting profitability and a stable base of investment income continue to provide for these favorable results.","Over the last several quarters, we have talked about the strategies we have deployed enhance returns and our success is born out by these results. In that context, I\u2019d like to outline our underwriting results and what actions, we have taken to reshape and improve in our portfolio.","Compared to the prior year, underwriting income was $29 million higher at $143 million. Even after Cat losses of $90 million in this year\u2019s second quarter versus $30 million one year ago. This year-over-year improvement continues to reflect an improvement in the underlying attritional combined ratio of more than 6 points. When adjusting for reinstatement premium, the attritional combined ratio was at 80.2%.","I will touch on specifics in a moment, but generally the major improvements in the combined ratios were in U.S. reinsurance and Bermuda, followed by continued improvement in the insurance segment.","The catastrophe losses of $90 million in the quarter, added 7 points to the combined ratio. So, overall, that ratio stood at a respectable 87.6%. There are multiple Cat events in the quarter. The details are as follows; U.S. tornadoes, $50 million; European floods, $20 million; Alberta floods, $20 million.","The continuing improving fundamentals are due to a variety of factors. At its core, it is underwriting. Changes in the portfolio mix which emphasized excessive loss over pro rata was a factor as primary rates softened. But other important measures included broader geographical diversification, new product initiatives, terminating unprofitable relationships and finally a basic disciplined underwriting and pricing approach.","Turning back to individual segments, I would like to provide some commentary about our U.S. reinsurance operations. As noted in our press release, premiums were up substantially in the quarter due to a Florida quota share transaction. The impact of this was material in the quarter due to an assumption of an incoming portfolio reflected in premiums return. Last year, we had terminated that deal, which resulted in an outgoing portfolio running through the premium account. When comparing year-over-year, this magnifies the percentage of premium growth. Premiums were up 16% in this segment without the impact of this transaction. As we continue to find opportunities for growth and as such are pleased with the current position of the portfolio.","During the recent Florida renewals, we saw a mixed pricing environment. Cat excess rates were down, but underlying primary rates were up. We therefore wrote fewer Cat excess loss release and redeployed this capacity to riding substantially more quota share business, which in combination provided for increased overall margins on this book.","Margin improvement was derived from both the underlying price improvements, but also can lower cost of inurning catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance on this business.","As Joe mentioned, we purchased an ILW retro on the Florida book, which reduced peak event PMLs, while at the same time, overall margins increased. Across the rest of the U.S. property book, we have been authorizing and binding larger lines. This has enhanced the geographic diversification of our portfolio and provided for overall margin improvement on the book.","Our casualty operation has experienced growth from both new and renewal business. In addition, new business opportunities, in particular in credit reinsurance and structured solutions have further contributed to premium growth in the quarter. All these activities have reshaped the U.S. reinsurance portfolio and lead to a year-to-date attritional combined ratio of 72% versus 86.5% last year, a 14.5 point improvement.","In our Bermuda operations, there was minimal change in premium year-over-year. However changes in the portfolio have resulted in a 7 point improvement in the year-to-date attritional combined ratio. The international operation also had minimal change to the top-line with continued growth in our Latin America book, offset by Asia, which was slightly down due to the continued shift on pro rata to excess. Nevertheless, we were successful in growing the excess book, were rates have been stable. Profit remained strong for this operation with a 77.2% year-to-date attritional combined ratio.","Now, turning to the insurance operations, which is growing proportion of the total book. The improving trend that we noted in the first quarter continues to build. The premium growth of $61 million or 24% was driven by continued rate increases in California workers\u2019 comp, a new non-standard auto initiative and to a lesser extent rate increases on casualty business and new business growth in general.","This profitable growth along with the continued strength of our professional liability, accident and health results has produced the combined ratio for the quarter of 96.6%, continuing the improving profit trend for the insurance operation.","The investment income picture for the quarter was also favorable in light of a declining yield environment. Income was down just slightly over the prior years, as new cash flows and income from limited partnerships have helped offset declining reinvestment rates.","Capital remained strong although shareholders equity was down slightly at 1.6% from year-end, due to a significant level of share repurchases and a decline in the value of the bond portfolio. This capital position enables us to grow our writing as evidenced in the second quarter from geographic expansions and new products in both our reinsurance and insurance operations.","As noted, this diversification which highlights the strength of our franchise has been benefiting our operational results. We have every expectation that this trend will continue.","Thank you. And now I will ask Craig to cover the financial highlights.","Craig W. Howie","Thank you, Dom and good morning everyone. We\u2019re pleased to report that Everest had another very strong quarter of earnings with net income of $275.6 million or $5.56 per diluted common share. This compares to net income of $214.6 million or $4.08 per share for the second quarter of 2012. Net income includes realized capital gains and losses. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $660.0 million or $13.09 per share compared to $519.3 million or $9.79 per share in 2012. The 2013 result represents an annualized return on equity of 21%.","Operating income year-to-date was $554.2 million or $10.99 per share. This represents a 20% increase over operating income of $462.9 million last year. These results were driven by $129 million increase in underwriting income representing a 58% increase year-over-year.","As you just heard from Dom, there are a number of strategic initiatives that are driving these improved results. This increase in underwriting income was partially offset by higher income taxes and slightly lower net investment income compared to the first half of 2012.","These results reflect the continued improvement in the overall current year attritional combined ratio, which has declined more than six points from 86.6% to 88.5% on a year-to-date basis. This measure excludes the impact of catastrophes, reinstatement premiums and prior period loss development.","The total reinsurance attritional combined ratio was 76.5% for the first half of 2013 compared to 83.7% in the prior year. The insurance segment attritional combined ratio was 96.4% year-to-date compared to 98.7% in the prior year. All segments reported increases in premium volume for the quarter and year-to-date and all segments reported underwriting gains for the quarter and for the first half of 2013. Total reinsurance reported in the underwriting gain of $134 million for the quarter, compared to a $107 million underwriting gain last year.","For the first half of 2013, total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $344 million, compared to a $219 million gain last year. These results reflect $90 million of current year catastrophe losses in the first half of 2013. All reported in the second quarter. This compares with $60 million of cats during the first half of 2012.","The Insurance segment reported an underwriting gain of $9 million for the quarter, compared to a gain of $7 million last year. On a year-to-date basis, the Insurance segment reported an underwriting gain of $9 million, compared to a gain of $5 million in 2012.","The 2013 results reflect a crop loss of $10 million for the year, primarily due to the seasonality of crop premiums. But, also including a $4 million unfavorable true up from the 2012 crop year.","The overall underwriting gain for the Group was $143 million for the quarter, compared to an underwriting gain of $114 million for the same period last year. On a year-to-date basis, the underwriting gain was $353 million, compared to a gain of $224 million in 2012.","Our reported combined ratio was 84.2% for the first half of 2013, compared to 89.0% in 2012. The commission ratio of 21.2% for the first half of 2013 is down 3.5 points compared to the prior year. This lower ratio continues to reflect the shift in reinsurance from pro rata to excess loss contracts, which generally carry a lower commission. It also reflects the shift away from program business to direct business in the Insurance segment.","As for loss reserves, in June, we released our third annual global loss development triangles for 2012. There were really no major changes since the 2011 release. Our overall quarterly internal reserving metrics continued to be favorable.","For investments, pre-tax investment income was $149 million for the quarter and $295 million year-to-date, under our $16 billion investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio continues to perform well. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.8% with a duration of just over three years. The first six months reflected $106 million of net after-tax revised capital gains compared to $56 million last year. These gains are mainly attributable to fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio.","On income taxes, the 12.3% effective tax rate on operating income is in line with our expected rate for the year. Also recall that the 2012 income tax expense benefited from favorable one-time adjustments.","Strong cash flow continues, with operating cash flows of $396 million for the first half of 2013, compared to $305 million in 2012. This is despite the high level of loss payments over the last two years related to catastrophes.","Earnings to capital management. We completed the redemption of our 6.2% junior subordinated debt in May as we announced on our last quarter call. We expect interest expense of approximately $8 million per quarter going forward.","Shareholders\u2019 equity at the end of the quarter was $6.6 billion compared to the $6.7 billion balance at year-end 2012. This is after taking into account $0.5 billion of capital return through $450 million of share buybacks, and $48 million of dividends paid in the first half of 2013. It also reflects $325 million decline in the value of the bond portfolio due to the rising interest rates this year.","Book value per share increased to $136.31 from $130.96 at year-end 2012, a 5% increase after adjusting for dividends. Our continued strong capital balance positions us well for potential business opportunities as well as continuing share repurchases.","Thank you and now I\u2019ll turn it back to Beth for Q&A.","Elizabeth B. Farrell","Thank you, Craig. At this point, we are open for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And will take our first question from Amit Kumar with Macquarie Capital.","Amit J. Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research","Well, thanks and good morning. I guess two or three quick questions. First of all just going back on the discussion on the business mix and, I know we\u2019ve talked about this in the past on the shift towards XOL. As you look forward what percentage would you be comfortable with in terms of the business mix?","Craig W. Howie","I\u2019ll start with, Amit. I mean, what we try to do is optimize our portfolio and go to the best deals available certainly on the property side, when we\u2019re fusing the P&L\u2019s that were willing to write to. Now we had seen for the last year or to XOL especially as the rates were rising that we wanted to write more of that, and that was stacking up better relative to pro rata.","I\u2019d say on the worldwide basis most of the changes that we wanted to make, we\u2019ve made in the last couple of years, but what we kind of added to the mix was this past June in Florida where we had a shift if you will, within the Florida book where we did more pro rata. I was still kind of guesstimate that where we are at mix wise today is pretty much where we\u2019ll stay on a world-wide basis. But having said that, we will continue to change as the world changes. XOL rates changes, underlying insurance rates change, but I don\u2019t expect the worldwide portfolio to undergo any significant changes I look out for the next year, like it has in the past couple of years.","Amit J. Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then where does Mt. Logan I guess fit in and start flowing in the numbers. I guess that would be more so in Q3, just could you refresh us on that?","Dominic J. Addesso","Amit, it\u2019s Dom.","Amit J. Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research","Hi.","Dominic J. Addesso","We had initially targeted by the end of the year to raise approximately $250 million in outsized capital until. We are about half way there, so we have some capital already deployed at Mt. Logan which would be reflected in the third quarter. Craig can get into the details if you like on how that will run through our financials because perhaps they are may have to consolidate that operation but that\u2019s yet to be determined. But that capital has already been committed to us and that will allow us to expand our writings within the reinsurance operations and then essentially quarter share, some business off to Mt. Logan, but it\u2019s not as you can see it\u2019s not necessarily a material amount.","Amit J. Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research","Yeah.","Dominic J. Addesso","It\u2019s a slow build.","Amit J. Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research","Got it. I can take that offline and final question on capital management and you were talking about some of the numbers, I think buybacks were and dividends were 86% or something like that of net income, which is obviously running at a higher trend than what we have seen in the past. How do you think about that, I guess for the remainder of the year? Is that a good metric to use, the current level or do you sort of pullback in the win season, maybe comeback a bit or do you wait for one-one renewals and then sort of comeback in Q1?","Craig W. Howie","Well, we are keen to buy and that\u2019s why we bought $450 million through the first six months. As I said, that kind of shows the confidence that we have in our portfolio, in our future. We probably will be a bit more cautious in the coming quarter, I mean we have historically through win season been a bit more cautious and I think we will probably take that same position.","Now we never forecast and so don\u2019t hold us because we reserve the right to change as conditions change, but probably later in the third quarter and if that all goes well, probably back to more in the fourth quarter, that would be kind of a guess at this point.","Amit J. Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research","Okay. That actually is quite helpful. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks.","Operator","We will take our next question from Joshua Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi, I guess for Craig, start, on the bond portfolio, you said, I guess the mark to markets were $325 million, is that correct?","Craig W. Howie","That\u2019s correct on a year-to-date basis Josh.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Year-to-date, okay. So I actually looking at the portfolio at about $6.5 billion, $16.5 billion that\u2019s been fairly resilient, can we sort of get more granularity, it\u2019s certainly better than the performance your peers have so far reported. To the rising interest rate environment and mark-to-market.","Craig W. Howie","","I recall that what we have been doing is been shorting the duration of our portfolio, so that helps dramatically. And then of course we\u2019ve over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve been reallocating some of our portfolio to a larger equity position, which has obviously helped as rates have been coming down, but obviously the stock market has been rising and that\u2019s helped shield some of that results. As well as our yield floating bank debt, and other areas that have kind of protected the portfolio from the times that were most recently have gone through.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","And do you\u2019ve taken some profits I guess on the equity markets.","Craig W. Howie","","We have our equity position has not in terms of what percentage of our asset base has not changed dramatically, but we do within our equity portfolios, we\u2019ll take profits on certain securities and then reinvest in other opportunities that we think have a better upside. Those not been any material change in our allocation equities.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","It looks like it shrink by about $100 million despite the rising equity markets, sorry I just thought that may you take some money off the table.","Craig W. Howie","","In some cases we are in particular positions but we continue to look for opportunity in that space. We are not directionally making a major change in our equity allocation.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","And can we talk about the size of the California workers\u2019 comp business now compared to where it was prior to Berkshire\u2019s 2007 moving that space. Are you larger than you were back then or as the proportion of the overall churns business, where does that stand?","Craig W. Howie","Now we were once close to $800 million or $900 million in the marketplace, we\u2019re no longer close to that, but it\u2019s growing we\u2019ll probably better than $300 million in the marketplace this year. We continue to get some very good rate increase and I would expect we\u2019ll probably do more business next year than this year.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","So, if we go back to like \u201906 almost all the business was workers\u2019 comp and now it\u2019s minority of the business?","Dominic J. Addesso","Well, that would still, it would represent close to 20% to 25%, but yes, we have gotten into crop, we\u2019ve done A&H, professional liability, non-standard auto was now in mix, the California DIC, as well as our E&S operation. So we\u2019ve got a well diversified insurance platform at this point, just in last couple of years, which is we\u2019re quite proud of.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Can we tease out of the strong growth, rate growth versus unit growth versus I guess expansion into newer markets?","Dominic J. Addesso","I\u2019m sorry Josh. Can we\u2026","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","I was looking at 36% growth in this quarter; over the last 12 months, probably 30% growth in the insurance book. Can we divide that into rate versus like exposures growth versus I guess newer markets and what not?","Dominic J. Addesso","Well, at a very, very rough estimate you can think about rate level increases particularly in comp and in our general liability classes in a 10% to 15% range. So, essentially that might help you think the 36% versus with that 10% to 15% number.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","No, I\u2019ll try and work that. Thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Dom, would it be possible to give us a little bit more detail on this Florida program that you wrote? I was looking back and it looks like even if we compare to like Q2 2011, gross premiums were still quite a bit higher here. So just wondering if that difference is because this contractor program got a lot bigger or you took other exposures in the same area. And then just a quick follow-up on that. Thanks.","","Dominic J. Addesso","You\u2019re saying that 2013 is higher than just this one transaction.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Well, no. You said that \u2013 I thought you had said this was a program that you guys did not, that you had participated in historically and then you didn\u2019t last year. So the delta between 2012 and 2011 or between 2012 and 2013 is really big. So I just figured maybe the better comparison would be 2011, when I would assume then that contractor was in place, comparing that to 2013.","Dominic J. Addesso","I don\u2019t have the 2011 numbers at my fingertips, but let\u2019s maybe just talk about 2012. So in 2012 for this one particular transaction we had almost $200 million of portfolio out. Right. In 2013, the portfolio winning was above $44 million and in addition we wrote some other quarter shares in 2013 that is also packed in these results. I don\u2019t know if that gets to your question, but that\u2019s about the most I can give you in terms of those transactions.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Okay. And then, in terms of thinking about this contract earnings through for the rest of the year, I assume that\u2019s when the majority of the contracts are through. First of all, is that right? And second of all, how much is earned though already in the second quarter?","Dominic J. Addesso","No, it earns ratably. I mean there\u2019s no unusual earnings pattern to. It\u2019s just that homeowner business that (inaudible) had over a 12-month period of time.","Joseph V. Taranto","Starting June 1.","Dominic J. Addesso","","Yes. Yeah.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","As always starting June 1.","Joseph V. Taranto","You wouldn\u2019t get too much earning in this quarter.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. And then, just one question maybe for Craig. Looks like the revolver, you took some out on the revolver in the quarter. Was that just kind of timing or is that something that you\u2019ll expect to do just to take advantage of still lower interest rates on the borrowing side?","Craig W. Howie","","That\u2019s correct, Mike. It is just really timing, more so than anything else and you\u2019re right. It is very low interest rates.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then, lastly I guess just thinking about capital deployment looking forward, does this program as large (inaudible) does this is in any way change your outlook in terms of how much you think or would like to deploy via buybacks relative to the how much you are earning over the foreseeable future or should we just consider that to be as it was?","Craig W. Howie","No, I think our outlook on buybacks is very much the same. It\u2019s going to be clearly part of the mix. It\u2019s been a big part of the mix for six months. I think it will continue to be a big part of the mix going forward. We told you despite not just this contract, but everything that was written in Florida we really didn\u2019t increase the PML at the one in 100 and above. So we didn\u2019t want that volatility, which frankly allows us to be more aggressive with regard to buyback. So it doesn\u2019t really change out outlook on that item.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And then just last one if I may. Can you just talk about the non-standard auto book? I\u2019m just trying to understand like when we\u2019re looking ahead in that insurance segment, how big is that, how big should that get into, just what sort of run rate are you thinking about in term or should we be thinking about in terms of profitability there? Thanks.","Joseph V. Taranto","Well, our non-standard auto book was running approximately $30 million a year for us and this year our expectation is that we would be somewhere around $30 million with the expansion hopes into the next year and beyond. That book of business we feel will have at least 10 points of margin in it. So that\u2019s kind of where we expect it to run.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Hi, good morning. Just wanted to talk a bit about the reserve triangles. This is the quarter in which you guys have released them. And it seems that there is a cushion that\u2019s growing, and I guess that\u2019s our opinion, based on what we can see. And the numbers are excellent that you are reporting, no doubt there and you\u2019re doing it without reserve releases. ","So can you comment a bit on how you feel in the reserves, maybe if you can cut across the different lines where you may feel relatively better or worse? And then, can you perhaps contrast it with the industry, which continues to release a lot, but their position seem to be slipping year-over-year.","Craig W. Howie","Greg, this is Craig. So as you\u2019ve noticed, the decision that we\u2019ve taken over time is to put up a prudent reserve position and over time we\u2019ve developed some very strong process that we have in place to develop that on a conservative basis going forward. So as you see those growing and you\u2019re seeing that across pretty much all lines in those triangles that we put out, but specifically on the reinsurance side we\u2019re seeing some very favorable development in our internal metrics that we look at, for example, actual versus expected that we look out on a regular basis. But again, the multi-pronged approach that we\u2019ve taken in the past over the last three years to setup this reserve position keeps supporting us in a better position over time.","Joseph V. Taranto","And Greg, to comment on any specific line or class of business at this point in time in the absence of a full reserve review is a little bit premature for us to get to in the second quarter. So what\u2019s important for us is the overall reserve position. There are going to be ups and downs in any particular class of business, I mean, we monitor close to 200 different reserve buckets and those move up and down over time. But it\u2019s fair to say that as the industry you always get a little more conservative with respect to the longer tail line.","So, the longer tail lines require a little bit more conservative reserve position, but that doesn\u2019t mean \u2013 so therefore, I guess, by definition, you can say that it there\u2019s any particular classes of the business that you\u2019d be less comfortable with it would be the longer tails, but we still feel that are causally comp and all those classes are well reserved.","Craig W. Howie","But I will add that, as you know, the results that we\u2019ve put out, and we are proud of these results, do not include any releases if you will. They\u2019re pure results based on this year and we\u2019re very happy that we have such good results that don\u2019t require the benefit of these releases. As far as the industry and how much more there\u2019s left and what\u2019s to come, we really won\u2019t comment on that. I don\u2019t think that we know any better than anybody else about that. We\u2019ll just talk about ourselves.","Gregory Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, great. Yes, the numbers are excellent. So congrats on another great quarter. Thanks.","Dominic J. Addesso","","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners","Hi, good afternoon. The first question is on the property cat business. I believe you have about $1 billion of premiums in there. And we\u2019ve heard various things about pricing, US versus the non-US, curious what portion of that business of yours is U.S. versus non-U.S. and how do you see the pricing outlook of that for the future?","Joseph V. Taranto","Well, it is about a $1 billion \u2013 it\u2019s probably grown from $1 billion in terms of the pure Cat premiums that we have on a worldwide basis. And I would tell you that the portfolio that we have as of the present after the July 1 renewals is probably the best portfolio we\u2019ve ever had in terms of total expected margin dollars going forward. And the ROE on the business that we\u2019ve written, we think is excellent.","Yes, we\u2019ve seen more competition for the business recently, some of that in Florida and you\u2019ve heard how we responded to some of that, and we did see somewhere beyond Florida in July. Clearly we have seen more capacity and in the market wise and I not \u2013 I don\u2019t necessarily expect that to go away if there is no big losses. But really as I continue to look forward, I expect us to continue to do well.","We\u2019ve dealt with competitions for many years. We\u2019ll continue to deal with that for many years to go. I think we have a lot of advantages in terms of our client relationships, the flexibility that we have in terms of the products that we can put together to meet clients needs, the ratings, the ability to move into pro rata or other options if that makes more sense. So yes, there\u2019s been recently more competition and probably that will stay but we\u2019re still putting together deals that we\u2019re very pleased with.","Dominic J. Addesso","Currently our U.S. catastrophe book represents approximately 50% of the overall worldwide Cat. So not that can change as Joe was describing depending on where the opportunities are, plus or minus 5 points, 10 points, but as we think of it, it\u2019s about approximately half.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay, that's helpful. And just thinking about this philosophically, if pricing does come down next year, would we see a pullback from you guys or do you think you can manage to still maintain your market share?","","Joseph V. Taranto","Well, yes, to be determinative, the pricing change dramatically and we were less enthusiastic about, less than I would expect that we would do less. And probably buy a whole lot of stock more back. And of course we would look for other opportunities to deploy our capital in other lines of business and other business dealing, whether it\u2019s acquisitions or something else. So sure as the world changes, we\u2019ll change, that\u2019s always the way it\u2019s been, that\u2019s always the way it will be.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners","Sure, that's helpful. And then on the primary insurance, are we still on track for a low 90%\u2019s combined ratio?","Joseph V. Taranto","Right now we\u2019re in the mid-90%\u2019s, and trending towards that number, yes.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners","Fine, and then just the last question is on Cats. Your Cats in the Canadian flood seem to be very low, just about $20 million and I know you guys are big player there. Just wanted to understand your exposure there and how you had such low Cats there? Thanks.","Joseph V. Taranto","In Canada?","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners","","Yes, correct.","Joseph V. Taranto","We are a significant player in the Canadian market. We tend to figure ourselves as probably the second or third largest reinsurer there. A bigger proportion of our portfolio relative to maybe some of the others is perhaps more casualty. And also we have not been as strong in that region as some others. So we\u2019ve not put down a lot of capacity in those regions where heavily prone \u2013 easily and more readily exposed to flood.","Dominic J. Addesso","","The property pro rata in Canada and the actual lead cut back in the last couple of years as we didn\u2019t believe that business was rated as healthy as it should be.","","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay that's very helpful. Thank you.","","Operator","We will take our final question from Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS","Yeah, good morning. A couple of questions here for you. The first one, can you tell us what the actual UEP transfer that came in on that Florida deal was?","Joseph V. Taranto","The portfolio end was $44 million.","Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS","$44 million? Great, thanks. And then just another quick question, on that deal how important was securing the ILW for you doing the deal and how much margin enhancement was that?","Joseph V. Taranto","That was not a factor in that transaction.","Dominic J. Addesso","The ILW deal wasn\u2019t just us managing the overall portfolio. We liked all the deals that we did, very pleased to do them and increase our margin. But when we got done we had a PML at 1-in-100 and above that was over, what it was a year ago. And we decided we didn\u2019t want that. And so we went to the ILW market, procured a deal that was very, very happy with at, took it back down.","Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS","Great. And then can you give us a quick update on what you are seeing as far as demand for casualty reinsurance out there? Is it still kind of declining? What is kind of the appetite out there for casualty reinsurance? And then also on that, have you seen any kind of change in terms and conditions, more multiyear deals, coverage\u2019s, anything else going on?","Joseph V. Taranto","Well, demand on the casualty side is it is kind of what you\u2019re implying in your question has been relatively weak. But that\u2019s been certainly something we have seen for the last couple of years. Nevertheless, we actually have been writing some new accounts, less so on the larger national type of clients where in that particular case the trend would be for less purchases as they increase retentions and as pricing is going up maybe a bigger better appetite on their end. ","But we have written some new business in the casualty space which is growing our portfolio, so it\u2019s real difficult to say what\u2019s happening with the market overall, but I don\u2019t think there is any significant change from the year-ago in terms of buyers appetite. And again, we\u2019re able to put some new business on the books, which were part of our franchises about building out the casualty operations well particularly into a market that where we are seeing some rate increase.","In terms of other types of transactions we are only seeing new and different types of transactions, different structures all the time, whether it\u2019s on the property or the casualty side and it\u2019s I made some slight reference \u2013 remarks about structured solutions and we\u2019re beginning to see opportunity there. And perhaps there is a slight pick up in where buyers are looking for in that space and we\u2019re participating in that.","","Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS","Great. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing or additional remarks.","Elizabeth B.

Q2 2012 Earnings Release Call.  Today\u2019s conference is being recorded, and at this time for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the conference over to Beth Farrell.  Please go ahead. ","Beth Farrell","Thank you, Lisa.  Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group\u2019s Q2 2012 earnings conference call.  On the call with me today are Joe Taranto, the company\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dom Addesso, our President; and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements.  In that regard, I note that statements made during today\u2019s call which are forward looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations, and the like are subject to various risks.  As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations.  Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements.  Now let me turn the call over to Joe.","Joe Taranto","Thanks, Beth.  Good morning.  We are pleased with our results through the first six months.  Our comprehensive income for that period is $519 million.  During the six months we purchased $225 million of our stock, paid $51 million in dividends, and still increased our surplus $346 million or 6%.  Booked value per share adjusted for dividends has increased 10%.  Our annualized operating earnings ROE was 16%.  ","Our reinsurance book has been positioned to capitalize on the best opportunities which have generally been on the property risks as rates, terms and conditions improved in the last couple of years in response to lost activity.  We have done this without meaningful increasing our PMLs in any peak zones.  We are pleased with our mid-year renewals.  Dom will provide more detail on this shortly.","Our insurance book has also been positioned to capitalize on our best opportunities.  This includes our [DNO] operations, our A&H medical stop loss business, and select property businesses which continue to be profitable areas for us; as well as the California worker\u2019s comp benefits and our general liability book where the market continues to improve; and our [crop book].  Again, Dom will provide more detail.","Our $16 billion of invested assets continued to perform well, particularly given the challenges of finding quality investments in the current market.  As previously announced, I will continue as CEO through the end of 2013 at which point Dom will become the CEO.  I\u2019m excited about continuing to lead our company through this year and next, and thrilled to have such a high quality individual \u2013 Dom Addesso \u2013 lead our company for many years thereafter.  I like our team, our portfolio and our plan.  Our company has never been stronger, our future has never been brighter.  Dom?","Dom Addesso","Thank you, Joe.  Good morning.  As Joe indicated, we\u2019ve had an excellent quarter overall.  The year so far is playing out generally as expected with the attritional combined ratio improving by one point compared to the first six months of 2011.  Rate increases and improving terms are beginning to work through the reinsurance property results.  Total CAT premium year-over-year has increased $200 million with approximately half of that in rate increase.","These results are also benefiting from the shift of pro rata to excess.  Well this has a dampening effect on premium, the positive impact on margin is flowing through the loss and expense ratios.  The combined ratio on our reinsurance property portfolios which has not yet been fully reflected through earnings has improved by 11 points.  On the treaty casualty side we are beginning to see modest rate increase work through the results.  It has not yet reached a level where we feel the need to aggressively expand, but the future opportunities may be more appealing over time.  In that regard we are beginning to enhance our teams and structure to maximize our resources around the globe.","Overall reinsurance premiums for the quarter were down, but this was due to foreign currency, reinstatement premiums, and the one-time effect of a cancelled [close share] contract.  After eliminating the effect of these items, premiums were up 17% for the quarter.  This was a result of the previously mentioned rate increases in many of our businesses.  ","The Florida market at June 1 saw CAT rates move up on average by 5%.  Canada property rate movements were similar.  The Asian markets had the largest moves, where rates in loss-affected regions were up 20% plus.  In Japan, we saw terms improve on proportional treaties although we did move some capacity to excess structures.  July renewals in Australia and New Zealand also had an upward movement in rates due to losses in those markets.  Increases here were in excess of 10% to 20%.  In all other international regions, property rates changes were relatively flat.","As I mentioned, approximately half of the CAT-exposed premium increase was rate, but the balance reflects new business opportunities for us in non-peak zones.  Our total CAT-exposed premium through six months is $740 million.  By year end this is expected to be approximately $1 billion with no material increase in peak PML zones.  This expansion reflects our appetite to expand as markets improve and most importantly our ability to execute due to the capability of our staff and the desire of the market for our well-rated capacity.","Improving markets and portfolio changes in both property and casualty has resulted in excess of $100 million in underwriting profit for the quarter and $218 million year-to-date for our reinsurance operations.  Excluding tax and reinstatement premiums, the reinsurance segment\u2019s combined ratio for the year has trended down to 83.7%.  This should continue to improve with the shift to excess.","On the insurance side results for the quarter and year-to-date are unfolding as expected.  Our growing primary A&H business plus double digit rate increases continuing in both worker\u2019s comp and our general casualty lines are all contributing to a solid 96.5% combined ratio for the quarter.  Our professional liability portfolio is also performing well and the runoff of terminated programs is nearing its end.","Currently, the only headwind in the insurance book is the crop business.  We have only 24% of the crop portfolio in the most severely affected states, yet we have booked conservatively for the year-to-date a small underwriting profit.  While it is still early to predict an outcome here it is less likely to have material impact on the annual results since the total MPCI writings for the year will approximate $135 million and we do purchase stop loss coverage on this book.  Overall the insurance book continues to move in the right direction with an underwriting profit for the quarter and year-to-date.","As we move through Q3 the indications for all segments are still positive.  We are moving into the US hurricane season and that still has to play itself out, but July property renewals in the US and Australia were strong.  The casualty market continues to move in the right direction.  For worker\u2019s comp we are into our third year of rate increases.  Our property portfolio has been expanding into non-peak zones and rates are at sustainable levels.  We have made some organizational changes and additions in key management positions in both the US and internationally which will allow us to move forward in expanding our footprint in new and different ways.","Given our size, credit quality and market positioning we are a market that brokers and clients are interested in doing business with.  With these changes I\u2019m confident that we can effectively execute on the right transactions and in the right way.  I will now ask Craig to take us through further details on the financials.","Craig Howie","Thank you, Dom, and good morning everyone.  We\u2019re pleased to report that Everest had another very strong quarter with after-tax operating income of $223 million or $4.25 per diluted common share.  In comparing these results to last year consideration must be given to the record catastrophes experienced in 2011.  Net income for Q2 was $214.6 million or $4.08 per diluted share.  Net income includes realized capital losses for the quarter.  ","On a year-to-date basis, operating income was $462.9 million or $8.72 per share.  This represents an annualized operating return on equity of 16.1%.  Net income year-to-date is $519.3 million or $9.79 per share.  This net income includes realized capital gains for the year.  These results are reflective of the year-to-date overall attritional combined ratio improving one point from 87.8% down to 86.6%.  This measure excludes the impact of catastrophes and reinstatement premiums.  ","The total reinsurance attritional combined ratio was 83.7% compared to 84.7% in the prior year.  The reinsurance segments would have improved even more if not for the $30 million charge in the marine line for the Costa Concordia cruise ship, $10 million of which was booked this quarter.  This includes the estimated $200 million of additional costs to remove the wreck.  The insurance segment attritional combined ratio was 98.7% compared to 99.3% in the prior year.  This ratio is much better than the 105.8% ratio for the full year of 2011.  These improvements should pinwheel as rate increases continue to earn in over time.  Also providing better margins is the shift in our portfolio from quota share to excess of loss.  ","Gross written premiums of $909 million for the quarter were down 8% compared to Q2 2011.  This decline is primarily driven by the non-renewal of one large Florida quota share reinsurance contract in the quarter \u2013 more on this later.  On a year to date basis, gross written premiums were $1.96 billion.  This represents a decline of 2% after adjusting for reinstatement premiums and the effects of foreign currency movements.  Earned premiums of $1.04 billion for the quarter were flat compared to the same quarter last year.  Earned premiums of $2 billion on a year-to-date basis have not changed significantly year-over-year.","We have achieved strong rate increases on portions of our books, especially on catastrophe-exposed risks.  However, the shift in capacity away from proportional risks does mask this effect as excess of loss business carries lower premiums.  The reinsurance segments reported year-to-date earned premiums of $1.6 billion, up 1% over 2011.  Reinsurance written premiums of $1.5 billion were down 3% over the same period.  However, written premiums were flat year-over-year after adjusting for reinstatement premiums and foreign exchange.  ","For the quarter, written premiums of $654 million were down 10% after adjusting for reinstatement premium and foreign exchange.  The decline in the reinsurance written premium this quarter is primarily driven by the nonrenewal of a large Florida quota share contract.  The reinsurance segment written premium would have been up 14% for the quarter excluding the impact of the return premium on this transaction.  The written premium would have been up 17% excluding the impact of reinstatement premiums and foreign exchange.","The nonrenewal of this contract allowed us to deploy our capital elsewhere and write other excess of loss covers in Florida.  In fact, we remain a significant writer of excess loss business in Florida.  This fits our strategy of shifting our portfolio towards excess of loss business where we feel underwriting margins have seen the most improvement.  We expect to see continued improvement in the expected margins to earn in over time assuming a normal catastrophe year in Florida.","The insurance segment reported $212 million of earned premium for the quarter which was flat compared to Q2 2011.  On a year-to-date basis, insurance earned premiums of $392 million were down 8% year-over-year.  This is primarily due to the runoff of certain program business and lower crop premium in the current year.  Last year the crop premium earned evenly throughout the year as reinsurance premiums.  ","The insurance segment reflects $35 million of seasonal earned premium from crop business in Q2 with $39 million now earned year-to-date.  We expect full year net premium from this book to total about $150 million.  We\u2019re currently booking the crop business at a 95% combined ratio but it\u2019s still too early to tell the overall impact that the record drought conditions in the US will have on this book.  However, as Dom mentioned, the company does purchase stop loss reinsurance coverage for its crop portfolio and the MPCI cover attaches at a 110% loss ratio.","Our reported combined ratio is 89.0%.  This is for both the quarter and year to date.  All segments reported underwriting gains for both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis.  The overall underwriting gain was $114.5 million for the quarter and $224 million for the year so far.  Total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $107 million for the quarter and a $218.7 million gain year-to-date.  The insurance segment reported a $7.4 million underwriting gain for the quarter and a $5.3 million gain year-to-date.  ","The commission ratio for the quarter is up 2.8 points compared to the prior-year quarter.  This increase relates to a number of one-time adjustments and settlements and the change in accounting for deferred acquisition costs.  We expect this ratio to return to a normal run rate of 22% to 23% over the next several quarters.  For the quarter we recorded $30 million of losses for current year catastrophes.  These losses are primarily related to a number of tornadoes and other severe weather in the US this quarter.  This brings our year-to-date gross catastrophe losses to $60 million for 2012 or 2.9% of earned premiums.","Regarding 2011 catastrophe losses, we\u2019ve reallocated a portion of the $50 million CAT IBNR established at the end of last year to cover higher estimates on certain events; in particular, the 2011 New Zealand earthquake.  We still have $30 million of this catastrophe IBNR remaining.  As for other loss reserves, we released our 2011 global loss development triangles in June.  There were really no major changes since the 2010 release, and in fact our quarterly internal reserving analysis continues to develop favorably.","For investments, pre-tax investment income was $149.3 million for the quarter and $301.8 million year-to-date on our $16 billion investment portfolio.  Year-to-date, investment income declined $35.6 million from one year ago.  This decrease is primarily driven by lower limited partnership income which was down $22 million this year and by declining reinvestment rates.  ","The quarter reflected $16.6 million of pre-tax realized capital losses and $8.5 million of losses after tax.  But, we had $82.1 million of pre-tax revised capital gains on a year-to-date basis and $56.3 million of gains after tax.  On income taxes, the 12.9% effective tax rate on operating income for the quarter reflects 1) the impact of the realized capital losses this quarter on the annualized effective tax rate calculation, and 2) other one-time tax adjustments.  The 7.4% year-to-date effective tax rate on operating income is within our expected range for the year.","Turning to other miscellaneous items, a $16.3 million derivative loss for the quarter relates to the decline in the equity markets and interest rates during the quarter.  On a year-to-date basis we reported a derivative loss of $10.1 million compared to a derivative gain of $4.2 million in the prior year.  Other income for both the quarter and the year largely reflects foreign exchange gains in the period as opposed to foreign exchange losses a year ago.  This is primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar against other world currencies.","Operating cash flows were $139 million for the quarter compared to $151 million in Q2 2011.  As expected, catastrophe loss payouts and income tax payments contributed to this decline.  We earned $188.5 million of comprehensive income this quarter.  This primarily reflects $215 million of net income for the quarter less foreign currency translation adjustments of $25 million.  We now have $590.4 million of comprehensive income year-to-date.  ","Turning now to capital management, in addition to the dividend payments to shareholders of $25 million we repurchased almost 1 million shares this quarter at a total cost of $100 million.  For the year we\u2019ve repurchased 2.4 million shares at a total cost of $225 million.  Since 2006, we\u2019ve repurchased over 15 million shares at a total cost of $1.3 billion representing over 23% of the outstanding shares at December 31, 2006.  The company has 4.9 million shares remaining under a share repurchase authorization from the Board of Directors.","Shareholders\u2019 equity increased to $6.4 billion this quarter, up 6% from $6.1 billion at year end 2011.  This is after taking into account the $225 million of stock repurchases and the $51 million of dividend paid so far this year.  Book value per share increased 9.5% to $123.75 from $112.99 at year end 2011.  Our strong capital position leaves us with capacity to maximize our business opportunities as well as continuing our share repurchases.  Thank you, and now I\u2019ll turn it back to Beth for Q&A.","","Beth Farrell","Lisa, we\u2019re ready to take questions.","","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you.  (Operator instructions.)   And we\u2019ll take our first question from Amit Kumar with Macquarie Research.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research ","Thanks, and congrats on a very strong quarter.  I just had a few sort of clarification-type questions on the crop insurance book, and the color was very helpful that you gave in the opening remarks.  First of all, can you just sort of refresh us in what is the crop distribution in the heartland book?  It\u2019s not that corn is the predominant just based on where it is, but can you just refresh us what is that distribution?","Dom Addesso","You mean the distribution by crop?","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research ","Yes.","Dom Addesso","Its normal distribution is corn and soybean; corn and soybean are the main products.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research ","And then do you have the percentages or\u2026","Dom Addesso","Give me a second here, Amit.  The information I have in front of me will not let me give you a precise answer, Amit, so I\u2019m going to have to follow up on that question. ","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research ","Okay, that\u2019s fine.  And secondly I know you mentioned the stop loss coverage. Would this be similar to sort of what the industry standard is in terms of where it attaches?  Can you give us any other color on that?","Dom Addesso","It attaches at a 110%.  I think it\u2019s 95% and we have a 5% participation.  It\u2019s 30 points of limit.  [95 of 30%], excess of 110%.","Joe Taranto","It\u2019s similar in structure to what most companies purchase.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research ","Got it, that\u2019s very helpful.  And I guess the only other question I have for now is you know, obviously your overall book has evolved.  You\u2019re talking about CAT-exposed premiums being at $1 billion versus right now at $700 million.  I\u2019m curious how should we sort of think about the CAT load discussion?  I know we\u2019ve discussed a number in the past but as the book changes how do you think about the CAT load internally?","Dom Addesso","That\u2019s not changed significantly, Amit.  As we\u2019ve mentioned there\u2019s been no major shift in our peak zones and we\u2019ve pushed out some additional aggregate into non-peak zones but that\u2019s not changing materially our annual expected outlook.","Joe Taranto","And a lot of the change comes from rate increases.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Research ","Got it.  Okay, that\u2019s all I have for now.  I\u2019ll re-queue for additional questions.  Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yeah, good morning everyone.  I just want to walk through the Florida quota share arrangement a little bit.  I wanted to know what impact there was on the expense ratio or the loss ratio in terms of maybe giveback of premiums or something like that that may be one time in nature?  Also I wanted to know does the program dissolve or does it go to a competitor?  And then talk a little about the philosophy of letting that program leave and what changed in the economics over the last few years.","Joe Taranto","I\u2019ll start with the latter part of that question with regard to what happened and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Craig to take you through some of the numbers.  Basically we would have supported the deal that was in place with us last year but a competitor offered terms that we could not support.  We in fact had a contractual right on the deal that was put forth to do more than 50% but we chose not to do anything, and instead we redeployed our capital into Florida XOL deals which we think offer better returns.  So that\u2019s the long and short of it in terms of that specific deal, but Craig will give you the particulars numbers-wise.","Craig Howie","Josh, one of the things is we don\u2019t typically discuss any one transaction on a call like this.  However what I can tell you is what we did is we portfolio\u2019d out the unearned premium.  That unearned premium was $194 million.  We have to resource the corresponding commission and then we have to remove any deferred acquisition costs associated with that on our unearned premium.  But this was a one-time transaction and a one-time event.  So you\u2019re right that it was an impact as part of our combined ratio for the quarter but there were a number of other adjustments and impacts in that combined ratio as well.","Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, no problem.  But arguably we can be comfortable saying that the expense ratio in US reinsurance is inflated in Q2?","Joe Taranto","Correct.","Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, thank you.","Joe Taranto","The (inaudible) points of inflation on the expense, that\u2019s on a worldwide basis.  So there is a blip in the quarter that drove up the expense ratio that should go away.","Operator","And we have Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.  Please go ahead.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yeah hi, good morning and again, congrats on the quarter.  I just wanted to get your appetite for buybacks at today\u2019s levels given that the valuation really hasn\u2019t moved much year to date because you\u2019ve had so much book value growth.","Joe Taranto","Our appetite remains strong.  We think it\u2019s one of the best ways to use the profits, the earnings that we\u2019re making.  Now we are moving into hurricane season and do we\u2019ll be a bit more cautious in this quarter than perhaps otherwise, but we intend to continue to buy nonetheless. ","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, and then if you can just remind me historically have you ever bought in the wind season and would that strategy change?","Joe Taranto","[We have] but again, we\u2019ve bought less than we have in other quarters.  But you know, at this point we have a lot of excess capital, profits are good.  We like the portfolio and the only hesitation is the fact that it\u2019s hurricane season.  But we like the price and it\u2019s really one of the ways of continuing to move the football down the field.  We like buying our stock at these levels.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Excellent, okay.  Thanks.  And then just shifting gears back to crop, it\u2019s actually pretty amazing.  You\u2019re not the only carrier but the industry is staring at what at least what would be the largest loss in crop in history and yet you guys are booking at 95% and are going to obviously make more in the line if your projections prove out.  And so I guess what I\u2019m trying to understand is what is going into that expectation of a 95%?  What gives you guys confidence that what appears to be the worst industry loss ever is not going to result in you guys losing money in that particular line?","Dom Addesso","Greg, it\u2019s Dom.  It\u2019s still very early to be predicting what the outcome is, but also recognizing that it\u2019s a limited amount of premium that was earned in Q2 from crop.  So that fact that we built a very small underwriting gain, which I think is consistent with what many of the other markets have done; and it\u2019s not inconceivable given that, as I mentioned in my script, we could eke out a small profit because at this point only 24% of the states are severely affected.  ","Now, that could change in the months ahead in either direction and we have ranges around where the result could end up, which include both a strong profit and a modest loss.  So it was really much too early to predict how to book this and frankly, given the level of earned premium that we had in the quarter it wasn\u2019t that material at least as in the impact for this quarter.  And ultimately as I said, even as the year plays out on the insurance side our annualized premium for crop is $150 million, and of that $135 million is MPCI-related; the remainder is crop [hail].","Joe Taranto","Yeah, to follow up on that, that really means that this is 3% of our worldwide premium and it\u2019s got a stop loss on it; and as Dom noted only 25% of the business now is in the states that are performing quite poorly.  Having said that, as Dom noted it remains to play out.  It certainly could get worse and we could lose money on this \u2013 we\u2019ll see.  But really in the grand scheme of things it is not a real big deal for us.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Excellent, very thorough.  And then last is on the top line decline, the loss of the contract which you called out in the quarter, are there any lingering impacts to that as we think about premiums and our models going forward on the top line and the bottom line? Just how we should handle that.","Joe Taranto","I don\u2019t think there are any adverse issues in terms of margins or profits or [attritionals] going forward.  Premiums may be down a bit; they were down this quarter, and we won\u2019t have that treaty on an ongoing basis.  But really our focus is on margin and profits and attritional.  We don\u2019t see any issues on that front.","Dom Addesso","In fact, margins really should be going up as again, I indicated moving more of our CAT PML from proportional to excess, we\u2019re benefitting not only on the attritional loss ratio but also on the commission ratio.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, great, and again, the profitability is strong.  But I guess what you\u2019re saying though is there will be top line pressure that plays through for at least the next three quarters.  We\u2019ve taken one quarter of the decline and it should continue but profits are up because of all the reasons you\u2019ve stated.  ","Dom Addesso","Greg, what\u2019s in that is you think about the rate increases we\u2019ve had, not only in Florida but around the globe, and a lot of that rate increase is offsetting to a very large degree this one particular transaction.","Joe Taranto","Yeah, and you don\u2019t have one quarter in this quarter.  You have the whole unearned premium reserve portfolio\u2019d out, so everything that was on the books has been written but hasn\u2019t earned at this point has been reversed.  So this is a very unusual quarter in that regard.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, good.  Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Cliff Gallant with KBW.","Cliff Gallant \u2013 Keefe Bruyette & Woods","Good morning, good quarter.  Just two questions: the first just on the switch from quota share to XOL \u2013 is that simply a reflection of current market terms or is there something more intrinsic about the business that you prefer in XOL?  And then my second question was just on investment income, and we continue to see low yields and the outcome doesn\u2019t look good there \u2013 is there any sense that you should change your strategy, try to get more yield?","Joe Taranto","Well, let me start on the first part. What we have found I think looking around the world in the last year or so is XOL rates have been going out where in many cases pro rata rates have not.  So more and more that\u2019s pushing us into the XOL camp.  Having said that we still see pro rata deals that we like doing, and we put those through our models and see how those returns compare to other potential deals.  We\u2019re talking about CAT deals now and so again, it\u2019s a portfolio optimization model that we\u2019re using.  We want to do the best deals.  We have a certain aggregate that we\u2019re willing to apply and we want only the best deals to go into that aggregate.  And what shakes out of that shakes out of that.  Now, as it turns out, given the trends that\u2019s more and more XOL as opposed to pro rata.","Craig Howie","From an investment standpoint, Cliff, I don\u2019t see a dramatic change in our portfolio here.  First of all there\u2019s been a lot of changes in the portfolio over the past couple years but right now it\u2019s very conservative.  It\u2019s a diversified portfolio.  It\u2019s very high credit quality.  We don\u2019t\u2019 have control over the low interest rate environment but we have to live with it.  We have to make it up on the underwriting side, and there\u2019s been a lot of discussion about underwriting benefits here and a decline in our attritional ratio; and that will make up for it to get to the bottom line ROE.","Cliff Gallant \u2013 Keefe Bruyette & Woods","Okay, that makes sense.  Thank you.","Dom Addesso","Let me also give you a statistic that might help keep this in perspective relative to the pro rata versus excess.  And it\u2019s not as if, as Joe indicated, that we stopped writing pro rata.  It\u2019s just reducing the proportion.  So in terms of the proportion of pro rata to excess business, in 2010 \u2013 and I\u2019m going back to 2010 because that\u2019s a reflection of how it earns through the portfolio \u2013 pro rata was 68%, XOL obviously 32%.  In 2011 61%\/39%, and in 2012 for June it\u2019s 57%\/43%.  So I mean that just gives you the trend line of the pro rata.","The pro rata is also benefitting, by the way, from underlying increases in primary rates but it\u2019s not as if pro rata is falling off a cliff here.","Cliff Gallant \u2013 Keefe Bruyette & Woods","Okay, that\u2019s helpful.  Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Ian Gutterman with Adage Capital.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital","Hi.  Just can you clarify again for me on the universal contract, I think you said $194 million of unearned premium?  Over what time period [would you have kept] the contract?  Over what time period would that have earned out \u2013 by the end of the year, does it go into next year?","Joe Taranto","It would have been one year and you\u2019re correct \u2013 the number was $194 million that was portfolio\u2019d out of unearned.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital","Okay, so basically that\u2019s Q3 of this year through Q2 of next year that would of earned out.","Joe Taranto","Correct.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital","Got it, okay great.  And then can you talk about, just given the portfolio changes you\u2019ve made in CAT, I don\u2019t know if you can give us a Florida only PML or just talk about how you\u2019ve structured the portfolio in XOL?  Are you exposed more to the [Florida-only\u2019s] and nationals, are you playing high layers, low layers \u2013 some sort of sense of what types of events or companies you might be exposed to.","Dom Addesso","Our portfolio hasn\u2019t changed much in that regard, frankly, and it\u2019s pretty well ventilated.  We support regionals, locals and national clients.  It\u2019s a wide array of client list.","Joe Taranto","And no meaningful change to the PML.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital","Alright, even though I would have thought\u2026 I mean (inaudible) implies you pay at dollar one where XOL means you pay obviously higher, so it would seem you\u2019d be less exposed to lower events [this year] at a minimum.  Is that right?","Dom Addesso","Well slightly that\u2019s true, but there are CAT covers that do attach low.  And then of course you can deploy more limit up high and it has a similar PML.","Joe Taranto","And (inaudible) our design was to not increase the PML so we\u2019ve worked backwards from that.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital","Okay, and maybe just lastly on that is just as you were trying to reallocate onto XOL-type programs, I mean some of your competitors have sort of discussed it being difficult to stay on programs that they liked in the past because of some of these nontraditional competitors coming in.  I just wondered how much of a concern was that as you were repositioning or were you sort of playing on a contract that doesn\u2019t tend to attract that kind of capital?","Joe Taranto","You know there\u2019s always competition in our business, there always will be; and it comes in from the normal competitors and yes, you do see it come in in unconventional ways here and there, be it sidecars or other things.  So yes, there was a little bit more than that recently.  Having said that, as Dom noted in Florida as an example rates still went up, so I\u2019m sure it had a dampening effect but rates still went up.  And I\u2019ve found it overall this June and July to be a very sensible market where we were still able to achieve what we were looking to achieve.","To a certain degree, more competition coming in that still keeps it a sensible market is not a bad thing.  We don\u2019t want so much coming in that it makes it a market that doesn\u2019t rate very well, but a lot of the competition that is coming in in an unconventional way only wants to come in if it\u2019s a reasonable market and frankly will go away I think if it is not.  So put it all together, I don\u2019t think it changed the world all that much and we were happy with what we achieved.","Dom Addesso","We also have demand too, Ian, coming out of model drift as well as companies seeking to buy more protection.  So those are some offsetting factors to what you\u2019ve described.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital","Of course, of course.   Do you have any emerging thoughts as far as a willingness to engage with some of these new form of capital?","Joe Taranto","We\u2019re open.  We talk to some of these potential new ventures.  If it makes sense for us we could engage.  We\u2019re open-minded about it.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from [Michael Yancey] with Goldman Sachs.","[Michael Yancey] \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you very much.  So one question I had, you mentioned capital deployment before and you mentioned the nonrenewal of this Florida contract.  Just thinking about capital deployment through wind season, I mean does the fact that you have less exposure now it would appear to wind season allow you to get more comfortable with deployment through wind season?  ","And I guess the second question I think, Joe, you mentioned upfront you\u2019re deploying capital relative to the capital you\u2019re generating.  I guess my question would be why stop there?  Why not deploy more if you have enough capital and you feel comfortable that there\u2019s enough there to continue?  And then I just have one follow-up, thanks.","Joe Taranto","Well you know I think we will be buying back.  In terms of going even more aggressively, let\u2019s put everything in perspective.  Craig noted we bought back 23% of the stock in recent years and frankly, we\u2019ve added to that that we plan on continuing to buy in a meaningful way.  Beyond that we like having excess capital.  We like having capital for business opportunities.  It didn\u2019t hurt having capital last year when there was a ton of losses out there and some others that downgraded because they didn\u2019t have enough capital.  So we want to balance everything.  We want to keep having high-quality earnings that we can buy back more, and we will just continue to buy back.  I think we pitched it at a very reasonable level all things considered.","I think you said something upfront about something that suggested our exposure was down.  I think we\u2019ve said we\u2019ve kept the PMLs the same but we didn\u2019t really say that we\u2019ve taken them down.  So our exposure if you will just looking from a PML point of view to hurricane is still approximately the same in peak zones.","[Michael Yancey] \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Even after adjusting for the nonrenewal of that one large contract?","Joe Taranto","Yes, yes because we redeployed that capital to do some other excessive loss contracts.","[Michael Yancey] \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Gotcha, okay.  And then one follow-up on the crop stuff: I assume that the reason your losses even in a worst case scenario are limited or relatively bracket-able is because of the reinsurance program that you have.  And I guess my question is is that all private market reinsurance?  Is some of that back to the government?  That\u2019s my first question.","Dom Addesso","What I was referring to is the stop loss program and Craig referenced it as well in his opening comments.  That\u2019s private reinsurance.  That\u2019s not the sessions to the federal government, no.","[Michael Yancey] \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Is there a quota share as well or is it just purely a stop loss?","Dom Addesso","Stop loss.  We do have quota share with XOL, right.","[Michael Yancey] \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Understood, okay.  And then just the last one: the growth, and it looks like a lot of the premium growth came out of international reinsurance, and I just wanted to understand where are you focusing your attention and do you expect that that will continue to be the engine for premium growth for the remainder of the year?  Thanks.","Joe Taranto","On the international side some of what you\u2019re seeing is a rate increase coming out of Australia, coming out of Japan, a little bit continuing in Latin America.  But we\u2019ve been very strong on the international front for years but again, I think much of what you\u2019re seeing there most recently is rate increase on the XOL side.","[Michael Yancey] \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it, great.  Okay, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners","Hi, good morning.  The first question is on the crop insurance.  You mentioned that you\u2019re writing on 95% combined ratio.  What\u2019s your loss ratio for the business that you\u2019re working at right now?","Joe Taranto","The combined is the 95%, yes.  The way we book it\u2019s 95% combined.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners","So the loss ratio would be similar to the combined ratio, correct?","Dom Addesso","Well you\u2019ve got the commission fees in there.  We\u2019ll get you that number in a second.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners","The reason I ask is that the stop loss is that 110% loss ratio so I just wanted to find out the apples to apples.  Okay, great.","Dom Addesso","The stop loss ratio works off of the entire combined excluding our internal expenses which are small.  And the loss ratio is 75% so it\u2019s [25%] (inaudible).","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners","Alright, so just looking at apples to apples it\u2019s 110% of the loss ratio was say maybe the 90% to 95% that you\u2019re booking at now, correct?  I mean that\u2019s the potential upside or loss that you may have, correct?","Joe Taranto","95% could go to another 15 points before the stop loss would begin, yes.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay fair enough, great, thanks.  The second question was on rate increases.  You\u2019ve had very strong rate increases and that\u2019s flattening out right now.  Where do you see rate increases going out next year should we have a benign CAT season?","Joe Taranto","Well, I think they\u2019re going to level off if you have little to no CATs.  If they stay where they\u2019re at I think they\u2019d be leveling off at a very reasonable place where there\u2019d still be some very good opportunities.  But I would not expect them to continue up way beyond what they\u2019ve done in the last couple of years if there was little in the way of catastrophes.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners","That\u2019s helpful, thank you.","Operator","And there are no further questions.  I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Joseph Taranto for any additional or closing remarks.","Joe Taranto","Well, I will make one comment.  We didn\u2019t talk much about the casualty market and Dom certainly noted that whereas we\u2019re seeing rate increases there and it\u2019s getting more promising it\u2019s still not exciting enough for us to really make some bigger bets there.  But I would remind everyone that we certainly have the firepower, distribution and people to do so should that end of the market begin to get more interesting.  ","We have the firepower both on the insurance side and the reinsurance side, so we are hoping that many who are predicting that that end of the world will continue upward and will continue to improve, we certainly hope that that is the case; and if that is the case we\u2019ll be able to do more there. I thought I\u2019d comment on that since we really hadn\u2019t addressed it whatsoever.  But other than that, thank you for joining us today.","Operator","And that concludes today\u2019s teleconference.  Thank you for your participation.",""]}}
