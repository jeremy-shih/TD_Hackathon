[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David DeSonier, Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations for Leggett & Platt, Incorporated. Thank you, sir. You may begin.","David M. DeSonier","Good morning, and thank you for taking part in Leggett & Platt's third quarter conference call. With me today are the following: Dave Haffner, our Board Chair and CEO; Karl Glassman who is President and Chief Operating Officer; Matt Flanigan, our Executive VP and CFO; and Susan McCoy, our Staff VP of Investor Relations. In addition, Joe Downes, who is Senior Vice President of the company and President of the Industrial Materials segment, is joining us this morning to participate in Q&A.","As we mentioned earlier this year, we plan to periodically include each of the segment presidents in these calls.","The agenda for our this call this morning is as follows: Dave Haffner will start with a summary of the major statements we made in yesterday's press release; Matt Flanigan will discuss financial details and address our outlook for the remainder of 2013; Karl Glassman will provide segment highlights; and finally, the group will answer any questions that you have.","This conference is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material.

Haffner","Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call. As we reported yesterday, third quarter earnings were $0.49 per share versus $0.45 per share in the third quarter of 2012. Current quarter results, including $9 million or $0.06 per share benefit from an acquisition purchased at a negotiated price less than the total accounting fair value of its net assets. Excluding this unusual item, earnings per share decreased to $0.43 primarily due to lower sales.","Same location sales decreased 3% during the quarter from a combination of factors, including, one, the non-recurrence, as expected, of the large JCPenney Store Fixtures programs that were concentrated in the third quarter last year. Two, lower trade sales from our rod mill; and three, weak demand in Commercial Vehicle Products. These declines were partially offset by continued strength in global automotive demand and growth in carpet underlay.","Excluding the unusual acquisition-related benefit, EBIT and EBIT margins decreased in the third quarter, primarily from lower sales.","In late July, we acquired another aerospace Tubing business with annual revenues of approximately $40 million, adding to the business unit that was formed in early 2012. This French-based acquisition expands our portfolio of Tubing products to include small diameter, high pressure, seamless tubing. This tubing is used in hydraulic, fuel, engine instrumentation and air conditioning systems and is complementary to the large diameter, low pressure welded tubing produced by Western Pneumatic Tube, which was the initial platform acquisition we made last year. We have identified meaningful cross-selling opportunities across our 4 aerospace businesses, as well as opportunities to improve the performance of this recently acquired operation.","With this acquisition, and a smaller U.K.-based business we acquired in the second quarter, our aerospace products business unit now has an annual revenue run rate of approximately $120 million. The development of this new business platform aligns very well with our strategic emphasis on improving the overall margin mix of our businesses by entering attractive markets where we can develop or extend a strong, sustainable, competitive advantage.","In conjunction with our priority on critically reviewing our businesses for strategic value, we are continuing to explore possible alternatives for our Commercial Vehicle Products business. One of which is the potential divestiture of that business. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1\/3 of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year.","For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2013, we have so far generated TSR of 15% per year on average, which currently places us at the midpoint of the S&P 500 companies.","I'll now turn the call over to Matt Flanigan who will discuss some additional financial details, along with our outlook for the remainder of the year. Matt?","Matthew C. Flanigan","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Operating cash flow grew to $116 million during the third quarter, an increase of 22% over the same quarter last year. Working capital contributed $21 million to operating cash in the quarter and consistent with our normal, seasonal patterns, should be a significant source of cash in the fourth quarter as well. Optimizing returns on capital employed continues to be a major focus for our operations. We ended the third quarter with working capital at 12.3% of annualized sales, which is well below our 15% target.","For the full year, we expect to generate over $350 million of operating cash, again, comfortably exceeding the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends.","In August, we increased the quarterly dividend by 3.4% to $0.30 per share. And 2013, therefore, marks our 42nd consecutive annual dividend increase at a compound annual growth rate of 13%.","At yesterday's closing price of $29.67, the current yield is 4% on our stock, which is one of the highest among all of the S&P 500 dividend aristocrats.","During calendar 2013, dividends should require about $125 million of cash, which is lower than a typical year, since the dividend, normally paid in January of 2013, was accelerated into December last year in anticipations of higher individual tax rates.","We expect capital expenditures in 2013 to be approximately $85 million. Our depreciation and amortization expense this year should total around $120 million. With current capacity utilization rates still relatively low, our need to invest in additional productive capacity is limited. We continue to make investments for maintenance, efficiency improvement, and growth in businesses and product lines where sales are strong. As volumes improve, we expect capital expenditure levels to increase, but longer term, they will likely remain at or below total depreciation and amortization expense.","As a reminder, our incentive plans emphasize returns on capital, which include net fixed assets and working capital. This emphasis, we believe, helps ensure that we are efficiently utilizing our asset base and investing capital dollars where the highest return potential exists. Returns should continue to improve as we expand EBIT margins, while controlling invested capital in this way.","In other uses of cash, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our stock in the third quarter. Year-to-date through September, we have repurchased 3.9 million shares and issued 3.1 million. Approximately 2\/3 of the issued shares were employee stock option exercises earlier in the year in response to higher stock prices. Consistent with our stated priorities for the use of excess cash flow, we will prudently buy back our stock, bearing in mind our level of cash generation, other potential opportunities to strategically grow the company and the overall outlook for the general economy.","We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year, but have established no specific repurchase commitment or timetable. As of today, we have approximately 6 million shares still available under this year's authorization.","We recognize that our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making investment decisions. We ended the quarter with net debt to net capital of 27.9%, which is well below the conservative end of our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%.","As we stated in yesterday's press release, we now expect full year sales of approximately $3.75 billion, which is 1% growth versus 2012. Our prior guidance range was $3.75 billion to $3.85 billion.","Given this expected level of sales, we anticipate 2013 earnings of $1.61 to $1.66 per share, including $0.05 per share from discontinued operations and 6% -- $0.06 per share from the third quarter unusual acquisition-related benefit that Dave mentioned earlier. Adjusting for those, earnings from continuing operations are expected to be between $1.50 and $1.55 per share. And this implies a fourth quarter EPS guidance range of $0.31 to $0.36 on sales of approximately $900 million. Our prior range for full-year continuing operations was $1.50 to $1.65 per share.","And as a reminder, we earned $1.47 of adjusted EPS from continuing operations in 2012. Now I'll turn the call over to Karl who will provide some additional segment comments.","Karl G. Glassman","Thank you, Matt, and good morning. In the Residential Furnishings segment, same location sales increased 6% in the third quarter, from higher unit volumes and certain product categories and raw material related price increases in Carpet Underlay.","In our U.S. spring business, sales decreased 2% in the quarter. Innerspring unit volumes decreased 4%, however, growth in the Comfort Core innerspring category continued, with those higher priced and higher-margin to units up 12% during the quarter.","Our boxspring volume was also strong, with units up 8%. Sales grew 4% in international spring, primarily from market share gains in Europe. In furniture components, sales increased 4% in the third quarter. Volume in our seating and sofa sleeper business grew 5%, and motion hardware unit volume was essentially flat.","Adjustable Bed units were down 10% in the quarter. In Carpet Underlay, sales grew primarily from price increases implemented to recover higher raw material costs. Third quarter EBIT and EBIT margins increased in the segment, primarily from higher sales. In the Commercial Fixturing & Component segment, same location sales decreased 20% in the third quarter. As expected, Store Fixture sales decreased significantly due to the non-recurrence of the major JCPenney programs that were concentrated in the third quarter last year.","In office furniture components, volume was up slightly during the quarter, roughly tracking the overall market for office seating. Segment EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus the third quarter of 2012 due to the lower sales. In the Industrial Materials segment, third quarter same location sales decreased 10%, with about half that decline from lower trade sales in our rod mill and the balance from steel-related price deflation and lower unit volumes.","The decrease in trade sales of steel rod during the quarter was offset by an increase in intercompany rod sales. And the rod mill continues to run at 100% capacity utilization.","As we stated in past quarters, a change in the mix of rod sales from trade to intercompany is generally positive to earnings, since that change tends to also shift the production mix to a higher value, high carbon rods.","EBIT and EBIT margins for the segment decreased during the quarter, primarily due to lower sales and reduced metal margins.","In the Specialized Products segment, same location sales increased slightly in the third quarter. Automotive sales increased 9%, with continued strong growth in Asia and North America, partially offset by lower demand in Europe. In Commercial Vehicle Products, sales were down 30% in the third quarter. Large fleet customers pulled volume forward into the second quarter and curtailed capital spending in the third quarter on near-term macro concerns.","The seg that's -- EBIT and EBIT margins decreased slightly during the quarter, as continued strength in automotive was offset by weak performance in CVP from lower sales and operating inefficiencies at a recently consolidated facility.","With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave Haffner.","David S. Haffner","We began 2013 with expectations for stronger demand in many of our end markets. And while those improvements have been slow to occur in certain areas, we are generally encouraged by the positive direction several of our businesses are headed. We continue to be very optimistic about the growth potential in our automotive business for the next several years. Industry forecast project 4% global production growth in 2014, with all the major geographies positive versus 2013. With content gain, we expect to outperform this industry growth rate. We are also encouraged by the longer-term view for the Office Furniture industry and expect improving growth rates in our business in 2014.","Customer backlogs and aerospace support industry demand strength in that business for several years. Our Adjustable Bed business has recently gained significant market share that we will start to see the benefit from in 2014. And with consumer confidence and housing generally on the upward track, our Residential Furniture Components and bedding businesses are poised to benefit as demand in those end markets improves.","And with those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier.","David M. DeSonier","That concludes our prepared remarks. We appreciate your attention and we will be glad to answer your questions. [Operator Instructions] Christine, we are ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Borstein with Longbow Research.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","On the adjustable foundations, I know -- I had read at the recent High Point Market, you introduced a new foundation that my guess comes in at a more affordable price point, perhaps due to some less functionality versus your other foundations. Is that some of the benefits that you had just mentioned in 2014 you expect to see?","Karl G. Glassman","Yes, Josh, this is Karl. Yes, that's part of it. We're continually introducing new product lines. But more specifically, Dave's commentary related to some significant customer that are specific to customer gains that will incorporate some of the new technology that we introduced in the -- at the High Point Market. You'll see again in the hands of specific customers at the Las Vegas Market in January.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then the decline in the quarter, the 10%, was that more the same just the promotional behavior from some of your competitors? Or was it just lower demand?","Karl G. Glassman","Josh, that was part of it. Part of it was that we were up against a very difficult comp. The third quarter of 2012 was really strong. Also, about 1\/3 of that backslide was related to a credit issue with a specific customer, it was an e-commerce customer. That situation has since been resolved. I will say the loss lessened as the quarter progressed. So we believe that the fourth quarter performance, we certainly won't see that rate of decline and as I said, are very enthusiastic about the pickup that we'll see in the first quarter of next year.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. I wanted to ask you about the cadence. So my impression was -- originally that it slowed down through the quarter, but it sounds like it actually had picked up. Is that correct?","Karl G. Glassman","It became less bad, yes.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then just last one on the adjustables. Is it -- the loss that did occur from this slower demand, was it your sense that it came equally from the bedding manufacturer that you supply? Or was it a mix between them and some of the retailers that you supply?","Karl G. Glassman","It was a mix of the 2, certainly, Josh.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Moore with CJS Securities.","Daniel Moore - CJS Securities, Inc.","Obviously, based on the guidance, as we look out to Q4, I'm not seeing immediate improvement in the near-term. If demand doesn't pick up, as you elaborated or might expect early in '14, do you have levers of room to further improve efficiency and reduce costs?","David S. Haffner","Dan, this is Dave. There are always some levers, yes. It's difficult to take a particular freestanding plant off-line unless -- especially if that plant has some unique manufacturing capabilities. We've chosen not to -- I mean, obviously, we've reduced the productive capacity a few years ago to what we thought was prudent. But the answer is yes. There are always ways; the operators, and I can let Karl comment on this, if he will, are always looking for ways to manufacture the products at a lower demand level in the most efficient way. And there's also fixed cost, of course, that if for some reason, we were to see additional pullback that we would have to reduce some fixed cost. Karl?","Karl G. Glassman","Yes. I would certainly agree with that, Dan. If business stays flat going forward, we'll continue to do our analysis of facilities as we always do. Our operating team really deserves a lot of credit for the margins that we've seen. The improvement in margins that we've seen in what has really been a flat demand year. So if you see that continue, expect that our margins will improve, we'll continue to be tactical around each one of the activities and work each one of those levers. It's interesting, in a flat demand environment, our capacity utilization actually is decreasing because we're becoming incrementally more efficient at every turn.","Daniel Moore - CJS Securities, Inc.","Very helpful. And one quick follow-up, perhaps. The -- maybe just elaborate on the acquisition in aerospace tubing, if not the purchase price, what's the margin profile look like? And how does that fit in strategically with Western Pneumatic?","Joseph D. Downes","Yes, Dan, this is Joe Downes. The business, it should follow the same profile of the Western Pneumatic as far as earnings and -- or the earnings on their sales. They do open up some markets for us, for some of the Western products to be sold to Airbus, which is a major customer, especially tubes. And in turn, we will be able to -- we expect to be able to take the seamless tubing that -- especially to producers and introduce it further to Boeing because of our entr\u00e9es [ph] that we have there with Western.","David S. Haffner","And, Dan, this is Dave. I wish it was larger business, because that margin profile is attractive for our shareholders. We'll continue to look for ways to grow that the entire unit. But that seamless tubing, which is high-pressure, low-volume displacement, is very -- it's different type tubing, but it's very complementary because it's used by the same customer base. And there's a nice cross-selling synergy, if you will, to that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","This is Rohit Seth in for Keith Hughes. Karl, this question is for you. We're looking at the sales trends for U.S. springs down to international springs up for furniture components. So there's a divergence of trends there, can you provide any additional color on what's driving that divergence there?","Karl G. Glassman","You know that the -- let's go through a little bit of a walk that -- I think I'll get this question later anyway. So if you'll give me just a second, I'll give you the U.S. spring walk and then comments on the other markets and how it differs. The innerspring units, as we reported, were down 4% in the quarter. The trend by month was July, down 2%; August, down 4%; September, down 5%. Boxspring units, conversely, were up 8% for the quarter. Some of that was impacted by a significant growth by Simmons. In March of this year, Simmons started to take some really pretty significant share and grow their position which, as you probably know, we enjoy all of Simmons' open coil business but they self-produce their pocketed coils. We do have all of their boxspring business. So as they have grown that, that is part of the reason our boxspring volume has grown significantly. They have taken some business from some of the smaller manufacturers. Simmons offering a better product quality in terms of using a metal base boxspring instead of a more promotionally priced wood foundation, that's a good switch to us. Also, what's driving boxsprings is around the major holidays, the 3 large producers, they've all engaged in free boxspring promotions. So that's driving some consumption. I'll also digress for just a second, and I know a question that I'm going to get is how does this all compare to the ISPA statistics. ISPA is showing through August that sales of mattress units were up 1.4%, up 3% over the last 3 months. We expect that there will be a -- at the end of the year, true up, while ISPA does really a good job of aggregating the data that they're given in their monthly vetting barometers. Last year, earlier this year, for 2012, there was an adjustment because of the reporters taking business from the non-reporters. We expect that, that will happen again for this calendar year. All that said, is we believe the industry is flat to possibly negative in units so far this year. Another thing that I want to say, and this tends to maybe sound a little defensive, but we're proud of this, in that innersprings are certainly gaining share from alternative sleep. When ISPA launches their September numbers, they'll give the actual third quarter trend and that will be the fourth quarter in a row that innerspring is taking away from specialty. Some of that driven by the consumption of the growth of Hybrid innersprings, which correlates to that Comfort Core number that we gave you with units being up 12%. The trend there was July, up 6%; August, up 14%; September, up 15%. October will be stronger than September. From an October trend standpoint in innerspring units, they're up 5%. Boxspring units are 12 through the first 3 weeks. It's a little bit odd for us in that the last 2 weeks of September, the trend was innerspring units were down 15%. That probably was an outlier. We picked some of that up in October, we're not real sure why that happened. We don't know if it was window dressing. We just don't know. It was an unusual activity, which had a negative impact on our consolidated third quarter numbers. As it relates to the rest of the segment, demand in Europe has been stronger than most people would expect. We're gaining share. Innerspring units actually in Europe were up 20%. We're seeing some recovery of growth in South America. On the furniture side to the rest of your question, the trends there -- the third quarter in furniture was really pretty strong. We expect that. That's their seasonal strength. Today, business in furniture continues to be reasonably good. Probably not as strong as the third quarter, but probably slightly stronger than last year. And I apologize for the rambling answer. But I took advantage of your question to answer some others that I'm sure will come.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I guess, since Joe is there, let's just kind of concentrate on the industrial. And you answered a little bit of the question on the new acquisition. And I hope, David, you can find more acquisitions with -- where you purchase the assets below fair market value.","David S. Haffner","I do, too, Budd.","Karl G. Glassman","And I'll pile on only if they perform in the future.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","But the question is, if you look into 2 different margin profiles of the business coming out of sterling and the other self-production that you do and trade sales versus the tubing business, which has got a higher margin profile, looks like, if I peg it right that the margin in the -- for self-production side, it's somewhere between 5% and 6%. Is -- first of all, is that -- am I somewhere near right, right now? And the second question is, where does that go, for Joe, in the near-term and maybe over the intermediate term?","Susan R. McCoy","I don't know that I have that broken down between the sort of legacy industrial business versus the aerospace business. Remember, aerospace, currently with the recent acquisition, is on $120 million revenue run rate. We won't have all those revenues obviously in place this year.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes, I adjusted for that, Susan.","Susan R. McCoy","Yes. I mean, this year's EBIT margins will be between 8%, 9% in the segment. Overall, I would suspect that the legacy part of that is going to be a little higher than what you backed into.","Karl G. Glassman","Budd it's fair. I mean, relatively speaking, Budd. As you would expect, the aerospace tubing product line is meaningfully more profitable. The contribution associated with it on a margin basis is meaningfully higher than it is of the mechanical tubing, which is the legacy tubing that Susan is talking about. While we don't give the margins out, relatively speaking, it's meaningfully higher.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. I understand that. And it looks like the spread at least has -- between the cost of scrap and rod has come in over the last year fairly substantially. What's the outlook for that? I guess that's the other way of asking that same question.","Joseph D. Downes","Budd, this is Joe. Right now, there is a significant overcapacity, both in the U.S., as well as worldwide, in the steel industry. And that's going to keep margins under pressure into the future. All of the rationalization and the benefits realized from what the steel industry did in the early 2000s, as you might expect, as margins improved, everybody started investing. Most of the new steel mills have come in Asia, but there is an overhang of excess capacity. I do believe that will keep pressure on margins in general, probably for some time into the future.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And that overcapacity, Joe, is in long product in the rod?","Joseph D. Downes","I don't know that it has been identified that way, just a number of the analysts that follow the industry very close estimate right now, that there's about 2.1 billion tons of production capacity in the world. Estimated maybe 850 million, 850 million of that is in China. And the consumption rate today is about 1.5 million. Now normally, you can think in terms of the loan products being a very small portion of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Herb Hardt with Monness, Crespi, Hardt.","Herbert Hardt - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","In regards the acquisition in France. Most companies I've talked to are trying to get out of France with significant labor problems, et cetera. And I'm curious as to the vetting process as to how you view this.","Joseph D. Downes","Herb, this is Joe, again. I would probably echo what a lot of the other people would've echoed from other companies regarding France. But our people did convince us that this was a good fit, it was something that was a natural extension of what we were already doing and having the welded tubing here, this extended us into seamless. We spent quite a bit of time on the due diligence of these businesses and a lot of that was spent on the HR aspect of it, and they do have a good relationship with their union there. And we felt like after doing our due diligence, we felt like it was the proper thing to do and we expanded -- now we expanded into France. I will tell you, it was kind of interesting and this is something we learned, it took a -- the French government approval of this acquisition because specialty tubes does a small amount of business with the French in the defense industry in France. And we were delayed with the closing by about 6 weeks. We finally closed it, the 31st of July and they immediately were taking 3 weeks vacation in the month of August. So that's quite an adjustment for us in the third quarter. They have 9 works worth of ownership and expenses and only 5 weeks -- that's just poor timing that we couldn't overcome.","David S. Haffner","It's Dave. As you might expect, we use different discount rates when we establish enterprise valuations based upon the territory of the operation and many other variables. But the discount rate that we use, certainly was one of the reasons that we're able to purchase those assets at the level we purchased them.","Matthew C. Flanigan","Yes. Herb, this is Matt. I'd just had one other comment that last year, when we bought Western, which we again, continue to feel really good about, it has exceeded our expectations and it was something in the neighborhood almost of $190 million investment as you recall. This investment in France starting out of the gate is less than $15 million of cash investment.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Dillard Watt with Stifel.","Dillard Watt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to see if you might be able to elaborate a little bit on -- any of the commentary on a possible divestiture in CVP. And what else may you be thinking, the fact that results of have been a little bit more difficult. Is that making things a little bit harder in terms of finding a buyer? Just any kind of color you can give will be great.","David S. Haffner","Dillard, I'll start and then if Karl want to comment, he's certainly welcome. We have been negotiating with one particular entity. There was a broader array of interest to begin with. But we've limited our discussion and negotiation with one particular entity to this point. We haven't decided finally, whether we're going to sell this. We're still in that negotiation, so it's important to send that signal out there. And to your point, yes, when a business fails to meet expectations, it's harder to negotiate price than if it went the other way. So it's obviously, a benefit that we would have if the business was outperforming as opposed to underperforming. However, saying that, we continue to seriously consider the divestiture, and we will do so only at a level that we feel is in the best interest of our shareholders. Other parts of our portfolio, we continue to look at them, Karl, and the operators look at them very critically, every year. And any time we see an underperforming part of our business, we will give serious consideration to changing it's position in the portfolio if need be. Karl or...","Karl G. Glassman","The only thing that I would add, Dillard, I think it's important to remember on CVP that the second quarter sales were abnormally strong. So that business is a cyclical business. And the third quarter was really indicative, as we said, of a pull forward into the second, that we continue to enjoy very strong customer relationships. That business is a solid business going forward, it's just a challenge from a cyclicality perspective.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question from Josh Borstein with Longbow Research.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","Just a quick follow-up on the CVP, it was down 30%. You said you mentioned a fleet operator that pulled back due to macro concerns. Was that in your estimation due to the government shutdown? And has that fleet operator since resumed spending?","David S. Haffner","Well, Josh, I don't know why they pulled. It wasn't a specific operator. It was kind of a macro industry issue. And why they pulled back, I can't tell you. Their forecast across the board shows some continued weakness in the fourth quarter with some recovery in the first. So we just don't know. It's a good question.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then, Karl, I know you gave us a lot of detail on the spring business, and I appreciate that. I just want to go over some numbers, just to make sure I have them right. For the U.S. spring, July, August and September was down 2%, down 4%, down 5% in September but the last 2 weeks of September you mentioned were down 15%, is that correct?","Karl G. Glassman","That's correct.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then October, was up 5%?","Karl G. Glassman","Yes, so far, yes. And then's through -- obviously through 3 shipping weeks.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And did you also break up the Comfort Core as well?","Karl G. Glassman","Yes, I did. It was up 6%, up 14% and up 15%. And based on the October shipments to date, I would expect that we'll beat that September 15% growth rate. The Comfort Core placements continue to grow pretty significantly.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So it sounds like the way the spring business played out was a little different from the way the adjustable foundation played out over the quarter. Is that fair to say?","Karl G. Glassman","Absolutely. We're not real sure on that. The last few weeks of September falling off like that, that is really an outlier over any of our historic analysis. It was unexpected. So we don't know if it was in consumer-driven demand weakness or if it was just customers optimizing inventory, because they did recover pretty strongly in those first couple weeks of October, as I said.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","And you didn't see that same drop off in the last 2 weeks in the adjustable business though?","Karl G. Glassman","No, we didn't.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","And then just last. If you try to factor out the popularity in Hybrid mattresses, is -- the comment you made that innerspring is taking share from specialty. If you factor out Hybrid, do you think that comment is still true?","Karl G. Glassman","Well, I haven't analyzed it at that level, Josh. I -- and this is speculation, which is a little dangerous. I believe that it probably is, because there is growth around some of the promotional price points. It seems like in the early days of the economic recovery, there was really strong demand at the ultra premium price points. And ultra premium, we define as above $2,000 in queen. There's weakness around all those price points now. It feels like even the Hybrid strength is in the $1,200 to $1,500 range, but it feels like if there is more promotional sub-$1,000 strength this year than there had been previously. Though it's difficult to rationalize all those mix shifts. But we're reasonably comfortable with the promotional price points.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question from Daniel Moore with CJS Securities.","Daniel Moore - CJS Securities, Inc.","Turning to the balance sheet. You've been running obviously, below your net leverage target levels for a quarter or 2 now. Absent further or larger acquisition opportunities, would you look to accelerate share repurchases? Or do you see more of these smaller tuck-ins on the intermediate horizon?","Matthew C. Flanigan","This is Matt. I think right now, and Dave can talk about -- comment on the pipeline from an M&A perspective. But it appears that it's relatively low right now. So yes, in keeping with our priorities of cash, I think you should anticipate that as we generate the excess cash flow that we've been predicting, $350 million of total operating cash for 2013 and frankly, there's a bias even from that number, I believe it's up right now. I think you would see us buy more stock here, as we look forward and we have in the last quarter or 2 based upon our predicted uses for that cash, otherwise, which right now are relatively modest as best we can tell.","Operator","Mr. DeSonier, we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.","David M. DeSonier","We'll just quickly say thank you for listening, and we'll talk to you again next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer-session will follow the formal presentation [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Susan McCoy, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. McCoy, you may begin.","Susan McCoy","Good morning. And thank you for taking part in Leggett & Platt's first quarter conference call. With me today are Karl Glassman, President and CEO; Matt Flanigan, Executive Vice President and CFO; Perry Davis, who is EVP and President of both the Residential and Industrial Segments; Mitch Dolloff, EVP and President of the Furniture Products and Specialized Products Segment; Dave DeSonier, Senior Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations; and Wendy Watson, our Director of Investor Relations.","The agenda for our call this morning is as follows. Karl Glassman will start with a summary of the major statements we made in yesterday\u2019s press release. Matt Flanigan, will then discuss financial details and our outlook for 2018; and finally, the Group will answer any questions that you have.","This conference call is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material. This call may not be transcribed, recorded, or broadcast without our expressed permission. A replay is available from the IR portion of Leggett\u2019s website. We posted to the Investor Relations portion of the website yesterday\u2019s press release and a set of PowerPoint slides that contain summary financial information along with segment details.

And thank you for participating in our first quarter call. Before I begin my prepared remarks, I want to thank Dave DeSonier for his years of service to Leggett and our investors. This is Dave\u2019s last conference call. As he winds down through his year-end retirement, Dave will be focusing almost exclusively on strategic planning.","Dave joined Leggett in early 2000. He organized our first investor call and has done an outstanding job of facilitating our investor relations communication and transparency. Thank you, Dave.","We are very pleased with our start to 2018. As we reported yesterday, first quarter sales increased 7% to $1.029 billion. Organic sales grew 6% primarily through raw material related price increases and positive currency impact. Volume grew 1% with strength in Automotive and Adjustable Bed largely offset by soft demand in several other businesses.","Acquisitions also added 2% to sales growth, partially offset by prior year divestitures. First quarter earnings per share were $0.57, down 8% from $0.62 in the first quarter last year primarily from higher raw material costs. EBIT and EBIT margin declined due to the pricing lag we experienced with passing along commodity inflation. To reflect this continued steel inflation we are raising our 2018 sales guidance to $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion and lowering our full-year EPS guidance to $2.60 to $2.80. Matt will discuss guidance in more detail later in the call.","We are encouraged about the remainder of 2018 as Automotive and Adjustable Bed continue to strongly outperform their markets. Work Furniture is making impressive gains in collaborative soft seating and several factors should contribute to growth in our Bedding business. In the US, we are benefiting from market share gains with both traditional and direct to consumer mattress producers, and increased content in more of the mattresses our customers produce.","Comfort Core units continued to growth as a percentage of total innerspring units and more customers are adding Quantum Edge perimeter springs to their innersprings. In the first quarter of 2018 over 35% of our Comfort Core units included Quantum Edge. We expect this growth to continue as mattresses with Comfort Core and Quantum Edge are preferred by consumers, articulate better in adjustable beds and streamline production for our customers.","As expected, margins declined in the first quarter from continuing steel inflation. Steel costs increased in late 2017 have further accelerated here to date and are expected to go up again in May. We are able to pass these increases onto our customers after an approximate 90-day lag in the majority of our businesses. However, since inflation has continued we now expect margin compression into the second quarter. Assuming costs stabilize margins should improve in the second half of the year.","On the subject of steel, we are frequently asked how the recently announced Section 232 steel tariffs and other duties on steel rod are affecting our operations. Depending on the type of steel input, we are seeing varying degrees of inflation in the US. Long product, the steel industry term for rod and wire, which are the steel products we produce at our rod and wire mills is up 20% since the end of 2017.","Flat product, cold rolled sheet steel, which we purchase for use in several of our businesses but most heavily in Home Furniture is up 20% to 30% since the end of 2017. The majority of our steel costs are in our long product and flow through our industrial products segment and into our other businesses, where we internally consume about two-thirds of the wire we produce. As I mentioned, we are able to pass along these steel cost increases to our customers subject to the pricing lag.","However, we have less ability to fully pass through steel inflation in our home furniture business, especially as our competitors produce their products in China, where steel costs are lower. Given the recent increases in flat steel cost in the US we are responding by reducing our cost structure and moving additional production to our Chinese operations to take advantage of the lower input cost.","As a reminder, from last quarter's conference call I am no longer giving segment narrative since those results are detailed in yesterday's press release and the slide deck we post on the investor relations website. We will be happy to discuss any questions you have relating to the segments during the Q&A at the end of the call.","I will now turn the call over to Matt.","Matt Flanigan","Thanks Karl, and good morning everyone. Cash from operations was $44 million in the first quarter, which is in-line with our normal seasonality and reflects increased working capital investment supporting higher sales and inflation. We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales at 12%.","We now expect our full-year operating cash to approximate $450 million. Capital expenditures should approximate $160 million and dividends should require about $195 million of cash for the year. Our top priorities for use of cash remain organic growth, dividends, and strategic acquisitions. After funding these priorities, if there is cash still available we generally intend to repurchase stock.","Our financial base remains very strong. We entered the quarter with net debt to net capital of 37.8% within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40% reflecting working capital investment, first quarter stock repurchases and increased acquisition activity. We also monitor debt-to-EBITDA and entered the quarter with debt at 2.4 times our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA.","As Karl mentioned we are raising our full-year sales guidance to $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion, up 9% to 12% versus 2017. We expect mid single-digit volume growth from strength in Automotive, Bedding, Adjustable Bed, Work Furniture, Aerospace and Geo Components. Raw material related price increases in increases and currency impact should also add to sales growth. The PHC acquisition completed in January in our new hydraulic cylinders business unit is expected to add 2% to sales growth.","However, we are lowering our full-year earnings per share guidance a nickel to a range of $2.60 to $2.80 per share, largely due to the impact of ongoing steel cost inflation. Based upon this guidance range, we anticipate our 2018 full year EBIT margin to be between 11.5% to 12%. This guidance also assumes an approximate 22% full year tax rate. Lastly, on January 1 of this year we adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard ASC 606, using the modified retrospective method.","This new standard did not materially impact our first quarter results and we do not expect it to have any ongoing material impact on our sales, net earnings, balance sheet or cash flows.","With those comments, I will turn the call back over to Susan.","Susan McCoy","That concludes our prepared remarks. We thank you for your attention and we will be glad to answer your questions. In order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate, we request that you ask only one question and then yield to the next participant. If you have additional questions you are welcome to reenter the queue and we will answer those questions as well.","Michelle, we are ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Susan Maklari","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. ","Susan McCoy","Hi, Susan.","Karl Glassman","Hi, Susan.","Susan Maklari","My first question is around the pricing, and sort of I know that you started to put some of this through in the third quarter of last year just given the inflation that we started to see, but can you give us some sense of where you are in terms of the price increases, maybe across the different businesses, and just some idea of how we should expect that to flow through as we think about that upcoming quarters?","Karl Glassman","Hi, Susan. I will take a swing. This is Karl. I will take a swing at it at the high-level and ask Perry and Mitch to weigh in on specific product categories. But basically what happened is first off, you are correct that we saw steel related inflation in 3Q of last year, passed through in 4Q. Steel was relatively flat in October and November and then we saw a significant spike in December.","That is why on our last call in February we guided folks to understand that we were going to have some margin weakness in 1Q of this year. Some of the analysts heeded to that advice; some of them didn't. But anyway, we have since passed through the inflation that we experienced in 4Q successfully in virtually every business. Mitch will talk about Home Furniture in some detail, but the timing is that has recovered.","What we didn't anticipate when we gave full-year guidance was the significant run of steel inflation that we have experienced in February and March on into April, scrap-based and ultimately into product. We are in the process of passing through that inflation. It will be in place by July 15 as at its latest. That is assuming that we don't have another round of inflation. Right now we expect some steel stability that we expect scrap to trade about sideways in May. We have seen the flat and long selling prices stabilize. We are seeing some continued increase in rod, but the amount of increases are slowing. So our current guidance is based on a forecast that we are seeing some stability in steel, which would be a very good thing for us to finally catch up in July.","That is really why we are showing that strong forecast in the back half. Now there is some probability we will see another round. If in fact we do, it will increase our LIFO forecast. We will have significant FIFO gains. Our steel mill does extremely well in this type of environment. And I'm going to compliment our employees that are listening to this call. Passing through inflation is difficult. Our people are really, really good at it. And anybody that doubts that has been proven wrong historically.","So we just need some stability in our cost structure. But either Perry or Mitch, either one of you had anything to add?","A - Mitch Dolloff","Okay. Maybe I should comment a little bit around Home Furniture. I think it is a slightly different dynamic than we have on the Bedding side, where we really don't have a contractual basis to pass the price increases along. So, we did experience the inflation at the end of last year but didn't have a whole lot of luck passing that through due to the situation with falling steel prices in Asia. This year, we have made some progress in pushing through price increases, but we have not fully recovered.","We will continue to aggressively pursue those price increases both in the US and in China, where necessary and in the long term we will not maintain unprofitable business.","That being said there are some things that we can do to help ourselves, we can effectively - as you probably all know we have manufacturing assets both in China and in the US and we are working hard to manage our global footprint to optimize the steel, labor and transportation costs over the long run.","So, we expect that overtime will be flexing our production capacity in the US and China as circumstances vary. But right now, these factors shift towards us producing more products in China.","Beyond that, we\u2019re also aggressively looking at our structure and approach to reduce overhead and operating costs. We are making good progress there when we think that will have some more or so. That also puts us in a position if things grant us as we think that the back of the half of the year for home furniture will be stronger from the profitability standpoint that we\u2019ll experience in the first half.","Perry Davis","Susan, I\u2019ll just echo, this is Perry. I\u2019ll just echo Karl\u2019s comment with regards to rod and wire increases; we do anticipate further increase in May. But as Karl said the rate is slowing, it appears that we may be nearing the inflection point there. If that is the case, both of those programmatic formulae increases and for the industry in general, we expect to have our pricing caught up with that inflation by early July.","Susan Maklari","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And, then I just wanted to get a little bit more color on the bedding side. It sounds like overall maybe units are a little soft, but you\u2019re definitely continuing to gain some share with the Comfort Core product and the Quantum Edge. So, can you just give us a sense of what\u2019s going on in the end markets there, I know that there has been a lot of moment and then maybe just some sense of what means for you?","Perry Davis","Yes, definitely. And, you\u2019re right, the first part of the year January started off extremely slow and now there are a lot of factors and it\u2019s changing out the product lines, we had some terrible weather conditions in certain areas that probably hampered shopping and those kind of continued on through February.","But we\u2019ve seen a pickup in the latter part of the quarter. And, then if you - Karl and I did some checking yesterday as to April, we have three complete weeks to look at and the US business through the first three weeks, we are up about 4%. So, if that trends holds and we don\u2019t see any reason why it wouldn\u2019t and April is traditionally not a strong month in the US bedding market. But there seems to be some lengths to this now. I don\u2019t think I have ever seen a time after a January market where our customers had been able to floor their products any quicker. So, a lot of the floors already set, there\u2019s still some work to do on others. But it\u2019s important that they have all those components in place by Memorial Day, a traditional selling season. And, they looked to be kind of well ahead in the curve compared to in past years.","We are pleased with Comfort Core and with Quantum Edge. Those gains I suspect will continue to increase as Karl said in the opening remarks, we are about 35% penetrated in the Comfort Core category with Quantum Edge. I suspect that as we run along through the course of this year, we will go past 40% with those content gains.","And, then one other area, in looking at the innersprings that we produced for upholstery layers, let\u2019s call it generically our nano products. We are seeing great penetration there and year-on-year those products are up about 60%. So, we are seeing increased interest in using coils in place of other kind of exotic filling components whether that would be latex or types of visco elastic or other products that are used in the comfort layer of mattresses. So, we are excited about that too. That product category, while still relatively small, will begin to become meaningful for us and the rate of growth is outstanding.","Karl Glassman","To follow on just a little bit there that when Perry gave you the April statistics, those were same day, so we had an extra shipping day in April. So, he\u2019s neutralized that out, so that same day unit growth based on the delta that we saw in the first quarter. So, we had three down in units if we look at just innerspring dollars, we were up 7% in innerspring dollars a tribute to the content gains and to inflation. So, roughly that 7% growth in units will probably with continued inflation look like something 12%, 13%, maybe even 14% in dollars, so it\u2019s significant.","Susan Maklari","Okay. And, then can one of you just remind us of the comps that you\u2019re going to come up against in the bedding space as we go through second and third quarter just given some of the sort of changes that happened this time last year?","Karl Glassman","Yes, I\u2019ve got it right here Perry. Innerspring units in 2Q of last year were down 8%. That was the time of most significant market disruption over the whole Mattress Firm [temper issue], 3Q down 3%, 4Q down 2%. So, the comps admittedly in the second quarter relatively easy. I\u2019m absolutely convinced you will see positive units from us this year.","Susan Maklari","Okay. And, then one last question and then I\u2019ll give someone else the chance. As you sort of look across Leggett and you think about all the different end markets that you touch and that you\u2019re in, what are you seeing broadly in terms of maybe more of the consumer products relative to some of your industrial products, can you just give us some high level sense of sort of your touch on things?","Karl Glassman","Yes, Susan, thanks for that question. And, I apologize, this answer is going to take a few seconds - minutes actually. But when we look back at the first quarter, I know that the analysts have all written that we missed the first quarter, I beg to differ, I think we exceeded the first quarter. As a matter of fact, our internal forecast was $0.57 of EPS. We reported $0.57 had $0.03 of LIFO, we didn\u2019t expect plus admittedly we had $0.02 of tax benefit that we didn\u2019t expect, so neutralized on the $0.58. That\u2019s somewhat remarkable in an environment where we only have 1% unit growth.","And, I think that\u2019s the route of your question that it\u2019s a testimony to our pricing power first off, but if you aggregate 3Q and 4Q last year, we had about 4.5% volume growth. Some of Perry\u2019s commentary on 1Q, I believe weather was a significant issue and our construction related businesses, foreign products, which is carpet cushion and Geo Components, we saw really softness in January that\u2019s atypical. And, then in the residential related businesses, Perry said, we saw softness in bedding, certainly saw some related softness in our fabric business that sells into bedding and home furniture, home furniture demand was soft, consumer products were soft. Adjustable bed growth was significant at 22%, probably would have been better than that in a different weather environment.","So, the fed released the retail sale statistics and they were admittedly softened in the first quarter. So, we think that 1% were really comfortable that we\u2019re through the worst of it. I believe our guidance is all around mid single digit unit growth, we are comfortable with that prediction based on what we saw on the back half of last year and what we have seen in April, business is much, much better.","So, as we kind of go around all those product categories, their strength in every one of them from a unit perspective. The only bit of weakness would be in home furniture and it goes to this transition that Mitch spoke to and frankly our lack of doing business where we can\u2019t make an acceptable return. We\u2019re appropriately optimistic is that very short answer, shorter with what I said with that final comment and I\u2019m sorry for all of that. But I had to take the opening Susan.","Susan Maklari","No, no, that\u2019s incredibly helpful and that\u2019s exactly what I was going to. So, thank you very much for the color. And, good luck.","Karl Glassman","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Budd Bugatch with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Budd Bugatch","Good morning, it is Budd for Bobby on this call.","Karl Glassman","Hey Budd before we go any further everybody in the room wants to wish you a Happy Birthday. So, Happy Birthday, Budd.","Budd Bugatch","Thank you very, very much. I can\u2019t remember how many there are or have been.","Karl Glassman","It\u2019s a big number. It\u2019s been significantly larger than our first quarter EPS but go ahead.","Budd Bugatch","I appreciate that. Karl, I want to go to the second part of the sentence in the first paragraph of the release regarding bedding where you - you expect the market improvement as 2008 progresses. And, I want to drill down to a couple of barriers about, how are you defining the market and I know you gave us some read on April, but why would the market improve overall and as I said how are you defining the \u201cmarket\u201d?","Karl Glassman","The market in that sense is meant to be the domestic market, which most of the investors are most sensitive to. We expect continued robust strength globally. But so it is the domestic bedding market and it\u2019s really what we are seeing in April and what we are hearing from our customers both at the OEM manufacturing and at retail, it\u2019s the lack of disruption that will have from Mattress Firm temper issue. So, the answer to Susan\u2019s question, the comps are relatively easy. So, the placement Perry made reference to this, it\u2019s a placement of new products and the enthusiasm around those product launches, we expect that there will be much more robust advertising spend, it\u2019s what we are hearing from both the manufacturers and the retailers. So, we are generally feeling just better about things, but Perry do you\u2026?","Perry Davis","Yes, I mean, the other part of the market, but you may have in mind too is the box bed category. We\u2019re really optimistic there for a variety of reasons. But we got, in some instances, relatively large players in that market that are making switches over to Comfort Core innersprings, we have other players who are maintaining their current product categories in the marketplace, but they are looking strongly and adding additional lines and we are having conversations with lot of those folks with regards to hybrid offerings that they want to build their lines with.","So, that\u2019s an area where although that still doesn\u2019t represent a huge portion of the market, it is growing obviously and it\u2019s an important part as a market for us. The first folks to play there were primarily the foam people. And, now we are seeing that market more closely mirror or begin to look like the market in general where there is a preference for innerspring. So, we think overtime that will change significantly and we obviously want to be a big player in that market. Quantum Edge and those edge enhanced type products where they come out of the packaging and the edge is something that is demonstrable to the consumer. It\u2019s a true feature benefit for the consumer, and it\u2019s custom-made for that type of product, so we are excited about that.","Budd Bugatch","I did have in mind the domestic market, but I was trying to see whether the market you are referring to as the market as maybe the defined by Espoo or something different and looking at that overall domestic markets and how do you look - how you\u2019re looking at that?","Karl Glassman","It\u2019s total market Budd.","Budd Bugatch","So, that would be 28 million units, is that the way we think about the market?","Karl Glassman","Yes, I think that\u2019s a good number, 28, 29. It\u2019s difficult to define the total market at this point. No real good data on domestic bed in the box, better data on imported mattresses. The imported mattresses continuing to gain share probably now greater than 20% of units, so aggregate everything together and we\u2019re in that 28 million, 29 million units.","Budd Bugatch","Okay. And, last from me just you talked about adjustable beds and also automotive has been still continued strong. Are we always worry that when you have some areas that are performing as consistently and strong as they have that there may be some a down trend coming, how do we get comfort that\u2019s not the case?","Mitch Dolloff","Hi Budd, this is Mitch. To comment on automotive first. So, we were up 7% in the first quarter year-over-year which we feel very good about when we look at the overall market, while our goal of 1,000 basis points above the market is sort of our long term goal and don\u2019t really want to comment on quarter-to-quarter. I think if you look at the first quarter for the overall market, you see production actually down a bit for the major markets and the market has a whole maybe 1% or 2%. So, we feel like 7% is very strong and also you\u2019ll know that we recall that we have really good visibility about our sales in the out years based on our programs.","So, we won over $300 million in new programs last year, continue to be very strong there. So, our outlook both for this year and for the coming years tells us that we can continue to make our 1,000 basis points above the market target. So, that\u2019s on automotive, we feel still strong there.","Adjustable bed has just been going great. Really strong Q3, Q4 last year, continued in the Q1. Our business with our major customer continues to be strong in the first quarter and we are ramping up capacity to help us serve them for the remainder of the year. So, we don\u2019t see negative headwinds there either. So, we feel really good about both of those businesses going forward.","Budd Bugatch","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Hughes with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. A couple of questions on organic growth, your guidance assumes mid single digits, does that include volume from PHC acquisition?","Susan McCoy","No, keep that separate.","Keith Hughes","That\u2019s organic. So, you did 1% first. So, this is a pretty big ramp, I know you\u2019re bullish auto and adjustables, other businesses are going to have to pickup to get to this estimate, what if you can kind of rank order, what do you think will start to accelerate in order of magnitude?","Karl Glassman","Certainly domestic bedding continued growth in international spring had a little bit of soft first quarter after a really, really strong last couple of years. We expect resurgence of growth there most of that little bit of softness was in Latin America had since reversed. We certainly expect that we are not going to have weather events. Yes, I mean, GEO components was really soft in the first quarter, that business has been growing at significantly greater than single digits. Carpet cushion is regrowing. Though it\u2019s just more robustness in those markets, we don\u2019t see anything fundamentally different in 2018 than we saw from a unit perspective in 2017, and we had 4% unit growth in 2017 even with the disruption that we experienced in the bedding industry.","Keith Hughes","Okay. And then just switching back to steel real quick, looks like scrap, I think you mentioned, looks like scrap has kind of going down little flat down maybe it\u2019s the better word in the last sort of month or so. How are the spreads been running in the last month and the next couple of months, are they at normal, are they widening, how is that winding out?","Perry Davis","Keith, this is Perry. They\u2019re widening, there is a lot of factors that play right now in the marketplace with regards to some of the tariffs that were put on latter part of last year and early part of this year have constrained the importation of long products. And, so that has enabled some of the domestic producers to pick up the slack there, increase their productive capacity and its put some constraints, there has been a good demand environment for those products.","So, the pricing power in a marketplace for rod right now is relatively strong and we\u2019ve seen some pretty hefty increase as Karl said since the first half of the year, all products up around 20%. Keith I would add just going back briefly on Geo Components which is a growing business for us obviously, it\u2019s a business that is seasonal, its weather dependent.","We really had a rough go with January and February due to weather there. We sustained through all that good backlogs, we kind of have some vision into as those programs - not programs, but projects rollout. And, we saw the volume there with improvement, the weather situation in March really picked up tremendously and that\u2019s holding now so much so our guys that are running that business unit are resolute in their conviction that the business volumes that we plan for and our strategic plans throughout the year they\u2019re going to be attained.","And, so we believe that backlog is just delayed and that demand is in fact truly pent-up demand that will shift as we go forward, so that has improved our - obviously our dollar volume, but the number of products that we are able to get out of the door.","Keith Hughes","And, so if you look at margins in the second quarter of company-wide and you say there is going to be compression. Do you think there will be less standard and less compression in the second versus the first?","Susan McCoy","Similar about, Keith. And, to get back to the full year that would indicate meaningful implements in both the third and fourth quarter.","Keith Hughes","So, there\u2019s rolling so much pricing, I\u2019m little surprised at the margin compression, I understand why, but it wouldn\u2019t last of somewhat going into the second, is there any things going on in the second that is kind of urgent?","Susan McCoy","No, that similar comment and you can apply a range to that too and maybe there\u2019s a little bit of an improvement, no, no is the answer.","Keith Hughes","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Moore with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Moore","Thank you and good morning. I wanted to maybe just touch a little bit on the PHC acquisition, talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing since the close and what your outlook is for organic growth and the revenue or cost synergies expected?","Mitch Dolloff","Daniel, this is Mitch. So, PHC has performed really well in the couple of months that we\u2019ve had them. Their sales are up year-over-year. And, we see really strong demand both in Northern American and in Europe in the current coming period. So, we feel very good about that. We see opportunities - for continued organic growth in the primary market material handling, particularly looking to perhaps get reductive capacity in place in China where lots of our large customers also produce product, so that\u2019s an opportunity that we think we can help them with.","And, then we\u2019re also very active in looking in add on acquisitions that would help out our footprint and our capabilities. As I mentioned, the PCH is strongly focused on the material handling side, we think there\u2019s opportunities in the adjacent markets around construction application, so we will participate in PCH today that where we could get a stronger - stronger our position. So, a couple of months in we feel very good about that acquisition.","Daniel Moore","That\u2019s helpful. And, switching gears the Quantum Edge, the 35% today of Comfort Core units going to 40% potentially, where do you see that going longer term?","Karl Glassman","Yes, Daniel, this is a good question. I at one time didn\u2019t think we would ever see 40%. So, you\u2019re probably asking the wrong guy. But I believe that within the next year we could see mid 40s somewhere in that range, that maybe a little optimistic, I\u2019m not totally sure. Longer term it just makes so much sense from a lot of different perspectives for our customers, it\u2019s a simplified product to build, it requires them to keep fewer SKUs and less working capital in their plans when they have to deal with all of the firm, for firm encasement. So, the economic from a holistically standpoint are good for our customers. So, I think we\u2019ll continue to see that build right on through this year. And, from there I don\u2019t know if it will ever get in the upper 40s or not, probably he has opinion of his own there, but I think mid 40s is attainable.","Daniel Moore","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Last one for me. Capital allocation obviously remained committed to being very balanced, in terms of your TSR given the longer term track record of outperforming the S&P, it seemed to be based on where the stock is as good as an investment a stronger return, would be maybe being a little bit more aggressive and pulling that lever on share repurchases, any thoughts there? Thanks.","Matt Flanigan","Yes Daniel, this is Matt. As you know we won a million too in the first quarter and we mentioned in the release yesterday that we expect by between 2 and 3 during the rest of this year, certainly the protocol to talk about the M&A pipeline is looking like as you know that\u2019s part of our priorities for cash. Mitch just represented with PHC related opportunities that might appear or not too distant future, we don\u2019t quite know. And, we are certainly mindful of where the equities trading and we don\u2019t live in a vacuum. But right now what we put in the press release is certainly our expectation that during the year will buy between 2 million and 3 million shares and do it prudently.","Daniel Moore","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Peter Keith","Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just another question for Matt, the cash flow is taken down by about 10%. And, I noticed some puts and takes on margin in sales. Could you give us little more detail on what cause that overall reduction?","Matt Flanigan","Yes, Peter, good question. Really it\u2019s largely working capital investment story, we had a bit more working capital invested in the first quarter tied to the sales growth has certainly kind of inflation relationship to that as well. And, really that is the most difficult part of our cash flow profile predict as you know. So, we just thought it made sense as we have this inflation phenomenon roll into the second quarter that we might anticipate the normal working capital cycle investment for us to reflect a better estimate for full year operating cash at $450 million versus $500 million.","But I will tell you that at the end of the year, we were trading at about 11% working capital investment, all things considered all pieces of the puzzle. In the first quarter that moved up to 12% and certainly we\u2019re all dedicated to bringing that back in the 11% neighborhood and so we will do better than $450 million. But as a working assumption that was the better estimate at this point in time for the full year.","Peter Keith","Okay. Thank you. That is helpful. My second question would just be on the topic of Mattress Firm, so just from of our industry conversations. There are other suppliers not just firm that seemed increasingly nervous about their cash situation. And, I was wondering if you could provide an update on the status of that relationship if you\u2019ve been having the tight terms or do you have credit insurance in place on that receivable, any update on Mattress Firm right now would be helpful?","Matt Flanigan","Pete, this is Matt again. Certainly, the customer we\u2019ve enjoyed for a long, long time very aware of their situation, we don\u2019t comment specifically as you would imagine relative to whether we had credit insurance related to that account or other consideration, but I would just tell you very supportive of what they are trying to make happen as they compete in the spaces that they are in and we\u2019re also well aware of their credit profile and have had excellent conversations and interaction with them and monitor our payment trends, their payment practices and we feel we\u2019re certainly that - we\u2019re well positioned where we should be all things considered with that relationship.","Karl Glassman","And, Peter the only thing that I would add is, obvious we had a lot of conversation with their other suppliers, we know of Mattress Firm being nothing but current with every one of their vendors. So, current today doesn\u2019t mean that your current tomorrow, but they have absolutely paid every one of their invoices on time and taken every available discount. And, we believe that is not a Leggett only phenomenon.","Peter Keith","Okay, very good guys. Thanks so much and good luck with the rest of the year.","Karl Glassman","Thank you.","Susan McCoy","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Spencer Joyce with Hilliard Lyons. Please proceed with your question.","Spencer Joyce","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the call.","Susan McCoy","Hi Spencer.","Spencer Joyce","Many of my things have been addressed. So, I\u2019ll try to be fairly pointed here. Ford announced just this week they are discontinuing some of their sedans. And, I was wondering if there was any potential direct impact for Euros contract and maybe it\u2019s too small to matter, but do you sell through to them or perhaps is there a benefit from some of the companies that you do work with if your components aren\u2019t in those Ford cars, but any clarity there would be nice?","Mitch Dolloff","Okay. Hi Spencer, this is Mitch. Yes, I think that\u2019s a great question. I think that announcement just sort of echoes what\u2019s been happening in the industry anyway not only in North America, but around the world as we see everything smaller car production declining especially in North America, but crossovers and SUVs and trucks accelerating. So, we would be well represented in all of those product categories across all major OEMs. So, we might lose a little bit on the car side, but we are going to gain as much or more on the shift to truck and SUV production where those larger vehicles just have more content, so that\u2019s been a positive influence for us in recent history and they\u2019ll continue to be one going forward. For sure, we won\u2019t have that interruption or disruption as some of those vehicles changed. But I\u2019m not sure at this point how that will take place. I think that is maybe many current programs run out and then whether they\u2019re doing significant investment and refreshing those platforms. So, I don\u2019t think we see a sudden stop of production there. But either way we\u2019ll benefit, we believe more from that shift to larger platform.","Karl Glassman","And, Spencer, to follow on a little bit that you probably would have also seen that GM announced earlier this week that they\u2019re going to add a third shift in their facility in Spring Hill, Tennessee that produces SUVs both Cadillac and the GM nameplate. So, it\u2019s just augment to what Mitch is saying that vehicles are getting bigger, more content good for us.","Spencer Joyce","That\u2019s helpful. Perhaps one for Matt here, previous call we talked about working capital a little bit, but specifically account receivable were higher than, I expected kind of exiting the first quarter. And I think perhaps above what might have been implied historically. Can you discuss maybe one or two specific drivers of account receivables this quarter?","Matt Flanigan","Yes, Spencer good question. There really isn\u2019t a call out phenomenon on either are receivables DSL particularly and if you slide above DIO, our days of inventory are even our payables activity, now the three key pieces are working capital. They all three were a bit up compared to what we had seen at the end of the year. And, again there is an inflation element to that, I don\u2019t know three of the pieces. But at the end of the day, we really don\u2019t believe there is any payment trend or activities that are flashy red signals right now relative to that, but certainly at 12% investment and working capital, 1% higher than at 11%, you see more cash being used to facilitate them.","But I really do believe as all of us around the table believe, there should be kind of natural unwinding of that as we get more to a stable price environment as we go through the rest of the year, the ongoing heavy focused on DSL and collection efforts and inventory management and certainly making sure we\u2019re optimizing our payable activity as well. So, I don\u2019t really have a very specific two or three things to point to than you should try the model or anticipate just know that you should hold us accountable to working capital investment that\u2019s closer to 11% it is 12% as we entered the first quarter.","Spencer Joyce","That\u2019s helpful. And, final one from me here, should we expect any special charges for some of the shifts, China that you all referenced a couple of times on the call or would that perhaps be a CapEx line versus an operating line or even if it\u2019s operating, is there something we should think about looking for or would those be [indiscernible]?","Mitch Dolloff","This is Mitch again. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s anything material at this point, we are looking at everything, we are looking at personal, we are looking at facilities, so we may have some capital investment, we may have some consolidation, but I don\u2019t know what those are and probably be smaller facilities if we did anything. So, I don\u2019t think from a whole company perspective we see anything that would be material. Again don\u2019t have specific plan at this point, still doing the analysis, but a good part of that shift because we already have capacity in place in China, we can make that happen with maybe little bit of tooling and maybe a little bit of inventory investment, but not significant capital.","Spencer Joyce","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And, I actually bought a couch this quarter. So, my [peer is] out there.","Perry Davis","We appreciate your support.","Spencer Joyce","All right, I thought it was a good quarter. And, thanks for the questions.","Karl Glassman","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of John Baugh with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","John Baugh","Thank you, good morning. And, congrats Dave DeSonier, on your instrumental role in establishing Leggett as one the best IR team that I know of Corporate America, congratulations.","Karl Glassman","It\u2019s pretty easy. All I had to do was hire Susan.","John Baugh","Most of my questions have been asked. But I did want to touch on two things just to make sure, international bedding was little soft. You called that out. You\u2019re bullish on the year. Have you seen anything in your Steinhoff business around the globe, is it weakening, Karl or no, that\u2019s all pretty much on track?","Karl Glassman","No, we really haven\u2019t in either. We have exposure to them in bedding and furniture. From an operating perspective I think that they continue to just kind of progress, their issues are more back office corporate banking from a future basis, this one we haven\u2019t seen.","Perry Davis","Primarily in the UK and Europe very little, there are no disruption basically, same thing run kind of business as usual there. They do have some holdings in Australia obviously and some retail assets in Australia, not sure what their future plans with that. But we haven\u2019t seen any disruption.","John Baugh","Okay, great. And, then not to beat the dead horse on auto, so I don\u2019t cover auto. So, and obviously quarters can be lumpy, I think the last three quarters were in the 7% to 8% year-over-year and I know the Q1 last year was a really tough compare. But I guess the question Mitch is, when you look at forecast \u201818, \u201819, \u201820 in auto build, I don\u2019t even know what that is, so maybe you could share that view. And, then you comment on a 1,000 basis points where you commented on $300 million program wins. I have no sense of what\u2019s rolling off. I guess without getting the quarters projections, maybe give some color around how we get comfort that we are going to still see that roughly 1,000 basis points for in the future? Thank you.","Mitch Dolloff","Okay, great John. So, for sure if you look at \u201818 versus \u201817 or what happened in \u201817 started off the first half of the year really strong and then started to slide a little bit in the second quarter and then significantly in the third and fourth quarter particularly in North America. So, that does as you mentioned creates pretty tough comps for us in Q1 and Q2, we think that gets better in Q3 and Q4.","If you look at the long term forecast, so call it at \u201917 to \u201820, \u201821 kind of outlook, we would see for the major markets, CAGR of a little over 1%, call it 1.4%, 1.5%. And, for the globe, global market a little bit stronger maybe around 2%. The distinction for me the major markets North America, Europe, China, Japan, South Korea, much larger volume, much higher content, you have faster growth in the developing markets on a lower unit volume based and also lower content.","So, eventually benefit from that growth in the developing markets, but for sure the major markets have a bigger impact for us. And, what really bothers was significant disruption in North America last year, we look at the major markets, unit volumes was up around 1%, we see it for \u201818 forecast, we look at IHS production forecast is up a little bit from 1.2% to 1.4% and that\u2019s kind of the trend going forward. So, we talk about a 1,000 basis points about the market, we are looking at something like 11% to 12% on average over the long term.","So, you\u2019re right to mention that, we look at our program, but at the same time we have programs falling off, our rate of wins significantly exceeds the rate of programs falling off and that\u2019s what drives our confident to make this kind of prediction. I remember that we have good long term visibility, so when we\u2019re winning award production generally starts about two years after the win or survives in other programs and then the program technically last around six years. So, we think about it as the series of curves that sort of build that we have good visibility, what\u2019s coming off those occasionally surprises and what\u2019s coming on and that\u2019s been - how we run the business for the last several years. And, I think our track record shows that we\u2019ve been able to deliver this.","John Baugh","And, then thanks for all that color. My last question about getting of specifics margin levels, I\u2019m just interested in whether there is any delta going forward in both the automotive and aerospace margin profile. I know in aerospace you had a little bit softness there at 1 point, what is the margin profile in both of those segments going forward status quo?","A - Mitch Dolloff","I would say pretty close to status quo, we may have ups or downs, quarter-to-quarter depending upon program mix. But at this point I think the margin, I\u2019m thinking about automotive right now and pretty similar across the major product categories, there are some though that are going to pick up steam where we\u2019re doing sort of more complex assemblies, I\u2019m thinking about Ford [indiscernible] that we mentioned before where there is more cash through content, so that would have a little bit of margin.","But overall that had a significant impact on our business. So, I think we\u2019re pretty comfortable that will say close to where we are. In aerospace, we have seen some margin declined in the last couple of years, really coming up of our straight to business where they were really sort of out of the market high and we\u2019ve been moving to capture more volume and get those pricing more reasonable in some cases.","But we think that most of that has happened and we continue to grow the fabrication side of that business. So, all in all I think that our margin profile there looks pretty steady as well. And, if I look at our outlook for the rest of the year, that\u2019s what I see there as well.","John Baugh","And, Mitch just to be clear, I think there was a reference in your slide deck to growth impacting auto margin, is that - was that what you were referring to with the complexity you have in other words I guess the question is simply as you look at the products you\u2019re winning in the margin profile, it looks similar, but there are maybe some tooling up in CapEx that you happened to do because volumes there overtime has been so good, is that the right way to think about it?","Mitch Dolloff","Yes, and that\u2019s exactly right John. When I entered the first part, I was thinking about sort of long term budget on this product. But there is sometimes some sort of lumpy investments in both capital and overhead that\u2019s required to support this. Again, we win the program, we have this time before it ramps up, but we are making those investments both in the productive capacity, but also sometimes overhead to manage those programs. So, we get occasionally when we have significantly new technologies or new programs starting up where we get a little bit of lumpiness in that profitability. And, that\u2019s exactly what we are talking about there.","John Baugh","Thank you and good luck.","Karl Glassman","Thanks John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Herb Hardt with Monness Crespi Hardt. Please proceed with your question.","Herb Hardt","Good morning.","Karl Glassman","Good morning, Herb.","Herb Hardt","Wishing you all well, my question is always two. One is given the strength in housing, would you expect home furniture, other parts of residential to pick up a bit later in the year into next year? And, can you give some more detail on aerospace, we\u2019ve been pretty successful making acquisition, it\u2019s kind of become a footnote in the last one or two quarters?","Karl Glassman","Yes, I\u2019ll take the first and dump the last on Mitch, that\u2019s the easy one. Yes, the housing, the strength in housing usually has a bit of a lag. So, historically and it moves through the homes. So, when housing picks up, we generally see it Geo, carpet or flooring products earliest and then it moves through the house generally from front to back. So, you will see some strength in home furniture, in front room and then you will see bedding strength as well. Housing, housing moves housing household formations are generally very good for our business, but it is not instantaneous.","Mitch Dolloff","Herb, this is Mitch. On Aerospace, not a footnote to us, we are very actively engaged there. And, it\u2019s still not that big part of our business at $140 million, $150 million sales, which is why I think you don\u2019t hear more about it all these calls. But we spend a lot of time working on it, and we still are committed to it as a growth platform. We see good things happening both from an organic standpoint where we are winning programs on some of the new aircraft and engines that are coming up, so we feel positive about that. We are also very active in add on acquisition, we haven\u2019t been able to bring one to finalization, but we\u2019ve been really active in looking that opportunities and continue to do so. So, we\u2019ll get one to bring home, hopefully, in the not-too-distant future. We keep swinging the back.","Karl Glassman","At Apollo, we are really comfortable with the quality of our management team there, they have capacity to do more and manage more; it\u2019s a complex business. So, to Mitch\u2019s point, we just need to make the business more substantive.","Herb Hardt","Okay. Well, thank you very much and good luck.","Karl Glassman","Thanks Herb.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Justin Bergner with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Bergner","Thanks for putting me in guys, good morning. My first question in regards to your range, I mean, EPS range is pretty wide still and I\u2019m trying to figure out, is that range mainly because of the raw material pass through or is that more because of the volume and if the latter maybe could you frame sort of what volume correspond to the low end of the range and what volume correspond to the high end of the range?","Susan McCoy","Justin I think it\u2019s a little bit about, we\u2019ll routinely have - still a pretty wide range coming out of the first quarter just because steel years yet to unfold and we want to try to create opportunities as best as we can see them for cover on the upside downside usually and it is this time predominantly volume related, but we recognized some extra towards volatility around commodity cost and what those are doing. As I think of that $0.20 range, high end or low end it is more a factor of the volume side, we say mid single digit, you might think of that as 4% to 5% growth, terrifically good would be 6%. We\u2019ll see how the year comes together and then the earnings leverage attributable with the flow through value or benefit incremental volume to our EBIT and then ultimately our EPS is the bulk of that the width of the range is explained accordingly.","Justin Bergner","Okay. So, with 6% volume corresponded at high end of the range or above high end of the range?","Susan McCoy","No, I would say something in the 5% to 6% range.","Justin Bergner","Okay.","Susan McCoy","We say mid single digit, but you can interpret that as using 4%, 5%, 6%, something in that I would think 5% and change maybe a little bit over 5% would be a reasonable price to think about, the higher end and maybe in the 4% ballpark the lower end.","Justin Bergner","Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. And, then just very quickly on Comfort Core, the stats you were giving about 7% growth, was that specific to April month to date?","Karl Glassman","It\u2019s a good question. We came out with a sheet this year at January with basically no growth, it\u2019s pretty depressed environment overall. So, when you think of Comfort Core being up 8% year-on-year that tells you the accelerated pace we saw in February and March. So, running well above a percent, so to end the quarter at 8% given the start we had is strong.","Justin Bergner","Okay, great. I think my numbers were little bit disjoint there. And, then is Comfort Core then above 40% of your unit shipments now, I think that was what you said in the last quarter?","Karl Glassman","From a pieces perspective it\u2019s about 35. -- Obviously they represent - of total US pieces Comfort Core is right at 40% in terms of Quantum Edge with Comfort Core, Quantum Edge 35% of Comfort Core and that represents obviously a higher revenue or dollar volume because those are value add products for us.","Justin Bergner","Okay. Thank you. I\u2019ll wrap it up here. I appreciate the questions.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back to over Ms. McCoy for any closing remarks.","Susan McCoy","Okay. Well, thanks for joining us today. And we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, David DeSonier, Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations for Leggett & Platt, Incorporated. Thank you, sir. You may now begin.","David M. DeSonier","Good morning, and thank you for taking part in Leggett & Platt's fourth quarter conference call. I'm Dave DeSonier, and with me today are the following: Dave Haffner, our Board Chair and CEO; Karl Glassman, who is President and Chief Operating Officer; Matt Flanigan, our Executive VP and CFO; and Susan McCoy, our Staff VP of Investor Relations. Jack Crusa, who is Senior Vice President of the company and also President of the Specialized Products segment, is also joining us this morning to participate in Q&A.","The agenda for our call this morning is as follows: Dave Haffner will start with a summary of the major statements we made in yesterday's press release, Matt Flanigan will discuss financial details and address our outlook for 2014, Karl Glassman will provide segment highlights and finally, the group will answer any questions that you have.","This conference is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material. This call may not be transcribed, recorded or broadcast without our express permission. A replay is available from the IR portion of Leggett's website. We posted to the IR portion of the website a set of PowerPoint slides that contain summary financial information along with segment details. Those slides supplement the information we discuss on this call, including non-GAAP reconciliations.","I need to remind you that remarks today concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results or events may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements.","For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the section in our 10-K entitled Forward-looking Statements.","I'll now turn the call over to Dave Haffner.","David S. Haffner","Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call.","We are pleased with our underlying operating performance in the fourth quarter and encouraged by the sales momentum in certain of our markets. But a few factors impacted us from a reported GAAP earnings perspective. Consistent with our announcement on December 17, we recognized a $67 million or $0.31 per share noncash charge related to the goodwill and intangible assets of our Commercial Vehicle Products business.","In addition, increases in steel costs late in 2013 resulted in a larger-than-expected LIFO expense of $12 million in the quarter. The timing of the steel cost increase has concentrated the LIFO impact into the fourth quarter and ahead of the benefit we expect from selling price increases.","We've begun implementing price increases to recover the higher costs and should realize a benefit in first half of 2014 that offsets this LIFO impact. And the earnings per share impact from higher LIFO expense was essentially offset by a lower-than-normal effective tax rate in the quarter.","Fourth quarter earnings, adjusted to exclude the CVP impairment charge, were $0.35 per share, in line with the guidance we issued in late October. In the fourth quarter of 2012, earnings per share, adjusted to exclude an $0.18 unusual tax benefit, were $0.32.","Same-location sales increased 3% during the fourth quarter, with growth in Automotive, residential furniture, bedding, Carpet Underlay and Machinery, partially offset by lower demand in store fixtures and CVP. EBIT and EBIT margins adjusted to exclude the CVP impairment charge decreased in the fourth quarter. The earnings benefit from sales growth was more than offset by higher steel costs and the concentration of the yet-to-be-recovered LIFO expense that I mentioned earlier.","For the full year, earnings from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude the fourth quarter CVP charge and a $0.06 per share unusual acquisition-related benefit from the third quarter, were $1.54 per share. Full year 2012 earnings from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude an $0.18 per share unusual tax benefit, were $1.47 per share.","Same-location sales were essentially flat, with modest unit gains offset by lower trade sales from our rod mill. Sales grew primarily in automotive and Carpet Underlay, but these gains were partially offset by declines in Store Fixtures, CVP and Adjustable Bed.","Adjusted EBIT and EBIT margins for the year were roughly flat with 2012. We expanded our aerospace tubing business unit in 2013 with the acquisition of 2 companies. The first was a small U.K.-based business acquired in May that extended our capability in aerospace tube fabrication. The second was a larger French-based company acquired in July that added small-diameter, high-pressure, seamless tubing to our product portfolio. With these acquisitions, our Aerospace Products business unit now has an annual revenue run rate of approximately $120 million. The development of this business platform aligns very well with our strategic emphasis on improving the overall margin mix of our businesses by investing in attractive markets where we can build or extend a strong, sustainable competitive advantage.","As discussed earlier in the year, we've been considering strategic alternatives for our Commercial Vehicle Products group, including possible divestiture of the business. As we progressed through the quarter, it became apparent that current market values for certain CVP assets had fallen below recorded book values, and impairment charges related to the goodwill and other intangible assets of the business were recognized.","This decline in current market values of the assets resulted from lower expectations of future revenue and profitability, reflecting reduced market demand for the racks, shelving and cabinets used in telecom, cable and delivery vans. We now intend to increase focus on improving the operating performance and cost structure of the CVP business.","We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1\/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that ended December 31, 2013, we generated TSR of $0.16 per year on average, which placed us at the midpoint of the S&P 500 companies.","I'll now turn the call over to Matt Flanigan, who will discuss some additional financial details, along with our outlook for 2014. Matt?","Matthew C. Flanigan","Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone.","Once again, we generated strong cash flow in the fourth quarter with operating cash of $178 million. For the full year, operating cash flow totaled $417 million. Working capital contributed $26 million of that amount, a notable accomplishment since we ended 2012 with particularly low levels of accounts receivable.","Optimizing returns on capital employed continues to be a major focus for our operations. We ended the year with working capital at 10.1% of annualized sales, well below our 15% target.","In August, we increased the quarterly dividend by 3.4% to $0.30 per share, and 2013 marked our 42nd consecutive annual dividend increase at a compound annual growth rate of 13%. At yesterday's closing price of $30.69, the current yield is 3.9%, which is the fourth highest among all of the S&P 500's Dividend Aristocrats. In 2014, we expect to again generate over $350 million of operating cash. Dividends should require about $170 million in 2014, and capital expenditures should approximate $100 million. Our depreciation and amortization expense should again total about $120 million.","With current capacity utilization rates still relatively low, our need to invest in additional productive capacity is limited. We continue to make investments for maintenance, efficiency improvement and growth in businesses and product lines where sales are strong. As volumes improve, we expect capital expenditure levels to increase. But longer term, they will likely remain at or below total depreciation and amortization.","Our incentive plans emphasize returns on capital, which include net fixed assets and working capital. This emphasis, we believe, helps ensure that we are efficiently utilizing our asset base and investing capital dollars where the highest return potential exists. Going forward, returns should continue to improve as we expand EBIT margins while controlling invested capital.","In other uses of cash, we repurchased 2 million shares of our stock in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year repurchases to 6 million. We also issued 3.2 million shares during the year. Consistent with our stated priorities for the use of excess cash flow, we will prudently buy back our stock, bearing in mind our level of cash generation, other potential opportunities to strategically grow the company and the overall outlook for the general economy.","We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year but have established no specific repurchase commitment or timetable. We recognize that our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions.","We ended the year with net debt to net capital at 27.3%, well below the conservative end of our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%.","The economic outlook for 2014 is a bit brighter than it has been for some time. Most forecasters are calling for a modestly better U.S. economy in 2014, though they note that headwinds will still exist. For planning purposes, we expect 2014 sales growth to accelerate and EBIT margins to expand. We anticipate full year sales of $3.85 billion to $4.05 billion or 3% to 8% growth versus 2013. Based on this level of sales, we expect 2014 earnings in the range of $1.65 to $1.85 per share, which would represent another year of record earnings from continuing operations. This compares to adjusted continuing operations EPS of $1.54 in 2013.","Now I'll turn the call over to Karl, who will provide some additional segment comments.","Karl G. Glassman","Thank you, Matt, and good morning.","In the Residential Furnishings segment, same-location sales increased 6% in the fourth quarter from higher unit volumes in several product categories and raw material-related price increases in Carpet Underlay.","In our U.S. Spring business, sales increased 1% in the quarter. Innerspring unit volumes were essentially flat. However, growth in the Comfort Core innerspring category continued, with those higher-priced and higher-margin units up 35% during the quarter. Our boxspring volume was also strong, with units up 8%. Sales grew 8% in international spring, primarily from market share gains and increased Comfort Core sales in Europe.","In Furniture Components, sales increased 9% in the fourth quarter. Volume in our seating and sofa sleeper businesses grew 13%, and motion hardware unit volume was up 7%. Adjustable Bed units were down 11% in the quarter. In Carpet Underlay, sales grew primarily from price increases implemented to recover higher raw material cost.","Fourth quarter EBIT and EBIT margins increased in the segment, primarily from higher sales.","For the full year, same-location sales in the Residential segment increased 3%, largely from growth in Carpet Underlay, partially offset by declines in Adjustable Bed. EBIT and EBIT margins improved primarily from higher sales in certain product categories, cost improvements and favorable product mix in U.S. Spring.","In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, same-location sales decreased 8% in the fourth quarter. Store Fixtures sales decreased 10%, and volume in Office Furniture Components was down 4% during the quarter. Segment EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus the fourth quarter of 2012, primarily due to the lower sales.","For the full year, Commercial segment same location sales were down 6%, and EBIT decreased on the lower volumes.","In the Industrial Materials segment, fourth quarter same-location sales decreased 4%, with slightly higher unit volumes more than offset by steel-related price decreases early in the quarter. EBIT and EBIT margins for this segment decreased during the quarter, with acquisition earnings more than offset by lower metal margins and late quarter inflation in steel costs.","For the full year, same-location sales in the segment were down 8%, with about half of the decline from lower trade sales at our rod mill and the balance from steel-related price deflation. The decrease in trade sales of steel rod during the year was offset by an increase in intercompany rod sales; and the rod mill continued to run at 100% capacity utilization. As we stated throughout the year, the change in the mix of rod sales from trade to intercompany is generally positive to earnings since that change tends to also shift the production mix to higher-value, high-carbon rods.","Full year EBIT and EBIT margins in the segment improved, primarily due to the absence of acquisition-related cost in Western Pneumatic Tube and earnings from other acquisitions. These gains were partially offset by lower metal margins in the second half of 2013.","Our Aerospace business continues to perform well, and earnings should further benefit in 2014 as we fully integrate recent acquisitions. In the Specialized Products segment, same-location sales grew 8% in the fourth quarter. Automotive sales increased 20% from a combination of expanded content, participation in new vehicle platforms and demand strength in each of the major markets. Same-location sales grew 17% in Machinery during the quarter.","In Commercial Vehicle Products, sales declined 30% -- 32% in the fourth quarter. Large fleet customers pulled volume forward into the second quarter and curtailed capital spending in the back half of the year. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margins, excluding the CVP impairment, increased during the quarter, primarily from higher sales. For the full year, same-location sales grew 4%, with strength in Automotive partially offset by declines in CVP. Full year EBIT and EBIT margins, adjusted to exclude the CVP impairment, increased primarily from higher sales.","With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave Haffner.","David S. Haffner","Thanks, Karl. As we look forward into 2014 and beyond, we are encouraged by the positive direction several of our businesses are headed. We continue to be very optimistic about the growth potential in our Automotive business for the next several years.","Industry forecasts project 3% global production growth in 2014. With content gains, we expect to outperform this industry growth rate as we did in 2013. We are also encouraged by the longer-term view for the office furniture industry and expect improving growth rates in our related business in 2014.","Customer backlogs in aerospace support industry demand strength in that business for several years. Our Adjustable Bed business has recently gained significant market share that we will start to see the benefit from in 2014. And with consumer confidence in housing generally on an upward track, our Residential Furniture Components and bedding businesses are poised to benefit as demand in those end markets improves.","And with those comments, I'll turn the call back over to you, Dave DeSonier.","David M. DeSonier","That concludes our prepared remarks. We appreciate your attention, and we will be glad to answer your questions. [Operator Instructions] Jessie, we're ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Daniel Moore with CJS Securities.","Daniel Moore - CJS Securities, Inc.","Dave, you sounded increasingly optimistic obviously around 2014, and you touched on some of these topics at the end of your prepared remarks. But in Automotive, obviously seeing a nice pickup there. In the core businesses, mattresses and furniture, what gives you the confidence that consumers are likely to get off their hands and get out there and increase unit purchases? And then a quick follow-up is simply what is the tax rate embedded in your adjusted $0.35 EPS for fiscal Q4?","David S. Haffner","Okay, Dan. In fact, we were talking before the conference call just amongst ourselves about the fact that we indeed do feel better about 2014. Things seem and indices would indicate that business is likely to be better in a broad array of our business units. Those things that I did mention, of course, there's some publicly available information that would support that. And then relative to your question about some of our core products, it's a broad-based combination of facts that lead us to believe that we're going to see improvement in those, Dan, obviously, interacting with our customers, taking a look at what they're planning to provide at markets, what sort of new products they're asking us to pursue, timing of those. But the general uplift of the housing market and consumer confidence going forward is likely to lift a lot of ships, not just Leggett's core businesses. So I don't want to come across as overly optimistic. We're a fairly conservative company. But I can tell you the group that sits here with me today feel like 2014 is likely to be a meaningfully better year, and obviously, Karl and his operating people have generated a forecast that would suggest that. Now I'm going to hand over the tax rate -- I know the answer, but I'll give it to Matt and let him comment on the tax rate that was embedded in that 2014 forecast.","Matthew C. Flanigan","Well, the forecast is basically implying for 2014 a tax rate approximately 30%. In the fourth quarter alone, Dan, it was certainly a bit of a cluttered quarter, but it was about 11%. And again, that was a function of a lot of unique occurred in that quarter, not in our decision-making but because of the taxing jurisdictions that we are involved with literally all around the world. Specifically, Mexico, China, Canada and Austria are all 4 examples of activities that occurred in the fourth quarter with decisions or ruling that proved to be beneficial in this case and drove our tax rate down uniquely, which, of course, we mentioned in that fourth quarter EPS result.","Daniel Moore - CJS Securities, Inc.","Got it. So that $0.35 is on the $0.11 tax rate -- 11% tax rate?","Matthew C. Flanigan","Yes.","Operator","The next question is coming from Josh Borstein with Longbow Research.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","With respect to the revenue guidance, I was just wondering if you can tell me, at the midpoint, what it implies for each segment?","Susan R. McCoy","Yes, Josh. Just in kind of rough terms, Residential would be at somewhere around 4%; Commercial up 1 point or 2; Industrial, up around 6%, with about half of that actually coming from the acquisitions that we completed earlier in 2013. You'll remember those were roughly midyear, so we still have some of that benefit carrying into 2014. And we expect strong growth in Specialized. Obviously, Automotive did really well in the fourth quarter. That growth would be up somewhere around 10% or 11% next year. All of that aggregates to kind of a midpoint growth in the ballpark of about 5%, 5.5%.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","Great. Just on the other expense line, the $59.3 million in the quarter, could you talk a little bit about what that was exactly?","David S. Haffner","That's the impairment showing up in there.","Susan R. McCoy","Yes, Josh. There was, of that total $60 million -- call it $67 million of impairment, there was about $63 million of that. In fact, I think it was exactly $63 million that hit the other line. That was specifically the goodwill impairment. We also impaired another customer-related intangible, but we did that by accelerating the amortization on that particular asset. And so that, that hit -- I think it's the line above on the table that you're looking at, the amortization expense.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So nothing there that should be recurring in the following quarters?","Susan R. McCoy","There's always a little bit of other income or expense. But no, not relative to those 2 items.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I guess my question really is in Industrial. I'm trying to get some more color and understanding of the bridge between last year and this year. We've got good-performing Aerospace this year. And last year, while you still had it, I think there were some charges that were still -- accounting charges that still were depressing or at least toward the first half of last year, maybe not in the fourth quarter. But I'm trying to understand how do we get to that $3.2 million bridge, when we keep saying that Western Pneumatic and the other 2 new acquisitions are performing well? And so can you maybe put some color, you just add some numbers to that, if you would? And is Aerospace around 20% or 25% of revenue of that segment now?","Susan R. McCoy","The run rate that it's at, Budd, is about $120 million. But of course, we didn't have all of that revenue in 2013.","Matthew C. Flanigan","I'll get that pretty quick. No, 16%, 17%.","Susan R. McCoy","Okay, so 16% or 17% of the segment revenues.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And how do we get to the bridge in the EBIT between the 2 parts of that?","Karl G. Glassman","Budd, this is Karl. Let's talk about steel pricing for just a second while Susan is trying to dig through a little of that. The quarter was, as you wrote in your note this morning, a little ugly from a lot of perspectives. But it certainly was in Industrial as it relates to steel pricing, and this commentary primarily relates to the long or round products. But what we experienced in late September, early October, was some selling price deflation in both rod and wire, with sale -- with pricing pressured by an abnormally large amount of import rods, so rods that were flooding into the country from primarily China and Turkey that were taking down that sell price while scrap was relatively flat. And then -- so that there was an oddity in that we were experiencing actually in the business units some FIFO expense and -- with revaluing inventories because of the selling price. And then what happened in November and then accelerated in December was a significant inflation in scrap -- in domestic scrap costs, driving selling prices up. We did not incur the benefit of those selling price inflation. They were announced in the month of December, but they start -- became effective first week of January and second -- and first week of February, as it relates to wire and rod. So that drove that big LIFO issue. And I can't remember having FIFO expense and LIFO expense in the same quarter. So it was that dramatic swing that caused some of the pressure, all manifested itself in a metal margin spread that was tighter than anything we've experienced in quite some time. Now in the first quarter, we should have the benefit of the wire and rod selling price increases. Simultaneously between Christmas and New Year's, we announced selling price increases into the bedding industry that become effective in the first quarter. So that's the cause of the chop, so to speak, in Industrial. It will also have somewhat of an impact going forward. So the first quarter of this year is going to be somewhat pressured by the increased cost and then the delay, that's our typical delay, in getting those price increases implemented, in both in Industrial and in Residential.","David S. Haffner","This is Dave, Budd, just one other thing. We had a little bit of a hiccup, if you will, it wasn't nearly as large as the things that Karl was talking about, in our steel tubing products, not aerospace tubing but steel products tubing where our margins were lower than we had originally had hoped they would be in the fourth quarter. That's another element of that.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So if I heard you right, let me just see if this math works, then it looks like that the metal margins were somewhere between 3% to 4% in the quarter, and the balance of that of $160 million or so of sales, and the balance would be the Aerospace margins on those sales. Is that about right?","Karl G. Glassman","I don't know the answer to that, Budd. I might -- my sense is that may -- if you go through that calculus, that may give you aerospace margins that are higher than you -- I know what you're trying to calculate, but I don't know. I'll just have to go back and check that. But I do want to reaffirm that our Aerospace business is performing very, very well. So you should not look at Industrial in the fourth quarter and say, \"Hey, these guys were being a little disingenuous with Aerospace.\" Aerospace is doing well.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Do you want to put any quantification on that, Karl?","Karl G. Glassman","Very. This is all you're getting. It's performing at -- above our expectations at the time that we made each of those individual acquisitions. So very well.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of John Baugh with Stifel.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask, and you don't have to go into minutiae of products, but was wondering, as you enter '14, and you look at key product areas, you referenced a couple where you were going to have market share gains, I think -- or had market share gains. I think international springs was one, and there was a reference to tending share gain in adjustables. But could you go through the whole company key product areas and cite where you think you're gaining share or losing share. Did it influence the numbers when we look at '14 versus '13?","Karl G. Glassman","We'll start with Residential. John, this is Karl. U.S. Spring is an area that we are gaining the benefit -- continued benefit of Comfort Core, which gives us optimism as we go forward. To see that growth rate of 35% in units and growth of hybrids is a very good thing for us. Admittedly, the U.S. bedding market has been pretty soft. I think when they -- ISPA sorts through and trues up, we'll probably ultimately report that units were down in 2013. The ISPA forecast for '14 is 2% real unit growth, so that would help us. As we -- the furniture performed -- home furniture performed extremely well in the fourth quarter, as it did all year. We expect that it will continue to perform well there. As more upholstery is manufactured in North America, that's a very good thing for us, especially in seating and distribution. Rest of segment, carpet continues to just be a macro benefit from correlated to housing. As we said, as Dave said in his comments, we expect some strength in office. Office has been under pressure the last couple of years. We expect -- as supported by the BIFMA forecast of 2% to 3% growth this year, we feel good about that business and have also experienced some market share gains there as well. Moving into Industrial, I spoke to Aerospace. Certainly feel good about that and the aircraft manufacturer build plans going forward. Automotive is a great story that we -- the fourth quarter of last year, we saw productive growth in Europe for the first time in a number of quarters. So Europe, bottoming out and becoming a contributor is a good thing, and we continue to gain content in each vehicle produced. So that gives us that general optimism augmented by the macro statistics.","David S. Haffner","Relative to specific, where do we get these market gains? In Adjustable Beds, we know specifically who those customers are that have made that change, and they're customers that are significant bedding manufacturers. It's business that has already been consummated. We're taking that business from another adjustable bed manufacturer. So we try not to just assume that we're going to gain market share. John, you know that about us. Only when we know that we've realized that market share will -- we build it into a budget. Now that doesn't mean we can't lose market share, too. And obviously, competition is what it is. But there's also some major, I'll just say, development work that's -- that happens that's built into this forecast with some customers. Most of those are existing customers. Some of them are new customers. So we build that into a budget based upon a risk profile or probability profile that we think's prudent.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So, Dave, probably just to kind of sum it up, it's -- I hear share gains in office. I -- content share gains, I guess, in Automotive, particularly in Europe. Share gains in adjustables, maybe a lingering share gain in innersprings internationally. All gains. Any areas where you see any losses going into '14?","David S. Haffner","John, nothing of any magnitude. There's always puts and takes, but I can't think of anything of any magnitude that would be considered a loss. Good question though.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Two questions. One, back to the other expense line. You highlighted the $63 million of the charge that was in there, which still leave a kind of positive 3 on that number. What were the other elements that made it a positive 3?","Susan R. McCoy","Nothing that comes to mind immediately, Keith. I can look at that and get back to you. But there weren't any other large things in the quarter.","Karl G. Glassman","Yes, Keith, we had a small real estate building gain. It's part of that 3. It's certainly's not all of it. A few other, I mean, knickknacks. Clearly, it's a cluster of a number of things.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then to your comments on commercial furniture, besides some share gains on those components that you had discussed, do you see that business growing faster than the BIFMA numbers? Is there a chance that could be up mid-single digits in the industry?","Karl G. Glassman","Strictly should seating -- the seating category grow faster than the macro BIFMA numbers?","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Karl G. Glassman","It could. Frankly, I don't know why it would. I think that we'll outperform that data point because of the gains that I spoke of. But I don't know that there's any real reason, Keith, that seating would grow faster. That -- at NeoCon, the last NeoCon, the launches tended to be across all product categories, not heavy-weighted to seating. So I don't know that seating would get an inordinate share of that growth.","David S. Haffner","As some of our customers -- as you know, Keith, we do some private label-type business right now where we produce the entire component or chair for our customer. And that appears to continue to be gaining some interest by some of our customers to bring that activity to Leggett. And indeed, the 2014 forecast does have some more of that type of revenue growth or content, if you will, in it. But I'm not Karl. It's hard for us to dispute the BIFMA numbers -- numbers of BIFMA. And I think they do as good of job as anybody in trying to forecast that.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Herb Hardt with Monness, Crespi and Hardt.","Herbert A. Hardt - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","My question is that things seem to be coming together reasonably well for you across most sectors. What areas are the most concern to you?","David S. Haffner","I'll let Karl and\/or Matt comment, too. I have some concern -- continuing concern, Herb, with Commercial Vehicle Products. Mind you, we've righted the balance sheet, the value that we carry to what we think is the right number now. But I continue to have some concern with that part of our business. Of course, Jack is here with us, and he can comment on that if he wants. We're highly focused on improving that business since we chose not to give it away. We could have sold it. We chose not to at the prices that were offered. I also have some continuing anxiety about some of our primary steel tubing. It's more of a commodity-type product. Certainly, the antithesis of the aerospace tubing. But I do have some concern about that commodity-type product. Karl, how about you?","Karl G. Glassman","I would throw in Store Fixtures in that it's such a difficult business to forecast. Our people do everything that they can to forecast that business. But, Herb, as you know, it's a seasonal and cyclical business that just is -- it's a tough business. And we're optimistic from the standpoint that we've had greater access to bids and feel relatively good, but it's a business, because of the nature of the business, that sometimes surprises us. So that's a concern. The other is, as we pass through this raw material bulge, we always get through, but it's a challenge. It -- there's the lag that's -- in kind of innate, but at the same time, there are some tough conversations with customers at a time that they're pretty bullish about their demand. So it's always a challenge, but our people are great at executing.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is a follow-up coming from the line of Daniel Moore with CJS Securities.","Daniel Moore - CJS Securities, Inc.","Maybe talk a little bit about capacity. You reiterated in the press release that you have -- you've been seeing $400 million in additional sales with little needed CapEx. Maybe talk about where that capacity is proportionally, where -- I guess, where, if -- what areas of the business, if you saw more material pickup, you might need to start adding capacity over the next 12 months plus. And one quick follow-up.","Karl G. Glassman","Yes, Dan, this is Karl. Where we're tight on capacity is certainly at the steel mill. As I said, it runs at 100%. But Automotive, with Automotive's growth, if we go back and look at the 2013 CapEx of $81 million of spend, about 30% of that has been in Automotive. That's a great thing because they're devoted to new programs, awarded programs that will impact us today and well into the future. But that's an area, because of the growth in that business, that we're a little tight. In Residential Furnishings, we're -- continue to be a little tight on Comfort Core as that has grown around the world. So there's not much available capacity. But we certainly have the ability to add capacity and continue to do so and certainly at -- more efficiency at each one of the -- the addition of each one of those machines. I don't know of any other area that we're really tight. There are capital investments. We'll continue to heavy-weight to Automotive, Residential and to the steel mill. And that's not a capacity situation. It is steel mills are just expensive to maintain, but we improve utilization with most dollars spent there. It's not just maintenance. But, Dave, I don't know of another place that we're really...","David S. Haffner","Well, it's interesting. As you were talking, I wrote down mine, and I put Sterling, Automotive and pocket springs, which is Comfort Core. Those are the 3 areas where -- and as you know, Dan, we can't wait to spend some more money in those areas. That generic volume, of course, is very attractive to us. And so we did bump up -- it's probably conservative, but we did bump up forecast for CapEx in 2014. Whether or not we'll spend all that, we'll see. But those are the areas where the capacity dollars are likely to go.","Daniel Moore - CJS Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then maybe just a couple of comments on the CVP business. Given the sort of lack of demand in the marketplace, and now you're going to kind of try to right the ship. What do you think -- what margins are achievable or sustainable in that business as we look out over the next couple of years?","Jack D. Crusa","The -- this is Jack, Daniel. And the target in a long-term perspective for CVP would be to get it up closer to the 9% to 10% margin range. In 2014, that's going to be a challenge because we have a lot of -- we have moving parts. The Ford business, they're going to cease the production of the E-Series van and begin to produce a transit in Kansas City. And we'll be establishing our presence in Kansas City to do that, to support that. So it will be a steady progression towards those improvements. Historically, we've seen that business, in good years, approach that 9% to 10% EBIT margin. And in soft years, it will be in the low single digits. So to be fair, I would probably use something, in a longer-term perspective, in the 6% to 8% range.","Operator","And the next question is a follow-up coming from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Got a couple of follow-ups. One, Karl, is there any update on the tariff situation? I think it's going through a review again.","Karl G. Glassman","Yes, we're in early stages of that review now. It's in the combination of a review, Budd, at the ITC and the DOC that -- at this point, we expect the DOC decision sometime in March. The ITC would trail that a little bit. That -- we're very confident there because of circumstances have not changed. You may have seen the recent publication of a Malaysian manufacturer that was speeding, cheating, lying and all those other dirty, nasty things that they were doing in transhipping products in the United States. And they were caught doing so. That duty rate was -- of 234% was reaffirmed. We see that as a good sign. We continue to work with a number of other manufacturers of other products, both steel and non-steel-related, to deal with continued enforcement of the existing antidumping and countervailing duty orders as they relate to transhipment. And we've done a pretty good job, I think, of engaging Congress and the DOC and Customs. So they're certainly well aware of the situation, and I think that bodes well for them adding another 5 years to the time frame.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And do you still think about 1 million units are finding their way in? And I think it peaked at about 4 million?","Karl G. Glassman","Yes, Budd, I think that there's about 1.5 million units coming into the United States, about half of those coming in legally and about half of those coming in illegally.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I know Comfort Core has done real well. But how will we think about pockets [ph], about coil versus open coil these days? It seems like open coil must be losing share, and that's been a traditional Leggett strength or is a legacy Leggett strength for as long as I've been around.","Karl G. Glassman","That certainly is a good point, that we have some open coil capacity that is available right now. Some of it's being relocated in the other geographies. But certainly, if you deal with 35% growth in Comfort Core, which today in the U.S. is about 12% of our total business growing obviously quickly, that it is obsoleting, so to speak, some open coil. And I would suspect, as you make your way around the showrooms in Las Vegas at market next week, you'll see more Hybrid, more Comfort Core introductions. A number of us were in Cologne last week at the IMM Fair and, boy, there's pocket coil in places there that used to be open coil as well. So it actually bodes well for us because of -- as you heard in my commentary, the higher average unit selling price is at higher margins. So it's been a good trend for us. With us having access to the best machinery company in the world, being Schpeul [ph], to manufacture those machines, it has been a very good thing for us. It allows us to innovate, and we'll continue to innovate on each one of the triggers that trigger the consumers' purchase of a Hybrid product.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and last thing from me if I could, I guess, to Matt maybe or Susan. On the working capital, on the cash from operations, expectation of $350 million or more, if I do the midpoint of it and with depreciation and amortization and maybe some stock compensation expense, I get to, like, about a $410 million before working capital usage. How should we think about that? If you do that midpoint, I think it's $20 million more -- $200 million more of revenue. What do we think about the use of working capital to get to your working capital or to your cash from operations for [indiscernible]?","Matthew C. Flanigan","Yes, great question, Budd. This is Matt. If you look at the end of the year, as I know you have done, and the working capital rate is 10.1%, you've heard us say for many -- several years now that our goal is 15% or that's our target. We've been inside of that routinely. We expect to stay inside that. Our current modeling, which, again, we think is conservative, would estimate, say, around 12%, 12.5% as a working capital investment on that sales growth that we anticipate taking place in 2014. If you plow that into your model, you would get something between $360 million and $400 million of operating cash flow to come out of 2014. Again, we would look forward to doing better than that. Also, as you well know, seasonally, the fourth quarter of the year is always the big operating cash flow time of those 12 months for us. So a lot of that comes home to roost in the fourth quarter, as it did once again this year. So we say more than $350 million; we certainly feel very strongly about that. Might it begin with a $400 million by the time we close this coming year's books? Could be the case, just like it was this past year and the year before that.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And that usage, how does that split between receivables and inventory?","Matthew C. Flanigan","Yes, we really -- we obviously look at all the pieces. But if you take receivables, inventory and payables, where there's a lot of work going on the payable side, that you can basically take that 10% all-in metric, go to 12.5% and basically use all 3 of those pieces to find your way there.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question coming from the line of Josh Borstein with Longbow Research.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","Just to -- another question on the Comfort Core is if you could talk about the cadence in the quarter, I'm just curious if you saw a fall-off in December as some other companies have reported and just how January started off for you.","Karl G. Glassman","That's an interesting question, Josh, in that we didn't see a fall-off. We did, full disclosure, see a fall-off in December in spring sales, so I don't want to do anything to disconnect. When we aggregate, maybe I'll stop dancing with you. Our total innersprings in December were down 6% in units, so it was a tough month for people, probably weather-driven. But if we look at the cadence of Comfort Core, up 38% in October, up 28% in November and up 34% in December. And I would expect us to continue to run at a pretty impressive rate as we have some insight into what our customers' introductions are next week in Las Vegas.","David S. Haffner","Karl, were all those bedding, Comfort Core or any of that furniture Comfort Core?","Karl G. Glassman","Yes, that's a good question, Dave. That excludes Comfort Core. We're seeing significant growth in Comfort Core applications and furniture upholstery and, to a very small extent, in pet beds. And all of that is excluded. So it -- the growth in Comfort Core, though, back to home furniture is a good story as well.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","Great. And then just on the adjustable foundations, if I think back to last quarter, seems -- or the business seemingly was improving as the quarter progressed, much like the Comfort Core business back in 3Q. Can you just talk about what the falloff in 4Q was that you saw?","Karl G. Glassman","Josh, it was pretty constant in the quarter, that it was -- aggregate to that 11%, we ran at about that rate. Actually, the fourth quarter was -- the December month was exactly 11%. And you've opened a door for me on adjustables. Let's talk about that category for a little bit. Dave made reference to it as well. But the -- our path of distribution on adjustables had been primarily to -- direct-to-retail, and we -- through what was admittedly a difficult year in 2013, we did not lose any retail floor placements. What had happened to us is some of the OEM manufacturers did a really good job of packaging their mattress with a specific base, and in some cases, those bases weren't ours. As Dave said, some of that has been rectified, and we're starting to shift those programs now. So I think that we're behind the loss of Adjustable Bed business.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, great. And then just one more for me. On the slide deck, I noticed, for the 2014 guidance, the contribution margin was 25%. Normally, you use a more normalized 30%. What accounts for the change?","Susan R. McCoy","Josh, that acknowledges that in our sales guidance range, we expect to have some inflation. We haven't split out how much of that 3% to 8% is pricing and how much is units. But admittedly, some of it's going to be pricing. And we don't get 30% contribution margin, obviously, as we've talked with you in the past about when it's price-driven sales growth. So that really is just a bit of a hedge, if you will. At this point of the year, it's difficult to identify exactly what's going to make up the sales growth, but considering that some of that's going to come from pricing. That just simply was just hedging, that contribution of that.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for any concluding comments.","David S. Haffner","Thank you. We appreciate your time, and we'll talk to you again in April.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation."],"13474":["Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG) Q4 2011 Earnings Call February  7, 2012  9:00 AM ET","Executives","David M.

Haffner","Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call. Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2011 earnings. For the quarter, earnings were $0.06 per share and included $0.16 per share of costs associated with the restructuring activities that we announced in late December. Earnings per share, excluding these costs, were $0.22 in the quarter. In the fourth quarter 2010, we earned $0.21 per share. Fourth quarter same location sales grew 6% versus the prior year largely from items that brought little incremental profit. Raw material-related price inflation and trade sales from our steel mill accounted for the bulk of the growth with unit volumes from our other businesses in total adding about 1% to sales. Earnings per share for the full year 2011 adjusted to exclude the fourth quarter restructuring related costs were $1.20 per share. In 2010, we earned $1.15 per share. The increase is primarily due to a lower share count, a lower effective tax rate and slightly higher sales partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense and other costs. Sales grew 8% in 2011 largely from inflation, currency rate changes and trade sales from our steel mill. ","Across the company as a whole, unit volume increased slightly. Demand improved in certain of our markets during 2011 with automotive and office furniture leading the way. In contrast, stagnant demand negatively impacted our major residential markets. Many consumers continued to postpone spending on larger ticket items such as bedding and furniture in the phase of ongoing weak economy. ","On the third quarter earnings call, we stated that our view of continuing demand weakness in certain of our markets and our plan to initiate actions that would yield improved ongoing profitability. In late December, we announced further restructuring which included the closure of 4 production facilities along with other cost reductions. These activities resulted in a $0.16 per share, predominantly noncash charge to earnings during the fourth quarter. The restructuring-related activities that we initiated during 2011 in total should benefit 2012 earnings per share by approximately $0.07 to $0.10. ","We were very pleased to report in late December that we were acquiring Western Pneumatic Tube, a leading provider to the aerospace industry of integral components for critical aircraft systems. Our  strategic long-term 4% to 5% annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions of companies exactly like Western. High-quality businesses with secure leading positions in growing, profitable, attractive markets and that makes sense to be part of Leggett & Platt. The acquisition was completed on January 12 and is expected to be slightly accretive to EPS in 2012.","Operating cash for the fourth quarter was $127 million, bringing the full year 2011 operating cash to $329 million. With concerns about weak markets, our operating folks continue to closely monitor the working capital levels.  We ended the year with working capital at 11.8% of annualized sales. Now current liabilities include approximately $30 million associated with an interest rate swap that we entered in 2010. ","Excluding this item, working capital was 12.7% of annualized sales, still well below our 15% target. In August, we increased the quarterly dividend by $0.01 to $0.28 per share reinforcing our commitment to consistent shareholder returns and our confidence in Leggett's strong cash generation. ","2011 marks our 40th consecutive year of annual dividend increases. Maintaining our dividend track record is very important to us. Only 2 companies in the S&P 500 have a stronger string of annual increases at a higher growth rate than Leggett. ","For over 20 years, we have generated more than enough operating cash to fund both capital expenditures and dividends, and we expect that to be the case again in 2012. For the upcoming year, operating cash should exceed $300 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be about $100 million and dividend payment should approximate $160 million. ","We anticipate the increase in capital expenditures relates primarily to new automotive programs that we have been awarded and that should contribute meaningfully to earnings and cash flow beginning in 2013. ","During 2011, we continued purchasing our stock while maintaining our strong financial base. For the year, we repurchased 10 million shares. We also issued 3 million shares through various employee benefit and stock purchase programs. We ended the year with net debt at 29% of net capital, which is below our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%. We expect to continue repurchasing our stock when we have excess cash flow, and we have an annual $10 million share authorization under which these purchases may be made. However, with the acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube in mid-January and the resulting temporary increase in our net debt levels to about 35% of net capital, we may choose not to repurchase any shares during 2012. ","For the fourth consecutive year, Leggett & Platt's stock provided a better return to investors than did the S&P 500 index. We target total shareholder return in the top 1\/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. ","For the 3 years ending December 31, 2011, we generated an average annual Total Shareholder Return of 21% compared to 14% for the S&P 500 index. That places us in the top 38% of the S&P 500, just a bit shy of our goal. ","With those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman who will provide some operating highlights. Karl?","Karl G. Glassman","Thank you, Dave. Good morning. In my comments, I'll discuss a few segment highlights. You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. ","Fourth quarter sales in the Residential Furnishings segment increased 6% primarily from raw material-related price inflation. Unit volumes were up slightly. In our U.S. Spring business, innerspring unit volumes increased 4% and boxspring units increased 2% during the fourth quarter. The positive innerspring data primarily reflects our recovery of market share in 2011 that was temporarily lost to a European supplier in the back half of 2010. For the full year 2011, both innerspring and boxspring units were essentially flat. ","In our Furniture Hardware business, fourth quarter unit volume decreased 3% versus the prior year. While units were still negative in the quarter, the market has stabilized since mid-year and was showing some improved strength as the year came to a close. For the full year 2011, units were down 6%. ","Again this quarter, we had significant growth in adjustable beds with unit shipments up 35%. With our other major residential businesses flat or down in unit volume for the full year, this business was the bright spot in this segment. For the full year 2011, adjustable beds units grew 44%. ","EBIT and EBIT margins in the Residential Furnishings segment decreased versus the fourth quarter of 2010. The earnings benefit from slightly higher unit volumes was more than offset by higher restructuring-related costs. ","Of the 4 additional plant closures that we mentioned in the restructuring announcement in late December, one was in the residential segment. This operation was a fabric coating business that was formerly part of our Fabric and Carpet Underlay Group. Earlier, restructuring activity in 2011 included a Canadian spring facility, which was converted from manufacturing to warehouse, and 2 carpet underlay plants. We expect segment margins to benefit in 2012 from the cost savings associated with these activities. ","In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, fourth quarter sales decreased 4% from lower Fixture & Display volume. Most of this decrease resulted from lower volume with brand product companies supplied by our Point of Purchase business. Sales in the Office Furniture components was essentially flat during the quarter. Volume in this business continued to generally track the overall recovery in the office furniture industry. Growth rate slowed in the back half of 2011 as comparisons became more difficult, reflecting the acceleration of the industry's recovery in mid-2010. ","EBIT and EBIT margins in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment decreased versus fourth quarter of 2010, primarily from lower Fixture & Display sales and production levels and higher inventory reserves. ","Of the 4 plant closures that we mentioned in our December announcement, one is in the commercial segment. We have begun the consolidation of 1 of our 6 remaining store fixtures locations. The majority of the volume is expected to be retained and will be supplied through 2 of our remaining operations. This activity is expected to benefit 2012 margins and should be complete in the second quarter. ","In addition, consistent with our stated plan to continually assess our portfolio and exit non-core businesses, we divested our small U.K.-based Point of Purchase display operation in January 2012.","Moving on to the industrial segment. Fourth quarter sales increased 18% reflecting steel-related price inflation and higher trade sales through our steel mill. Unit volumes increased slightly in our wire drawing business but declined in steel tubing and fabricated wire products. EBIT decreased versus fourth quarter of 2010 primarily due to restructuring-related costs. EBIT margins also decreased during the quarter as a result of a change in sales from intra-segment to trade at our steel rod mill. These trade sales have positive earnings contribution in addition to covering overhead costs and have kept the mill running at full capacity, while internal demand for steel rod has been down. ","However, this sales shift is dilutive to margin percentages since it increases our reported sales while preserving comparable EBIT levels. ","The remaining 2 plant closures that we discussed in December are occurring in this segment. We closed 1 of our 6 domestic wire drawing operations and consolidated that volume into 2 of the remaining plants. We are also closing a wire forming operation that was a supplier of coated wire dishwasher racks to the domestic appliance industry. These activities should improve capacity utilization within the segment in 2012 and benefit earnings and margins. ","As Dave mentioned earlier, we completed the acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube on January 12. This operation will become a standalone business unit in the Industrial Materials segment. And with operating margins above company average, it bolstered the segment's full year EBIT margins in 2012.","In the Specialized Products segment, we posted 6% sales growth in the fourth quarter, with increases coming from all parts of the segment. Automotive growth continued but in a more moderate 6% rate as prior year comparisons have become more challenging. EBIT and EBIT margins decreased during the quarter. Higher sales contributed favorably to EBIT, but the benefit was more than offset by impairment costs associated with the write-down of a specific patent. ","Automotive industry forecasts anticipate continued growth in the global production rates in 2012 but the outlook varies by geography. North America and Asia are both expected to have meaningful production growth, but European forecasts are negative as economic concerns linger. ","With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave.","David S. Haffner","Thank you, Karl. As we announced yesterday, our full year 2012 earnings guidance is $1.20 to $1.40 per share on sales of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion. The earnings guidance assumes a $0.07 to $0.10 per share benefit from recent restructuring activities, but this will be partially offset by higher anticipated interest expense and effective tax rate. ","The full year revenue forecast assumes only modest improvement in the economy with no significant change from inflation, deflation or currency factors. We had to make some difficult and emotional decisions this past quarter. It is never easy to close facilities or reduce the number of employee partners, but it's a tough business environment and we've reacted accordingly. The changes we've made and the meaningful positive effects that they will have in our operations going forward are valuable to our entire shareholder base. We are leaner than we've been for many years and are in great shape to benefit from improved demand.","With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier.","David M. DeSonier","That concludes our prepared remarks. We appreciate your attention, and we'll be glad to try to answer your questions. In order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate, we request that you ask your single best question and then voluntarily yield to the next participant. If you have additional questions, please reenter the queue and we'll try to answer all the questions that you have. ","Diego, we're ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just -- here is my question I guess. It goes to guidance, and maybe give us some color on guidance. And Dave, you did tantalize us a bit with 2013 talking about the automotive project and automotive projects. And I think in the announcement on Western Pneumatic, you talked about significant accretion after 2012 as you get through some of the purchase accounting issues. Can you give us kind of a goalpost of -- what are the goalposts of 2012 in terms of negative 1% plus 5% and the operating margins that happened? Why do you have a negative 1%? What has to happen there, what has to happen to get to plus 5% at the top line and then the bottom line? And then what does 2013 look like? You didn't put any numbers to that, at least I didn't see -- I didn't hear any. So give us a thought of -- do we get to our $2 roadmap in 2013?","David S. Haffner","Yes, see if I can tackle that a piece at a time. First of all, the reason I commented on the automotive business, the gestation period -- I think you know this, but the time it takes from conception through development, through quotation and then landing the business is significant and then there's quite a period of time for tooling and ultimate utilization of the product, and those are reasonably meaningful capital expenditures for us. We're very pleased to do that because the return on that investment is outstanding. But we wanted to kind of dovetail the timing of that increased capital expenditure and the fact that it's probably -- or it will be 2013 whenever that incremental benefit comes to pass. So there wasn't -- certainly wasn't trying to do anything other than just show that difference in timing on capital expenditure. And with regard to Western, you're right, there's some purchase accounting that comes into play and that's a good thing. 2013 will see improved accretion as a result of that acquisition. I'm not in a position today to try to quantify that for you except to say that the bias on EPS will be higher the next year and subsequent years. And then with regard to -- let me take the low end of the guidance if I may Budd -- and I apologize for jumping around here, because we reckoned that question would come. And as we sat around and put forth our best estimate of a range, we reminded ourselves of what happened in 2010. Namely, we came out of the gate pretty robustly, pretty strong and by mid-year, we started to see some significant pullback in demand. We hope we're being conservative, but we think we're being realistic that, that could happen. So that really talks -- that talks to the lower end of that guidance. And then I read your notes this morning that you put out and I think you've done a good job of talking about what's going to cause this EPS shift and specifically, margins and reduced fixed costs on higher volumes certainly assist us. The restructuring benefits that I spoke about, that $0.07 to $0.10 certainly going to come to pass. A modest accretion in the first year here with Western and then those higher tax rates and interest expenses. As we know those are going to happen, and so we've gone ahead and put those into play. Stir that whole pot, it gets us in that approximate $1.30, $1.32 range. And so we bracketed $1.20, $1.40.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just if I can -- just to avoid Dave DeSonier's restrictions for one more time, just one more follow-up. On the Western Pneumatic, it is so project-related with the aerospace and the big projects that are going on with the airline companies, how do you get comfort that, that's a longer-lasting business and that there's something behind that?","David S. Haffner","Yes. That's an excellent question, and really we're glad you asked that because part of the due diligence, in fact a meaningful part of the due diligence that we did in conjunction with this Western Pneumatic team, which incidentally they're an outstanding team of management and partners in general. But that diligence had to do with the customer concentration, the breadth of the product line and the duration of those products and their application. They're very -- they're somewhat automotive-like and even longer their long-lived applications. And once you're able to be favored with that type of business, then the users of that product rarely will change suppliers over the life of that particular application. SO they're very long-lived. And so we gained a significant amount of comfort. And then of course, we're pleased to see the demand in global aircraft orders go up and certainly benefit from that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","A question within the commercial division. Within your guidance, could you tell me how you're thinking about Fixture & Display and Office Furniture for 2012?","Karl G. Glassman","Keith, this is Karl. From a commercial standpoint that we are looking from a top line perspective of a reduction in sales of about $20 million, some of that has to do with the divestiture of the U.K.-based POP facility and about flattish demand in the remaining business. Remember that we're going through this facility consolidation in Alabama. We expect that we'll retain the majority of that business. So store fixtures, while it's early and is by far the most difficult of our businesses to predict, we're looking at a flattish once you take out the POP business. Office is also a forecast of flat to slightly up. You'll note that the BIFMA forecast for 2012 is for flat to slightly negative in the macro BIFMA space. We feel pretty good or real good about our product placement and our relative position with specific customers. So we are up admittedly against some very difficult comps in that business, but feel good about our market position. It's just a question, does the market continue to stay strong?","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","The market for store fixtures?","Karl G. Glassman","The market for office.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","For office, okay. I guess on residential -- and if you could do the same thing just on Spring and Furniture, your expectation for '12?","Karl G. Glassman","On the spring side, our forecasts are slightly positive maybe a point, which correlates to the ISPA industry data of forecasted unit growth of 1%. They also -- and they incorporate all the specialty space, so some people would say our innerspring growth forecast may be bullish. I certainly feel that those that think that an innerspring is no longer part of a mattress didn't witness the Las Vegas market last week, didn't see the extreme proliferation of new innerspring designs, especially in hybrid placements. We feel good about the trend on innersprings. They were up in the fourth quarter. Innerspring sales in the January timeframe are up about 7%. So we feel good about the trend, but today's earlier point, we're a little spooked by the head fake that we've experienced in the last couple of years with a strong start and a diminished back half. From a hardware standpoint, specific to furniture, that business was under greater pressure in 2011 than was bedding. We saw a trough in the summer months. Saw some recovery toward the end of the year with hardware units being up about 7% in December. Feel good about the trend, I cannot give you a January trend number on furniture because of the Asian aspect of that business. And as you all know that the Chinese holidays were in January this year versus February last, so I don't have meaningful comparisons. But we would expect for the full year flat to slightly unit positive in that business as well. All in the backdrop of, as you yourself witnessed, significant optimism and really positive feelings coming out of the Las Vegas market last week. But we continue to be concerned as our customers about the back half of the year, the cost of advertising, the probability of a very contentious election. So we're guarded in our forecast.","Operator","Our next question comes from Leah Villalobos with Longbow Research.","Leah Villalobos - Longbow Research LLC","I just wanted to clarify on the quarter innerspring results, how much of that was share gains versus organic growth?","Karl G. Glassman","It was primarily recovery of previously lost share that you would have heard in our commentary or remember from a year ago that we spoke to some temporary loss to some opportunistic pricing from a European spring manufacturer that was highly correlated to the then very low euro exchange rate. We've regained that business in early 2011, so we're comping the recovery of that business. So probably 3 quarters of the pickup in the fourth quarter was the recovery of that business. In the first shipping weeks of this new year, we're still getting some benefit of that. We think about 50% of it was the recovery of that business and the other 50% was just a fact that business is better now than it was a year ago now.","Leah Villalobos - Longbow Research LLC","That's really helpful. And then just if I could one more on the International Springs business, we saw some nice growth numbers to last few quarters and I was just wondering if there's anything in terms of timing or if you're really seeing a contraction there versus kind of what you saw on the third quarter?","Karl G. Glassman","We started to see a little bit of slowing in specifically European spring in the fourth quarter with units down about 4.5% to 5%. Interestingly enough, they were up in December just from 100 basis points, but they were up. But we did see a little bit of contraction in January, which we've been expecting. Now remember, January, in all the data that I'm giving you, has one more shipping day in 2012 versus '11. But European spring was down about 10% in January. Latin American spring was up about 10% in January and was up -- as we continued to gain share, it was actually up 22% in the fourth quarter of last year, so we feel good about that. The real question is the cloud that hangs over Europe.","Operator","Your next question comes from Herb Hardt with Monness.","Herbert Hardt - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","With the plant closings, can you give us some sense of your operating rate? And if business starts to get more robust, is there any areas where you might run out of capacity?","Karl G. Glassman","Herb, good question. Our utilization rate at the end of the quarter was about 60%. We had not -- that does not take into consideration the majority of the restructuring activities that are really in process now. We expect through all of that we may lose as much as 500 basis points in total capacity, but it spread through the businesses in the appropriate areas, and all of that obviously, based on some longer-term forecast. The steel mill is, as I said, 100% utilized. The automotive and office sides have a little bit higher utilization rate than, say, a store fixtures would. I really look forward to running out of capacity in any of our businesses and long for the day when a customer is calling me saying that we can't keep up with them. It's been so long that I've kind of forgot how those calls take place, but I remember the EBIT margins that come with them.","David S. Haffner","Yes, but with the production capacity that we've got, Herb, it's unlikely we're going to need to make any meaningful capital expenditures for increased capacity if we keep the product mix that we've got through 2013 -- excuse me, through 2012. Come 2013, if the economy picks up, there are going to be 2 to 3 business units where we'll probably need to increase capacity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes, sorry to get back in. And Karl, the obvious issue in the bedding industry, I just wondered if you'd just step back and kind of philosophically talk about the changes that we're seeing in bedding between alternative sleep and the units of innerspring and where you think that goes. And if you could also maybe comment a little bit about the import situation and where that sits. I know you've had some recent conversations in our nation's capital on that. So maybe talk a bit about the whole philosophy of where you think -- where Leggett thinks this is going because you guys have as good a window on that as anybody. I know there's been a lot of conversation about that market now.","Karl G. Glassman","You and I certainly have a lot of conversations recently on this very issue. We believe today that alternative sleep or specialty, depending on how you define the terms, is about 10% of total industry units, probably in the 25% to 30% range in dollars, big future expectation of how large it can get is difficult. Admittedly, that product sells at some ultra-premium price points. Until recently, almost all above $2,000 at queen retail. That consumer certainly has been a more comfortable consumer allowing that business to grow significantly last year. Give a lot of credit to the people in that space, the Tempur-Pedics and Select Comforts who've done a wonderful job at pulling the consumer into the replacement cycle as opposed to the fulfillment replacement business that others have been doing. To give you an order magnitude though, I think that your statistics would tell us that Tempur sales were about 618,000 units in 2011. Admittedly, great growth. To give you that magnitude though, and I don't want to be overly defensive, but that's about 3 average shipping weeks for us. So 90% of the market is still alive and well, servicing a consumer that has been less confident than the ultra-premium consumer. Now what we saw in Las Vegas was a shift in that Tempur-Pedic along with some others specifically, Serta, have done a really good job of introducing new products that hit a target customer north of the $1,000 queen. And we believe that about 75% to 80% of sales are still below $1,000 at queen, that is very highly concentrated to an innerspring probably in the 98% range, don't know for sure. It's interesting in conversations with both Simmons and that they have done a lot of consumer market preference analysis and believe that at the $1,000 price point and above -- their own studies tell them that about 60% of consumers prefer an innerspring hybrid product that highly correlates to our own internal studies. That's why you saw Simmons focused on a hybrid product, that's why you saw Serta, obviously, those 2 share the same dataset, introduce a hybrid, hy [ph] series product. Sealy, there's no secrets in the bedding industry, certainly introduced a beauty rest hybrid product. It becomes a definition of terms issue. We had some conversation with a manufacturer at the Las Vegas market and asked him how things were doing and he said, \"Business is great. I'm having hard time selling innersprings.\" And we said, well, what's your best-selling introduction and he described the hybrid product that has our innerspring in it but he called it specialty. So we need to understand the definition of the terms. We are really optimistic about the launch of the hybrid product offerings and what the support of an innerspring combined with some alternative materials and the sleeping surface mean for the consumer. The fact that a high percentage of those introductions contain our products is rewarding. So we're bullish, at the same time that we're looking forward to the day that, that consumer that is more price sensitive comes back into the market. We'll learn a lot over the next few months. And as you know, the bedding demand cycle has changed a little bit. The biggest selling months historically going back in time were August, September. They're now February and March, highly correlated to tax refund season, so we'll see. It's a little bit too early to say what that demand will look like, but we're optimistic.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And the import issue?","David S. Haffner","The import issue. Go way back in time that you'll know that we filed an antidumping suit against the combination of China, South Africa and Vietnam believing that primarily China at that time and the others to a lesser degree, were dumping innersprings into the United States at lower than their cost of manufacture and lower than they were pricing their products in the domestic market. We then and today produce innersprings in China. We are very confident of that filing. The U.S. government agreed with us. At its peak, we were experiencing about 3.5 million innersprings coming into this country with the benefit of that antidumping and sister countervailing duty finding that new tariffs were put on those innersprings at the high rate of 235%, and we saw that the importation of that dumped product drop pretty significantly. Then again, early 2010, late 2009, we saw a spike in that product again, probably at the rate of 1 million pieces. So we've fixed 2\/3 of it, but there's about 1 million pieces that we believe that we closely track that are shipped into this country illegally, that by a transshipment, most of the point of origin is still China and all that happens is shipping documents change hands, and it looks on to the customs department that those products are produced in places like Malaysia and Singapore and Taiwan where there's not a big manufacturing base of innersprings. The reference that you made is that I did have the pleasure of testifying in front of a Senate trade subcommittee in May of last year, making the folks in Washington aware of that illegal transshipment. It's a nonpartisan issue, in that it's a jobs issue that we're losing jobs through the lack of enforcement of U.S. trade laws. And we continue to fight -- we hear good things, but one thing that I'm sure of in Washington is there is a propensity to point fingers at the other agency and to cut through the politics and the lack of inaction and the desire to enforce our laws, but seemingly the lack of ability is alarming. So as a U.S. taxpayer, we're certainly losing that revenue as a U.S. manufacturer is losing the ability to engage in increased job formation, and we continue to pursue that. It's rewarding to hear the talking heads, the politicians all talk about fair trade, but little is being done, so we'll continue to push.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on the acquisition. So if I'm hearing you right, there are going to be some purchase accounting adjustments. I assume that's around inventory in the first year that prevents more accretion. Is that correct?","Susan R. McCoy","Yes, that's correct, Keith.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and there will be a goodwill amortization that would hit over a longer period of time, correct?","Susan R. McCoy","Yes, it's intangible amortization. It's  -- we'll assign some value to the customer relationships and that's fairly meaningful.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And that you have to amortize that over time, is that correct?","Susan R. McCoy","Yes, that's right.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","But the inventory hit is just the first year?","Susan R. McCoy","That's correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Havard with Hilliard Lyons.","Joel K. Havard - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division","The text -- the release cited higher interest expense as a potential, at least marginal drag on the earnings power here. If Matt's in the room still, I wondered if he could elaborate on that debt picture. You don't have big maturities near term, but I don't see anything big coming on either. It looks like kind of '13, '14, some of the chunks start to roll off. Is that expected to be replaced or does cash flow take care of it? What are you looking at?","Matthew C. Flanigan","Good question, Joel. As we sit here today, we have our $6 million bank facility that we renewed in August, and it's a 5-year tenure, so we've got almost a full 5 years left. We're using about $300 million of that as we speak. The overnight volume rate is about 30 basis points. So we're happy to have that in place, feel real good about that. We anticipate to continue to use that as a source of financing, and it's obviously quite inexpensive, all things considered. In January, which is when we bought Western, too, that required about $188 million check to write. So that's the spike in the borrowing that has taken place, and we're glad it did so to make an acquisition come to pass. And so that will -- that's directly correlated to some of the incremental expense we will see on the interest line in 2012. We expect to pay that off significantly during the year, which also directly correlates [indiscernible] we do not anticipate to buy back many shares, if any at all, in 2012. If you look at our rolling forward maturities, we do have one coming around the corner in April of 2013 at $300 million. We expect to largely refinance most of that with an issuance later this year. That issuance will be about $200 million. And again, where we see interest rates today, the coupon on that would be something without our swaps noted in the 3.5% to 4% range. Once we factor in our swap, it will be something still south of 5%, again if rates stay just where they are right now. And so we would anticipate refinancing some of the upcoming maturity debt just in a pragmatic fashion. So nothing on the debt side or the overall leverage should give anybody pause. In fact, quite the contrary, we would anticipate that our net debt to cap ratio, which we often quote, would be near the end of the year about 30%, once again which is about where it was as we closed 2011.","Joel K. Havard - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division","And since we're all doing inherent follow-ups today, I wonder then, does that -- maybe this goes to Haffner, too, does that mean that to get into the quote target debt range that there's another more sizeable acquisition candidate or 2 on the horizon?","David S. Haffner","Yes. Joel, let me just say if I may, that the activity down the M&A department has picked up a bit, and we've got a few more things on the radar screen, as we say. There are some pretty critical criteria that we use. We've strengthened and refined our criteria requirements, so we're looking at, I think, generally fewer than higher quality targets. And we'll need to announce them as they happen, but we're working.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Robert Kelly of Sidoti & Company.","Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Forgive me if I missed this. Did you talk about, in your 2012 guidance, your expectations for the Western Pneumatic revenue?","Karl G. Glassman","We didn't talk about it specifically, Bob, but it's in the $60 million to $62 million range.","Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC","So revenue in '12 will be roughly even with what they did in 2011?","Karl G. Glassman","No, 2011 was about $55 million, $56 million.","Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay, got you. And then I believe you stated the EBIT margin for Western were -- I guess, is the right way to think about the EBIT margins for Western accretive to Leggett's corporate average?","David S. Haffner","Yes, I think the way to think of it, Bob, is that those margins in general are higher than the average margins otherwise.","Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC","And is that adjusted for the one-time inventory and purchase accounting adjustments you'll be making?","David S. Haffner","Yes, sir.","Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC","So once those fall away, significantly accretive?","David S. Haffner","Meaningfully, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dillard Watt with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Dillard Watt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","You mentioned a shift from interest segment to trade sales in the steel mill. Wondering what drove that shift. Was an addition of any new costumers or anything like that?","Karl G. Glassman","No. Really what happened was it was a reduction in internal demand which used to be the transfer or the sale of product intra-segment. So sales with the rod mill would move to the wire mill at market, remember. So there is an appropriate EBIT margin on all of that, but they were non-reported sales. We have now -- because of things being relatively soft and our ability to produce more tons at the sterling mill, we've shifted some of that business out into the trade steel industry, again, at very acceptable EBIT margins, but now we have a reported sale. So it becomes dilutive from that perspective.","Dillard Watt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Got you, okay. And then within the residential segment and I guess, really the whole business, what are you all thinking about in terms of the inflation impact from a year ago on revenue on a quarterly basis?","Karl G. Glassman","From an inflation perspective, we're today modeling no new inflation and we would have the continuation then of where you would have depressed prices in 1Q of last year, somewhat inflated prices in 2Q and then depending on the business, some selective givebacks in 3Q. So normalize the whole thing, and it's flattish.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time.

With me this morning are the following: Karl Glassman, who is President and CEO; Matt Flanigan, Executive VP and CFO; Perry Davis, Executive VP and President of both the Residential Products and Industrial Products segments; Mitch Dolloff, Executive VP and President of both the Furniture Products and Specialized Products segment; Susan McCoy, our VP of Investor Relations; and Wendy Watson, our Director of Investor Relations.","The agenda for our call this morning is as follows: Karl will start with a summary of the major statements we made in yesterday\u2019s press release and provide segment highlights. Matt will discuss financial details and address our outlook for the remainder of the year; and finally the Group will answer any questions that you have.","This conference call is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material.

Yesterday, we reported strong quarterly sales growth. Third quarter sales increased 6% to $1.01 billion, organic sales also grew 6% from strength in Automotive, Adjustable Bed and several other businesses, along with raw material related price inflation and currency impact.","Acquisitions added 2% to sales growth, but were offset by divestitures, which reduced sales by 2% in the quarter. Third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.61, down 9% versus $0.67 in third quarter of 2016. As expected, the benefit from stronger sales was more than offset by higher steel cost, including LIFO expense and the timing lag associated with passing along those higher cost.","In the third quarter last year, we were still benefiting from steel deflation. As a result, adjusted EBIT decreased in the quarter versus third quarter last year and adjusted EBIT margin declined 210 basis points to 11.6%. We have implemented price increases to recover most of this recent steel cost increases, but are experiencing the typical 90-day pricing lag. Assuming steel cost stabilize, market should improve early next year.","During the quarter, we divested the last remaining business within our commercial vehicle products group. From this transaction, we will recognize a total $0.06 per share tax benefit, of which $0.04 was recognized in the third quarter and the remainder will be recognized in the fourth quarter. This third quarter tax benefit was offset by a $0.02 per share loss related to the CVP divestiture and a $0.02 per share impairment charge related to another small business.","We acquired a producer of rebond carpet underlay during the quarter with annual revenue of approximately $20 million. This business adds to the production capacity and geographic footprint of our Carpet Cushion business.","Now on to the segments. In Residential Products, third quarter total sales increased 6%, with a 2% increase in organic sales and a 4% increase from acquisitions. Volume was flat, with growth in most businesses offset by a 2% sales decrease from lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds.","Raw material related price inflation and currency increased sales by 2%. We began to anniversary the Adjustable Bed headwind in the third quarter and the impact on sales will be decreased further over the next few quarters. U.S. Spring component dollar sales were flat with 8% growth in higher content Comfort Core units offsetting a 3% decrease in total innerspring units and a 6% decline in boxspring units.","International Spring sales continue to be very strong, with dollars up 15% in the quarter. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin improved, primarily from higher sales. In the Industrial Products segments, third quarter total sales decreased 7% due to divestitures completed in 2016 and a 3% reduction in organic sales.","Volume declines were partially offset by steel related price increases. The Industrial segment\u2019s EBIT and EBIT margin decreased due to higher steel costs, including LIFO expense. The timing lag associated with passing along inflation, lower volume and a $5 million impairment of a small wire products operation. In the third quarter last year, we were still benefiting from steel deflation in the segment.","In the Furniture Products segment, third quarter sales increased 8%. Organic sales increased 7%, primarily from growth in Adjustable Bed. A small Work Furniture acquisition completed earlier this year added 1% to sales growth. Adjustable Bed sales grew 35% in the third quarter. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin decreased with the benefit from sales growth in Adjustable Bed and Work Furniture more than offset by steel cost increases, including LIFO expense in Home Furniture.","In the Specialized Products segment, third quarter total sales increased 4%, organic sales increased 9% from continued strength in Automotive and a currency benefit. The CVP divestiture reduced sales by 5%. Excluding currency, Automotive sales grew 8% in the quarter. The segment\u2019s EBIT and EBIT margin decreased with the benefit from higher sales offset by growth-related costs, currency adjustments and a $3 million loss on the sale of our last remaining CVP business.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Matt.","Matt Flanigan","Thanks, Karl. And good morning, everyone. Cash from operations was $105 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $18 million versus the third quarter of last year. We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 11.6%. We expect our full year operating cash to approximate $425 million.","Regarding uses of cash for the full year, capital expenditures should be near $160 million and a dividends should require about $185 million. In August, we increased the quarterly dividend by $0.02 to $0.36 per share, a 5.9% increase versus the third quarter of 2016. The dividend payout, as a percentage of adjusted earnings, is within our targeted range of 50% to 60%, and we continue to expect future dividend growth to approximate earnings growth.","At yesterday\u2019s closing price of $48.23, our current yield is 3%, which is one of the highest yields among the 51 companies that comprise the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 900,000 shares of our stock and issued about 400,000 shares.","For the first three quarters of 2017, we have repurchased 3.3 million shares and issued 1.6 million, primarily for employee benefit plans. As always, our top priorities for use of cash are organic growth, dividends and strategic acquisitions. After funding these priorities, if there\u2019s still cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock rather than repay debt early or stockpiling cash.","We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. However, those specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. Our financial base remains very strong. We ended the third quarter with net debt to net capital of 38%, near the higher end of our long standing target range of 30% to 40%, reflecting working capital investment, stock repurchases and acquisitions.","We also monitor debt-to-EBITDA and ended the quarter with debt at 2.1 times our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling three-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top one-third of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year.","For the three-year period that will end on December 31, 2017, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 7% per year and that performance places us in the middle of the S&P 500. As we announced yesterday, we raised the low end of our sales and earnings guidance. Full year sales are now anticipated to be $3.95 billion to $4 billion or up 5% to 7% over the last year.","We expect mid single-digit volume growth from strength in Automotive, Adjustable Bed, International Spring, Work Furniture and Geo Components. Raw material related price increases should also add to sales growth. Divestitures should be largely offset by acquisitions. Full year guidance for earnings per share from continuing operations is now $2.49 to $2.54.","These earnings include a net $0.04 per share benefit from several items, including a tax benefit from the CVP divestiture, a CVP divestiture loss and a small impairment charge, along with a real estate gain and an anticipated pension settlement charge, both of which will be recognized in the fourth quarter. Full year adjusted EPS guidance is now $2.45 to $2.50. Based upon this guidance range, we anticipate the 2017 full year adjusted EBIT margin to approximate 12%.","With those comments, I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to David.","David DeSonier","That concludes our prepared remarks. We thank you for your attention and we will be glad to answer your questions. In order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate, we will request that you ask only one question and then give it to the next participant. If you have additional questions, you\u2019re welcomed to reenter the queue and we will answer those questions as well. Sherry, we are ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse. Please state your question.","Susan Maklari","Good morning.","Karl Glassman","Good morning.","Susan Maklari","I guess, first question is you had some really nice growth in auto and I know that there\u2019s been a little bit of concern there around the U.S. producers and what\u2019s been going on in that market. Can you just talk a little bit to what you\u2019re seeing in some of the out performance that you\u2019ve realized?","Mitch Dolloff","Sure. This is Mitch Dolloff. Thanks for the question. Yes. Definitely, we see some changes in North America for the third quarter. We think production in North America was off about 8% and the real change there is having plant shutdowns over the summer season. But some of those continue today where we didn\u2019t see those in the last few years. I think in the long run, that\u2019s probably a positive thing as the OEMs ramped down production in an effort to balance vehicle inventories at the dealerships. I think that we see \u2013 we\u2019re seeing that to be effective, the latest data I see shows that the vehicle inventories are, indeed, coming down from August.","And then we see the fourth quarter forecast \u2013 production forecast for North America has been down about 3% year-over-year. So definitely more paying in the third quarter than we see going forward. But that puts the full year year-over-year unit production down somewhere around 2.5%, 2.7%. And then, the longer term forecast is relatively flat. So the 2018, the latest forecast shows that 2% unit increase, but \u2013 so, but out during the longer term, probably relatively flat. But remember that, that\u2019s at a really high number of vehicles. So at 17.5 million vehicles produced a year in North America, we\u2019re happy with that.","And then if you remember, we\u2019re very much a global business. So if we look across the industry as a whole, I think it still remains very healthy. See good performance in Europe, in Asia as well. So for what we would consider our major developed markets, I think that long-term CAGR were around 1.5% looks pretty solid. And again, we continue to pledge and are determined to outperform in the market. We continue to do so, not only from vehicle unit growth, but increased content gains and different product categories that we\u2019re participating in.","Susan Maklari","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then in terms of scrap steel prices, following these storms, it sounds like there could be some more volume that comes in as we get all of those sort of cars and appliances and what have you into that market. Can you just talk a little bit to maybe what you\u2019ve seen on the pricing there? And what that could mean for you guys looking out to 2018?","Perry Davis","Yes. Susan, this is Perry Davis. If you go back through the latter part of the quarter, we were rolling along in September, hearing a lot of chatter around considerably higher scrap prices coming. And within probably three days towards the end of the settlement period, totally reversed. And in fact, we saw some decreases in scrap, but there were some already announced increases in the rod side of the business. So actually the scrap market right now, compared to the year, for the most part, looks to be relatively stable through the remainder of this year. However, as always, I put a caveat on that, that things can change quickly.","Susan Maklari","Okay. And have you seen rod today elevated? Rod as well as\u2026.","Karl Glassman","Rod, has \u2013 like I said, did go up in October. We are seeing rumblings in the marketplace of that coming back off some as scrap prices, like I said, have stayed stable to down.","Susan Maklari","Okay. Perfect, thank you guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Budd Bugatch with Raymond James. Please state your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, guys. This is for Bobby, actually filling for Budd. Hope everybody\u2019s doing well. And I will thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to first touch on Bedding. Units were still down this quarter, but it looks like they performed better than kind of what we saw in the first half. What exactly are you kind of hearing from your customers as any type of indication, maybe that end market\u2019s finally starting to stabilize a little bit?","Karl Glassman","Yes. Generally, seems like a little better mood in the Bedding category. We did see strengthening of our business on year-to-year comps as we went through the quarter. As I talked about on the last call, in June, business was not good at all and we began to see just a little bit of improvement in July. And then August and September were considerably better, although still slightly down from last year. One of the big issues right now that many of our customers are dealing with is because of the increased chemical input cost, we\u2019re seeing a lot of rising foam cost. And that, in a way, could serve to help us with some of our content gains with regards to Quantum Edge and some of the other things that we\u2019re doing with upholstery layers made out of springs as opposed to foam. But it will be interesting to see there, the foam cost, we\u2019ve heard, for the year, for a lot of our customers, increased by 20% to 25%, and those are just simply cost increases that they can\u2019t absorb. So I would expect to see some of those costs be passed through to retail.","Unidentified Analyst","Appreciate that. And that was actually part of my second question. The Quantum Edge, if the uptake does come because of the higher foam prices that would be something we probably see in the January Las Vegas market? In terms of more manufacturers adopting the product and moving towards that way. Or is that something they can do on the fly, basically to say, like as we move through the rest of the year?","Karl Glassman","Yes. For the larger producers, it would be tougher to kind of do it on the fly. Those lead times for rollouts of those introductions are longer than this. They\u2019re probably, I would say set, with what they\u2019re going to be at in January. However, they\u2019ve known for some time that foam pricing is escalating. So we expect to see continued penetration of Quantum Edge in the category. I remember back in July on the call, we were talking about the fact that we were seeing those content gains, but it was hard to pull them out because the overall macro conditions of the Bedding market were so poor at that time. Now in the third quarter, we began to really see the benefit from our side on content gains associated with Quantum Edge.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. And then lastly for me, on the adjustable base sales growth, can you maybe update us just on how the timing of the new programs have been rolling out? Are we kind of towards the end of rod and new programs? Or do you expect more programs through the fourth quarter and kind of into 2018 to help me think about modeling that growth?","Mitch Dolloff","Bobby, this is Mitch. Yes, I think that we\u2019ll continue to see those programs roll out as some of the select business programs continue to ramp up. So it\u2019s something that I think, is still dynamic for us.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, in ex-select \u2013 on the non-select based programs, is it new retail doors or you adding SKUs to independent kind of specialty retailers? How do I think about that, that way the growth is driving?","Mitch Dolloff","Well, I think it\u2019s continued growth at the major retailers and then also additional penetration, I think, at some of the top 20 kind of accounts and below that we service through our patch specialty bed group, some of them are programs that we manufacture ourselves and some of them are import program. So it\u2019s really kind of across the board. We try and have the right solution for the different retailer\u2019s need.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. I appreciate all the detail. Congratulations on the result, and I will jump back in the queue.","Operator","Our next question is from Keith Hughes with SunTrust Robinson & Humphrey. Please state your question.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. First question on the Furniture business, you had some nice revenue growth, still some steel issues there in the quarter. As you move into the fourth, do you see this kind of revenue gain, do you think margins will turn positive year-over-year in furniture or there\u2019s still be a steel lag?","Mitch Dolloff","Mitch again. Yes, I think we have a couple of different dynamics in the Work Furniture business. We\u2019re very pleased there. We continue to see volume gains and improved profitability. The real drag on the quarter was in Home Furniture where unit volumes were off about 3%, and that was then more impacted by higher steel costs. So we\u2019re starting to pass through some of the steel costs. So we expect that will continue to see that recovery improve through the fourth quarter and into 2018. So we\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019ll be back in the cost of the territory that you mentioned as we go further into 2018.","Keith Hughes","Okay. And just a big picture question in terms of demand. As you look into the fourth quarter, is your businesses that you expect to accelerate or doing better than we saw in the third quarter? I mean, your guidance across something better\u2026","Karl Glassman","Keith, actually I think, what you\u2019re making reference to is the expectation that we\u2019re going to see stronger sales dollars in the fourth quarter from a sequential basis. And a good bit of that is recognition of the pricing rolling through. So there\u2019s the catch-up impact of that. Auto should be a little stronger because we\u2019ll, as Mitch said, we won\u2019t have this headwind of North American challenges. But in the content gains, we\u2019ll continue. But there\u2019s not one business unit that we say is going to have spectacular growth. We\u2019re really pleased with the growth across all of Leggett. Admittedly, the U.S. Bedding comps get a little easier going forward. But my goodness, the company from a top line is performing pretty well. Give us the benefit of the continued inflation pass-through and it gets that much better.","Keith Hughes","Okay. So it\u2019s price. That\u2019s \u2013 you expect, price to accelerate?","Karl Glassman","Yes.","Keith Hughes","Okay. Thank you","Karl Glassman","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Pets [ph] with Stifel. Please take your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I appreciate the color on the Automotive industry and your outlook. You mentioned the CAGR growing about 1%, does that mean that you guys still think this \u2013 long term could be double-digit growing business?","Mitch Dolloff","This is Mitch again. Yes, we do. We still stand by our statement that we\u2019re determined to grow 1,000 basis points faster than the market. In the long run, we\u2019ve seen that, and we believe we\u2019ll continue to be capable of doing that.","Karl Glassman","We\u2019ve taken the position historically based on awarded programs and the visibility that we have that we\u2019re confident through 2019 based on awards that we have recently received. I think Mitch would, well I\u2019m committing Mitch now, to continue that 10 basis points or 1,000 basis points, I\u2019m sorry, over global build at least through 2020. The good thing of Automotive is we have really good long-term visibility.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. And then back to the Bedding market. Spring volumes weren\u2019t down as much. Is that an improvement in your customer base? You mentioned customers a lot. Or is that the way the industry is tracking? I\u2019m trying to wonder if maybe you are gaining market share or if you could just provide a little more color there, industry versus what your customers are doing?","Karl Glassman","Well, I think there\u2019s two sides to that. In the U.S. I\u2019d say it\u2019s more a function of just an overall \u2013 a bit of a lift to the market. If you look at our international business, particularly in Europe and in South America, we have made some strides there as far as gaining share and increasing our business in both of those geographies.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s all from me.","Operator","Yes. Our next question is from Justin Bergner with Gabelli & Company. Please take your question.","Justin Bergner","Thank you. Good morning and appreciate taking my questions. To start, I wanted to just touch on the issue of market share in Bedding. You mentioned on the last question that you were gaining share in Europe and South America. Do you think you\u2019re also gaining share in U.S. and sort of how do you measure share given some of the dynamic changes in the market towards that in the box and that sort of trend?","Karl Glassman","Justin, we don\u2019t talk in specific with regards to share, but we believe our share of the U.S. market is relatively stable. There are, obviously, and has been for quite some time, talk about alternative bedding producers. Producers who make primarily for the digital marketplace and we participate in that business. Maybe not quite to the degree that we do in the standard legacy Bedding business, but our position there is growing and growing quickly. A lot of the producers of those products are OEM manufacturers who simply make those products and put a brand label on them. They\u2019re produced to their specifications and a lot of that is innerspring, specifically Comfort Core.","And while we\u2019re talking about that, Comfort Core obviously is a category that continues to grow for us year-on-year. But if you look at the quarter, we\u2019re up over about 36.5% of the units we sell our Comfort Core. But if you look a little deeper, in September, that was generally a five-week period for us, five-week month in our accounting system. Our share of innerspring represent by Comfort Core ramped up about 39% and that is just an indication to me of continued growth of the category, which is good for us. Curious with the higher average in the selling prices.","Justin Bergner","Okay, got it. So it seems like what you\u2019re suggesting is that you\u2019re \u2013 outside of the bed-in-the-box, you\u2019re actually gaining share and making off \u2013 making up for whatever, I guess, headwinds might be created from that alternative channel.","Karl Glassman","Yes. And we\u2019re definitely gaining content. It\u2019s difficult in the U.S. for us to gain absolute share other than the domestic produced bed-in-the-box conversion to hybrid that Perry made reference to, but in the traditional bedding environment, we are gaining significant content per bed, not only in this Quantum Edge configuration, but in the micro-coils at the top layer. And based on the conversation with, I think it was Bobby earlier, that because of foam inflation, we expect that to accelerate.","Justin Bergner","Okay. Okay. Switching gears. You mentioned a couple small acquisitions, one that you made, I think a quarter or two ago, one that you made this quarter. Could you just provide us a little bit more detail?","Karl Glassman","Yes. The most recent one was a carpet cushion acquisition in North Carolina that are \u2013 we were at capacity running near 100%. We were fortunate enough to pick up a large regional program from one of the very large U.S. retailers. So we were able to fill in some needed capacity there and pick up some innovative manufacturing techniques in that industry as well. So we\u2019re really pleased to have made that acquisition. The earlier year acquisition was a company based in Michigan that produces decorative exposed tubing into the office Work Furniture business. That acquisition has been performing very, very well. So we\u2019re pleased to have both of them as part of the Leggett family.","Justin Bergner","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then lastly, on the Work Furniture side, it seems like there\u2019s been some deceleration in that business. Is there any meaningful driver behind that, be it end market trends or otherwise? Obviously, you\u2019re including some inorganic factors there as well on the current quarter\u2019s numbers.","Mitch Dolloff","This is Mitch again. I don\u2019t really think so. I mean, bit more forecast is around 2%. We continue to, I think, have strong growth, particularly on the finished goods or collaborative seating side. So we remain optimistic about that business in the longer term.","Justin Bergner","And the growth forecast of 2%, is that for you or is that sort of the market?","Mitch Dolloff","That\u2019s the market.","Justin Bergner","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Karl Glassman","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Spencer Joyce with Hilliard Lyons. Please take your question.","Spencer Joyce","Good morning, thanks for taking the call.","Karl Glassman","Good morning.","Spencer Joyce","A lot covered so far, so I\u2019ll try to be brief for you. I want to talk about specialized or specialty products segment for a second. Adjusted EBITDA margin at 16.4%, by my model, looks like the lowest we\u2019ve seen, at least for us the last past couple of years. And I know on the slides, you mentioned some growth-related cost and some growth-oriented spending there. And I\u2019m wondering if there were some one-off items that hit the third quarter or if perhaps the 16.4% we have from Q3 has some read through value into mid-Q4 and Q1?","Mitch Dolloff","This is Mitch again. Yes, you\u2019re right. We did have growth related costs that impacted us in the third quarter year-over-year. Those are mainly investments in fixed overhead that we\u2019re making to support our future growth that we\u2019ve been talking about so much this morning. Those include buildings, equipment, tooling and people. For example, we have ramping up a new plant in China, a new one in Mexico or we have an expansion under way in Canada. All of those things are to support new programs that we\u2019ve won. We have to ramp up that capacity ahead of the start of production of those programs and then those programs ramp up and hit full volume over time. So it does get a little choppy some time. So yes, I think that the third quarter margin was a little bit lower than it has been historically and we expect to see that improve as those volumes ramp up and start to fill that capacity.","Spencer Joyce","Okay. So obviously, you\u2019ve been making some similar investments over the past few years. I guess, is it fair to say there was just kind of a confluence of items maybe that hit Q3?","Mitch Dolloff","Yes, that\u2019s absolutely right.","Spencer Joyce","Okay. And then just kind of a follow-up here on the Specialized segment. It really seems like the Automotive piece has been dominating the conversation for that segment on this call and in kind of over most of this year and I\u2019m wondering if you can talk a little bit about the aerospace side, either qualitatively, trends that you\u2019re seeing there and then more specifically for Leggett, is that saving a little bit as far as strategic importance goes, kind of as we look out over the next handful of years?","Mitch Dolloff","Okay. Great question. So, no. I think that we \u2013 I think we talk more about Automotive just because the size is so much bigger, right? Aerospace remains a relatively small business for us today, but we\u2019ve done a lot of work around finding the right spot for us to really grow that business in the industry and especially this year and I think we\u2019re coming out of that with a strategy that we feel really good about. We\u2019ve done a few small acquisitions over the last couple of years and those are performing well, particularly on the fabricated side. And we\u2019re starting to \u2013 and we are seeing organic program wins on the good programs that are going forward in the future and I hope that you\u2019ll see us continue to do some more acquisitions there over time. So we remain very positive on the aerospace business.","Spencer Joyce","Okay. Thanks for the comments and congrats on a nice calls after the quarter here. That\u2019s all I had.","Operator","Our next question is from Herbert Hardt with Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co. Please take your question.","Herbert Hardt","Good morning. I also have a question on aerospace. You folks since spent a great deal of time, I believe, on acquisitions and have made at least five, if not a few more, along the way. And is that still a focus for expansion at this point?","Mitch Dolloff","This is Mitch again. Yes, it definitely is a focus for expansion for us. We think that we have some attractive areas that we can participate in that will build-out our competitive advantage in this \u2013 in the market, and we\u2019re pursuing acquisitions as we speak.","Herbert Hardt","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Please take your question.","Peter Keith","Hi, good morning everyone. Couple of questions for you. First off, on the hurricane impacts or the hurricane dynamics during the quarter. Curious on some of your U.S. segments, if you saw any disruption and maybe how kind of trends progressed before during and after those hurricane events?","Karl Glassman","Peter, it points in time, there were probably some minimal disruption. The large bedding retailers literally weren\u2019t functioning in, first, Texas and then Florida for a few days. We\u2019ve made no effort to try to quantify hurricane impact. There probably was a little bit of pick up in Carpet Cushion. We saw that Bedding generally, you\u2019ll see a little bit of a pick up on the promotional side longer term, which we have not yet seen the premium part of the industry picks up. So disruptive for sure, impacted our people and our customers and our customers\u2019 people, almost impossible to quantify.","Peter Keith","Okay. Fair enough. And then as we\u2019re looking at continued inflation, do you have \u2013 a couple of your U.S. segments have been a bit challenge from a unit perspective and we\u2019re looking specifically like Bedding and the Domestic Furniture. Are you in a position where you\u2019re having any difficulty passing through full price increases? Or are you getting any push back from some of your customers?","Karl Glassman","Yes. In Bedding, there\u2019s \u2013 not to say there\u2019s never difficulty because it\u2019s always a conversation, but those \u2013 the pricing pass-through is so program-specific that we do not have a hard time at all recovering inflation. Home Furniture is a little different challenge in that there are \u2013 there\u2019s an additional dynamic of steel inflation or deflation in China that is not connected to the timing of inflation or deflation in the U.S. And that industry has been a little bit soft from a demand perspective.","So as Mitch said earlier, we certainly had a hard time passing through in the Asian operations a spike in inflation. Now that steel inflation has started to regress somewhat where we saw a 23% increase in flat steel in China over a two-month period of July and August. Yet we\u2019ve seen some of that pull back at the same time. We now have an ability to recover some of it from a pricing perspective. U.S. steel is flatter, if that makes sense, that there\u2019s been less movement in U.S. steel than there has been in Chinese steel inflation.","Peter Keith","Okay. Thanks, Karl. And maybe to follow on that big picture wise, if we\u2019re just looking at the EBIT margins of the business, down 210 basis points, so you\u2019re down on declining margins from last year and, I guess, the big picture question is, is it just a function of you were getting inflation on top of inflation? Or is there something mix-wise that\u2019s starting to put some pressure on the overall margin structure?","Matt Flanigan","I think it\u2019s a deflation versus inflation answer in that our margins at the company level in 3Q 2017 were extremely high because we were getting the benefit of a deflationary environment having not past that deflation yet through to our customers and we have the absolute inverse situation 3Q 2017, where we\u2019ve received the inflation and have not yet fully recovered. So it\u2019s really just a delta point in time issue.","Peter Keith","Okay. Fair enough. One last question, maybe for Matt. On my math, we had your tax rate for the full year at 25%. It looks like now you\u2019re implying kind of 22% to 23%. So two questions there. Did it step down for the back half of the year? And I guess, as the race to the high end of the guidance will exits only from the lower tax rate?","Matt Flanigan","Well, generally, it\u2019s stepping down a bit once again largely a function of where is the income coming from and what are the tax impacts associated with that. So it\u2019s a bit noisy, of course, for some of the tax benefit activity that happened in the third quarter and prospectively in the fourth quarter. And this might be a little bit of help. As you look to 2018, as we sit here today, we\u2019re estimating our tax rate will be something around 25% to 26%. Who knows what happens with tax reform, but that\u2019s currently what we\u2019re ballparking for 2018 as we\u2019re thinking about the next 12 months.","Susan McCoy","Peter, I\u2019m going to add on a little bit onto that if I can. We would have been about 24%, I think, it\u2019s the last second quarter for our full year assumed tax rate when we announced in early September, we\u2019ve moved that down to about 23% given a couple more months of progression. I would tell you that our third quarter adjusted tax rate, when you allow for the one-off things that we put in the table at the back of the press release was 24%. And based on what we know right now, an adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter would also be 24%. The change in our guidance from the September release is volume. It\u2019s not a change tax rate assumption, it\u2019s us getting more confident around kind of that upper half of the volume range and it\u2019s kind of a reassessment of where we sit from a steel perspective and confidence and to what \u2013 to the extent that we can have confidence in the volatile steel market that kind of how the next two months might look.","Karl Glassman","Yes, to pile on to what Susan said, I completely agree with her, which is usually, but it\u2019s a big thing for me to do. But it is volume, but understand, Perry made reference to the steel dynamics in our \u2013 the assumptions that we made over steel inflation on September 6 versus what we experienced is very, very different and that we were expecting significant scrap inflation on September 6 by \u2013 when we print release. By September 20th, we knew that scrap was going to soften some. And had no ability to forecast the softness that we\u2019ve experienced in October. So the steel industry is very, very difficult to forecast. That is a U.S. steel manufacturer, it really is up to what global demand looks like and what China decides to do.","Peter Keith","Okay. Thanks to all the color guys and good luck to the rest of the year.","Karl Glassman","Thanks Peter.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have a follow-up question from Keith Hughes of SunTrust Robinson & Humphrey. Please take your question.","Keith Hughes","Yes, just turning back to mattresses with the growth in bed-in-the-box. I know you\u2019ve done some work for folk doing spring in a box, you can just out of talk about where you are there and what kind of trend you\u2019re seeing.","Mitch Dolloff","Well, yes, Keith, a couple of areas where we\u2019ve got kind of longer term established players in the market. We\u2019re seeing a \u2013 continuing to see interest in diversifying product lines. Some of the people that had one bed early on, as you know, are now coming out with multiple lines. We also are seeing an increase in the number of those folks that want to participate in the foundation market and have developed products specifically for that, that can be shipped, UPS of all type products and it\u2019s an add-on sales for those customers.","Other OEM manufacturers and also some of the Internet purveyors of mattresses are heavily into innerspring and that skews heavily, as I said earlier, to Comfort Core. And that\u2019s been the case for some period of time. We\u2019ve got a large manufacturers producing both for direct consumer and boxed products B2B, boxed products going on anywhere from \u2013 to Amazon, you name it, any of those large, large sellers.","Keith Hughes","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","Karl Glassman","We appreciate your time and we will do this again on February 5, I think it\u2019s after the New Year.

With me today are the following: Dave Haffner, our CEO and President; Karl Glassman, the Chief Operating Officer; Matt Flanigan, our CFO; and Susan McCoy, who is Staff Vice President of Investor Relations.","The agenda for the call this morning is as follows. Dave Haffner will start with a summary of the major statements we made in yesterday's press release. Karl will provide operating highlights. Dave will then address our outlook for 2013. And finally, the group will answer any questions you have.","This conference is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material. This call may not be transcribed, recorded or broadcast without our expressed permission. A replay is available from the IR portion of Leggett's website.","We posted to the IR portion of the website a set of PowerPoint slides that contain summary financial information. Those slides supplement the information we discuss on this call, including non-GAAP reconciliations.","I need to remind you that remarks today concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results or events may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the section in our 10-K entitled Forward-Looking Statements.","I'll now turn the call over to Dave Haffner.","David S. Haffner","Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call. We're very pleased with the operational progress we made in 2012. As expected, we realized significant earnings leverage as unit volumes grew in several of our businesses. This led to higher earnings and significantly improved margins. We completed the restructuring activity that was initiated in late 2011 and realized the anticipated benefits.","Western Pneumatic Tube, which was the first large acquisition we've made since our strategic change, exceeded our performance expectations during its first year in our portfolio. We have also maintained our focus on optimizing returns. Working capital levels remained lean throughout the year and operating cash grew significantly. Before I elaborate further on those details, I would like to thank all of our employee partners for their hard work that contributed to this 2012 progress.","As we reported yesterday, full year same-sales location increased 1% in 2012. Unit volumes increased 3% but were partially offset by lower trade sales from our rod mill and changes in currency rates. Full year unit volume growth was driven by several key businesses, including automotive, U.S. spring, adjustable bed, geo components, carpet underlay and parts of residential furniture components.","2012 earnings were a record $1.70 per share at the high end of the adjusted guidance we issued on January 10, which incorporated the $0.18 fourth quarter unusual net tax benefit. 2012 earnings from continuing operations adjusted to exclude unusual net tax benefits in both the second and fourth quarters were also a record at $1.46 per share.","In 2011, full year earnings adjusted to exclude fourth quarter restructuring-related costs were $1.20 per share. This 22% increase in adjusted EPS primarily reflected benefits from higher unit volume, cost improvements and the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition.","EBIT grew and EBIT margins also improved to 9.2% for the full year. Fourth quarter same-location sales decreased 2% versus the fourth quarter of 2011. Unit volumes increased 1% but were more than offset by lower trade sales from our rod mill. Unit volume growth during the fourth quarter primarily occurred in key residential businesses, including U.S. Spring, Adjustable Bed, Carpet Underlay and parts of Residential Furniture Components.","Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding the unusual net tax benefits, were $0.32. In the fourth quarter of 2011, earnings excluding the restructuring-related expenses were $0.22 per share. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects cost improvements, higher unit volumes and the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition.","Cash from operations increased 37% to $450 million during 2012 on stronger earnings and improvements in working capital levels largely from reductions in accounts receivable. Optimizing returns on capital employed continues to be a major focus for our operations.","We ended the year with working capital at 13.2% of annualized sales, well below our 15% target. Our financial base remains very strong. We ended 2012 with net debt to net capital at 29%, slightly below the conservative end of our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%. In August, we issued $300 million of 10-year notes. With the proceeds, we reduced our use of commercial paper and ended the year with our entire $600 million commercial paper program fully available.","2012 marked the 41st consecutive annual dividend increase for the company. During the year, we increased the quarterly dividend by $0.01 to $0.29 per share. Even the recent increase in share -- with the recent increase in share price, Leggett & Platt possesses one of the highest dividend yields among all of the S&P 500's dividend aristocrats.","At yesterday's closing price of $29.04, the current dividend yield is 4%. Given the $188 million cash outlay to acquire Western Pneumatic Tube, our share repurchases were at levels well below those of recent years. During 2012, we purchased 2 million shares of our stock and issued 4.7 million shares, 2\/3 of the issuances related to employee stock options exercises which increased notably in 2012 with a significant share price appreciation during the year.","Consistent with our stated priorities for use of excess cash flow, we will prudently buy back our stock, subject to the outlook for the economy, our level of cash generation and other potential opportunities to strategically grow the company. We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year, but has -- we have established no specific repurchase commitment or timetable.","We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1\/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3 years ending December 31, 2012, we generated TSR of 16% per year on average, which places us in the top 37% of the S&P 500 companies, just shy of our goal to be in the top 1\/3. Our shareholders continued to benefit from our effort to achieve consistently strong TSR by profitably growing revenue, improving our margins, paying meaningful dividends and buying back our stock.","With those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman who will provide some operating highlights. Karl?","Karl G. Glassman","Thank you, Dave. Good morning. In my comments this morning, I'll discuss a few segment highlights. You will find additional details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website.","In the Residential Furnishings segment, same-location sales increased 4% in the fourth quarter, entirely from higher unit volumes. In our U.S. spring business, innerspring unit volumes grew 6% in the quarter and boxspring units increased 4%. Growth of Comfort Core, which is our pocketed coil product offering continues to significantly outpace the other innerspring categories and was up 35% in the quarter. This is being driven in part by strong market reception of hybrid mattresses. For the full year, innerspring units grew 4% and boxspring units were up 1%.","Volume in Furniture Components increased 2% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the year. Continued growth throughout the year in our seating and sofa sleeper businesses was partially offset by a 4% fourth quarter and full year decrease in motion hardware unit volumes. Again, this quarter, we had significant growth in Adjustable Beds, with unit shipments up 21%. For the year, units grew 27%.","We also had meaningful sales growth in carpet underlay in both the fourth quarter and full year. Fourth quarter EBIT and EBIT margins increased versus the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily due to the absence of last year's restructuring-related cost and higher unit volumes.","In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, same-location sales decreased 4% in the fourth quarter. Fixture & Display sales decreased 9% on lower retailer spending. Sales in Office Furniture components increased 2% during the quarter, which we believe is roughly in line with the overall market for office seating.","EBIT and EBIT margins improved during the quarter, primarily benefiting from prior cost improvement initiatives, the absence of last year's restructuring-related cost and increased production related to programs that will ship in the first quarter of 2013.","We anticipate a strong start to 2013 in this segment. We have been awarded several major programs by various retailers that should have a positive impact in the first quarter on not only our wood operations, but metal and import operations as well. In the third quarter of 2013, we will face a very strong 2012 comparison from large programs that shipped last fall. And typically, fourth quarter volumes declined significantly versus third quarter. We expect that normal sequential decline again this year.","In the Industrial Materials segment, fourth quarter same-location sales decreased 15%, primarily from lower trade sales at our rod mill. Across the remainder of the segment, unit volumes were essentially flat. The decrease in trade sales of steel rod during the quarter was largely offset by an increase in intercompany rod sales, so total rod production in the quarter was roughly flat with the prior year.","The rod mill continues to run at 100% capacity utilization. Despite the negative sales headlines they create, lower trade sales abroad are generally neutral to earnings if production levels are stable and we're consuming the rod in our own mills, which was the case in the fourth quarter. EBIT and EBIT margins for the segment increased primarily due to the absence of last year's restructuring-related cost, cost improvements and earnings from the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition.","As Dave mentioned earlier, we are very pleased with the performance of the Western acquisition. The business exceeded our initial first year forecast, and as expected, generated full year 2012 margins greater than the company average.","In the Specialized Products segment, fourth quarter same-location sales increased slightly. Automotive continued to experience strong growth in North America, but this was offset by lower demand in Europe, with sales in Asia essentially flat. Sales grew during the quarter in Commercial Vehicle Products, but this increase was offset by lower machinery volume. EBIT and EBIT margins increased during the quarter, primarily from the absence of last year's restructuring-related cost.","With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave.","David S. Haffner","Thank you, Karl. You guys did a great job this past quarter. As we stated yesterday in our press release, we anticipate further improvement in sales and earnings in 2013. For the full year, we expect sales growth between 1% and 6%, resulting in sales of $3.75 billion to $3.95 billion. Given this sales growth and the contribution margin we expect from incremental unit volumes, we anticipate 2013 earnings from continuing operations of $1.50 to $1.75 per share. This compares to the $1.46 of adjusted EPS from continuing operations that we reported in 2012.","As Karl mentioned in his comments, our store fixtures business will likely experience some quarterly earnings volatility again this year, with a relatively strong first quarter of 2013 currently anticipated. For 2013, we expect to generate over $350 million of operating cash, again, comfortably exceeding the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends.","During calendar 2013, dividends should require about $125 million of cash, which is lower than a typical year since the dividend normally paid in January 2013 was accelerated into December 2012 in anticipation of tax rate changes. Capital expenditures in 2013 should not exceed $100 million.","And with those comments, I will now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier.","David M. DeSonier","That concludes our prepared remarks. We thank you for your attention and we will be glad to try to answer your questions. In order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate, we request that you ask your single best question and then voluntarily yield to the next participant. If you have additional questions, please reenter the queue and we'll be happy to answer all the questions you have. Claudia, we're ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Keith Hughes with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","A question on the Industrial segment. The intersegment sales in Industrial Materials were up only modestly in the fourth compared to the fourth quarter of last year. With all the inter-usage of the materials, wouldn't that number have been higher if the -- most of the subs are going internal?","Susan R. McCoy","Keith, the trades -- or the sales out of the rod mill, when we sell those to ourselves, those actually go to our own wire mills, which are all within that one segment, so those never get reported in any form of -- in terms of a sale.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So the issue here was a sale from your rod mill to your wire mill versus your rod mill going external to the company, is that correct?","Susan R. McCoy","That's correct.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Is that something that's going to continue in the future?","Karl G. Glassman","Keith, it was a big issue. This is Karl. There is a -- it was a big issue starting in the third quarter of 2012. And as I said in my prepared comments, it has a significant negative impact on reported trade sales. In the fourth quarter, as an example, our trade sales would've increased 3% versus being flat if that -- if those rod sales would have gone to trade. We expect it to continue because we expect that our sales will continue to grow. We -- selling rod to the external market at the degree that we did in 2011 was the default. If our internal consumption within the company consumption of wire and rod, therefore rod, is at the levels that it was in the back half of 2012 and at the levels that we expect in 2013, you should continue to see that depressed reported trade sales strictly from the Industrial Materials segment. I'll pile on here that as the comments said, that is relatively neutral to earnings. It's actually slightly positive. I'll complicate this a little bit more in that when we consume wire and rod internally, it tends to be higher value. It tends to be a higher percentage of high carbon than low. When we sell rod externally, it tends to be heavy weighted to low. So this switch is really good from every perspective other than the headlines of reported trade sales.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","So is that the reason you had such a strong contribution margin that the EBIT was up substantially in the Industrial segment year-over-year?","Karl G. Glassman","Yes, it's just one of the reasons. As a matter of fact, it's a relatively small contribution to all of that, that we didn't repeat the restructuring cost that we had in the fourth quarter of last year. Western certainly is a contributor, but that piece was a small contributory positive for us [ph].","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then final question, you made money in commercial for the first time in about 6 years. Was there something unusual that will prevent you from making money again next year or is this kind of passed earlier?","Karl G. Glassman","Keith, I appreciate you calling that out. Dennis Park and the Store Fixtures people would appreciate it also. You'll remember in that segment that it is made up of Office, which really always performs well, is always profitable in the fourth quarter, offset by reduced spending in the Store Fixtures side of the business. What happened in the fourth quarter was we were very busy, from a production standpoint, building for programs that will ship in the first quarter of this year. So the answer to your question, will it repeat, is pretty much dependent on the order book that we receive in the fourth quarter of any year predicting consumption or sales in the first quarter of the following year. At the same time, we're working feverishly to always make that segment profitable from the Store Fixtures perspective. It really is a demand issue, but we're not having the repeat of restructuring cost. That business is very much in control today at a much greater rate than it had been in the past.","David S. Haffner","And Keith, this is Dave. I'll just summarize by saying it is our expectation that it will continue its profitability.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of John Baugh with Stifel, Nicholas.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So following up to this so we are modeling correctly, as we think about this internal rod mill versus external, what might that influence the revenue line when we look at all of '13 versus '12, and it sounds like it's more first half of the year loaded?","Karl G. Glassman","Yes, that's true, John. It was about a $45 million impact for all of 2012. It was about a $28 million impact in just the fourth quarter of 2012. I expect, I'm guessing, that it will be about an $18 million impact in 1Q of '13 and it would probably diminish to maybe in the $12 million to $13 million range in the second quarter. But again, it all is dependent on internal demand of wire. We're going to continue -- that rod mill is very, very, price- and cost-competitive. So we're going to run it at 100% at all times.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And related to that, I assume, the drop in accounts receivable, I assume there's some connection there, although it looks like that was even greater than that figure. If you can give some color on AR.","Karl G. Glassman","You are right, John. There was some impact because there were obviously fewer reported trade sales, but that was not the majority of it. It was a really good job by our corporate finance and credit collection group, augmented by some help out in the field, of reducing our DSO.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Great. And then lastly, quickly, Western Pneumatic, I recall there was some earnings drag in the initial year. Could you review again what that was, when that precisely goes away and what that impact roughly would be to earnings in '13?","Susan R. McCoy","Yes, John, there was about $5.5 million that we attributed to an inventory fair market value adjustment that -- most of that came through 2012. There's a little bit of that, that carries over, but it's less than $1 million. In fact, it's probably less than $0.5 million that carries over in 2013. There is also about a $3.5 million intangible asset that we assigned some value to that had a 1-year life, so that basically rolls off by January as well. So in the $8.5 million to $9 million range is what 2012 was burdened to us that 2013 should not be.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Karl, maybe I missed it, some might have gotten -- but can you go over kind of where we are in Bedding and how you saw the quarter develop and what the outlook is for early 2013? I think the January of last year, you had a very strong performance in Spring, and that would be hard to compete against.","Karl G. Glassman","Yes, but -- thank you for that, and I'll be long winded with this answer too and I apologize for it. But there's been so much question as regards the ISPA statistics and the timing of the months that I want to do what I did in the third quarter and give you a walk of innerspring sales within Leggett versus ISPA-reported. And before I do that, I want to preface my comments by saying that ISPA is a wonderful aggregator of data and reporter of data. This discrepancy is no indication on ISPA or ISPA's ability. It's a timing of purchases. They're somewhat victimized by the data that comes to them, and remember that all they receive is data of 2\/3 of the industry. So ISPA reported that innerspring sales were up 12.8% in October, our innerspring unit sales were up 3%. ISPA reported that November innerspring sales, this is supposed industry, was up 11.8%, our sales were up 3%. ISPA reported that December innerspring sales were down 5.4%, our innerspring unit sales were up 10%. So anybody that invests on the ISPA data based on a monthly sample is probably doing themselves and probably others a disservice. If you aggregate it from a quarter perspective, ISPA reported that innerspring sales were up 5.9%, Leggett sales were up 6%. So perhaps it makes more sense to look at the quarterly numbers than the monthly numbers. I will continue in that it's notable that in the fourth quarter ISPA statistics, the innerspring outgrew non-innerspring and the AUSP of innerspring sales was positive versus non-innersprings being negative. It's the first time that's happened in quite some time. It's a testimony to the Hybrid offering and product line, supported by the Comfort Core comments that I made. And to give you a little more color there, Comfort Core or pocketed coils as a percentage of Leggett's total U.S. innerspring sales in 2011 were 7.1%. In 2012, they were 9.2%, and in January of 2013, they were 10.8%. A Comfort Core has greater than a 2x average unit selling price compared to the open coil product that it replaces. So all those dynamics are good. Now to January, January has certainly been off to a slow start that our January U.S.-based innerspring shipments were down 8.4%. We did have 1 fewer shipping day, so on a same day's basis, it was down about 3%, and -- but we really do attribute that to your comment in that January of 2012 was extremely strong. And in addition that our customers who you interacted with and a number of the other listeners who are participants on this call interacted with in Las Vegas are very, very bullish about the quarter. But they all collectively say that the year started a little bit slow. Some of that cause is probably attributed to the delay in the IRS issuance of refund -- tax refund checks. The first quarter is the most promotional quarter from the standpoint of lower-end bedding, a tremendous amount of units. The quarter is really important to us. We think that season is going to get started somewhere between 2 and 4 weeks later in 2013 because of the tax noise caused by our friends in Washington.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's very, very helpful, Karl. And just as I don't get run too far foul of David's prescription for one question, I'm going to sneak one other in. As I look at the share repurchase and dividend prescription for this year, it looks to me like you -- one of your share repurchase criteria had been no dilution and yet you had a little bit of dilution last year because of not purchasing for the 4.7 million share issuance. This year, do we look like we're going to have less dilution or no dilution? Is that -- are we going back to that? And on the dividends, are we only going to see 3 quarters of cash flow this year because you accelerated the dividend into the fourth quarter of last year?","David S. Haffner","Yes, that's correct. This is Dave. It's our intent to go ahead and buy those shares back and remain neutral. And the only caveat I would provide is that if there is something that we feel strategically would be much more compelling to the value of the corporation, maybe it's a very attractive acquisition, then we would consider that. But normally, it's our intention to at least maintain neutrality on that dilution factor.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And the likelihood of that strategic acquisition, David?","David S. Haffner","We're always looking for opportunities. I will say that there are some interesting things out there. We're not close to consummating any deal of any significant size at this point.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And the money you made in -- the money you invested last quarter in something, I think that did not happen, and that's back in the company coffers?","David S. Haffner","No, it's still standing, hanging fire, if you will. We're still investigating that as an attractive long-term potential.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I thought that was supposed to be ended by the end of the year, that's not correct?","David S. Haffner","No, we -- what happened, Budd, is we extended our indemnity with another entity. So that we -- it gave us a longer period of time to analyze the aspects of acquisition.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from the line of David Macgregor with Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Can you just talk about the Specialized Products group for a moment. And it seems like things are mixed. It's nice to see CBP sales up. But as you put together your guidance for 2013, what are the trends that you're assuming with respect to margins in this segment? Should we be expecting better margins, flat, down?","Karl G. Glassman","David, from an auto perspective that there was about 6% industry production growth in autos in 2012, we're expecting about 2% worldwide auto production, so we -- auto is the biggest part of that segment. So we expect continued growth there. That fourth quarter mix of CBP being positive and machinery being negative is actually dilutive to margins. While we appreciate the CBP business and the margin that it brings that, that's not a trade that's good for us. So it's somewhat dependent from a long-term basis as to the demands in those 2 industries. And we, at this point, would expect that 2013 would look similar to the fourth quarter of 2012. Boil that altogether, segment margin should not be significantly changed one way or the other.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Good. And then on the -- you highlighted the machinery business being down. Is there something going on there with respect to share or evolving technology that we should be concerned about?","Karl G. Glassman","No, as you'll remember that, that machinery business is primarily sewing and quilting related to the bedding industry. I think there was certainly a U.S. pause in capital spending, with the uncertainty around the fiscal cliff in the fourth quarter. Worldwide, a lot of that machinery goes into Europe. South America was a little depressed, so it's really macroeconomic, it has nothing to do with shares.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then just with respect to the contribution margins, I guess, on -- we have discussed on a consolidated basis. But I know historically, you've kind of been in the 25% to 30% range. I sort of took from the verbiage in the press release that you were expecting better contribution margins for next year, I just want to make sure I'm reading that correctly. And if so, can you just highlight maybe what's best -- sort of the most powerful drivers of that might be? Is it mix, is it pricing?","David S. Haffner","Well, Dave, let me start and then, Susan, you might want to comment. We continue to think that our contribution margins are going to be in that 25% to 30% range, and that assumes the approximate mix that we have. I know we've mentioned before and it's true that certain of the business units have higher incremental contribution margins than others. Right now, for planning purposes, we just use the 25% to 30% on average. Susan, do you want to comment?","Susan R. McCoy","That's what I was going to actually point you to, David. On Slide 11, there's a step-forward walk sort of that shows from our continuing ops earnings this year to the midpoint of our guidance. And it implies on that 3% midpoint sales growth somewhere around a 30% contribution margin. However, we look at this, whether it's EPS or whether it's from an EBIT standpoint, that's basically what we have built in. It is mix-sensitive. That's the reason for the range that we've put out there a bit, but somewhere around 30% would be a reasonable place to start.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Robert Kelly with Sidoti & Company.","Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Just a question on the outlook for -- at the segment level for '13. If the midpoint company-wide growth is 3%, what's growing above the average by your budget? And it sounds like the Specialized division is going to be growing below the midpoint budget.","Susan R. McCoy","Bob, at the midpoint of our guidance, we would actually have Specialized growing at a nice pace, somewhere in the mid single digit range, whereas Residential and Industrial approximately at the midpoint of our guidance, which is in that 3% or so range; and currently, Commercial, about flat.","Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC","So almost uniform growth across the businesses, except for Commercial?","Susan R. McCoy","Yes, with Commercial -- right, with Commercial a little lower and Specialized a little stronger.","Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay, great. And then just as far as the LIFO reserve changes, do you have any expectation there for '13?","Karl G. Glassman","Bob, our guidance does not include nor does it ever include at the beginning of the year LIFO, FIFO forecast. The 2 measures match during the year, so it's not part of our thinking at this point. Totally dependent on what happens with inflation, deflation during the year. We expect at this point a relatively calm steel year, that the outlook for steel pricing, in what we've read from an industry perspective, is that steel should be really pretty flat during the year. But it can change very quickly. But at this point, there -- you shouldn't see a lot of LIFO, FIFO noise.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Allen Zwickler with First Manhattan.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","Anyway, I -- my question is more of a macro that I ask maybe once every couple of years. If you have kind of looked at your mix, I know you bought the tool business. But whether it be residential, the mattress business or the fixture business, could you kind of describe to us where you feel you are in those businesses, i.e. capacity, i.e. competition? I know that's a long-winded question. But maybe -- it's year end, maybe it's a good time to just refresh us on how you're feeling about those businesses.","David S. Haffner","No, it's a good question. I'll give a high-level comment, then ask Karl to give you some more specifics. We still are well below our capacity utilization targets. And I look at that from a glass half-full perspective, that is a wonderful opportunity for us. And so as the demand for our products continues to or we hope continues to go up, we'll see those incremental margins that we've commented. The only one that is at full capacity, Karl mentioned this, is our sterling rod. But the rest of them have lots of room to grow. They vary anywhere from the mid -- high 40% utilizations to, excluding sterling, in the 60%, 70% utilization. And as you know, we've said we like to be in 80%, the way we calculate it. We'll continue to put a very high priority on all of our business segments. Residential Furnishings, of course, has always been the genesis of the company and continues to get a large amount of our product development effort. But there's business development going on in each one of the segments. I think that Commercial Furnishings, as I mentioned before, our expectation is that it will continue its upward profitability march. We're very pleased to see what those men and women have been able to do there. So we've got plenty of capacity in that particular business unit and demand is what we need. Luckily, we're winning those significantly important and large opportunities from various of the retailers.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","Well, could I ask just ask at a slightly different way? You have -- you say you have capacity and so just in the last few years, the -- particularly the mattress business, there's been some changes in terms of different kinds of mattresses, even though I'm sleeping on the same one, and you'll probably hate me for it. But my question is do you have -- is the capacity matching with today's demands? Am I making myself clear on whether -- yes, you might be running at 50% of capacity, but the other 50% is machinery that, for example, is making products that people aren't buying anymore. I'm just try to match that up.","David S. Haffner","Yes, okay. Thanks, Allen. Thanks for the clarification. And of course, our utilization is significantly higher than that 50%.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","Well, I'm just -- you understand that, where I'm coming from.","David S. Haffner","Yes, I do. I do. And suffice it to say that the equipment that we are commissioning most recently and in -- today and in the near future, a large percentage of that equipment is pocketed coil equipment, which goes to Karl's previous commentary about how that Comfort Core product has grown. And so our capacity is aligned with what we believe will be the demand going forward for the types of innersprings that are going to be expected and demanded by our customers. Karl, you want to offer anything?","Karl G. Glassman","Well, I think that we -- our job is to match the capacity utilization with the mix of our business on a daily basis, and we're doing our job.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","Okay. So just to wrap up, so the fact that you're not running those plants full out, okay, whatever the number may be in terms of capacity, is not a function of not having the right machinery, if I'm using the right word? I mean, so if -- for example, you got the orders, but they were from stuff that you couldn't produce, you'd have to pass on them -- to somebody who had that business.","David S. Haffner","Yes, that is not the situation, Allen. It's a very good question. But we're not missing business for lack of our ability to produce the particular specification that's required.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","Okay, that's fine. And in the fixture business, do you feel now that you have the right mix? Forget about the customers who are going to be fickle, but do you feel like you have the right mix there? And capacity, if you look at your capacity versus your mix of customers, et cetera, do you think that's in balance at the moment?","Karl G. Glassman","Yes, it -- we're better positioned there, Allen, than we've been since we started aggregating acquisitions in store fixtures many years ago. The balance is correct for customer demand, evidenced by the performance over the last few quarters and the expectation that you should have of our performance into the future.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I'm just reentering -- reentering the queue to ask a few more questions, if I could. Karl, I want to make sure I understand for modeling purposes the situation with the commercial fixtures. You had said that in the 2012 third quarter, you still had some business that you were delivering, I think, for some of the major retail projects you won. You don't expect that to really participate in this year's third quarter, and yet you still expect it to drop off in the fourth quarter revenue. Do I understand that right?","Karl G. Glassman","Basically, Budd, that's right. You should always expect the fourth quarter is going to be extremely soft. It doesn't matter which retailer, which mix, it's just they have to have their stores, all retailers across all categories, they have to have them positioned roughly October 1. So that's what causes the weakness in the fourth quarter for us and all other fixture manufacturers. As it relates to the difficult third quarter 2012 comp, that all we're doing is saying, \"Heck, it was a heck of a third quarter last year.\" It's really early this year. We don't have orders in hand to match that. We're not saying that we won't, that retailers usually don't release that kind of PO that early in the year, so we're continuing to win business every day. All it is, is a notification or reminder to you that, heck, it was a good quarter. I'm not, for one, willing to sit here today and tell you that we can't match that. I am willing to tell you that we don't have orders in hand to do that, nor did we a year ago today to run to that real strong 3Q 2012 demand.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Well, the sequential growth from last year's second quarter to third quarter was nearly $50 million year-over-year in the whole total segment. It doesn't seem that, that's in the cards this year. We're kind of projecting a little bit more flattish from second quarter to third quarter of 2013, even though at the second quarter of 2013, we're projecting it above last year. Is that a right kind of starting place? And then fourth quarter this year, we're projecting down and almost flattish with last year.","David S. Haffner","Budd, this is Dave. I think that's prudent for your modeling purposes. And I hope that -- we're all surprised that it's less than what we actually post, but I do think that's prudent.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Couple of other quick questions. I think the sterling rod mill capacity was usually about 550,000 tons. Is that still right? Is that still a right prescription?","Karl G. Glassman","Yes, that's roughly accurate. We have not added or reduced capacity, Budd.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes, but I was just wondering whether had you gained any capacity from some efficiencies that you had been able to do. No real difference in capacity?","Karl G. Glassman","Well, slight but not significant.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And finally, even though you had a great performance this year, it seems to me that the operating margin on a normalized basis still has, I think, several hundred basis points to go to get to a target that I think -- I remember from the time when we first heard about the strategic plan. Is that still accurate?","Karl G. Glassman","Yes.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And time frame to get there?","Karl G. Glassman","Budd, we need volume. You tell us what the macroeconomic situation is going to look like and sort all that out and I'll give you an answer. It all goes back to capacity utilization and then the contribution margin associated with the additional volumes. So you give us volume and we'll bring it home at a higher level than we have in the last couple of years, albeit there's been significant improvement and we expect that to continue.","David S. Haffner","Somewhere north of $4 billion, maybe it's $4.2 billion, $4.3 billion with current product mix, are the metrics, Budd, and that will that be in 2014? I hope so.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","You know how much regard I have for the company, but I've heard this issue a long time about needing extra volume to get to that kind of margin potential. The cynic might say, \"Are we really having a pipe dream there?\" I know you have a high regard for your customers and you want to be able to supply them when they give you, when they favor you with an order. But are we just being a little bit too open to that kind of prescription and wanting that volume to come back?","Karl G. Glassman","Mattress units haven't recovered to the demand pre-recession. Upholstered furniture demand hasn't recovered to near that demand. Auto hasn't recovered fully. Home construction hasn't recovered. But the population in the United States is larger, so I guess we would have to -- the default to know that we can't is the consumers' long-term inability to consume. We're selling primarily replacement products.","Matthew C. Flanigan","And Budd, this is Matt. I'd just add that one of the nice aspects of 2012 was the illustration, particularly in the back half of the year that the incremental margin, contribution margin that does show up if we have incremental volume up here, none of us at all are particularly overwhelmed by 9.2% EBIT margin in 2012. We need to be -- to double digits and beyond. But the nice thing is what happened in 2012, when we certainly anticipate going forward, as additional volume appears that we will harvest in that 30% contribution margin range and that simple math takes you to 10% and beyond in EBIT margin and we are certainly looking forward to that taking place and believe it will and are dedicated to that proposition.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","No, I have no issue with the contribution margin. It's just the level of sales that gets you to that, I think, that $2 roadmap we've all wanted to see you get to for a while. One last question though quickly is the EBIT margin on Carpet Underlayment. Do you have increased sales? I don't remember hearing you just talk about it. Has the EBIT margin yet satisfactory?","Karl G. Glassman","It's improving, but not yet acceptable. But it's getting there.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the floor back over to David DeSonier for closing comments.","David M. DeSonier","Well, we don't have a lot of closing comments. We thank you for your participation and we'll talk to you again next quarter. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation."],"12818":["Leggett & Platt Inc.

And finally, the group will answer any questions that you have.","This conference call is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material.

Glassman","Good morning and thank you for participating in our first quarter call. We are pleased with our start to 2017. Sales growth improved as the quarter progressed and earnings were slightly ahead of our forecast. For the full year, we expect market improvement and Leggett initiatives to drive sales growth and strong earnings.","As we reported yesterday, first quarter sales increased 2% to $960 million despite a 3% reduction from prior year divestitures. Organic sales grew 4% primarily from continued strength in automotive. Acquisitions also added 1% to sales growth.","First quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.62, down slightly from $0.63 in the first quarter last year. The benefit from higher volume and a lower effective tax rate was more than offset by higher steel costs and several smaller factors.","Steel costs began to inflate in late 2016 and we have implemented price increases to recover the higher costs. With our typical pricing lag, earnings and margins were compressed in the first quarter, as expected, but should improve over the remainder of the year.","We completed two acquisitions during the quarter that should add combined annual revenue of approximately $50 million. The first is a distributor and installer of geo-synthetic products and expands the geographic scope and capabilities of our Geo Components business. The second is a manufacture of surface-critical bent tube components supporting the private-label finished seating strategy in our Work Furniture business.","On April 10, we filed an 8-K discussing changes to our management structure and our segments that were effective January 1. Under the new segment structure, the Home Furnishings group was move from Residential Products to Furniture Products and the Machinery group was moved from Specialized Products to Residential Products. In addition, LIFO impact will now be recognized within the segment to which it resides. We revised prior year data for comparison purposes.","In the Residential Product segment, first quarter total sales were flat with a 2% decrease in organic sales offset by acquisitions. Volume grew 2% with demand improving late in the quarter. However, this growth was offset by lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds which reduced segment sales by 4%. We will begin to anniversary this headwind in the third quarter.","U.S. spring component dollar sales were flat with 6% growth in ComfortCore units and other content gains offsetting declines in total unit volume. Total innerspring units decreased 4% and box spring unit volume was down 7% in the quarter. International spring sales were strong with dollars up 10%. Machinery sales decreased significantly offsetting organic growth from the other parts of the segment.","Segment EBIT increased and EBIT margin improved primarily due to the absence of last year\u2019s FIFO inventory impact and a favorable sales mix in the current quarter. In the first quarter last year, EBIT was negatively impacted as we reduced selling prices while we were still consuming higher cost inventory.","In the Industrial Product segment, first quarter total sales decreased 14% largely from divestitures completed during 2016. Organic sales were down 4% with lower volume partially offset by steel-related price increases. The segment\u2019s EBIT and EBIT margin decreased due to the lag associated with recovering higher steel costs and lower volume in both rod and wire.","In the Furniture Product segment, first quarter sales were essentially flat. Adjustable bed sales grew 10% and Work Furniture sales also increased but these improvements were offset by lower sales in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin decreased primarily from steel inflation, cost associated with new program launches and the non-reoccurrence of a prior year gain from a building sale of $2 million.","In the Specialized Product segment, first quarter organic sales increased 9% with continued strength in automotive and improvements in aerospace partially offset by currency impact and lower volume in CVP. The prior year divestiture offset part of the organic sales growth. Excluding currency changes, automotive sales grew 14% and aerospace organic sales increased 6% in the quarter.","The segment\u2019s EBIT was essentially flat and EBIT margin decreased with the benefit from higher volume offset by cost associated with growth in automotive, absence of earnings from a prior year divestiture and other smaller items.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Matt.","Matthew C. Flanigan","Thanks, Karl, and good morning, everyone. Cash from operations was 58 million in the first quarter, a decrease of 54 million versus the first quarter last year, primarily due to increased working capital.","This increase resulted primarily from higher inventory to support sales growth and new programs, increased accounts receivable from strengthening sales late in the quarter and the inflation impact on both inventory and receivables.","We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 11.2% in line with the first quarter of last year. We continue to expect our full year operating cash to exceed 450 million.","In February, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share and extended our record of consecutive annual increases to 46 years. The dividend payout as a percentage of adjusted earnings is within our targeted range of 50% to 60%. Therefore, we expect future dividend growth to approximate earnings growth.","At yesterday\u2019s closing price of $53.59, the current yield is 2.5% which is one of the higher yields among the 51 companies that comprise the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. We repurchased 2.2 million shares of our stock in the first quarter at an average price of $48.82 and issued 1 million shares largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises.","As you may recall, for the past few years, we have typically bought more shares of our stock in the first quarter than in each of the other three quarters of the year. For all of 2017, we now expect to repurchase a total of 3 million to 4 million shares and issue about 2 million primarily for employee benefit plans.","Our financial base remains very strong and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the quarter with net debt to net capital of 40% at the high end of our longstanding targeted range of 30% to 40%, reflecting working capital investment are typically strong, first quarter stock repurchases and increased acquisition activity.","We also monitor debt to EBITDA and ended the quarter with debt at 1.9 times our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. We access our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling three-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top one-third of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year.","For the three-year period that will end on December 31, 2017, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 14% per year, and that performance currently places us within the top 29% of the S&P 500.","Our guidance for 2017 is unchanged. Full year sales are anticipated to be 3.95 billion to 4.05 billion, up 5% to 8% versus 2016. We expect mid-single digit volume growth from strength in Automotive, Bedding, Adjustable Bed, Work Furniture and Geo Components. Raw material-related price increases should also add to sales growth. The sales impact from divestitures completed during 2016 should be offset by acquisitions.","We expect full year earnings per share of $2.55 to $2.75 versus adjusted EPS of $2.49 in 2016. This guidance assumes that the benefit from higher volume will be partially offset by the pricing lag we experienced in recovering higher raw material costs, most of which occurred in the first quarter. Based upon this guidance range, we anticipate a 2017 EBIT margin between 12.7% and 13.3%.","As previously mentioned, operating cash flow should exceed 450 million in 2017 with both working capital investments supporting sales growth and inflation expected to be a use of cash. Capital expenditures should approximate 150 million and dividend should require about 185 million of cash for the year.","Our top priorities for use of cash are organic growth, dividends and strategic acquisitions. After funding these priorities, if there is still cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock rather than repay debt early or stockpile cash. We have a standing authorization from the Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. However, no specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established.","With those comments, I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier.","David M. DeSonier","That concludes our prepared remarks. We thank you for your attention and we will be glad to answer your questions. In order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate, we request that you ask only one question and then yield to the next participant. If you have additional questions, you are welcome to reenter the queue and we will answer those questions as well.","Rob, we are ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Robert Majek with CJS. Please go ahead with your question.","Robert Majek","Good morning.","Susan R. McCoy","Hi, Robert.","Robert Majek","Given the recent steel price increases over the past few months which should prove accretive to margins and earnings for the year and perhaps incrementally positive to guidance, which has been left unchanged. It is just conservatism or are there other offsetting factors we should be thinking about?","Susan R. McCoy","Robert, you need to bear in mind that we do have a lag. When costs go up, it typically takes us a quarter or so to have our pricing adjusted in order to recover the increase in costs. So that\u2019s part of the consideration. But the sales growth we factored in and the early kind of start to the year impact from steel was about what we would have anticipated that it would have been. So we think everything has been appropriately allowed for.","Robert Majek","Thank you. And just one quick follow up from me. Pretty solid growth in automotive. Can you just kind of help us understand the drivers there and perhaps your view on the growth rate going forward given what some see as a potential plateau in industry auto sales?","J. Mitchell Dolloff","Sure. This is Mitch Dolloff. We continue to be very optimistic about our opportunities in automotive. We have said that we expect to grow that business 1,000 points stronger than the market overall. And remember this is truly a global business for us. So while we have significant operations in North America, we also have operations throughout Europe and the developed markets in Asia. So we really look at this as what the total market is going to do. So for our major markets that growth is estimated to be about 2% for 2017. So we feel good about our ability to continue to deliver the double-digit kind of growth that we have been. It\u2019s really based on the strength of our products, the strength of our relationships from a technology standpoint with our customers, meaning our engagement with them early in programs. And we have good visibility of those programs because we typically win them a year or two ahead of production. So we remain optimistic about that business.","Robert Majek","Thank you. I\u2019ll hop back into queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Griffin","Good morning, everybody. This is Bobby filling in for Budd. Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on a good start to the year.","Karl G. Glassman","Thank you, Bobby.","Robert Griffin","Are you guys hearing for your customers that the pickup in demand within Residential that you experienced in March, is it sticking or was it more just a function of the timing shift and tax refunds?","Perry E. Davis","Hi, Bobby. This is Perry. We did see a pretty good pickup after kind of a sluggish start at the beginning of the year. March was a good month for us. A lot of you can attribute to the tax refunds which by the way were a little bit delayed from the prior year. Right now in Bedding, the shipments in April are back under last year about mid-single digits. April and October historically over the last few years are a couple of the weaker months. We are seeing some positive developments though with regards to some of those introductions we saw early in the year at Las Vegas. Those are beginning to filter into the market now with four samples being placed in readiness for the upcoming Memorial selling which typically is the kickoff to our busier season on the Bedding side.","Robert Griffin","Okay. And the industry should still expect at least from a Bedding perspective a pretty big increase in advertising at least from how we understand it starting at Memorial Day? Do you believe that\u2019s still the case?","Perry E. Davis","We do. Given all the turmoil in the industry over the last three months, we do expect that promotion and advertising will ramp up pretty heavily. I would think it would be heavier this year than in past years \u2013 for the last years. Remains to be seen yet. And that generally bodes well for the industry overall and for us.","Robert Griffin","Okay. And I\u2019m going to try to sneak one more in just on the slight change in the EBIT margin guidance for the full year. I think the midpoint priorly was 13.2 and now it\u2019s around 13. Is it just more of a function of the acquisitions and some recent price movement in steel?","Susan R. McCoy","It\u2019s really just rounding, Bobby. I wouldn\u2019t attribute too much to it. We before would have considered 13-ish to be kind of midpoint of guidance and that\u2019s about where we still are right now. So that full range, it could be a little higher than that, it could be a little lower. The steel headwinds obviously is an issue in the first quarter. It\u2019s unpredictable what will happen in the steel market. So if costs were to continue to increase, we would potentially have to deal with an additional lag at some point and we need to allow for that latitude and the range that we have out there.","Robert Griffin","Okay. I appreciate all the detail. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Best of luck going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Please proceed with your questions.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. Questions on overall margin. You know what you said now is pricing of volume. Will margins in the second quarter still be down year-over-year or would be able to sneak them up as the prices come in?","Susan R. McCoy","No. Keith, they\u2019ll probably still be down. If you remember in the second quarter last year we were still pretty strong with a bit of the sort of lag tailwind that related to the deflation that had been going on last year in the second quarter. Our adjusted margin was almost 14%. So while we\u2019d expect our margins to increase sequentially from 12.1 in the first quarter, we would not anticipate that they would increase enough to surpass last year\u2019s second quarter margins.","Matthew C. Flanigan","Keith, this is Matt. I\u2019d just add that you should expect which I know you\u2019re modeling to do so that sales meanwhile will be picking up we anticipate further as the year goes along. In the second quarter certainly being part of that positive trend.","Keith Hughes","Part of that\u2019s going to be the price increases, can you give us some sort of idea on how much price increases are going up in some of your bigger industries that matches furniture, automotive, things like that?","Karl G. Glassman","Keith, it\u2019s Karl. It varies by industry. And the timing varies by closeness to the raw materials. So in the industrial we would have seen some price increases that were implemented and passed through in 1Q. Residential markets are seeing more of that in second Q. The Bedding increases range from 5% to 10%. That\u2019s probably a good number on Home Furniture, especially in Asia. The industrial markets would be experiencing a similar trend. And to Susan\u2019s earlier point, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to steel going forward. Steel\u2019s inherently choppy. It\u2019s almost impossible to make an intelligent forecast as to what steel will do. As an example, we sit here late April as you know scrap in May won\u2019t sell until middle of May. We don\u2019t know what scrap\u2019s going to do. We think it might pull up in the $10 range. But we just frankly don\u2019t know. But we have been successful at passing through the price increases as our people typically are.","Keith Hughes","Okay. And final question, I\u2019m a little surprised that the weakness in the furniture sales and Fashion Bed and giving comments of anything \u2013 what happened in the quarter there?","J. Mitchell Dolloff","This is Mitch. Generally, we saw weakness at retail. This is simple as that.","Keith Hughes","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. The next question is from the line of Dillard Watt with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Dillard Watt","Thanks. Good morning.","Susan R. McCoy","Hi, Dillard.","Dillard Watt","I wanted to talk a little bit about adjustables. I think that pace of growth accelerated a little bit from the fourth quarter to the first and I admittedly I don\u2019t have the comparisons from the two prior years in front of me. So anything going on there that you\u2019re seeing a pickup or is it just some of the year-over-year issues?","Matthew C. Flanigan","No. I think we continue to win new programs. Some major new programs are launched early in the first quarter. In fact, earlier they were expected. So that\u2019s really what helped drive some of the strong growth in the first quarter and has us well positioned for the balance of the year.","Dillard Watt","Okay, great. And then we\u2019re still seeing the meaningful outperformance in ComfortCore relative to the rest of the spring business. Pretty well known the content gains you\u2019re getting there. Does that continue through the year in terms of that wide of a spread or how should we think about the underlying trends in the Bedding business versus what you\u2019re doing with Nano and some of the other ComfortCore products?","Perry E. Davis","Hi, Dillard. This is Perry. We would expect to continue to see growth in ComfortCore as we go through the year. As those programs launch and as programs ramp up, we\u2019ll see it at least through the second and third quarter I believe. And part of that, you\u2019re right, is the fact not only in terms of pieces that we believe that there\u2019s a continuing transition from open coil to ComfortCore type products but we also anticipate seeing those content gains relative to some of the innovation we\u2019ve had surrounding Quantum Edge products that have built-in edge support that replace what formally had been some foam content.","Dillard Watt","Great. Thanks. And then finally still on the Bedding, I don\u2019t know the best way to ask the question here but just kind of any thoughts you may have on how temporary mattress may have changed things for you guys, and if you\u2019ve seen anything of an impact I guess through April here and if you expect anything differently to play out through the second part of the year?","Perry E. Davis","Things have still yet to settle out. There\u2019s a lot of commotion going on with re-flooring of product, changes to lines. We\u2019re working to establish those forecast going forward but we believe overall that we\u2019re in a good position. We obviously are a major supplier to the industry and there are \u2013 when you step on one balloon sometimes another one pops up. But we think overall that we\u2019re well positioned to take advantage of any growth that would be seen in the marketplace. And plus with the innovation I talked about earlier, I think our content gains have us in a good spot.","Karl G. Glassman","Dillard, this is Karl. To Bobby\u2019s earlier question, the fact that we do anticipate a significant increased investment in advertising is historically good for us as the consumer becomes more aware of that bedding innovation. So we remain very bullish on the remainder of the year, to Perry\u2019s point kickoff by Memorial Day. The floors are set. They\u2019re ready to go. We just need the holiday to get here.","Dillard Watt","Great. Thank you, guys, and good luck.","Karl G. Glassman","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question is a follow up from the line of Robert Majek with CJS. Please go ahead.","Robert Majek","Thank you. Just one more from me. You previously mentioned 25% to 35% incremental margins on volume growth while utilizing spare capacity. How much more room is there for revenue growth at these incremental margins until we kind of hit full capacity?","Susan R. McCoy","Hi, Robert. Yes, it\u2019s a good question and you might imagine a number that\u2019s difficult to pin down really precisely. We have grown organically a lot over the last call it five, six years. We used to have a number we would share that was pretty high and today that number is far lower than it used to be. Our best guess is it\u2019s under 100 million and it is widely variable by business. There are businesses, as you know, that have grown more and we\u2019re investing today to support all of the growth that they\u2019re getting out as an example of that. But there\u2019s others too in bedding and parts of bedding where we\u2019re growing, we\u2019re putting investments in place to support that. So many businesses do still have spare capacity available when volume does come back into those places. We see a nice benefit from incremental margins more broadly across the company. You\u2019re going to see relatively lower incrementals because of the costs that are being invested to support the growth. It\u2019s still good but not probably as quite that high as a range.","Robert Majek","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

And finally, the Group will answer any questions that you have.

Full year sales from continuing operations grew 9% from a combination of strong organic growth in many of our major businesses and acquisitions.","Fourth quarter sales grew 11% with same location sales up 6% and acquisitions adding 5%.","While demand in the majority of our markets improved in 2014, we also benefitted from the continued shift in bedding to Comfort Core springs, new adjustable bed programs that ramped up during the year and ongoing content gains and new program awards and automotive.","Importantly, nearly all of our businesses are seeing positive sales momentum as we begin 2015. Full year adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were a record $1.78, up 19% versus the adjusted $1.50 we earned in 2013.","Full year earnings largely benefited from higher sales. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations grew to $0.41, up from an adjusted $0.38 per share in the fourth quarter of the prior year.","Earnings in the current quarter benefited from sales growth and lower LIFO expense, but this was partially offset by a higher adjusted tax rate and higher than expected stock compensation expense that resulted in large part from the significant increase in Leggett share price versus the market since late October. Matt will discuss this further in his comments.","Our adjusted EBIT and EBIT margin improved for both the fourth quarter and full year, largely due to strong sales growth. We ended the year with adjusted EBIT margin at 10.2% up 60 basis points over the full year 2013. From a reported GAAP earnings perspective, the fourth quarters in both years were impacted by large unusual items.","In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized an additional $0.21 per share litigation accrual. This charge reduced fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations by $0.09 per share and earnings from discontinued operations by $0.12 per share.","By far the largest portion of the accrual is for the foam antitrust cases. We believe the accrual is sufficient to resolve all of the pending foam antitrust cases.","In the fourth quarter of 2013, we recognized a $67 million or $0.31 per share non-cash charge related to the goodwill and intangible assets of our commercial vehicle products business.","A major component of our strategy since 2007 has been the optimization of our portfolio of businesses by increasing investments in businesses that posses strong competitive advantage and reducing our exposure to businesses and markets that are less attractive. In 2014, we made good progress on both fronts.","We required three Tempur Sealy innerspring plants, invested in machinery to support the significant growth of comfort core innerspring, expanded our operations in China to support rapid growth of our automotive business and acquired a small German-based designer of motion furniture components.","In early November, we also completed the divestiture of the majority of our store fixtures operations and continue to pursue the sale of the two remaining facilities in that business. The divestiture resulted in a $0.03 per share loss that was recognized in discontinued operations during the fourth quarter.","We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling three-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top one third of S&P500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year.","For the three-year period that ended on December 31, 2014, we generated compound annual TSR of 28% per year, which placed us within the top quarter of the S&P500.","Our stock price increased 38% during the year from about $31 to $43, with much of the increase occurring in the fourth quarter. Assuming dividends are reinvested, 2014 TSR was 43%, which ranks in the top 7% of the S&P500.","I'll now turn the call over to Karl, who will provide some additional segment comments.","Karl Glassman","Thank you, Dave and good morning.","Most of our businesses continue to perform extremely well in the fourth quarter and we ended the year very strong. In the Residential Furnishing segment, fourth quarter total sales increased 21%. Same-location sales increased 12% with each of the major businesses growing.","Excluding acquisitions, U.S. Spring component dollars increased 18%. Innerspring unit volume grew 13% with the Comfort Core premium category up 59% during the quarter. Boxspring unit volume increased 9%.","Sales grew 4% in International Spring, primarily from market share gains and increased Comfort Core sales in Europe. Excluding acquisitions, furniture components sales increased 8% in the fourth quarter.","Volume in our seating and sofa sleeper businesses grew 8% and motion hardware unit volume increased 14%. Adjustable Bed units grew 127% in the quarter from a combination of new programs and strength in ongoing customer programs. Sales also increased meaningfully in fabric converting, geo components and carpet underlay.","Fourth quarter segment EBIT was negatively impacted by a $22 million litigation accrual. Excluding this charge, adjusted EBIT increase and EBIT margin was essentially flat with fourth quarter of 2013. The benefit from higher sales during the quarter was partially offset by increased stock compensation expense of $10 million.","Full year total sales in the segment grew 13% with same location sales up 9%. Adjusted EBIT for the year increased 27% and adjusted EBIT margins improved 110 basis points versus 2013 ending 2014 at 9.7%.","In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, same-location sales increased 15% in the fourth quarter. Sales grew in the quarter from improved market demand in our work furniture business. EBIT increased slightly with the benefit from higher sales, largely offset by higher stock compensation expense.","For the full year, total sales in the segment grew 7%. EBIT for the year increased 21% and EBIT margin improved. Segment margins continues to be below our target level due to a number of factors, including underutilized capacity and operational challenges with a Chinese joint venture.","With industry demands still depressed from lower business and government spending, our plans continue to operate well below optimal utilization levels.","While our cost reductions have been implemented over the past few years, we are working to identify more opportunities to improve efficiency. In addition, our business development activities are focused on identifying opportunities to improve our sales mix through higher-valued products.","In the Industrial Materials segment, fourth quarter same-location sales increased 5%, primarily from higher unit volume within our wire operations that was largely driven by strong bedding demand.","EBIT and EBIT margin increased with a benefit from higher sales and other smaller factors, partially offset by higher stock compensation expense of $3 million.","8","Full year total sales in the segment increased 3% primarily from acquisitions. Same-location sales were down slightly. EBIT and EBIT margins for the year decreased primarily from reduced metal margins and weather related costs and inefficiencies early in the year.","In the Specialized Products segment, same-location sales grew 5% in the fourth quarter. Automotive sales increased 13% versus a strong fourth quarter of 2013 from a combination of expanded content, participation in new vehicle platforms and demand strength in North America and Asia.","This growth was partially offset by an 18% sales decrease in Commercial Vehicle Products. Machinery sales were essentially flat during the quarter.","The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin increased versus 2013 primarily due to the non-reoccurrence of last year\u2019s CVP impairment charge. Operationally EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the second quarter -- in the current quarter with a benefit from higher sales, partially offset by higher stock compensation expense of $4 million.","For the full year, total sales in this segment grew 9%. Adjusted EBIT for the year increased 26% and adjusted EBIT margins improved a 180 basis points versus 2013 ending 2014 at 13.6%.","I'll now turn the call back over to Matt, who will discuss some of the additional financial details along with our outlook for 2015.","Matt Flanigan","Thanks, Karl, and good morning, everyone.","Well as you've already heard, fourth quarter earnings were impacted by an unusually high accrual related to our stock-based incentive compensation plans, which in total, represented $80 million or $0.08 per share.","Approximately two-thirds of this cost was due to the significant increase in our relative TSR performance late in the year as our share price increased from approximately$35 to $43 during the fourth quarter.","The remainder of the higher cost was driven by recent strong growth in operating margin improvement in many of our businesses. In accordance with GAAP, we record our incentive compensation accruals each quarter to reflect the related performance metrics. For the TSR-based incentive plan, we measure our TSR performance over three-year periods compared to an 320 member peer group.","For the three-year measurement period that ended in 2014 our relative TSR through the end of September was at roughly the midpoint of the peer group. As a result we had accrued for our two and three quarter year assuming an estimated payout of approximately 71% of the incentive target.","Our fourth quarter increase in share price and relative TSR moved us into the top third of the peer group and caused payout percentage to more than double.","Consequently, all of the incremental cost for the entire three-year period occurred and was duly recognized in the fourth quarter. A significant adjustment was also required for the three-year period that will conclude in 2015.","At the end of December, we were delivering top TSR performance for that measurement period as well.","In 2014 our stock compensation expense for all programs totaled $48 million, nearly half of which was recognized in the fourth quarter. Our forecast for 2015 anticipates total cost of approximately $44 million at the current share price and assuming our relative TSR does not change.","If our TSR moves into a lower performance level in relation to the peer group, then we will reduce our accruals for open measurement periods to reflect the corresponding lower payouts estimates.","Now on to a few other topics. Operating cash flow was once again seasonally strong in the fourth quarter at $166 million. For the full year, we generated operating cash $382 million.","We ended the year with working capital at an usually low 7.9% of annualized sales. The third and fourth quarter litigation accruals caused a sizeable increase in current liabilities by year end. Excluding this accrual, working capital was 10.3% of annualized sales.","In November, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share and 2014 marked our 43rd consecutive annual dividend increase at a compound annual growth rate of 13%. At yesterday\u2019s closing price of $45.07, our current yield is 2.8%, which is one of the highest dividend yields among the 54 companies that comprise the S&P500's dividend aristocrats.","We repurchased 700,000 shares of our stock in the fourth quarter at an average price of $41.14 and issued one million sales largely for employee option exercises.","For the year, we repurchased 5.4 million shares at an average price of $33.76 and issued 3.9 million shares. Our financial base remains very strong and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions.","We entered the year with net debt and net capital at 31.5%, which is comfortably within our longstanding targeted range of 30% to 40%. In 2015, we again expect strong sales growth, which should lead to another year of record earnings per share from continuing operations.","As we announced yesterday, we expect 2015 earnings from continued operations to be between a $1.90 and $2.10 per share.","With improving demand, market share gains and recent acquisitions, sales from continued operations are expected to be $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion. This range represents a 3% to 8% increase versus our $3.78 billion of sales from continued operations in 2014. Based upon this guidance range, we currently expect a full year EBIT margin between 10.7% and 11.2%.","We expect to again generate operating cash flow of approximately $350 million in 2015. Dividend should require about $170 million of cash and capital expenditure should approximate $120 million per year. We continue to make investments to support growth in business and product lines where sales are strong and for efficiency improvement and maintenance.","Our incentive plans emphasize returns on capital, which include net fixed assets and working capital. This emphasis we believe helps ensure that we're efficiently utilizing our asset base and invest in capital dollars for the highest return potential exist.","Consistent with our stated priorities for the use of excess cash flow, we will prudently buy back our stock, bearing in mind our level of cash generation other potential opportunities to strategically grow the company and the overall outlook for the general economy.","We have a standing authorization from the Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year; however, no specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. We currently expect to issue between two million and three million shares in 2015, primarily from employee stock option exercises and repurchase an amount that at least offsets shares issued.","With those comments, I'll turn it back over to Dave Haffner.","Dave Haffner","Thanks Matt. I would like to close my prepared comments this morning by extending a very sincere thank you to the thousands of dedicated employee partners who have collectively contributed to Leggett's record performance in 2014 and have helped us to position the company for strong performance in 2015 and beyond.","I would also like to sincerely thank our many customers for trusting us with their business and allowing us to assist them as they work to achieve their respective long-term goals.","Dave, I\u2019ll turn the call back to you.","Dave DeSonier","That concludes our prepared remarks. We appreciate your attention and we will be glad to answer any questions.","In order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate, we request that you ask only your one best question and then yield to the next participant. If you have additional questions, you're welcome to reenter the queue and we will answer those questions as well.","Christine, we're ready to begin the Q&A","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Bobby Griffin","Good morning everybody. This is actually Bobby filling in for Budd. Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on the strong revenue quarter.","Matt Flanigan","Thanks Bobby.","Bobby Griffin","First off, on the innerspring units up 13%, can you please give us a sense of how that trended during the quarter and maybe what you see so far in that segment or that business unit year to date?","Perry Davis","Bobby, this is Perry Davis. Yes. I can give you some color around that and during the quarter in October we were up roughly 7%. November similarly about 7% and then in December we saw a really strong surge with Innerspring shipments up about 24%.","Bobby Griffin","Thank you. And then is there a little color on how January has trended so far?","Dave Haffner","Yes. So far in January through basically the end of last week for the period, we are up year on year about 16.6%. Now would caution for some of that because you recall in 2014, we faced some underlying weather issues that probably dampened shipment somewhat, but overall still we're seeing strong unit volumes as we progress through the quarter.","Bobby Griffin","Perfect. Appreciate the color. And lastly on the Chinese joint venture in the commercial segment gave you some operational challenges again. Can you talk about how that has progressed versus last quarter and what the outlook looks like for working through those challenges?","Karl Glassman","Bobby this is Karl. It continues to be a challenge for us. We were in a complicated Chinese legal situation with that joint venture partner that's distasteful to all of us. So we're continuing to make progress.","The margins are not quite as bad as they once were, but the business is losing money as we speak. So we're doing everything we can within our power in a tough environment to remediate those issues.","Bobby Griffin","Thank you. And best of luck going forward.","Karl Glassman","Thank you, Bobby.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Borstein with Longbow Research LLC. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Borstein","All right. Good morning everyone thanks for taking my questions. Could you provide us an update on what scrap costs are doing and where pricing is and the spread between those two right now?","Karl Glassman","Good. Josh, this is Karl. Scrap is a little bit of a challenge for us and our outlook has changed pretty dramatically in the last 30 days.","The scrap traded up about $5 from December to early January and now the expectation for February scrap prices is down about $30 a ton which ballpark is 10%. What's driving that forecast of scrap deflation is significant availability of U.S. scrap.","Iron ore costs they are falling pretty dramatically around the world and then currency exchange rates. The impact of that is probably more, will be more significant on the flat products, because of availability of both Russian and Chinese flat steel products against scrap is driving that currency exchange issues also into the flat steel products.","From a wire rod perspective, there is less availability of high carbon rod around the world that is of quality enough to utilize in our products or our customers or competitors products.","The low carbon is somewhat protected now because of commerce filing, or finding of guilt of antidumping claims by the U.S. wire rod producers, specifically the low carbon.","They've levied duties effective mid-December of between 100% and 200% depending on the importer of those products, but rod will probably deflate some because of the correlation to scrap.","Now the impact on Leggett is, there may be depending on how scrap actually does trade, some pricing pressure on some of our products there'll probably be a lag of certain 30 to 60 no really 60 to 90 days which will pressure selling prices, pressure margin dollars, but actually should have a positive impact on margin percentage.","And for those of you that are trying to quarterize our guidance this is probably a bit of a headwind to the first quarter, because we, again if scrap falls off we will have to revalue our rod, or bill it, our rod, our wire inventories and our flat product inventories, so that reevaluation will be a headwind to our EBIT and the respective benefit or the LIFO benefit based on GAAP accounting we won't book that benefit until each one of the quarters and based on a year in 2015 forecast.","So the pain is upfront. The remedy is spread equally amongst the remaining quarters of the year.","Josh Borstein","Okay, thanks for that color Karl and so just overall for the year would you anticipate to see margin improvement in the industrial segment?","Karl Glassman","Yes, I would expect so.","Josh Borstein","Okay, and just you talked a little bit about the flat steel, can you remind us how much you buy annually in flat steel and the potential against either savings I'm imagining you might realize there?","Karl Glassman","About 400,000 tons, josh that's changed pretty significantly because of our Store Fixtures business consumed a lot of flat products that is no longer part of us.","Josh Borstein","Okay, I see and then maybe for Susan, one question for you with respect to the revenue guidance, just wondering if you could provide us at the midpoint what it implies for each of the segments? Thanks.","Susan McCoy","Yeah, sure, Josh and this is admittedly qualitative that it will give you some framework to think about. In Residential I would assume something in the mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth.","For Commercial, closer to mid single-digit and Industrial low single-digit and Specialized high single-digit. All of that collectively decide where you want to be with each of the segments, but the midpoint of our revenue guidance which are just short of 6%.","Josh Borstein","Okay great, I appreciate the color, thanks a lot, I'll hop back in the queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Moore with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. This is [Robert Magic] [ph] in for Dan Moore. Innerspring volumes picked up materially in 2014.","Do you see this as being the front end of a longer-term upswing in demand for mattresses and innersprings? And on the flip side do you see that spike as creating somewhat of a tough comp for growth in 2015?","PerryDavis","Well Robert, I think as the year goes along, this is Perry Davis, we will see the comps become more difficult.","We obviously had a lot of challenges as I mentioned earlier last year in the first quarter particularly, with me and the major selling weakens basically a washout. But as the year progressed we saw those unit volumes continue to expand and by the end of the year again we were at a run rate that was extremely high.","And if you go back and you look at the statistics that ISPA put out in October, they were showing 7.5% innerspring picked up year-on-year.","We were around 7%. Go to November, they showed a smaller little over 3%. We were at 7% again and then like I said, as the quarter ended we had a terrific \"period\" with heavy unit shipments 24% up year-on-year.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question coming from the line is Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. On the Commercial business strong revenue growth in the quarter, just if you give us any qualitative statements on what you're hearing from your customers on store, excuse me, on office furniture there in terms of order pace picking up what they are expecting for the year and just kind of any sort of outlook, that will be great?","Karl Glassman","Keith this is Karl. It certainly was a good fourth quarter. That is not an indicator of the industry. We are definitely gaining some share. We're positioning ourselves very well in Europe which was an area that we weren\u2019t geographically strong in the past. Domestically there was uptick from, like I said new programs.","The bit more forecast is 4% growth this year. I would expect us to probably double that, so we'll see, you know you see what the public report from a demand perspective it varies by each one of those customers depending on where they are in the product chain.","Keith Hughes","Okay and real I'll just sneak one and real quick here on the Comfort Core, another great quarter on Comfort Core, when you start hitting the big numbers that you're putting up the last couple of quarters in Comfort Core, are there more customers to go to or is that naturally just going to slow down?","Karl Glassman","It will naturally slow down somewhat as we get later in the year Keith, but we have seen just a week ago in the Las Vegas market numerous new introductions in the Comfort Core category that continue to drive growth.","And if you look at all of last year, compared to the prior year I mean we're talking 50% growth, 2014 over 2013. So will we be 50% again this year? I doubt it, but we continue to see huge shifts and not only at the higher price points, but we'll begin to see it in more of the midrange product and that's basically where the Vegas market was focused this time with new introductions was at those medium to medium upper high price points.","Keith Hughes","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Baugh with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","John Baugh","Good morning and congratulations to the team on a great year. My questions are as follows: if we could talk about cash flow and I'm particularly interested in the forecast for 2015 the puts and takes there and maybe you could touch on among others the legal settlement dollars to go out? And then perhaps Karl on working capital which has been so tightly managed in 2014? Thanks.","Matt Flanigan","Yeah John, this is Matt. I'll jump in and take that one. If you take the midpoint of our guidance for the net earnings contribution that's a pretty straightforward number, something in the neighborhood of 280 million this year. ","Still we have about 140 million shares out. Our D&A this coming year should be about 120 million. The working capital, here is a key piece of what does move around based upon what's happening in those various categories and operations has done a superb job in the last several years of freeing up a lot of capital in that regard.","As you've heard what you adjust for the years end accruals relative to the litigation we were trading at about 10% working capital level of investment, we would anticipate that that would be about the level of investment this coming year as sales continue to grow, which therefore means, we would use some cash and working capital and that sort of gearing in 2015.","And then specifically, relative to the accruals that we have taken on the litigation, we would anticipate that most of that activity would take place in 2015, but of course, that's one again hard to predict.","You throw all that together and we continue to feel very good that about $350 million with a hope to do better than that should be the working operating cash flow assumption you should have in your models.","John Baugh","So Matt, roughly is there a range or guess on the litigation amount?","Matt Flanigan","Hard to guess that. We now -- we'll say this that we'll first of all, due to confidentiality considerations, we rarely ever comment on any pending litigation as you might imagine.","And during the past few months we've had additional developments that occurred in that litigation to help us come up with the estimate that obviously we book now here in the fourth quarter, as Dave mentioned in his comments. And we believe that is sufficient for resolution of these issues. Don't know for sure, but that's certainly our best estimate at this time.","So, relative to win, would that cash go out the door? We just don't know. We would -- it's carried as a current liability. That's how GAAP require us to record it, which implies that within 12 months that is likely to occur and that's where you will find it on our balance sheet.","Karl Glassman","John, I suspect that a meaningful majority of it will be here in 2015 with some trail into early 2016.","John Baugh","Great. Thank you. And then, if I could just may be ask you to comment as you look at '15 versus '14, and this is, you know, a complicated question I guess, but more you simplify the better. What in general you think raw material changes made due to your P&L and currency. What due to your P&L, the headwinds and tailwinds. Thanks.","Dave Haffner","John, the raw material is really the steel issue that I spoke of earlier. If graph does trade down in February like the market expects, there will be some impact on our pricing, but it should be a positive again from a margin percentage perspective. It's very difficult to forecast steel cost into the back half of the year right now, but all-in-all, I would expect that they will end the year somewhat and possibly significantly lower than they ended 2014.","As it relates to currency that from a transactional perspective, we do a pretty darn good job of matching manufacturing and manufacturing cost in the geography of consumption; and then augment that by a pretty rigorous hedging program. Our finance folks and operations folks worked really well together to adequately hedge ourselves.","From a translational perspective, we did an analysis just the other day on currency exchange rates that are current, so just two days ago. And the impact on automotive, which is our most internationally diverse business, is about $25 million in top line and about $2.5 million from an EBIT perspective. If you multiply that by two is probably too aggressive for the rest of the company just because of Auto being, like I said, the most geographically dispersed. So we'll see those rates literally change every day every minute, but currency is a bit of the headwind.","Matt Flanigan","And John, I'd just add relative to currency that just in the fourth quarter, as a frame of reference, sales were negative about $9 million relative to that translation aspect on the U.S. dollar, and EBIT very modest impact south of it, obviously. But $9 million was the top line headwind in the fourth quarter company-wide.","John Baugh","Great. Thanks for that color. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Herb Hardt with Monness Crespi Hardt. Please proceed with your question.","Herb Hardt","Good morning. I was curious, if you could give us operating rates, the lowest and highest, of course, the divisions in the company.","Matt Flanigan","Herb, you mean capacity utilizations?","Herb Hardt","Yes.","Dave Haffner","You have those. I've got them here too, Karl, if you don't have in hand. Highest; Herb, is always going to be the steel mill. Though it's near 100%, it wasn't light in the fourth quarter of last year as we did some process improvements and took some outages to implement some new systems.","After that it would be Adjustable Beds in our U.S. Spring operations today where volume is so good automotive would follow that. There is a little bit around the globe, but utilization rates are high.","From the lowest perspective, it would be our commercial vehicle products business. After that, it would be our work furniture business where we made comment that we're underutilized, the rest would be somewhere in between all of that.","Matt Flanigan","And U.S. Spring is, of course, the upper end of that, Herb. And I know you've heard Karl and Terry say in the past that we're busily building new higher speed, more efficient equipment to put into our U.S. Spring business to accommodate that demand.","Herb Hardt","Okay. Thank you very much.","Dave Haffner","Thanks Herb.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is a follow-up question from Josh Borstein with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Borstein","Thanks again. Just to make sure I understand what's going on in the residential segment on the margin side. The adjusted margins were down 10 basis points despite a nice step up in revenue. I realized some of that's the acquisition revenue for Sealy, but is that all -- the relatively flat margins, is that just due to the stock-based compensation, or is there something else in there?","Susan McCoy","Yes, Josh, that is. I think we expanded in our comments that there's about $10 million of that stock comp that hit the segment. If not for that charge, the margins would have expanded pretty nicely.","Josh Borstein","I see, okay. Thanks for that. And then, you've talked a little bit about capacity additions in several of your businesses, how should we think about contribution margins for 2015?","Susan McCoy","It\u2019s a good question, Josh. And I think the discussion that just went through relative to were our utilization levels are higher, helps to set the backdrop for that. We should be comfortable in that 25% to 35% range that we've talked about for a long time, but much of the growth that we're getting in 2015 is coming in those businesses that are already very busy until we're making incremental investments to support that growth.","And therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that we might be in the lower half of the historical range versus the higher half. Still good at incrementals and good businesses that we're very happy to have the growth occur.","Josh Borstein","Yeah. Thanks for that, Susan.","Operator","It appears we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Dave DeSonier","Now, we'll just say thank you for your participation and we'll talk to you again next quarter.","Matt Flanigan","One additional comment, I apologize to interrupt. But investors often ask us what separates Leggett from other public companies? And it's the -- the areas of business that we play in are our product, but when you step back for just a second and think about 2014, Adjustable Beds in the third quarter were up 75%. They were up 127% in the fourth quarter, Comfort Core up 75% in the third quarter, 59% in the fourth quarter.","That's our people. So the thing that separates Leggett truly is our people. It's the experts that we have in accounting, the experts that we have in our logistics that make this happen in a very, very difficult environment.","So, I just wanted to stop for a second and echo Dave's prepared comments that our people had a great year and every company has people. They don't have our people, so that's the point of differentiation. So I personally wanted to thank our people for doing an outstanding job. That\u2019s all Dave. Thanks.","Dave DeSonier","And with that we'll close. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer-session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Wendy Watson, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Wendy Watson","Good morning, and thank you for taking part in Leggett & Platt's second quarter conference call. I am Wendy Watson, Director of Investor Relations. With me today are Karl Glassman, President and CEO; Matt Flanigan, Executive Vice President and CFO; Perry Davis, EVP and President of the Residential Products and Industrial Product segments and Mitch Dolloff, EVP and President of the Furniture Products and Specialized Products Segment. ","Susan McCoy, our Vice President of Investor Relations is not joining us today for the call. She is out of the office pertaining to a medical-related issue. Cassie Branscum is also with us on today\u2019s call. She joined our Investor Relations team at the start of the year and works directly with me and Susan as Manager of IR. ","Cassie has been with Leggett since 2005 and has a strong background in accounting and financial analysis. Cassie has held roles in acquisition due diligence, as a controller for one of our operations and for the past several years at our Corporate Development department working with many of our businesses to lead those acquisitions and divestitures. We are excited to have Cassie as the newest member of our IR team. ","The agenda for our call this morning is as follows: Karl Glassman will start with a summary of the major statements we made in yesterday\u2019s press release.

Those documents supplement the information we discussed on this call, including any non-GAAP reconciliations.","I need to remind you that today\u2019s remarks concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends, or results constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results or events may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements.","For a summary of these Risk Factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday\u2019s press release and the sections in our 10-K and 10-Qs entitled Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Karl.","Karl Glassman","Good morning. Thank you for participating in our second quarter call. Yesterday we reported strong quarterly sales growth. Second quarter sales increase 11% to $1.1 billion. Organic sales grew 10%, reflecting a 6% volume growth and a 4% benefit from raw material-related price increases and currency impact. Acquisitions also added approximately 3% to sales growth while prior year divestitures reduced sales by 2%. ","Our sales growth in the quarter came from strong performance in several businesses. Organic sales were up 48% in Adjustable Bed, 12% in Geo Components, 11% in Automotive, 7% in Work Furniture and 7% in U.S. Spring. ","Notably in U.S. Spring, Comfort Core innerspring units grew 25% in the second quarter from market share gains with traditional and direct-to-consumer mattress brands. We continue to gain higher value content in our customers\u2019 mattresses through our Comfort Core and Quantum Edge perimeter spring products. ","To accommodate this ongoing sales growth, we are increasing our full year estimates for capital expenditures by $25 million to approximately $185 million, primarily due to recently awarded business in our Bedding and Adjustable Bed business, although there will be start-up cost associated with these significant new programs that will affect our 2018 earnings, we are very excited about these new opportunities. ","Matt will discuss full year earnings and sales guidance later in the call. ","Second quarter earnings per share were $0.63, down $0.01 from $0.64 in the second quarter last year. In our first quarter call, we explained continuing steel inflation would compress our second quarter earnings and EBIT margins due to the pricing lag associated with passing along the higher costs. This primarily affected margins in our Residential and Furniture Products segments. ","Price increases went into effect during the quarter to recover higher steel costs, but we had not fully worked through our typical 90-day pricing lag. While steel scrap costs were relatively stable in the quarter, steel rod prices further accelerated. The increase between scrap cost and rod prices improved the metal margins at our steel mill with a corresponding EBIT margin improvement in our Industrial Products segment. ","If scrap \u2013 steel scrap cost do not further increase in the second half of 2018, margins should recover in the majority of our raw and wire consuming businesses. However, our Home Furniture business utilizes flat steel which has continued to increase in price in the U.S. While we have implemented price increases, offshore competition limits our ability to fully recover higher cost in this business. ","We continue to focus on cost reduction and transferring production of some products to our Chinese operations to take advantage of lower input costs. Last quarter, I briefly addressed the Section 232 steel tariffs announced early in the year, since that time, potential Section 301 tariffs that apply a 10% duty on a long list of products from China have been proposed. ","We are working through the list to determine what effects both positive and negative, these tariffs might have on our operations, but do not expect them to be material.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Matt. ","Matt Flanigan","Thanks, Karl, and good morning, everyone. Cash from operations was $81 million in the second quarter, a decrease of $17 million versus the second quarter last year reflecting increased working capital investment to support higher sales. We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales at 12.5%.","Accordingly, we have lowered our full year operating cash estimate by $25 million and now expect operating cash flow to approximate $425 million this year. Dividend should require about $195 million of cash and as Karl mentioned, our full year estimate expenditures is now $185 million. ","As always, our top priorities for use of cash remain organic growth, dividends, and strategic acquisitions. After funding these priorities, if there is still cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock.","Our financial base remains strong and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We repatriated $123 million of offshore cash in the second quarter and currently expect to repatriate approximately $300 million of cash for the full year. ","We ended the quarter with net debt to net capital of 41.6%, slightly above our target range of 30% to 40% and total debt was 2.5 times our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Both of these metrics reflects increased working capital investment or typically higher stock repurchases in the first half of the year and the recent PHC acquisition. ","As we announced yesterday, we are lowering our sales guidance for 2018 due to demand softness in our Home Furniture and the Fashion Bed businesses and lower than previously expected sales to some of our major retailers in Adjustable Bed, despite strong year-over-year growth in that business unit. ","Full year sales are now anticipated to be between $4.25 billion and $4.35 billion. This range represents an 8% to 10% increase versus our reported $3.94 billion of sales in 2017. We continue to expect mid-single-digit volume growth from strength in several businesses, as well as raw material-related price increases and a positive currency impact. ","Acquisitions, net of divestitures are expected to add 2% to sales growth. We are also lowering our 2018 EPS guidance and now expect full year earnings to be $2.55 to $2.70 per share versus our prior range of $2.60 to $2.80 per share. ","The three main changes in our full year EPS guidance are number one, lower sales expectations, number two, continued impact of steel cost inflation in Home Furniture, our offshore competition limits our ability to fully recover cost increases; and three, startup costs from new programs in Bedding and Adjustable Beds. ","Based upon this guidance range, full year EBIT margins should be between 11.3% and 11.8% and assumes an approximate 21% full year tax rate. ","With those comments, I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Wendy. ","Wendy Watson","That concludes our prepared remarks. We thank you for your attention and we will be glad to answer your questions. In order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate, we request that you ask only one question and then yield to the next participant. If you have additional questions, please reenter the queue and we will answer those questions as well.","Michelle, we are ready to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Susan Maklari ","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. ","Karl Glassman","Good morning, Susan.","Matt Flanigan","Good morning. ","Susan Maklari ","My first question is around, you mentioned, obviously the sort of moving parts with the Home Furniture business. I guess, can you give us a little bit more color on where you are in terms of shifting some of those operations? And how we should think about that timeline coming together over the next few quarters?","Mitch Dolloff","Sure, Susan. This is Mitch Dolloff. So, when we sort of split it into two parts if that\u2019s okay, there is sort of the demand side and then the steel inflation in the price side. So, on the demand side, really at the end of Q1, we were expecting the business, we are expecting the business actually be up slightly year over the year. Since then, we\u2019ve reduced our sales outlook based on two factors. ","The first is just weak demand in the industry generally and the second is some loss of market share as we shed low margins accounts. So, as we pursued price increases, we are not willing to produce products if we are not going to make money on it. So, that lower demand had \u2013 definitely had some impact on our EBIT outlook. ","And then, on the cost side, as Karl mentioned, the cost effect still continue to increase in the U.S. while we\u2019ve implemented price increases, offshore competition limits our ability to fully recover higher raw material cost. In Q1 and Q2, we passed along about 35% of the raw material inflation. So we still had a gap that impacted our year-over-year earnings adversely. ","We expect to increase our recovery in the back half of the year, but we think we\u2019ll still have somewhat of a gap. In the mean time, we\u2019ve been reducing overhead and operating cost and transferring production of some of our products to our Chinese operations to take advantage of lower input costs. In many cases, we are already tooled up for those products, both in the US and China. ","So we are moving those products as ratably as we can. We are also looking at taking some capacity offline, but we are still working on those studies. So, we expect that to unfold through the back half of the year. In the longer-term, we\u2019ll manage our global footprint to optimize steel, labor and transportation cost as well as currency impacts. ","So, I think, we\u2019ve made good progress, particularly in the second quarter, we still have more work to do in the back half of the year, but our goal is to be substantially done with whatever restructuring activity we have by the end of the year, early into 2019. ","Susan Maklari ","Gotcha. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, my next question is around the investments that you are making in Bedding. The $25 million for \u2013 to support some of the new programs that are coming through, I guess, can you give us a little bit more detail on that? And then, how should we think about the offsetting revenue that will come from that and the timing and may be how it will come together?","Perry Davis","Susan, this is Perry Davis. I kind of address, at least part of that. We\u2019ve been able to pick up some additional share. In addition to the content gains that we talk about regularly, we are pleased to be supplying products now to several of the box bed entities. We have some that are introducing new lines. Others, who are actually transitioning some beds that had formerly been foam, all foam beds, now to a hybrid product. ","So that\u2019s Comfort Core product. In a lot of cases, it\u2019s a Quantum Edge Comfort Core. So, as we look at not only new business we picked up, but shifts to our mix, continual shifts to our mix. We have the need to invest in those assets that will enhance our production capabilities. We look to add assets through the remainder of this year and likely into 2019 as we continue to grow and we\u2019re favored with more business. ","Karl Glassman","And Susan, to add to that, Perry\u2019s narrative which is spot on, that there is a great opportunity for the company, because this additional volume then flows upstream into the Industrial Materials segment, as well. ","So, Comfort Core, as you know is high carbon, high quality wire. So the grade of product that is produced through the value chain is really accretive. There are startup costs associated with every new program and there is a number of them. ","Matt Flanigan","And Susan, I just ask \u2013 or add at the tail end of that that relative to the specific $25 million number, which you mentioned, about two-thirds of that is associated with the bedding commentary that Perry and Karl just touched which we are very excited about. ","And then about a third of the $25 million is tied to Adjustable Bed-related activity. I mean, a little few pieces elsewhere, but those are the two big pieces of the $25 million already increased. Again, in places we really like to spend our capital, our shareholders\u2019 capital. ","Susan Maklari ","Gotcha. Okay, thank you very much for the color and good luck. ","Karl Glassman","Thanks, Susan. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bobby Griffin with Raymond James Financial. Please proceed with your question. ","Robert Griffin","Thank you and good morning to everybody and congrats on a good volume quarter. ","Karl Glassman","Nice, Bobby. ","Robert Griffin","I guess, I first want to follow-up on Susan\u2019s question about the Home Furniture Group. It\u2019s been a couple quarters now, we\u2019ve seen kind of weakness at the top-line perspective. If the weakness more in the lower-end versus the higher end or anyway you can help us kind of understand what\u2019s going on in that end-dynamic of the market. And then, given that, it\u2019s kind of maybe competitor type issues as well, how do you kind of see that stabilizing or is there a way that you can\u2019t stabilize as we move into 2019?","Mitch Dolloff","Okay, Bobby. This is Mitch. I\u2019ll take a shot at that again. So, we really see more of the weakness, I guess, actually both today, both on the US side and in China, but the dynamic of lower cost finished motion furniture coming into the US from China definitely has created some disruption in the industry. So, I think most of our \u2013 most of the softness really is related to the motion hardware for us. ","We have another side of that business that distributes singulars wires, sleep boxes, and a variety of other components that go into finished goods, mainly to US manufacturers. That side of the business has stabilized pretty well. So, on the motion side, that\u2019s where a real effort is to move to optimize our production to reduce cost as much as we can to become more competitive and that means, taking cost out of the organization, as well as shifting more production to China. ","So, we think that, we can make \u2013 we made progress in that so far and we think as we go - head into 2019, we would just simply be at a better cost position to be more competitive. ","Karl Glassman","Bobby, to add-on to that a little bit is, it really is, if you look at the price stratification of the products, we are in good shape on the high-end value-added IP protected product. It\u2019s the commodity side of the business, to Mitch\u2019s earlier statement that\u2019s has become very competitive, as you know, there is about a 60% delta in the cost of steel in the United States versus China. ","And on that low-end commodity product that is continuing to grow, we are just not going to \u2013 out our equipment to do a lot of sales volume with no margin associated with it. So, I would expect - and definitely expect the Home Furniture business to shrink, especially in the hardware mechanism side and to be more focused on areas where we can add significant value. ","Mitch Dolloff","Yes, that\u2019s a great way to say \u2013 within and that\u2019s sort of the disruption as Bobby mentioned that we\u2019ve seen in Q1 and Q2, I have a little bit of it in the back half, but that was where making our way towards rightsizing it along those lines. ","Robert Griffin","Thank you. And then, I guess, lastly from me is, trying to understand a little bit better around the new program, more particularly in Adjustable Bed and I guess how it relates to the capital investments coming in to support the growth but we are kind of seeing a slowdown in the second half. Maybe just help us get a little bit better clarity on kind of the ramp or the program or the wind down of maybe an old program inside there?","Mitch Dolloff","Okay, Bobby. ","Karl Glassman","Mitch is having a lot of fun this morning. I am leaving saying that our Adjustable Bed story is a wonderful story. But\u2026","Mitch Dolloff","Yes, and let me, sort of answer both parts of that question, if that\u2019s okay. So, our Adjustable Bed sales were up 22% year-over-year in Q1 and 48% year-over-year in Q2. And we expect our full year 2018 sales growth to be well north of 30%. So, as Karl said, a very positive story. As we finished Q1, our customer forecasts were even stronger than that, too strong, I guess in hindsight. ","And so that led us to cut back a bit on our outlook for 2018. But still bringing us back to the 30 to 35 \u2013 30 plus percent year-over-year growth that we are talking about now. So, I know it\u2019s a little bit confusing, but it\u2019s slightly less good, I think is the way to think about it. But still very strong at growth at north of 30%. ","Karl Glassman","And we believe the category will continue to grow. You\u2019ve heard on Tempur Sealy\u2019s call the other day that \u2013 or yesterday that their adjustable bed business grew 25% in the second quarter. You also heard Sleep Number say that they are now fully engaged in 360. The market is growing and there is customer awareness. ","What we are really optimistic about is the back half is, both of those providers and mattress firm to be real frank are committed to advertising the category. So, the business will continue to grow just at a lesser rate than we originally had forecasted. So it is a bit confusing, but it is an outstanding story for us. And we are \u2013 we really need to continue to invest capital, because we believe long-term the categories just is going to continue to grow. ","Robert Griffin","Thank you. I appreciate the detail. I mean, if it pick on too much there, Mitch, but I do appreciate all the extra color. ","Karl Glassman","It\u2019s just good training for him, actually, Bobby. And Bobby, on a personal note from all of us, congratulations on the promotion. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Bergner with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question. ","Justin Bergner ","Good morning, Karl. Good morning, Matt and all the best to Susan. ","Karl Glassman","Thanks, Justin. Good morning to you as well. ","Justin Bergner ","I wanted to just start-off on better understanding of the guidance bridge, is it sort of safe to say then that the three drivers, the lower sales expectations, the steel prices in Home Furniture and the start-up costs, those are sort of ranked in order of magnitude in terms of the earnings guide change or\u2026 ","Matt Flanigan","Yes. ","Karl Glassman","Yes. ","Matt Flanigan","Yes, and for sure. The sales down draft is certainly number one, in the litany there and then, yes, as you sequence them, they were in relative order of importance. ","Justin Bergner ","Okay. And then, the sales down draft, I mean, that, I guess, you are lowering your revenue guide by about 1%. If that\u2019s sort of entirely centered around furniture products and you are basically lowering the sales guide for that segment by about 4%?","Matt Flanigan","The sales in general are about two-thirds associated with the furniture hardware story that Mitch just mentioned and about a third maybe a tad less, relative to the Adjustable Bed dynamics which, again, you just heard quite a bit about. Those are the two main pieces there. But the bulk of the sales midpoint drop is furniture hardware-related. ","Karl Glassman","So, therefore your point is correct. It\u2019s embodied in that Furniture Products segment. ","Justin Bergner ","Okay. And then, the final sort of part of this question is, I guess, a lot of your business seems to be firing pretty well. And I guess, what I am trying to figure out is, aren\u2019t there some positive offsets in specialized products or in the residential business that are positive contributors to guidance versus early expectations? Or is the strength on these sort of meeting the expectations that you had set out earlier in the year? ","Karl Glassman","As a matter of fact, that\u2019s a good way to put it. There are \u2013 there is wonderful stories in 12 of our 14 business units that are performing extremely well. But to your point, that we had \u2013 our guidance earlier \u2013 earlier guidance was based on a continuation of that outsize performance. So, definitely our second quarter, we were right on a number that we expected, albeit with a little bit of tax rate help, but offset by interest expense. So, 2Q turned out just as we had forecasted. ","So from a future perspective that, I guess we have taken the task a little bit in at the end of the first quarter when we said that we expected units would grow and our guidance was based on units growing mid-single-digits. Well, we were comfortable that they would grow that 6% in the second quarter. So, our guidance is unchanged other than these two headwinds of Home Furniture and the slight change in Adjustable Bed. ","Justin Bergner ","Okay. Thank you. ","Karl Glassman","You are welcome. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Moore with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question. ","Daniel Moore ","Good morning. Thank you for the time and the color. I can know it\u2019s number three in terms of the impact to the EPS guide, but maybe quantify the startup cost that what you are referring to in the second half of the year and do you expect those to linger into 2019? And a quick follow-up.","Karl Glassman","The startup costs really are embedded in the growth of the Bedding business. And a remerchandising of an Adjustable Bed program which is a good opportunity. We had a large program that is a little aged and needs to be remerchandized and every time our programs are remerchandized that there is a little bit of margin pressure as the sellout of the old line and this ramp of the new line. ","So, those are the two primary drivers and no, we do not expect that they will continue to be a 2019 issue. We really see this as a one-time event. ","Daniel Moore ","Very helpful. A similar question with CapEx. It sounds like moving to a little bit of an elevated state. I know, you don\u2019t want to get into 2019 guide, but is the $180 million give or take a decent runrate to think about? Or are there programs this year that might roll off and might come back to where your prior guide was for this year? ","Karl Glassman","Dan, I really don\u2019t know how to answer the question. I hope our CapEx next year is at the same rate, because it would be indicative of continued market share gains and program wins. But I just \u2013 I don\u2019t know, not being coy with you, I don\u2019t know. I hope that if \u2013 that 2019 CapEx looks like 2018, because it\u2019s \u2013 there are monies that are well invested for our shareholders. But I just don\u2019t know. ","Mitch Dolloff","Yes, Dan, this is Mitch, I might add to that. Since we started the year, as you know at 160 million as our best guess, now it\u2019s moved to $185 million, probably, as we sit here today, our best guess for 2019 wouldn\u2019t start at $160 million. ","It probably starts closer to that $180 million again, based upon a lot of the organic things that are in the mix. But again, just like Karl said, it\u2019s too early to try to pin down really where we think that might be, but there certainly is a bias up from starting this coming year at a $160 million level would be my guess. ","Daniel Moore ","Very helpful. Lastly, if you had a comment on the performance of PHC, now that it\u2019s been in the portfolio for a couple of quarters relative to your expectations?","Mitch Dolloff","Sure, this is Mitch Dolloff, again. We\u2019ve been very pleased that PHC\u2019s business has integrated well into our Leggett systems. Feel very good about the management team. They are doing a terrific job and are a great cultural fit with us. Demand is very, very strong in the industry there, both in the US and in Europe. We are struggling a little bit to keep with demand. I think the whole supply chain is. ","So we\u2019ve got a little bit of inefficiency, a little bit of extra overtime, but it\u2019s a very positive problem for us to solve. We expect that we may even make some capacity expansions there. So, overall, very, very pleased with that business. ","Daniel Moore ","Very good. Thank you. And obviously, please do pass along the best to Susan as well. ","Karl Glassman","Thank you, Dan. We\u2019ll certainly do that and I will tell all the listeners, she is listening right now. She is feeling the love. So, thank you for that. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Hughes with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question. ","Keith Hughes","Thank you. I have to go back to this again, but on the Home Furniture, just from a big picture perspective, is this a demand problem from US consumers or is this just a market where pricing has gone down at the low-end of the markets and where you are just not willing to go to make money?","Mitch Dolloff","Hey, Keith. This is Mitch. I think the answer is, a little bit of both, right. So, there is weak demand in US consumers Home Furniture and there is also, as Karl mentioned, there is expansion at the very low-end, particularly on the motion hardware furniture. ","Keith Hughes","So, motion has been big part of upholster furniture for a long time. There are other consumers just not buying that as much now. ","Mitch Dolloff","I think that it\u2019s much, so I think that there is still demand on the motion side, but I think we see that price point really going to the low end. So I think that\u2019s where really where the issue is. ","Keith Hughes","Okay. And the \u2013 just to be clear on the numbers, you are up \u2013 assuming you are up in Adjustables about 30% - 30 something percent in the first half and on Home Furniture you are down about 8% in the first half and under the guidance, would similar results need to be seen to the guidance range? ","Karl Glassman","I would say, yes on Adjustables. Home Furniture has an easier comp going forward. They had a really strong first half last year, a softer back half. I think that\u2019s right. But I haven\u2019t dug that. ","Keith Hughes","It is clearly going to be down. You are assuming it\u2019s going to be down, right?","Karl Glassman","Yes. ","Mitch Dolloff","Yes, and Home Furniture, I\u2019d see it being down about 5% year-over-year. ","Keith Hughes","Thank you. ","Wendy Watson","And for that segment, Keith, we would have said, particularly based on the strong growth in Adjustables, up high-single-digits for the full year and now we would say that segment would be up low-single-digits. ","Keith Hughes","I am sorry, which segment is up?","Wendy Watson","Furniture. ","Keith Hughes","Furniture. Okay. All right. Thank you. ","Karl Glassman","Thank you.","Mitch Dolloff","Thanks, Keith.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Baugh with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. ","John Baugh ","Good morning and Cassie, welcome to the team and Susan, all the best. Timing right in. I guess, my first question is, is there any impact to the outlook for the year from the LIFO change?","Matt Flanigan","Well, we update, as you know, John, our full year LIFO estimate to essentially $37.5 million. So, that\u2019s quite a bit more than we started out after the first quarter. We are closer to \u2013 10-ish or. So we ramp that up and keeping with the inflationary environment we see. ","So what is that 10s is that for the full year in the back half, we have about $18 million to $19 million of LIFO expense plugged in if that turns out to be a perfect estimate for the full year. And of course, as you well know, once we get into the third quarter, we\u2019ll refresh that expectation and see what it tell us at that point in time, both in terms of crisis in the market and our inventory levels and then we\u2019ll adjust accordingly. ","But, yes, it\u2019s now significantly higher than we thought 90 days ago. And it\u2019s baked into the updated earnings guidance obviously as if that is a correct assumption for the rest of the year. ","John Baugh ","So, so, translated as we look at the guidance today, versus 90-days ago, there is a negative impact from a higher LIFO reserve or do I not understand that correctly?","Matt Flanigan","No, for sure there is, yes. ","John Baugh ","Okay. And then, how is \u2013 same question quickly on the spread between scrap and rod. How does that outlook for the rest of the year and I understand that\u2019s all gets worked in the back half. But, what changed if anything good or bad in the second quarter as it relates to that?","Perry Davis","Yes, John, this is Perry. The spreads, obviously has growth as the years progressed. The rod pricing strength in the marketplace of those rod producers is pretty good right now. They\u2019ve been able to push through increases and in a lot of cases in excess of scrap increases and been able to hold that. Part of that has to do with the 232 and some of the tariffs and the thread in tariffs. ","But more so, by the dumping actions that were taken and cited at the end of last year and the first part of this year. It\u2019s kind of effectively eliminated, not a 100%, but for the most part it\u2019s eliminated imports rod from the picture and so the domestic suppliers have been able to pick up that slack and they are all running pretty full right now. ","They have pricing power, because the buyers of those rod products \u2013 their choices have been reduced. They no longer look to imported rods to supplement their domestic supply. So, how sustainable that is going forward? It\u2019s hard to gauge, it\u2019s the steel market, but we suspect that we won\u2019t see a lot of weakness in the rod markets over the next several months. ","John Baugh ","Okay. So just to sum up steel, if had this wrong, please tell me. We\u2019ve got the issue with flat furniture steel inflating and you can\u2019t really raise prices there. So that\u2019s one issue and then we have somewhat higher LIFO reserve. But the scrap rods spread is more or less playing out so far as you would have guessed 90 days ago.","Perry Davis","Yes, I think that\u2019s right. It maybe actually a little higher than what we might have thought at the time. But, going back to LIFO, as we said in our release, the first six months of last year, we took about $2.5 million in LIFO expense this year first half $18.8 million. So there is $16.3 million delta right there in LIFO expense in the first half of the year for the company. ","Matt Flanigan","And John, lot of LIFO talk here. I know, we are aware and everybody out I am sure, but the increase in our LIFO expectations compared to 90 days ago has been a little bit more than $14 million for the full year. So, if you want to know what \u2013 how much more have we now \u2013 do we think is in the mix, given where all of those ingredients have gone, it\u2019s up $14 million from what our estimate was at the beginning of last quarter or at the end of last quarter. ","John Baugh ","Okay. Thank you. And then, pivoting to Bedding quickly, I guess, this is for Karl or Perry. I would assume your open coil entry price points for Domestic Bedding producers was none too great. If I had that wrong, correct me, but the question is, when you give your guidance and we know what the \u2013 is king of going on there and there might be a dumping petition filed. Is there anything in your guidance that assumes whatever that trend is, changes as a result of a dumping petition?","Karl Glassman","Yes, John. There is not. We don\u2019t include that in anything looking forward. If it happens, we will address that at that time, but right now, it\u2019s not baked into any of our forecast going forward. ","John Baugh ","Great. Thank you for the color and good luck. ","Karl Glassman","Thank you, John.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question. ","Peter Keith ","Hi. Thanks, good morning to everyone and hi, to Susan. I wanted to look at the Bedding business and certainly the interpsring unit growth being positive as this notable callout. I guess that Perry and Karl, do you feel like you\u2019ve turned the corner with some content and share gains such that, now going forward, you have some visibility that business could continue to run positive year-on-year? ","Perry Davis","We believe it will. We looked for a back half of higher unit volume than we had last year. Obviously, a tremendous amount of disruption last year that now we kind of lapped and we are getting past that. The mix changes continue to happen and going back to just a minute ago on John\u2019s comments, yes, the open coil products that we historically have produced have become \u2013 there has been some cannibalization by higher value and for core interpsrings. ","We believe that in the Bedding market right now, that the lower end part of the market is suffering some, probably more so than the mid to upper-ends. And a lot of that we think is due to the import situation. But, yes, looking at our business, where we are today, the programs that we have coming in the back half of the year, we are pretty upbeat about that business. ","Peter Keith ","Okay, fantastic. Second last question for me and just maybe filling on John\u2019s last question around the steel dynamics. So you have been talking in recent months about this very favorable spread between rod and scrap. ","If I am putting the pieces together, within the guidance, are you anticipating that this favorable spread is maintained or that it could revert also to more historical norm? Can you help us understand, I guess, your thoughts around how the spreads could play out in the back half of the year from your advantage point? ","Karl Glassman","We \u2013 so basically, you can say that, where we are at today is kind of where we are forecasting will remain through the remainder of the year. There is one thing for sure, we are going to be wrong, it\u2019s just a matter of degree as to how wrong we are. But, we believe that the spreads are sustainable at this point, given the dynamics in the marketplace today, I spoke up a few minutes ago. ","You end up kind of pile along to that, Peter, that not giving 2019 guidance, but because of the dynamics in the steel market related to as Perry said the anti-dumping petitions that were put in place and awarded late last year, we expect that spread to be outsized into next year and we won\u2019t have the negative LIFO impact offset as we see it today. ","But I will admit forecasting steel is a fool\u2019s game. So, I just declared what I am. But the market dynamics support a long-term higher greater spread. ","Peter Keith ","Okay, terrific. I appreciate the insights and best of luck. ","Karl Glassman","Thanks, Peter. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Herbert Hardt with Monness Crespi and Hardt. Please proceed with your question. ","Herbert Hardt ","Good morning. ","Karl Glassman","Good morning, Hardt. ","Herbert Hardt ","And best to Susan, as well. Actually two questions. One is, given the commentary on the order business in recent months, not just tariffs but demand changes and the patterns. You\u2019ve often highlighted the length of the cycle and as things gets specked in, is there any change in your own expectations? ","Mitch Dolloff","Herb, this is Mitch. Thanks for your question. No, I don\u2019t think there is any change in our expectations in the long-term. As we mentioned, sales were up 11% year-over-year in Q2 after removing the currency benefit. So, we remain confident in meeting our goal of exceeding growth in vehicle production by a 1000 basis points in 2018 and in the longer-term. ","And we see that as a target of around 11% to 12%. While there is some choppiness in year-over-year growth forecast for the major markets, US, Europe and China, Japan, South Korea at about 1% for 2018 and remain at that rate for the next several years and while that\u2019s not a huge percentage, it is on a very healthy build of over 81 million vehicles. ","So, it results in a lot more vehicles on the road. The press rate is \u2013 growth rate is even higher in the developing markets, closer to 7%. So that brings the total global market to around 2%. So that\u2019s how we get our 11% to 12%. As you mentioned, we do have good long-term visibility, programs usually launch about two years after we win the award and run for about six years. ","There is some exceptions to that. We typically have sort of that cycle of new programs coming on and old programs dying off. And we are winning sufficient business to give us confidence to meet our target. I think I have mentioned before that in 2017, we won over $300 million in new awards. ","Now, you mentioned that there is some news in the market and may have seen recent OEMs\u2019 earnings releases in the last few days that were pretty mixed. And I think, trade wars, fuel economy standards, new fuel testing requirements that are coming online in Europe, Japan and South Korea may create a little bit of choppiness in the short-term. ","But we still remain committed to our long-term goal of 11% to 12%. So, we don\u2019t see any fundamental negative changes in the business, just some sort of temporary issues that may push demand one way or the other in the quarter or two, but fundamentally, we are really positive on the business in the long-term. ","Herbert Hardt ","Thank you. My second question is, you used the word repatriation for paying cash back and what are the tax implications of that? ","Matt Flanigan","Good question, Hardt - Herb, this is Matt. Basically, we are bringing net cash back and keeping with TCJA, the incurred tax at the beginning of the year, but there is no incremental tax or cost to getting that cash back onshore. Doing a lot of planning to make that happen. We started out at the beginning of the year. ","As you may recall, saying we\u2019ll bring back. We estimated about $300 million this year. We thought most of the $300 million with again, this planning and coordinating would cause that to mostly come back in the back half of the year. As you read, we actually got back quite a bit of it earlier, $123 million came in the second quarter. ","So, all of that is right on track, in fact a little bit ahead of schedule, I believe and the upshot is it\u2019s not causing us anymore at all, compared to what we just had to true up with TCJA when they put in that tax reform. ","Herbert Hardt ","Thank you very much.","Karl Glassman","Thanks, Herb. ","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Ms. Watson for any closing remarks. ","Karl Glassman","Yes, thank you for participating, yes, go ahead, Wendy.","Wendy Watson","Thank you all for participating and we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter.","Karl Glassman","Thank you everyone. ","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David DeSonier, Senior Vice President Strategy and Investor Relations for Leggett & Platt Incorporated.","Thank you. Mr. DeSonier, you may begin.","David M. DeSonier","Good morning, and thank you for taking part in Leggett & Platt's second quarter conference call. With me this morning are the following: Dave Haffner, our CEO and President; Karl Glassman, our Chief Operating Officer; Matt Flanigan, our CFO; and Susan McCoy, our Staff VP of Investor Relations.","The agenda for the call this morning is as follows: Dave will start with a summary of the major statements we made in yesterday's press release; Karl will provide operating highlights; Dave will then address our full year outlook for 2012; and finally, the group will answer any questions you have.","This conference is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material. This call may not be transcribed, recorded or broadcast without our expressed permission. A replay is available from the IR portion of Leggett's website.","We posted to the IR portion of the website a set of PowerPoint slides that contains summary of financial information. Those slides supplement the information we discuss on this call, including non-GAAP reconciliations. I need to remind you that remarks today concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements.","Actual results or events may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the section in our 10-K entitled Forward-Looking Statements.","I'll now turn the call over to Dave Haffner.","David S. Haffner","Thank you, Dave. Good morning, and thank you, all, for participating in our call. We are pleased with the second quarter earnings and margin improvement we reported yesterday. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.45 compared to $0.37 during the second quarter of last year. Second quarter 2012 earnings include a $0.04 per share unusual tax benefit and a $0.02 per share benefit in discontinued operations from a litigation settlement associated with the previously divested business.","Second quarter of last year, earnings included $0.02 per share unusual tax benefit. Second quarter same location sales were down 2% from the prior year, primarily due to lower trade sales from our Rod mill, currency rates and lower store fixtures sales, a portion of which was volume we chose to exit. Apart from these 3 factors, same location sales increased 2%.","Unit volumes were flat to positive across the majority of the company and the strongest growth continuing -- with the strongest growth continuing to come from our automotive and adjustable bed businesses. EBIT increased and EBIT margins improved both year-over-year and sequentially to 9.2% during the quarter. Earnings are benefiting, as expected, from higher unit volumes and the cost savings associated with the restructuring activities we initiated in late 2011. In addition, the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition that we completed in January is exceeding our expectation for strong operating performance. We are very pleased with the return we're generating on this investment.","Reflecting our broad focus on returns, we ended the quarter with working capital at 12% of annualized sales. Current liabilities include $41 million associated with an interest rate swap that we entered in 2010. Excluding this item, working capital was 13.1% of annualized sales, well below our 15% target. Cash from operations was strong during the quarter at $81 million. We expect operating cash for the full year of approximately $350 million, which had once again comfortably exceed the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends.","Capital expenditures should be approximately $90 million this year and dividends should require about $160 million. We continue to maintain our strong financial base and ended the second quarter with net debt at 33% of net capital, which is within our long-term target range of 30% to 40%.","In May, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share. 2012 marks the 41st consecutive annual dividend increase for the company, a record we plan to extend. At yesterday's closing price of $22.49, the current dividend yield is 5%. Leggett possesses the highest dividend yield among all of the S&P 500 dividend aristocrats that have over 30 consecutive annual dividend increases.","Given the cash outlay earlier in the year to acquire Western Pneumatic Tube, we did not complete any open market purchases of our stock during the second quarter. However, consistent with our stated priorities for the use of excess cash flow, we expect eventually to resume buying back our stock subject to the outlook for the economy, our level of cash generation and other potential opportunities to strategically grow the company.","We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year but have established no specific repurchase commitment or our timetable. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1\/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year.","For the 3-year period that began January 1, 2010, we have so far generated TSR of 8% per year on average or slightly below the midpoint of the S&P 500 companies over that same time period. With those comments, I'll turn the call over now to Karl Glassman who will provide some operating highlights.","Karl G. Glassman","Thank you, Dave. Good morning. In my comments, I'll discuss a few segment highlights. You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website.","Second quarter same location sales on the Residential Furnishings segment increased 1% with unit volume growth partially offset by the impact of currency exchange rates.","In our U.S. Spring business, innerspring unit volumes increased 2% and boxspring units were down 3%. Innerspring units in Europe also increased 2%, which is notable in this current economic environment.","In our Furniture Hardware business, unit volume was flat with the prior year. Again, this quarter, we had significant growth in adjustable beds with unit shipments up 20%. EBIT and EBIT margins in this segment decreased slightly versus the second quarter last year. The earnings benefit from slightly higher unit volumes in the current quarter was more than offset by weaker mix in certain businesses.","In the Commercial Fixturing & Component segment, second quarter same location sales decreased 10% due to lower spending by key Fixture & Display customers and our decision to exit certain programs formerly supplied by operations we have closed or consolidated. Sales on office furniture components were flat during the quarter, which we believe is roughly in line with the overall market for office seating. EBIT and EBIT margins in the segment decreased versus second quarter of 2011, primarily from lower sales, higher restructuring related cost and absence of earnings from the U.K.-based Point of Purchase business we divested in January. These impacts were partially offset by restructuring-related benefits and better overhead absorption associated with increased production for a major program that will ship in the third quarter. The seasonality of our Store Fixtures business this year is expected to be consistent with the long-term historical pattern in which third quarter is the sales peak, primarily due to a major initiative by one of our large retail customers. We anticipate an improvement in segment results in the third quarter as a result of this additional volume.","In the Industrial Materials segment, second quarter same location sales decreased 5%, primarily due to lower trade sales from our rod mill, partially offset by increased unit volumes in both Drawn Wire and Steel Tubing. The decrease in steel rod sales resulted from an equipment change over at the rod mill, which was an investment in process and quality improvement. The installation of the new equipment occurred late in the first quarter and production did not return to normal levels until early May.","EBIT and EBIT margins for the segment increased in the quarter. Earnings benefit from the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition and the plant consolidations announced in late 2011 contributed to the improvement. As Dave mentioned earlier, the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition, which resides in the Industrial Materials segment, is exceeding our performance expectations. We continue to expect this business to produce full year 2012 margins greater than the company average.","In the Specialized Products segment, second quarter same location sales increased 5% with unit volume growth partially offset by the impact of currency exchange rates. The increase in unit volumes resulted entirely from growth on automotive. Commercial vehicle products sales were roughly flat and machinery sales were down compared to the second quarter of last year. EBIT and EBIT margin increased during the quarter, largely due to higher sales.","Automotive industry forecast anticipate continued growth in global production in 2012, but the outlook varies by geography. North America and Asia are both expected to have meaningful production growth, but European industry forecast are negative as economic concerns linger. Despite the macro issues and currency headwinds, our automotive sales in Europe are roughly flat during -- were roughly flat during second quarter and were up slightly for the first 6 months of the year. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave.","David S. Haffner","Thanks, Karl. As we announced yesterday, we increased our full year guidance to reflect the positive effect of second quarter's unusual items and improved margins. We now expect full year 2012 EPS of between $1.35 and $1.50 per share, up from our previous $1.25 to $1.45 per share estimate on sales of $3.65 billion to $3.8 billion.","We began the year with an appropriately cautious view of the macro environment, especially given election-year uncertainties, with EPS guidance of $1.20 to $1.40 per share. We have now raised our full year estimate following both first and second quarters given solid first half performance. In each of the prior 2 years, after the second quarter, we were beginning to feel a contraction in our markets and in each case, reduced our full year guidance. That pattern does not seem to be repeating this year. Still, we're maintaining the degree of caution at the low-end of our guidance in the event that we were to experience a minor macro pullback.","And lastly, I'd like to say, since we know that many of our employee shareholders are listening to our conference today, we want to thank them for their past and continued efforts, which have contributed to Leggett's improved execution and performance. And with those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier.","David M. DeSonier","That concludes our prepared remarks. We thank you for your attention, and we will be glad to answer any question. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","On the Residential business, Karl, you flagged the European spring units up 2%, and so that caught my attention as well. I wonder if you could just dig and give a little more detail on that. How does that compare to the overall market? Any detail that you could provide there would be helpful.","Karl G. Glassman","David, we are appreciative of the fact that European spring continues to hold strong. We are dealing with somewhat of a negative mix in that it feels like that the consumer in Europe is downgrading a little bit, that we felt a kind of a margin contraction from the mix from Pocketed Coils to more vinyls. But we're fortunate in that we're heavy weighted in Europe to the Scandinavians countries, Northern Europe and the U.K. and have lesser exposure to the Southern European countries. So things are really proceeding well. We are also benefiting from the de-verticalization of the U.K. manufacturer earlier this year as part of the Silentnight business. So that business is good business. So all things said and done, while the margins have been slightly negatively impacted, things are proceeding well in Europe, and as I noted in my comments, we're experiencing the same from an automotive perspective. Europe has not been a negative issue for Leggett up to this point.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Is that sustainable through the second half?","Karl G. Glassman","We believe so. As we talked to our customers. Europe's always a little bit of a challenge in the third quarter with most of the continent being on holiday shifts the month at a time country by country. But that's a typical year-on-year comp, so we really continue to feel pretty bullish.","David S. Haffner","And Europe's automotive build forecast for 2012 is still 19 million units.","Karl G. Glassman","And it was actually -- the most recent forecast we've just released yesterday and the European auto production estimation was increased slightly.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of John Baugh with Stifel, Nicolaus.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Congrats on that working capital number. I can't remember the ratio being that low. Do you remember when it was 20% plus? And so kudos to that. I wanted to focus, I guess, on bedding and furniture. Let's talk U.S. It would appear to me in bedding, we've got high-end springs under some pressure, maybe not, but certainly middle end shifting down strength in units at lower end. Where are hybrids? Are they helping yet? Pocketed coils is getting a lot of attention. Is that helping or are we still looking at a negative mix issue within Leggett on innersprings? And then on residential furniture, just relating somehow the flat unit numbers year-over-year, what you think your customers are doing and any issues with the foreign competition there.","Karl G. Glassman","John, this is Karl. Thanks for opening the door for a conversation on U.S. spring. And the news there is very, very positive, that we are seeing significant positive impact from the launch of the Hybrid product lines. Comfort Core, which is our pocketed coil offering, is the fastest growing part of U.S. frames, with units up 20%, significantly higher average unit selling prices, improved margins associated with that, great overhead recovery in our facilities as we continue to work hard to keep up with that demand. So there is -- while we made comment of a negative mix shift in macro residential, U.S. spring is not impacted to that -- to any degree from an inner spring perspective. It is impacted from a boxspring perspective. You are right about the bifurcation of the market, but I'd do not think that high-end innerspring has been negatively impacted. You'll go back to the Sealy conference call, they commented that Stearns is growing. We see that. We see that in our other customers with competitive offerings, high-end innerspring is doing extremely well. And we are very, very bullish and we'll continue to invest capital to support that growth.","The middle market of the bedding industry is under pressure. The low end or the more promotional or somewhat, say, non-branded business has been very, very strong. That correlates to our boxspring numbers and that you saw innersprings -- U.S. innersprings up 2%, boxsprings decreased 3%. I will tell you that is no loss of market share. It is indicative of fewer boxsprings being sold. There are no steel boxsprings under the promotional bedding. As adjustable beds grow significantly, that mitigates the need for an adjustable boxspring under that adjustable mattress and some of the specialty suite product, very few of the selected -- of the specialty suite product sit on top of a wire-based product. So all those dynamics don't bode well for boxsprings, which is part of our residential mix explanation in that boxspring margins are higher than the rest of the segment. So there's a lot of moving parts. As it relates to home furniture, that flat unit's, certainly from a sequential perspective, is an improvement over the first quarter. We have lost a little bit of market share that we have since regained and we do think that, that demand is indicative of the market. To elaborate on another inference in your question though, we are seeing a shift from U.S.-based mechanism production to Chinese-based mechanism production. That is not a finished furniture mix, that is a component mix. We retain the business in Asia. So it's not a positive situation for our U.S. factory workers, which we're not fond of that situation. But we do retain the business and retain it in Asia sometimes with lesser functionality as the furniture industry has become a little bit promotional with the significant inflation of polyurethane foam pricing. So that is also a negative shift. The units are there, but the average pricings drops slightly","David S. Haffner","And John, this is David. Just kind of a crossover on pocket coils, which continued to gain momentum in bedding. It's also interesting, and we may have mentioned to you previously, that pocket coils are being considered and indeed utilized in upholstered furniture cushions more than they have in the past for a couple of or for several reasons. One important one, being the cost of the polyurethane foam, which is replaced with the air and the wire and the fabric of the pocket coils. And needless to say, it makes a superior seat. So that's been also a positive trend. I don't want to spin everything just totally positive, but that's something that's significant enough to mention.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Chad Bolen with Raymond James.","Chad Bolen","If I could maybe jump over, we're pretty pleased to see the strong contribution margin in Specialized Products. Could you maybe walk us through some of the moving parts there? And is that kind of performance something that we should expect to persist for the rest of the year?","Karl G. Glassman","Yes. It's certainly performance that you should expect for the rest of the year. Specialized is being helped primarily by the significant growth in automotive units. Our people have done a really good job of reducing costs during the downturn of a few years ago and not layering in that cost back on. So we're -- our facilities are very well utilized. Chad, as you remember, our Automotive business is a worldwide business, so the growth in production doesn't really matter to us as to in what geography it takes place. So things are good in automotive. We expect them to be good, and not only to the rest of this year, but into the foreseeable future years. There was a little bit of a negative in the second quarter in specialized and that our machinery volume was down slightly. That's indicative of lesser innerspring machinery demand on the continent of Europe. We expect some recovery there in the back half of the year. CVP, the sales were flat, the profitability was improved, certainly not to acceptable levels, but let's call it less bad.","Chad Bolen","And If I could just tuck on another quick one. I mean, obviously, in commercial, the program that you discussed is going to have a pretty significant impact. I guess from a modeling perspective, could you give us a little help in terms of what your full year guidance assumes for that segment in terms of growth and margin and maybe give us some sense of the magnitude of how that'll balances between 3Q and 4Q?","Karl G. Glassman","Chad, when it comes to details, you know I'm smart enough to t.o. that to Susan, but that program certainly is a strong store fixtures program that will really fully ship in the third quarter. We are  about halfway through that shipment as we speak. Things are going well and we're extremely pleased, but from a split standpoint.","Susan R. McCoy","Yes, Chad, just real quick. At the midpoint of our sales guidance, the total company will be about up 2.5% and thinking about that across the segment, that would be approximately [Audio Gap] magnitude of increase in residential. Commercial likely down around 7%, but most of that is the divestiture and the volume that we chose to exit. I'll just remind you that at the end of last year, we saw the combination of those 2 things would probably extract about $40 million of sales for the full year. Industrial up, order of magnitude maybe around 6%, but again, that's going to include the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition which should have annualized sales in the ballpark of about $65 million and specialized up somewhere on the 5%, 5.5% range. That's full year. We haven't done anything to try to help you really by quarter. But you should expect, as we alluded to, the commercial volume in the third quarter will be -- should have a nice uptick. And as you'll remember, fourth quarter is typically a very low quarter for volume in that segment.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","First in Residential. Karl, if you could comment on the sales trends as the quarter progressed in both spring as well as furniture, and anything you're seeing here in the first couple of weeks in July.","Karl G. Glassman","Keith, I'd tell you, I appreciate that, because it's been also a good news. So we're pretty optimistic that U.S. spring shipments were up about a -- about 1% in April, 4% in May and then 1% in June, we're up a little north of 7% in the first 3 shipping weeks of July that we believe that about half of that is market as a follow-through from a very positive 4th of July selling week and the rest of it is market share gains. We are starting to finally see some assistance from the custom border protection agency on our anti-dumping issues and it appears that they are starting to help us enforce the U.S. trade laws, which bodes well for us in the back half of the year, if that continues. As it relates to furniture, I don't have that broken out by period as much, but it strengthened pretty significantly as the second quarter progressed and continues to be reasonably strong as we speak.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And on the working capital number, you show on Slide 6, you're down year-over-year on working capital to the tune of about $90 million versus midpoint last year. Can we see that kind of working capital extraction as we hit year end here in 2012?","Karl G. Glassman","Yes. Actually, the answer is yes. There's a couple of changes in working capital and that addition of Western, while that business is wonderful business, it's not quite as working capital efficient as the rest of the company historically has been because of the nature of auto -- of aerospace build. But while I appreciate the congratulations on the working capital performance, we were a little fat in working capital as it relates to inventory at the end of the second quarter because we were building for this fixtures and displays release. So I see nothing but positive in the working capital trends.","Matthew C. Flanigan","Again, Keith, this is Matt, I'd just add that as a reminder, in both of the first 2 quarters of this year, even though the working capital statistics are relatively notable, we used over $20 million in each quarter and in the fourth quarter, seasonally, we always have a significant pick up and a source of cash for working capital and that certainly shall once again repeat that cyclicality this year.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And finally, for you, Haffner, I need a Missouri win in early September against Georgia...","David S. Haffner","I'll do what I can, Keith. But there's been some trash talking that's happening around our corporate office from some Georgia graduates. But we'll do what we can, my friend.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Robert Kelly with Sidoti & Company.","Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Just a question on how scrap prices have trended throughout the year here, if you received the benefit of the margin thus far in '12. And then expectations for the second half of the year, looks like the market is at least rumored to recover a little bit beginning August?","Karl G. Glassman","Bob, from the macro market perspective, the scrap has fallen off from April to July about $100 a ton. We expect about $50 of inflation, re-inflation now between the next couple quarters. The margins have been improved. We will see some -- the closer we get to commodity in our steel mill being billets impacted before rod, rod before wire, that we are starting to see a little bit of top line deflation because of the connectivity to scrap and we expect that to kind of reinflate as the year progresses. But the trends are certainly positive in that business from a margin perspective.","David S. Haffner","And Bob, this is Dave, I was just looking at our forecast for master coil and slit. We're expecting a modest decline in this third quarter that we're in and then just another modest uptick in the fourth quarter. Really not much to move the needle.","Robert Kennedy - Gradient Analytics, Inc.","And then just one final one on Western Pneumatic. You might've touched on it already. You stated that things are going better than expected. Is that on the sales and margin front? And then the drags, the inventory valuation, some of the items that depressed that contribution in the first half of the year, are they completely gone now?","Karl G. Glassman","Bob, as it relates to the performance, it's positive on both fronts. Certainly from a demand perspective and then the associated recovery of that has expanded those margins. We still do have some inventory valuation hangover that will pass through in the third quarter.","Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC","And then it's complete?","Karl G. Glassman","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Herb Hardt of Monness, Crespi and Hardt.","Herbert Hardt - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just to follow-up on the last question and Western Tube. As I remember, there was a $3 million evaluation change in the first quarter and supposedly the same in the June quarter. First of all, is that still true and how much would it be for the September quarter?","Susan R. McCoy","You're right about the first quarter, Herb. It was about $3 million. We had another, call it $1 million, in the second quarter, and there's about $1.5 million that remains that will come through third quarter.","Herbert Hardt - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","And the next question is on the 2 million shares you're giving employees. Is that going to be issued out of the treasury or will be bought back in the open market under your \"eventual\" buyback return?","David S. Haffner","We anticipate that we'll buy those back, Herb.","Karl G. Glassman","And Herb, from a point of clarification, those shares aren't given to the employees. A good percentage of those shares are purchased by the employees admittedly at a slight discount, but I don't want any  listener to think that, that is a gift.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is a follow-up from John Baugh with Stifel, Nicolaus.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","CVP. I don't know anything about that business. Tell me what's going on, all of the fleet stuff, how you're positioned, any competitive dynamics, et cetera.","Karl G. Glassman","As you know, it's a relatively small business that -- it is a fleet vehicle business, and basically, what we're doing is up-fitting delivery vans with Rack & Bin Systems that are then sold into the telecom TV service, the Sear's service groups. It's a difficult business to forecast in that because the releases tend to be large and difficult to forecast, and then we're also -- at the whim is too strong. But if the OEM vehicle manufacturers then push those fleets through into our system on a difficult-to-predict basis, because remember their primary business is in auto and truck manufacturing, so it's a difficult business. Our shares are reasonable, and it's certainly been under pressure in the last couple of years, and as I said, it continues to improve.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then touching on this large customer that you're making this store display shipment to, without naming names, what is the implication as we look, say, the fourth quarter, and more importantly, beyond 2013, maybe even '14, are they through their bottleneck? We don't know what we're going to do now we've decided and this clears the path to better volume for them for some foreseeable time or is this kind of a one-shot deal?","Karl G. Glassman","It is a single order that affects 5 different departments within this particular retail -- retailer. And as I said, about half of it has already been shipped. It will all be shipped in the third quarter. There is no forecast. There's certainly forecast of sales to that customer in the fourth quarter, but they would be normal sales. We are very optimistic because of our -- really to this point, really well-executed performance by our people. Our people have been working literally night and day getting these releases out and the products have been shipped on time with high quality and have really done a commendable job. And we have been congratulated by that retailer at this point, and are very optimistic that we will be in the front of the line for some of their planned releases in 2013.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","All right, and then lastly if I can sneak one more. CRI numbers were pretty weak. Carpet shipments in Q2, can you talk about your Underlayment business?","Karl G. Glassman","Actually, that's a good situation for us. It's been a little bit negative to the residential margins, but our square yards of carpet underlay, and you know this, but not all the listeners do that, it's a U.S. business only. We're up about 6% in the second quarter and strengthened as the quarter went on. With the housing statistics being somewhat improved, that's good for that business. Admittedly, the margins are below the segment and corporate average, but are certainly improving. That business is no longer a drag from a P&L perspective. Again, the margins aren't where we -- where they historically have been, but our people continue to execute well on that business.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Karl, I think residential carpets shipments were down in the low to mid-single digits. So is there something going on in share? Why would you be up like that?","Karl G. Glassman","We are extremely well positioned from a geographic standpoint, and I do believe that we are getting -- we're experiencing some share gains, particularly in the south and southeast.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Allen Zwickler with First Manhattan.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","Two questions, one is what is the size today of your Fixture & Display business, leaving out the truck business, just roughly. What's the run rate?","Karl G. Glassman","About $280 million.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","And how does that compare, say, with 2 or 3 years ago? You've always talked about rightsizing it and I'm just a little unclear as to how big it was at a  point in time.","Karl G. Glassman","Approximately half of what it once was.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","And the $280 million, is that the current run rate meaning about what it will be this year?","Karl G. Glassman","Yes, that's the 2012 forecast.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","And are the margins higher or lower than the corporate average in that business?","Karl G. Glassman","They are lower. They are improving, but they're lower.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","Improving, okay. But you are profitable, is that correct?","Karl G. Glassman","Yes.","David S. Haffner","Yes.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","Okay. And is that about the right size given the capacity that you have or do you still have excess capacity in that business?","Karl G. Glassman","We have really very little excess capacity, but remember that, that business is extremely seasonal. It always has been and most probably always will be. So the capacity has to be at a level to allow for the surge that takes place historically in the third quarter. But the business right now, for the business that we have in hand, is rightsized.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","Got it. And then switching over from -- back to the bedding business. You're talking about some of these newer products and I just wanted to step back for a minute and think about furniture\/bedding. Is there any change in -- I remember in the old days, there were a lot of living room furniture that had springs in it, beds in it. Are you active in that market? I mean, I'm sorry, just not to remember, but we barely ever talked about it. And if so, do these new styles or designs of beds have any bearing on that business?","Karl G. Glassman","They're really distinctly different. In that old sofa sleeper business, we are a large participant and believe were the largest producer of sofa sleeper mechanisms in the world, but...","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","That's what I recall, yes.","Karl G. Glassman","The market is significantly smaller today than it once was, growth of daybeds really took the legs out and then ultimately futons, we're going way back in time. But, yes, that business is a good business and we continues to participate in it, and we are very happy with the business. It's a little bit of a buggy whip business, but we're good at it..","David S. Haffner","And Allen, this is David. One thing I would say, the advent of some of the alternative sleep systems in adult bedding have spilled over a bit into sofa sleepers. Those used to be considered -- I mean, going way, way back considered poor quality sleep services and things have gotten significantly better including the application of pneumatic bladders on top of springs and so you won't kill your mother in law with one of these new ones.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","When you again are talking about these new mechanisms, I'm going back to the bedding business. Is it a zero-sum game, meaning, that if for example, as you mentioned, you're doing particularly well on the high end with some of these new styles I'm calling them, because I don't have a better word, is it that -- the volume just overall is flat and you may be getting some new business and losing that middle part as you mentioned? I just want understand the dynamics a little more. It's not clear to me.","Karl G. Glassman","Actually, it's not a zero-sum game and that because of the growth of the high end inner spring business at significantly higher average unit selling prices, that it's been positive to us, but that has been a very recent trend.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","Recent, meaning, in the calendar year or in the last few years?","Karl G. Glassman","Growing in the last few years, more significant in the last 2 quarters.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","Okay. And so what you're saying is that you're getting more pieces on a particular product than you were before, is that -- am I hearing you right?","David S. Haffner","That's correct. Allen, that goes back to the Pocketed Coil, Comfort Core conversation we had a little while ago where that business is growing significantly...","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","That's what I was trying to understand whether it's growing at the expense of something else or is it growing because you're getting more components on a box or an assembly. Is that what you're saying?","Karl G. Glassman","In terms of units, it's growing at the expense of something else.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","Okay. And just not to monopolize, but is the profitability and competitiveness of these new products the same, better or worse than the old-style products as you see them now?","Karl G. Glassman","It is better.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","On all counts?","Karl G. Glassman","Yes.","Operator","Our next question coming from the line from David MacGregor of Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Just a follow-up on the adjustable beds. What's the right way to think of a contribution margin on that product category?","Karl G. Glassman","David, it's certainly at the rate of growth that the contribution margin is consistent with our formerly stated range of 25 to 35. It certainly falls in that. That business has been wonderful for us and it -- a little bit goes back to the long conversation we just had with Allen and that we're replacing a boxspring that from our steel component form sells to the customer, say, at $15 with an adjustable bed that has an average unit selling price, say of $600. So in that small part of the market, it's only about 2% of all foundations are adjustable, but it's growing very, very quickly. So that's a good trend.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the floor back over to management for closing remarks.","David S. Haffner","Thank you for your attention and we'll talk to you again next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation. Thank you, gentlemen."],"12808":["Leggett & Platt Inc.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Dave DeSonier. Thank you, sir. You may begin.","Dave DeSonier","","Good morning, and thank you for taking part in Leggett & Platt's second quarter conference call. I\u2019m Dave DeSonier, the Senior Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations, and with me today are the following; Dave Haffner, our Board Chair and CEO; Karl Glassman, who is President and Chief Operating Officer; Matt Flanigan, our Executive VP and CFO; and Susan McCoy, our Staff VP of Investor Relations. ","The agenda for the call this morning is as follows; Dave Haffner will start with a summary of the major statements we made in yesterday's press release; Matt Flanigan will discuss financial details and address our outlook for the remainder of 2014; Karl Glassman will provide segment highlights; and finally, the group will answer any questions that you have.","This conference is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material. This call may not be transcribed, recorded or broadcast without our express permission. A replay is available from the IR portion of Leggett's website.","We posted to the IR portion of the website a set of PowerPoint slides that contain summary financial information along with segment details. Those slides supplement the information we discuss on this call, including non-GAAP reconciliations.","I need to remind you that remarks today concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results or events may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements.","For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the section in our 10-K entitled Forward-Looking Statements.","I will now turn the call over to Dave Haffner.","Dave Haffner","","Thanks, Dave. Good morning, and thank you all for participating in our call. We\u2019re very pleased with second performance in the majority of our operations and are seeing improved sales momentum in nearly all of our key businesses.","Same-location sales grew 4% during the quarter with strength in all of our residential markets, Office Furniture Components and Automotive, partially offset by lower volume in Store Fixtures and Commercial Vehicle Products. Excluding the weak performance in Store Fixtures and CVP, growth during the second quarter was strong with sales up 10%.","From a reported GAAP earnings perspective, as announced on July 14, we recognized a $108 million or $0.65 per share non-cash charge for the complete write-off of the goodwill associated with the Store Fixtures Group. Excluding this charge, second quarter earnings per share were $0.48, a 9% increase versus continuing operations earnings per share of $0.44 in the second quarter last year. This increase is primarily due to sales growth, reduced share count, and a lower adjusted tax rate.","Second quarter adjusted EBIT improved slightly versus second quarter last year with the benefit from broad-based sales growth, largely offset by weak performance in Store Fixtures and the non-recurrence of prior-year gains from asset sales. Adjusted EBIT margin for the quarter was 10.1%.","As we announced last week, we have engaged an investment banker to help explore strategic alternatives for the Store Fixtures business, including the possible divestiture of that unit. In a very positive long-term development, on July 1, we jointly announced with Tempur Sealy, the purchase of their three U.S. innerspring component production facilities.","In conjunction with this purchase, we also expanded and extended our supply relationship and became the exclusive long-term provider in the U.S. and Canada of wire-based innersprings for Tempur Sealy and boxsprings for Sealy. We are very pleased to have completed this transaction and we look forward to the expanded long-term strategic partnership.","The additional production should enhance economies of scale, benefit from our vertical integration in steel rod and wire and allow manufacturing optimization across a broad asset base. We expect this agreement to add approximately 2% to sales and be neutral to EPS over the first year as we execute our integration plan.","We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling three-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top one-third of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. So far, for the three-year period that will end on December 31, 2014, we\u2019ve generated TSR of 20% per year on average, which places us just below the midpoint of the S&P 500 over that same time frame.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Matt Flanigan who will discuss some additional financial details along with our outlook for the remainder of 2014. Matt?","Matt Flanigan","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Well, as expected, operating cash flow returned to strong positive territory in the second quarter and grew to $103 million, up 4% versus the same quarter last year.","We ended the quarter with working capital at 12.5% of annualized sales, consistent with the second quarter of 2013 and notably better than our 15% target. Based upon our current annual forecast and our normal seasonality, we expect to again generate operating cash of over $350 million for the full year.","Dividends should require about $170 million of cash in 2014 and capital expenditures approximately $100 million. Our depreciation and amortization expense should total about $120 million.","We continue to make investments to support growth in businesses and product lines where sales are strong and for efficiency improvement and maintenance. As volumes improve, we expect capital expenditure levels to increase, but longer-term they will likely remain at or below total depreciation and amortization.","Our incentive plans emphasize returns on capital, which include net fixed assets and working capital. This emphasis, we believe, helps ensure that we\u2019re efficiently utilizing our asset base and investing capital dollars where the highest return potential exists. Returns should continue to improve as we expand EBIT margins while controlling invested capital.","In May, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share. As such, 2014 marks our 43rd consecutive annual dividend increase at a compound annual growth rate of 13%. At yesterday\u2019s closing price of $32.87, the current yield is 3.7%, which is the fourth highest among the 54 companies that comprise the S&P 500\u2019s Dividend Aristocrats.","We repurchased 2.3 million shares of our stock in the second quarter at an average price of $33.33 and issued 700,000 shares. Consistent with our stated priorities for the use of excess cash flow, we will prudently buy back our stock bearing in mind our level of cash generation, other potential opportunities to strategically grow the company and the overall outlook for the general economy.","We have a standing authorization from the Board of Directors to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established, however, we currently expect to buy back between 5 million and 7 million shares in 2014 and issue approximately 2 million shares through employee benefit plans.","Our financial base remains strong and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. With the reduction in shareholders\u2019 equity from the non-cash impairment charge along with increased uses of cash during the quarter for the acquisition of the three Sealy innerspring plans that Dave mentioned earlier, and for share repurchase purposes, we ended June with net debt to net capital at 35.6%.","Given the normal seasonality of our business and our anticipated strong cash generation, we fully expect to end the year with net debt levels back near the low-end of our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%.","We expect full-year sales growth to continue to accelerate. Based upon our current forecast, we are narrowing our guidance to $3.88 billion to $3.98 billion in sales for the full year versus guidance of $3.85 billion to $4.05 billion, which would be up 4% to 6% versus 2013.","This revised guidance reflects softer-than-previously anticipated demand in Store Fixtures and CVP, but continued strength in most of our other major markets. Sales guidance also includes approximately $40 million of growth expected in the back half of the year from the acquisition of the three Sealy plants which closed on June 30.","With anticipated ongoing strength in many of our key markets, and an expectation for EBIT margins to continue improving, we made no change to our earnings per share guidance despite narrowing the sales range.","We continue to expect 2014 adjusted earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.85, which would represent another year of record adjusted earnings from continuing operations. This compares to adjusted continuing operations EPS of $1.54 last year.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Karl who will provide some additional segment comments.","Karl Glassman","Thank you, Matt, and good morning. As Dave mentioned, most of our businesses performed extremely well in the second quarter. In the Residential Furnishings segment, same-location sales increased 9% with each of the major businesses growing during the quarter.","In U.S. spring, component dollar sales increased 4%. Innerspring unit volume was down 3%, however, growth in the Comfort Core premium innerspring category continued with those higher-priced and higher-margin units up 48% during the quarter. Boxspring unit volume was essentially flat.","Sales grew 8% in International spring, primarily from market share gains and increased Comfort Core sales in Europe. In Furniture Components, sales increased 7% in the second quarter. Volume in our seating and sofa sleeper businesses grew 4% and motion hardware unit volume was up 14%. Adjustable bed units grew 35% in the quarter. New adjustable bed programs have begun to ramp up and should continue to drive significant volume growth in the back half of the year.","Segment EBIT and EBIT margin for the quarter increased versus second quarter of 2013 primarily from higher sales and favorable product mix, partially offset by the non-reoccurrence of last year\u2019s gain from a building sale.","In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, same-location sales decreased 24% in the second quarter. Store Fixture sales declined significantly due to the non-recurrence of major retailer programs from second quarter 2013 and unanticipated weak overall market demand.","Volume in Office Furniture Components grew 8% during the quarter, largely from new programs that we have been awarded and gradually improving market demand. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin, adjusted to exclude the goodwill impairment charge, decreased versus the second quarter of 2013, primarily due to lower sales.","In the Industrial Materials segment, second quarter same-location sales decreased 4% primarily from lower unit volume in wire and industrial tube. EBIT and EBIT margin for the segment decreased during the quarter. Metal margins in rod and wire continue to be under pressure as market conditions did not allow us to fully recover higher costs. EBIT was also impacted by lower unit volume in wire and industrial tubing and the non-reoccurrence of a prior year gain from equipment sales.","A dumping case brought earlier this year by major U.S. steel rod producers has begun to have a stabilizing effect on the domestic rod market. Our Aerospace business, which resides in this segment, continues to perform very well domestically and earnings should further benefit as we fully integrate our European acquisitions.","In the Specialized Products segment, same-location sales grew 10% in the second quarter. Automotive sales increased 21% from a combination of expanded content participation in new vehicle platforms and demand strength in each of the major geographic markets. Same-location sales also increased 3% in machinery.","These combined improvements were partially offset by a 22% sales decrease in Commercial Vehicle Products versus a strong prior-year comparison in that business. The segment\u2019s EBIT and EBIT margin increased during the quarter, primarily from the higher sales.","With those comments, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Dave Haffner.","Dave Haffner","Thanks, Karl. As we look ahead at the balance of 2014 and beyond, we continue to be very encouraged by the opportunities we are seeing in many of our markets.","Enhancing our portfolio of businesses by identifying opportunities to grow competitively advantaged positions while reducing our exposure to businesses that don\u2019t provide long-term strategic value remains a top priority. We believe these actions are keys to our long-term success and consistent achievement of our top third TSR goal.","And with those comments, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Dave DeSonier.","Dave DeSonier","That concludes our prepared remarks. We thank you for your attention and we will be glad to answer any questions.","In order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate, as we usually do, we request that you ask only one question and then yield to the next participant. If you have additional questions, you\u2019re welcome to re-enter the queue and we will answer those questions as well.","Kevin, we're ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Josh Borstein from Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question. ","Josh Borstein - Longbow Research","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions here. Dave, you mentioned some broad-based growth which you haven\u2019t seen in some time, but when you back out the $40 million from the Sealy spring business, the revenue guidance seems a little less optimistic than those comments would suggest, can you help reconcile those two things, it is mainly just the Fixtures and CVP business that\u2019s causing the variance there?","Dave Haffner","That\u2019s correct, Josh. Even if you back out the imputed $40 million in the back half, we\u2019re seeing growth that we haven\u2019t seen in a long time and it\u2019s extraordinarily encouraging. All the rest of the business units within Leggett are experiencing strong upward bias in demand except for those two that we mentioned.","Josh Borstein - Longbow Research","Great, thank you. And then, maybe Susan, this is for you, I know you updated us on your guidance by segment at the midpoint if guidance is changed, the segment guidance changed since we last spoke?","Susan McCoy","Yes, Josh. From the midpoint, I think your question is sales growth related, but at the midpoint of our guidance, which is 5% sales growth. For Residential, that would be somewhere in that 8% to 9% growth range and that includes 3% growth from the acquisition.","Commercial would be down in the mid-to-high teens again on weakness in Store Fixtures. Industrial would be up around 3% with that basically being the growth we\u2019re getting from the acquisitions that were completed last year in Aerospace. And Specialized up in the 10% to 11% range.","And if you aggregate all that, that should get to about 5% midpoint growth. You can decide if you want to be high or low in our 4% to 6% range, but that\u2019s the midpoint.","Josh Borstein - Longbow Research","Great, that\u2019s helpful. And then, if I can just sneak one more and I think maybe for Karl, you had some nice growth in adjustable foundations and I know you had some nice program wins helping that business, how much of that growth was selling given the new wins and looking past that, how do you see growth in the business over the next quarter or so?","Karl Glassman","Good morning, Josh. You are right, there are two major customer wins. That growth was phased in as the quarter progressed, trying to be fully in place by Memorial Day. So, you should see a greater rate of growth going forward than even the 35% that we experienced in the second quarter.","I will also say that our legacy businesses, those customers, they continue to grow as well too. So it\u2019s a combination of the strength of the historic customer base and these new big customer wins. Our adjustable bed people have really done a good job of executing on these programs.","Josh Borstein - Longbow Research","Great, thanks. I\u2019ll hop back in the queue and I know I\u2019ll see at least some of you on Monday. Thanks.","Dave Haffner","We look forward to, Josh.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Baugh from Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","John Baugh - Stifel","Good morning, and nice to see the volume gains here. I was wondering after that comment, if we can jump right into CVP and Store Fixtures, I\u2019m curious on a couple of things. One, where are they valued on the balance sheet? And then, can you give us some frame of reference for current run rate of sales for each business and EBITDA?","Matt Flanigan","I\u2019ll take the latter part of that John. Not sure that we\u2019re going to give you the valuation from a balance sheet perspective, but I\u2019ll give you the trends and the best way to think about those two businesses is our current expectation for Store Fixtures is that the sales for full-year 2014 will be about $80 million less than they were in \u201813, which gives us a run rate of, say, $185 million.","CVP, it looks like full-year sales will be off about $13 million for a run rate of about $113 million. Going forward, from a model perspective, assume that - backup. Second quarter F&D was off $34 million, CVP was off $9 million.","Third quarter, our current forecast show Store Fixtures off another $19 million and CVP off another $1 million. So, CVP is now anniversarying that real strength that we experienced in the first half of last year that you\u2019ll recall.","Store Fixtures is a bit of a challenge for us from the standpoint that we were pretty optimistic when we were on this call in April in that most of the Store Fixtures volume, as you know, is shipped in the third quarter and those are based on orders that are taken as the second quarter progresses. Those orders didn\u2019t take place, so that\u2019s caused this weakness. So it\u2019s been a step function change in demand expectations since our April call.","I want to make it clear though, we do not believe we\u2019re losing market share that many of the brick and mortar retailers are continuing to struggle with their investments in brick and mortar versus their e-commerce investments. And weakness in this business isn\u2019t a testimony to Leggett or our people. We have outstanding people that are trying to find every opportunity as they possibly can, the market is just depressed.","Dave Haffner","And John, this is a, relative to the first part of your question, we\u2019re going to respectfully decline to give out that detail at this time.","John Baugh - Stifel","Okay. Any comment around the profitability of those businesses and then as a follow-up, curious or would love more color on Residential Furniture, in particular Motion being up so strong. But it looks like your overall Components were up 7% as well, any wins there or do you think that\u2019s in line with market or any color there? Thank you.","Matt Flanigan","John, your questions are longer than my answers. And that\u2019s a challenge. The first part of F&D and CVP profitability, Store Fixtures was not profitable in the second quarter, it\u2019s expected to be profitable in the third quarter and as you know, the fourth quarter is always a challenge. So our current forecast would show that we will lose money in the fourth quarter as we always do.","CVP was profitable in the second quarter, should be marginally profitable in the third. And the outlook there is better. We think we found bottom in that business. We\u2019ve done a lot of tactical activities to improve the margins at this lower demand level. So we\u2019re optimistic on CVP going forward.","As it relates to the Residential businesses, boy Dave said it, there is good demand across all the businesses, the trends are positive from a bedding units perspective, you\u2019ll remember, Perry Davis mentioned on the April call that the April trend was soft. It was. Units were off about 13%, remember we had one less shipping day in April this year because of the Easter holiday move.","May units were down, this is innerspring units, were down about 2%, but June up 4%. The Comfort Core trend, those units were up 62% in June. So we feel like that there is a lot of momentum in those businesses.","The Furniture Hardware business for their units to be up 14%, I don\u2019t believe the furniture industry in this country is up as strong us our sales results show, we\u2019re gaining share and the motion market is very, very strong. So the fact that we\u2019re heavy weighted to motion, lesser weighted to stationery, stationery is important, but not as important as motion, is a good thing.","Carpet underlay, there has been real strength in recovery and top line and bottom line of carpet underlay. Those businesses, Geo Components, we saw strength, significantly improving margins there. Things are good in the residential markets and we expect them to continue.","John Baugh - Stifel","Great. Thanks for that color. I think your answer is longer than my question by the way.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Budd Bugatch from Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James","Good morning, David, David, Susan and Karl and Matt, thank you for taking my questions and most of my questions have now been addressed. I guess the one that I\u2019m confused about is the adjusted tax rate change in guidance. If I remember right, I think last call the tax rate guidance for the balance of the year was around 29% or 29.5%, if I remember right and now it seems to be that full-year tax rate on an adjusted basis is 27%, so can you tell us what\u2019s happened there and why?","Matt Flanigan","Yeah. This is Matt. Good question. There is not a lot of magic dust there, it really reflects where the earnings are coming from now as the year continues to progress. For example, as you hear and read about automotive doing particularly well, that\u2019s our most global footprint. In general, earnings generated outside of the United States tend to be at a bit lower tax, effective tax rate, than they do here domestically. So that\u2019s just one example.","But the grand scheme of it is that the mix and match of the earnings and where they are coming from is now driving our best estimate for tax rate for the full year to be a tad lower than the 29% we talked about 90 days ago and 27% is our best estimate as we sit here today.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James","I see. And for the out years, Matt, what should we use on that?","Matt Flanigan","Budd, another good question. Typically, we\u2019ve used about 30% as our working assumption to begin most of these recent years. I would say there is a bias slightly down from that as we see the lay of the land today, but it would be something around 29% to 30% if we had to tee up our best guess right now for 2015, but we\u2019ll sure refine that as we get closer to the end of this year and looking with better clarity into 2015.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James","Okay. So I\u2019m using 29.5% and that sounds like it\u2019s a reasonable number on that? And my last question goes to the Store Fixtures group, you have engaged an outside banker to look at that, what is the time frame on that, when does -- I don\u2019t know how I call patience, but when do you think that gets done?","Dave Haffner","Budd, it\u2019s going to be dependent upon the overall interest that we stir up in that particular business. I believe that it\u2019s likely to take six to nine months, if I had to venture a guess.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James","We\u2019ll go through this year, David, before we know --. You have - now, the Board has not made a resolution to declare that as disc-ops, right, so that\u2019s going to continue to be reported in operating results?","Dave Haffner","What\u2019s going to happen, Budd, is I\u2019m going to encourage the Board to resolve the approval of divestiture of that business. And once that happens, then of course the accounting classification will change. That is likely to happen at our upcoming Board meeting here in a couple of weeks. Once that resolution is made, assuming that it is, then we do have a Gantt chart of activity and I think I\u2019m being fairly conservative when I give you that time frame.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James","Okay, but that time frame, then we have to - we\u2019ll have to reclassify that for our modeling purposes?","Dave Haffner","Yeah. That\u2019s right, Budd.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James","Okay, thank you, David. Good luck on the balance of this quarter and the rest of the year.","Dave Haffner","Thanks.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question is coming from Daniel Moore from CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Moore - CJS Securities","","Good morning.","Dave Haffner","","Hi, Dan.","Daniel Moore - CJS Securities","Lot of ground has been covered. Maybe expand a little on the transaction with Tempur Sealy, what factors do you think pushed them over the edge and decide to exit innerspring and are there other opportunities, significant number of other opportunities, for other bedding furniture companies that might want to outsource components to you?","Karl Glassman","Dan, this is Karl. The conversations with Tempur Sealy have been, or let\u2019s call it Sealy, have been - it\u2019s been a long process. We first started talking to their management teams in 1960. So many of these relationships in these conversations take place over a number of years and outcomes develop as circumstances change.","I don\u2019t want to speak for Tempur Sealy. On their conference call yesterday they talked about the rate of speed of innovation, and certainly, I think that they respect how innovative our people are and the capability of our machinery. So I would think that the triggering mechanism was simply that. The bedding industry, demands, rapid-fire product innovation and frankly our people are very, very good at that augmented by some very capable machinery as I said.","As regards to other opportunities, we\u2019re always talking to people, we are in conversations today on some small, what we call, the verticalizations in Europe, they are small, we\u2019ll see. It\u2019s a small world. We have the same capability outside this country as we do in this country. So we\u2019re hopeful, but certainly nothing is imminent, nothing to announce.","Daniel Moore - CJS Securities","Okay, very helpful. And maybe just lastly, expand a little bit on or updated us on pressure in the wire rod pricing, you said it was starting to ease a bit given the legislative changes, maybe just update us on what you\u2019re seeing in that market?","Dave Haffner","We\u2019d be happy to. Dan, on a year-on-year basis, the rod price dropped very slightly, about 40 basis points while scrap costs increased somewhat slightly but meaningful but at 240 basis points. At the same time, we\u2019ve experienced increased cost as it relates to energy and transportation logistics costs. So unlike in a historical situation, if we had a move in raw material, we\u2019re darn good at passing through selling price cost changes.","It was difficult this time because of the influx of significant amounts of dumped rod from China, both high and low carbon, and you remember on the April, we talked about the impact that that had starting, say, last September or October, so it\u2019s compressed those margins. There was an anti-dumping countervailing duty filing in January of this year. That\u2019s going through the process. There was a significant amount of material that was on order.","We believe that that is -- all hit this country late May. So those inventory stockpiles are being worked through, but we\u2019re no longer -- the industry is no longer under the threat of those dumped materials. So we feel like that we\u2019ll start to see some recovery in the back half and that margin squeeze will be mitigated.","Daniel Moore - CJS Securities","And I\u2019ll squeeze one more in. Cash flow improved, but receivables and DSO still up a little bit. Just talk about what are the main levers that gave you confidence in the ability to still hit or exceed the $350 million for the full year?","Matt Flanigan","Yeah, Dan, this is Matt. We certainly feel very good about that. Our DSO metric, for example, in the second quarter came down to 52, but we certainly see that. As seasonality and collection activity unfolds, that will see some improvement between now and the end of the year.","Our inventories continue to trend down over the last two quarters. We\u2019re now at 69 days, but that also has some potential to ratchet downward. And our payables continues its ascension on purpose and smartly and so you start at least those for APs, the working capital equation together and we feel really good about where we think in 2014, we\u2019ll end the year in terms of working capital investment in the company.","Certainly, all of our modeling for the back half of the year is giving us lots of comfort that $350 million plus will be what our operating cash flow we\u2019ll generate and a big piece of that is what happens in working capital.","And as a reminder, last year, we ended the year at $417 million and we were very similar in the run rate as to where we sit today in that regard, a tad behind that, but again for good reason because some of the growth opportunities happening in the company right now that were not prevailing a year ago.","Daniel Moore - CJS Securities","Very good. Thank you again.","Operator","","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question is coming from Keith Hughes from SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust","","Thank you. As you pointed out in the release, the sales would have been just phenomenal without the two underperforming units. And we know where you were headed with those. But my question more in terms of how the management team and the management team and the Board think about it? Are you starting to change how you look at your portfolio of businesses such that maybe avoiding some of these businesses that we know, for example, Fixtures has struggled for some time about taking strategic actions before you get into a situation like it is now, maybe businesses that are doing well but don\u2019t have the growth profile, margin profile of others. I guess my question is, is there more of an aggressive portfolio approach that would be applied after these two businesses are addressed?","Dave Haffner","Yeah. Keith, this is Dave. Relatively speaking, the short answer would be yes. I believe and I know the rest of the team believes that we are being significantly more diligent upfront before we invest capital in new business units that we add to the portfolio.","Also, we are being -- we\u2019ve been way too patient way too long with some underperforming businesses and not that we\u2019re calloused; it\u2019s just that we recognize the value to the shareholder base by improving the overall efficiency of the portfolio. So bad on us for being too patient in the past for some businesses, but I do believe that we\u2019re significantly more diligent in identifying these strategic value of existing businesses, as well as prospective businesses.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust","One quick follow-up. On the adjustable bed number of 35%, I think I heard you correctly, you believe that growth is going to accelerate in the near term, is that due to just more placements or just the products not fully in the retail channel, where is that coming from?","Karl Glassman","Yeah, Keith, this is Karl. It\u2019s really the latter. The floors weren\u2019t fully placed through all of the second quarter, so we are in place as the third quarter starts going into the very important Labor Day holiday, so that\u2019s really what our thinking was.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust","Those numbers are probably -- we don\u2019t have adjustable bed growth numbers on this calendar year basis, but this appears to be well above the industry. Do you think the industry though is still seeing adjustable attach rates go up and dependent of your share gain here?","Karl Glassman","Yes.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust","All right, thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Herb Hardt from Monness, Crespi, Hardt. Please proceed with your question.","Herb Hardt - Monness, Crespi, Hardt","Good morning. Other than on capital gains side, are there any tax savings from this recent write-off?","Matt Flanigan","Herb, this is Matt. Not significant.","Herb Hardt - Monness, Crespi, Hardt","The second question is on the Aerospace, you made, I believe, four acquisitions now, any more on the offing?","Dave Haffner","Herb, we are looking at some other small businesses that could be complementary. I think you know that the component and sub-assembly businesses are relatively fragmented around the world, but, yeah, there are some others that we\u2019re taking a look at.","Herb Hardt - Monness, Crespi, Hardt","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next today is a follow-up from Josh Borstein from Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Borstein - Longbow Research","Thanks. A question on comfort cores, there\u2019s some nice growth there and I think Karl mentioned in June, up 62% on top of some already robust growth, were there any new program wins there, is this growth primarily coming just from sell-through?","Dave Haffner","Josh, primarily from sell-through. The industry is moving towards that comfort core category. There\u2019s certainly some small gains, but it really is the industry growing to a consumer preference. The growth of hybrids certainly have accelerated and augmented that.","Josh Borstein - Longbow Research","And I know that growth in comfort core, it\u2019s been robust in the U.S. for some time, it seems like you are also starting to see a pickup now in comfort cores in Europe, how far behind is Europe versus the U.S. in terms of this growing trend towards either hybrids or the use of more comfort cores?","Karl Glassman","Actually, it\u2019s -- the reverse is true. There is significantly larger percentage of total sales of comfort core, pocketed coil type products in Europe than there are in the United States. So it\u2019s really the growth in Europe, it has been market share wins and an improving economy and a healthier comfort core mix, but the comfort core product has always been significantly more popular in Europe.","The U.S. is kind of late to the party. That\u2019s why we expect again augmented by the hybrid product that we expect comfort core growth will continue to be significant. To put it in numbers, at the end of the second quarter comfort core was about 17% of our total unit sales in the United States. I don\u2019t, off of the top of the head, know what that number is in Europe, but it\u2019s probably two times that, so we would expect continued growth in the U.S.","Dave Haffner","Hey, Josh, this is Dave. One other thought, I know we\u2019ve mention it to you and some of the other colleagues, but Leggett enjoys a very nice advantage because of our ownership of [Speidel] [ph] and Speidel, I believe, is the undisputed leader in producing equipment that then subsequently wraps those coils at the speeds and with the quality consistency that all of our customers need. That\u2019s been very helpful in Leggett\u2019s participation of this overall movement towards pocketed coils.","Josh Borstein - Longbow Research","","Thank you for that extra color, very helpful. And then, just last on -- another question on the guidance, just looking at the slide deck, page 11, there is a category called Other, last quarter I think it was called higher tax rate and Other, there was about $0.06 variance between what you had this quarter $0.02 in that category and a loss of $0.04 in the last quarter guidance, what\u2019s the variance there, is it mainly just the tax rate?","Susan McCoy","The tax rate is coming down. We last time said 29% as an average for the year. Now, closer to 27% and otherwise, Josh, this is just kind of the catchall bucket go from last year to what the midpoint of the guidance is obviously at this point. It\u2019s our best guess of what\u2019s going to happen.","Josh Borstein - Longbow Research","Okay. Great. Thank you for that. And good luck.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.","Dave Haffner","We\u2019ll just say thank you and we\u2019ll talk to you again next quarter. Bye.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

And thank you for participating in our third quarter call.","Yesterday we reported strong third quarter sales growth of 8% to $1.09 billion. Organic sales grew 6% with volume of 3%. Raw material-related selling price increases, partially offset by currency impact also added 3%. Sales growth in U.S. Spring, Automotive, Adjustable Bed, Aerospace, Steel Rod and Work Furniture was partially offset by soft demand in most other businesses. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added 2% to sales growth.","Third quarter earnings per share were $0.67, up $0.06 from $0.61 in third quarter last year. Earnings grew primarily from expanded metal margin in our Steel Rod business and increased volume. Earnings growth was partially offset by higher raw material and transportation cost in several businesses, less overhead recovery where we reduced inventory and startup costs in a few of our growing businesses. Earnings also benefited from the non-reoccurrence of last year\u2019s $5 million impairment charge and $3 million divestiture loss, but these charges were fully offset by the non-reoccurrence of last year's divestiture-related tax benefit.","Steel scrap cost, which is the primary input utilized by our rod and wire consuming businesses including U.S. Spring has been relatively stable in recent months, allowing selling price increases to catch up in certain of our businesses. As a result, EBIT margins improved sequentially from 11% in the second quarter to 11.4% in the third quarter. However, EBIT margin decreased slightly compared to the prior year's third quarter adjusted EBIT margin of 11.6%.","While raw material cost increases have moderated, they are still a headwind in several of our businesses, including Home Furniture, European Spring and Flooring Products. We had another quarter of strong demand in our U.S. Spring business with Comfort Core innerspring units up 22% primarily from market share gains. We recently entered into a long-term supply agreement with Simmons Bedding and are supplying inner springs to several of their facilities.","In Adjustable Bed, sales grew 27 %, however, earnings were negatively impacted by promotional activity and lower overhead absorption as we reduced inventory. Automotive growth moderated to 4% in the quarter as vehicle production slowed, particularly in Europe and Asia. With our pipeline of awarded future programs, we continue to be confident in our expectations for strong long-term performance in this business.","In September, in our Geo Components business, we acquired a manufacturer and distributor of home and garden products that can be found in most major retailers. With annualized sales of $37 million, this acquisition provides a solid foundation on which to continue growing a retail \u2013 our retail market presence in Geo Components.","I'll now turn the call over to Matt.","Matt Flanigan","Thanks Karl. Good morning everyone. Cash from operations was $127 million in the third quarter, an increase of $21 million versus the third quarter last year. We ended the year with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales at 12%, end of the quarter of that is. We now expect our full year operating cash flow to approximate $400 million.","Regarding uses of cash for the full year, dividends should require about $195 million and capital expenditures should approximate $185 million. Our top priorities for use of cash remain organic growth dividends and strategic acquisitions. After funding these priorities if there is still cash available, we will generally intend to repurchase stock. ","Our financial base remains strong and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We repatriated $50 million of offshore cash in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $173 million. We currently expect to repatriate approximately $275 million of cash for the full year. We ended the quarter with net debt to net capital of 41.3%, slightly above our target range of 30% to 40%. And total debt was 2.3 times our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA.","As we announced yesterday, we are lowering our 2018 EPS guidance and now expect full year earnings to be $2.40 to $2.50 per share versus our prior rage of $2.55 to $2.70 per share. This decrease is primarily due to lower than previously expected sales in Automotive, a pricing lag on raw material increases in our European Spring, Flooring Products and Fabric, continued volume weakness in Home Furniture and European Spring, and promotional activity and lower overhead recovery in Adjustable Bed. Based upon this guidance range full year EBIT margin should be between 10.8% and 11.2%. Guidance assumes an approximate 21% full year tax rate.","Full year sales guidance is now approximately $4.25 billion, the low end of our prior range of $4.25 billion to $4.35 billion. This guidance represents an 8% increase versus our reported $3.94 billion of sales in 2017. We expect low-single-digit volume growth in raw material-related selling price increases should also add to sales growth. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, are expected to add 2% to sales growth.","As we previously discussed, two of our businesses Home Furniture and Fashion Bed, are not meeting our expectations. And we are conducting an in-depth analysis which may result in some restructuring expenses. We expect to have this analysis completed in the fourth quarter.","With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Wendy. ","Wendy Watson","That concludes our prepared remarks. We thank you for your attention and we will be glad to answer your questions. In order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate, we request that you ask only one question then yield to the next participant. If you have additional questions, please re-enter the queue and we will answer those questions as well.","Michelle, we're ready to begin the Q&A Session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment please, while we poll for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Susan Mcclary with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Susan Maklari","Good morning everyone.","Karl Glassman","Good morning Susan.","Matt Flanigan","Hi Susan.","Susan Maklari","My first question is around it sounds like there was just some weakness that came in this quarter globally as you sort of look across all your different businesses and end markets. Can you just give us a sense of maybe what some of the trends were on a more local basis in terms of Europe, Asia, the U.S.? And maybe even thinking about consumer products versus non-consumer products, just given that perspective that you guys have in all these different end markets and geographies?","Karl Glassman","Yes, Susan. It's a good holistic question. Your basic premise is correct in that there was some spotty softness, globally and structurally in some businesses, but overall, we feel really long-term optimistic about where we are. We\u2019re in a soft spot, a patch, I should say. The softness in Europe is embedded in pretty recent slowing in European Spring and in Automotive. Mitch will get into the details of that in a little bit. In Europe and Asia you asked, there is just general malaise. We haven't seen anything structurally change. Some businesses that consumer products and I should say specifically Fashion Bed and Home Furniture, we continue to analyze, as Matt said. ","So that I wouldn't attribute to market weakness as much as us backing away from some specific parts of that business purely because of margins that aren't acceptable. And as we said on the second quarter call, we're not going to wear out our assets, just do volume for volume sake. If there are acceptable margins associated with that volume, we\u2019ll continue in those sub sectors. Betting, U.S. was strong. We feel really good about where we're positioned there.","So to summarize, long term, tough, admittedly tough third and fourth quarter. But long term we feel really good about things.","Susan Maklari","Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess in terms of the bedding side of things, that's certainly an industry that's never short of events. As we think about some of the more recent news that came down this quarter with Mattress Firm, can you just talk to what you've been seeing out there? I mean, obviously, it seems like third quarter held up, but how should we think about the go forward as some of these events come through? ","Matt Flanigan","Perry do you want to handle this?","Perry Davis","Yes Susan this is Perry Davis. We \u2013 first of all, with regards to the Mattress Firm developments, we view that very positively. We believe that a strong Mattress Firm is obviously good the domestic industry. And with them being able to shed some cost and enhance their ability to generate cash, we think that's a very good thing. That helps in promotion and in a lot of other areas and stability in the market. Going forward, it's interesting times because as you know, there's a lot of macro factors outside of Leggett that are influencing business conditions.","Not the least of which I would say would be the ongoing antidumping case against finished mattress products from China. As that progresses along, if that begins to look positive, and we think it certainly will be, we believe there's certainly a plenty of evidence of dumping. That should invigorate not only folks from the supply side, where we're at, but also the finished bedding side and at retail. And so we look at that as a \u2013 while it may be down the road a little ways, but we look at that as a positive development if it in fact comes to fruition.","As to demand, yes, next year, it's difficult to say at this point. We held our head up pretty good in the third quarter, and we'll have to wait and see what the fourth looks like. Generally, right now, we're in a relatively slow time in the industry. You can usually take April and October and those are two of the weaker months, but that's planned for. And hopefully, we'll see a pickup through the remainder of the year.","Over the last few years, we've seen some relatively good strength going into the end of November and into December. ","Susan Maklari","Okay guys. Thank you very much. Good luck.","Matt Flanigan","Thanks Susan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bobby Griffin with Raymond James Financial. Please proceed with your question.","Bobby Griffin","Good morning everybody. And thank you for taking my questions.","Matt Flanigan","Good morning Bob.","Karl Glassman","Hi Bobby.","Bobby Griffin","First, I wanted to touch base on was the Automotive business. We saw that business kind of decelerate from high single-digit growth to kind of mid-single digit growth in the quarter. Was there some timing issues that caused that? Or how should we think about that in terms of the plus 1,000 basis points over production rate you guys have always talked about?","Mitch Dolloff","Okay good morning Bobby. This is Mitch. Our Automotive business continues to perform very well and our long-term outlet really has \u2013 outlook really has not changed. We have that strong pipeline of business that we've won, future programs that continues to give us confidence in meeting our goal of exceeding the vehicle production growth by a 1,000 basis points. Again, that's a long-term goal, right? We're going to have quarterly volatility, as we've talked about it in the past. But we still stand by that target for us.","In the third quarter, you're right. We're up about 4% year-over-year including currency compared to an overall decline in the market of about 2%, probably, something higher than that if we look at our major markets. So it was really kind of a mixed bag as you go around the globe. North America was very strong, we had double-digit growth there versus slight decline in the market. Asia was lower than normal for us in sort of mid-single digits versus slightly down for the market. And I think that there was the \u2013 based on the slowdown in sales in China and just some of the general economic concerns that Karl mentioned.","And then Europe was actually down a bit for us, pretty close to \u2013 in line with the market and the issue there, in addition to the sort of economic issues and Brexit concerns that Karl talked the specific disruption at OEMs with the onset of new emission testing standards called the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedures. So OEMs are actually having to slow or stop production on some models until the testing is complete. And so that has created quite a bit of disruption further back in the supply chain.","Bobby Griffin","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I appreciate that detail. So is the negative two kind of production growth that we saw in third quarter, is that somewhat close to the expectation for fourth quarter again? Or I guess, what do you \u2013 what is kind of your thoughts of the near term for production? ","Mitch Dolloff","I don't have a market number for the fourth quarter. I see it for the full year, which is \u2013 so for 2018 now the forecast is slightly negative year-over-year for the major markets down about 0.2% and less than 1% for the global market. So the forecast has come down, the production forecast. So from July, it's down about 1.3 million vehicles or about 1.6% globally. So it's been a pretty rapid shift. It's about time we talked. ","Bobby Griffin","Okay.","Matt Flanigan","And then I guess on \u2013 okay go ahead. ","Mitch Dolloff","I just wanted to say, for us, I'd probably see us pretty similar to where we are now for the third quarter.","Karl Glassman","Just to follow-on, Bobby. I would say that's the most significant contributor, that more recent news on Global Automotive to our downshift of our 4Q expectation.","Mitch Dolloff","Yes. It's \u2013 we have \u2013 our business fundamentally hasn't changed for us. We haven't lost program, we're just seeing the volatility of that entity.","Bobby Griffin","Okay. And then I guess this is more of just a high level type question. But when you look at some of the headwinds that maybe surprised you here in this quarter, the promotional activity or the lower overhead, the step down in auto, which one of those are \u2013 have the chance to be longer term in nature verse shorter term in nature to help us kind of frame what we want to do with our 2019 estimates? Understand you guys don't provide guidance until the fourth quarter.","Karl Glassman","Yes, before I answer the whole question, Mitch, why don't you take the opportunity to talk about the promotional activity as it relates to Adjustable and to answer the first part of Bobby's question?","Mitch Dolloff","Okay, alright. I\u2019ll be glad to do that. Adjustable Bed business continues to be really strong on a unit basis. We have 22% in the first quarter, 48% in the second quarter and 28% in the third quarter. As we mentioned last time we were on the call though, that forecast that we are getting were even stronger, too strong in hindsight. And so that left us with access inventory. We agreed to work with one of our major retailers \u2013 retail customers to \u2013 on some promotions to reduce the inventory and facilitate a move to refresh the product line. So we agreed to a rebate on unit sales. And we also cut production significantly to help reduce the inventory.","So the good news is that it worked, our inventory is down over 13% since Q2. The bad news is that the loss of production and the promotional cost were even higher than we expected. So of course, we had those impacts baked into our forecast for the third quarter. But we ended up extending the rebate and curtailing production more severely to reduce the inventory.","So we think we'll start to see some increase in production during Q4. But expect to see some continuity \u2013 continued headwinds from the promotional cost and lower overhead absorption into the first quarter of 2019. So we're making progress, but we still got ways to go.","Karl Glassman","And Bobby to answer your higher level question, and you're right, we're not giving 2019 guidance. But we really do believe that most of the issues that the company and the industry has dealt with in 3Q and 4Q are transitory. Automotive is expected to rebound. We feel very comfortable with our call on the 1,000 basis points of growth greater than build. But we have an expectation, that most of the pricing issues that we've dealt with, based on the visibility than we have today, which is a caveat that I want to put on it, that the pass-through was taking place.","As we said or I said in my prepared comments, we're mostly through that from a U.S. Spring, rod, wire value chain. That there was a little bit of a hangover in early 3Q, that we're past. Scrap jumped up a little bit in October, $10 to $20. Forecast is it'll jump up slightly in November. But in the big picture, that's kind of insignificant and the lag will catch up.","The other points of raw material pass-through that we called out, European spring, we've enacted pricing increases. Usually European inflation is about a quarter behind U.S. inflation. So they're raising prices, difficult in a very soft bedding economy. And it feels like the consumers become more promotional in Europe with the macro uncertainty, but the pricing is going in play \u2013 in place, the mix might not be as attractive from a future perspective. ","We mentioned flooring products, there was a 24% increase in the cost of foam scrap early in the third quarter that we're passing through, double-digit price increases are being put in place. Fabric, same situation, there has been some inflation there. 4Q, we're passing through that. Furniture and consumer products, those businesses continue to be challenged. They will be healthier next year. They will probably be smaller, but they'll be healthier. ","So structurally, at a macro level again, not putting guidance on it \u2013 well, and one other thing I want to interject, this metal margin that we're dealing with in the steel mill, the supply chain, that should continue for the foreseeable future. So we're really optimistic about 2019. We'll obviously, on February 4, put some numbers around that. But we really do believe what we're dealing with right now, assuming that the macro economy is reasonable next year, we're outliers.","Bobby Griffin","I appreciate the detail. And best of luck in the first quarter and into 2019.","Mitch Dolloff","Thanks, Bobby.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Moore with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Moore","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions as always. Your Q4 guide implies a little bit of further slowdown to the low single-digit organic growth, if my math is correct. You gave a lot of color on auto, very helpful. Maybe can you break that down a little bit by segments? And just give us a better \u2013 little better sense of where you're expecting the biggest kind of near-term slowdowns?","Mitch Dolloff","Cassie why don\u2019t you.","Cassie Branscum","Yes, the biggest impact you'll see will be in our Furniture Products segment in Q4. But sales, we ","single digits for the year. Industrial will be up high teens. And furniture despite this sort of second half slowdown should be up low single digits for the year. Specialized will be up low teens.","Daniel Moore ","For the year or Q4? You mean to say special.","Wendy Watson","Specialized will be up low teens for the year. For the quarter..","Daniel Moore ","For the year, right.","Wendy Watson ","Yes Those \u2013 they, for the fourth quarter, they'll still be up probably low double digit.","Karl Glassman ","Yes. Some of that should grow.","Wendy Watson ","And that's acquisition.","Karl Glassman ","Right. The organic growth not having lapped through the Hydraulic Cylinders acquisition.","Daniel Moore ","Very helpful. Appreciate it. And then one other quick one, yes, go ahead.","Wendy Watson ","Sorry, just to be repetitive. That auto in 4Q, growth is expected and that guidance to be about the same as it was in 3Q just to be repetitive, which is a big swinger obviously, in Specialized.","Daniel Moore ","Indeed. That's perfect. Thank you. Last quick one for me is, if I look at just overall trends in Q3, you mentioned foam prices being up, but input cost on raw materials, if they stayed where they were today and obviously nothing ever stays where it is today, but if they did, when do you think would be kind of fully caught up or close to fully caught up with price increases catching up with the raw materials? Thanks, again.","Karl Glassman ","Dan, if it's \u2013 thanks for the questions by the way. If everything stayed the way they are today which I agree is questionable to forecast, but I think we'll be caught up by the end of the quarter. That, yes, we should be fully through on all of those businesses we called out by the end of the quarter.","Daniel Moore","Got it. Helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. In industrial, we saw the influence of what's going on with the spreads and you've been talking about for some time, some big numbers. But in Residential and Furniture, raw material still called out as a negative, because both of that saw that EBIT decline year-over-year. Can you just sort of talk about the relationship there? And what specifically is happening in Residential and Furniture to have raw material hit them?","Karl Glassman ","Yes, Keith, I'll ask Perry and Mitch to take those respectively. Other than, I don't want you to think, and it's easy to assume that the Residential raw material commentary has to do with the bedding, rod, wire supply chain. That is not the case. The commentary around Residential really was, these other ancillary products. So it was more recent inflation and I spoke to the pass-through. But bedding room we're caught up. So, but anyway, Perry will answer it.","Perry Davis","Yes. The other part of that Keith, I think, in Residential, in our Flooring Products group as Karl said, we saw some really significant and kind of two tranches of raw material increase which is on scrap foam primarily. But we also saw it earlier in the year on some input chemicals like MDI and things like that. But scrap foam I believe in September was about double the price it was in April of this year. And the second tranche of that increase really came on quick. And so we've reacted quickly, we have price increases, double digit price increases going into effect basically a bit about next week I guess.","And so we expect, as Karl said, we'll be caught up there fairly quickly. The other area was, we saw some real significant polypropylene increases which influences our Fabric groups, both Hanes Converting and Hanes Geotextile and so we've had a bit of a catch up there, we've been pursuing, where we've got most of it, we'll have the rest of it by mid-November. The other complicating factor in that business is lot of that products imported. And some of it \u2013 a lot of it from Asia and we've got to the tariffs that we're dealing with. But we have passed-through the initial tariffs. We certainly don't intend to absorb those in any business.","But waiting to see if in fact that goes up to 25% at the end of the year we're fully prepared to act immediately, and we've been talking that up with our customers and have good acceptance of that. It's not a cost anybody can avoid if it comes to be. So, but yes, for the most part and then the other thing is the kind of the downdraft we've still experienced in Europe. It is still a little later as far as getting those raw material increases and getting those passed-through. And as Karl said, the macro environment for bedding on the mainland in Europe and then in UK is not very good right at the moment. ","So it's always kind of difficult whenever you're going up in a kind of a depressed environment. But we're working to get all that caught up too. And then, that may linger on into the first part of the year before we get fully recovered there.","Mitch Dolloff ","Yes. This is Mitch. In Furniture, the biggest impact is in the Home Furniture business. And there are still total costs were about, were up about 15% in the first quarter and closer to 25% in the second quarter. But we were only able to recover about one-third of the material inflation. So really adversely impacted our results. So as we said, we're transferring production to our Chinese operations to take advantage of lower input cost, and we're also shedding low margin accounts.","So in the third quarter, steel cost for us was up about 17% year-over-year and we improved our recovery ratio to about 60% to 65%. So, made some progress there. We expect to continue to close that gap in the fourth quarter probably get closer to 90%. So we might not be completely there by year-end, but we'll be pretty close.","Keith Hughes ","Okay. And that's flat steel, right?","Mitch Dolloff ","Yes. It's flat steel.","Keith Hughes ","All right. And then, as you look to the fourth quarter and the guidance you gave I think you talked about, I guess more slower growth in Automotive. But kind of get the impression, are we going to see volumes slow in a \u2013 just a large number of your businesses based on this guidance in the fourth?","Karl Glassman ","That's a darn good question, it's difficult to forecast in this environment. We have pretty good visibility in Automotive. We've talked about virtually no change in the growth right there. Bedding is always difficult to forecast, but we like our position. The content gains and the market share gains will continue. Certainly, I'm confident that we're outperforming the US bedding market without any question from a domestic producer perspective. But yes, it does forecast some continued softness. ","The majority of it is the Automotive side of it, some of it is European Spring and the remainder would be Home Furniture and consumer products. So it's really those four businesses.","Keith Hughes ","Okay.","Matt Flanigan","Yes. Keith, this is Matt, I would just add and complete exactly what Karl said. So sales, this coming fourth quarter versus last year's fourth quarter will still be up about 5%-ish give or take. But a keynote is, just as Karl said, when you hear about Automotive being a bit softer and European bedding a bit softer, that mix shift and not as many sales there as opposed to elsewhere in the Company, that's a meaningful EPS impact when we see those sales dissipate just a bit in those two key parts of the Company.","Keith Hughes ","Okay. Thank you.","Wendy Watson","And Keith just to pile on, I mean, the only segment where we would expect to see contraction year-over-year in Q4 would probably be Furniture Products.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Baugh with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","John Baugh","Good morning and thank you. I guess sort of touch on that market share comment you made Karl, and then Perry you can chime in as needed. That, I'm curious as we, I don't know \u2013 try to look out the future and assume there's a meaningful dumping rate assigned, and the industry, at least the sub-$1,000 spring kind of industry rebounded to some meaningful degree. I'm trying to get a sense, you, I think reported a 1% or something growth in springs or there is some growth in the springs in the quarter?","I'm assuming that share gains you've referenced, Simmons among other things. But the simple question is, if we got a meaningful duty, then let's say the low end of the domestic producers saw growth next year with your share gains, content gains what kind of spread would we expect to see from Leggett, say, on a unit basis, let's leave inflation of steel out in that \u2013 given those assumptions.","Karl Glassman ","Well that's a good question, John. Why I should give it to Perry?","Perry Davis","I guess I'd start off by saying that the domestic US mattress market is somewhere around $30 million. We believe that \u2013","Karl Glassman ","That's in units. Total metric.","Matt Flanigan","In units, I'm sorry. Yes. The China part of the business is $4.5 million, $5 million maybe as much as that. So if those got repatriated, some of them likely would go elsewhere, but most of that, if there's successful effort on the dumping action would be repatriated. ","You're talking about a significant uplift, and that would, I believe more effect the promotional end of the market. As you said, that could be both innerspring and the foam part of the market. So it'll provide a meaningful uplift for US manufacturers. And beyond that as far as percentage growth, I think I'll stay away from that at this point.","Karl Glassman ","John, it's really tough to forecast when that business comes back. And we're confident that, and we're starting to see some early signs of it coming back. So we're confident that there will be a positive uplift. But it's hard to forecast today, when it comes back, will it come back as innerspring or foam or hybrid? And what's the channel of distribution as it comes back? ","It left as brick-and-mortar low end innerspring. It more than likely is probably going to come back as a higher percentage of foam possibly hybrid than it left and a greater percentage of it would probably come back as e-commerce, then it would brick-and-mortar. But trying to understand that balance is difficult and that's why it's so difficult to answer your question. That's the best we can. We don't know.","John Baugh","How about this question? If we just look to Q3, which is in the books, what did your US Springs business do in units versus what you think the trade did overall?","Karl Glassman ","We were up 1%. ISPA has not published domestic units yet. But they said that 2Q units were down 3%. I don't see any reason to expect that changed. And our dollars were up 5% and that's a tribute to content gains and inflation.","Perry Davis","Yes. And John, just a little more color on content gains during the quarter, which we've talked about the shift and the share gains with regards to Comfort Core. But the two things we talk about generally in content gains are Quantum Edge and then some of these lower height Comfort Core products that are used in upholstery layers. And just looking at the third quarter year-on-year, Quantum Edge is up a little over 27% compared to last year. So that's terrifically good.","And then the upholstery part of the equation with the lower height Comfort Core units were up a little over 50%. So that, while that started at a relatively low basis, beginning to become quite meaningful as manufacturers utilized those products in mid to upper-end product lines.","Karl Glassman ","And John to even give more granular, as it relates to the Comfort Core's sphere of our US total innersprings, 2016 it was 33%; 2017, 37%; year-to-date, it's 43%; third quarter was 45%; September was 48%. So that trend continues to expand and admittedly taking some of the Simmons business helped facilitate that. And to Perry's point as we put Quantum Edge around an increasing number of Comfort Core from a value per mattress perspective, that story is a wonderful story that continues to hold up.","John Baugh","Okay. And maybe a question for Mitch on Automotive, because I don't cover that space and I certainly don't track quarterly or annually even the major market of auto builds and global and all that stuff. But you talked in the past about, still in the future, still expecting this 1,000 basis points spread. I guess is that in \u2013 and I know the quarters are lumpy, but if I look, I don't know back to eight quarters and then we look forward, say eight quarters as best as you can, is that 1,000 basis points holding up? And which you're doing the major markets or are you doing global? It seems to me that spread has been a little bit lower in the last several quarters, then maybe I'm off.","Mitch Dolloff ","I think it's been up and down over the last several quarters. Again we didn't really set it out there, the quarterly metric, but more of a long term goal. I think that we've been hitting it over the last several years, and when we look out into the future, and remember we have really good visibility here, we see us overall continuing to be able to maintain that goal.","So, I kind of talk about the major markets versus developing markets for a couple of reasons, one, just the scale is quite different. The major markets are about 80 million vehicles today versus the developing markets at about 15 million. So not surprisingly the major markets growth is lower, right, because they're developed markets. So if you look at the long term CAGR, call it 2017 through 2021 for the major markets that is shown at a little less than 1%. Still good on 80 million vehicles, but it's a lower growth rate.","In contrast, when you look at the developing markets, that's a higher growth rate about 5.5% on a much lower base the 15 million units. So, the distinction is, I think important in a couple of ways, one, we have certainly more content in the major markets, that are higher level vehicles. We have less than the developing markets, but the developing markets are our long term future opportunity. We continue to see content gains as economies develop, and that someplace that we'll end up playing in a bigger way over the long term.","John Baugh","Okay. Thanks for that color. Appreciate it. Good luck.","Karl Glassman ","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Peter Keith","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for all the detail. I wanted to just circle back on the promo activity in the Adjustable Bed business side. I wasn't quite clear, was that self-induced promo activity? Or is there broader promotional dynamics starting to play out in the industry right now?","Mitch Dolloff ","This is Mitch, Peter. No, it's a program that we participate in conjunction with one of our retail customers.","Karl Glassman ","Really it's a wind out of their existing product line. And to be completely candid, they had forecasted more robust sales than they actually delivered on, so we had excess inventory. We are working with them to wind down that existing program and as Mitch said earlier that, it's really been a good monetization of that inventory. The problem is we are working together to discount the product and that it's because we're selling out of inventory instead of new production it's hurt us from an overhead recovery perspective.","Peter Keith","Okay. That's helpful color. Thank you. Lastly from me the Flooring and Carpet Cushion business doesn't usually get a lot of attention, it's pretty steady. I guess I don't have context on any history of it, double digit price increase. Is there any unit elasticity in that category? Could that impact future demand? Or certainly, a lot of dynamics going on in the Flooring right now is moving to hard surface and how should we think about that price increase and how to play out to your overall volume growth?","Perry Davis","Yes. Peter, we used to see a lot of volatility in that business, and we've been fortunate enough not to have too much over the last few years. So this is the most significant moves in both scrap foam raw material and chemicals that we've seen in a while. There are fewer players today in that business than there were a few years ago. We believe the industry overall has a better pricing discipline than it used to have, and you're right, the growth of hard surface flooring, particularly luxury vinyl tile over the last few years has taken some share away from soft surface or carpet. But also has taken share away from things such as ceramic tile and hardwoods and other hard surface flooring.","So and incidentally, we participate in a growing part of our business with a synthetic rubber underlay product for luxury vinyl tile, that's a very good acoustical or sound deadening product, and that's growing significantly. We're holding our own pretty well, in carpet, our unit volume is about flat. And like I said, we've had a little bit of a challenge this year with some unexpected increases, but overall that's a healthy business unit.","Peter Keith","Okay. Sounds good, guys. Thank you. Good luck.","Karl Glassman ","Thanks, Peter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Herb Hardt with Monness, Crespi, Hardt. Please proceed with your question.","Herb Hardt","Good morning.","Karl Glassman ","Good morning, Herb.","Herb Hardt","Two questions. One, you used to speak much more about aerospace and the stability, long term growth. I see one comment it was up 10% in the release. But is there anything, especially given what's going on with military spending these days on the outlook that could improve it?","Mitch Dolloff ","Hi, Herb. This is Mitch Dolloff. Yes, I think we didn't talk a lot about aerospace, because it was generally good news, this quarter. I think that business continues to perform very well. We are winning new awards. We're improving the profitability. We continue to have a strong flow of deals from an M&A standpoint, although we haven't put anything together. So we continue to be very enthusiastic about the business and it's performing well.","Herb Hardt","Thank you. The other question is, back to the carpet underlay, I believe you said you were close to doubling of raw material cost in some places which seems to be pretty rough to pass through. You've talked about this several times this morning, but is there in general a longer term delay in doing that? Or are you able to bring it on pretty quickly?","Perry Davis","Yes. Herb, this is Perry. We have reacted quickly. As I said, there's been kind of two tranches this year, this last increase over the last 90 days has been, came upon us, somewhat unexpectedly and happened quickly, but we reacted immediately. We are the largest provider of those products we feel. And we have led the way with increases and sometimes when you lead the way, your nose bumps into the wall, but with this, there is nobody that's not affected in this business by what we've seen. And the magnitude of the increases are just simply impossible to absorb, so we\u2019ve quickly taken action to pass those through, and we fully expect to recover, like I said by the mid-end of November, something like that.","Herb Hardt","Okay. Thank you very much.","Karl Glassman ","Thanks, Herb.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Ms. Watson for any closing remarks.","Wendy Watson","Thank you, everybody for participating today. And we'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Actual results or events may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements.","For a summary of these Risk Factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday\u2019s press release and the section in our 10-K and 10-Q entitled forward-looking statements.","With those comments, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Karl Glassman.","Karl Glassman","Good morning. And thank you for participating in our fourth quarter call. I want to take a moment and thank our dedicated fellow employees around the world for your efforts this past year, you are very much appreciated. We are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2017 sales growth, which was largely driven by new programs, increased content and market share gains. Our EPS was lower in 2017, most significantly from the effect of one-time cost associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Matt will discuss later in the call. Adjusted EPS was 1% lower primarily from rising steel cost over much of the year and LIFO expense, which pressured profit margins.","For 2018, we expect that market improvement and Leggett initiatives will drive sales growth and increases in earnings per share. Last week, we acquired Precision Hydraulics Cylinders, a leading global manufacturer of highly engineered hydraulic cylinders, primarily for the materials handling market. The purchase price was $85 million. PHC has current annual revenues of $81 million and represents an attractive new growth platform for us. Hydraulic cylinders is one of the handful of new markets identified during the styles of competition analysis and growth process we began in 2016.","PHC serves a market of mainly large OEM customers utilizing highly engineered co-designed components with long product life cycles, yet representing of small part of the end products total cost. This business aligns extremely well with the critical component style shared by many of our strongest performing operations and is expected to add 2% to our 2018 sales. Hydraulic cylinders is a new business unit in our specialized product segment and will report to Mitch. We welcome PHC\u2019s employees in North Carolina, the UK and India to the Leggett & Platt family.","Our businesses remained well positioned for long-term profitable growth. Matt will run through our guidance for 2018 and our 2020 financial targets later in the call. Fourth quarter sales increased 9% to $984 million, reflecting 5% higher volume from strengthened Automotive, Adjustable Bed and several other businesses, and 4% growth from raw material related price increases and currency impact.","Acquisitions added 2% to sales growth, but were offset by divestitures. Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.27. This included several items outlined in yesterday\u2019s press release that net to $0.32 per share reduction in earnings. Excluding these items, adjusted fourth quarter earnings increased 11% to $0.59 per share from $0.53 last year. This increase is primarily due to higher sales in the quarter. For the full year, sales increased 5% with organic sales up 6% from a combination of 4% volume growth and 2% benefit from raw material related price increases and currency impact.","Acquisitions added 2% to sales, but were more than offset by divestitures. Full year earnings per share from continuing operations decreased to $2.14 from $2.62 in 2016. Current year earnings include the fourth quarter $0.32 per share net reduction just mentioned. Full year 2016 earnings included $0.13 per share net benefit from divestiture gains and other small items. Adjusted full year earnings per share decreased 1% to $2.46. Adjusted EPS benefitted from higher sales, a lower effective tax rate and a lower share count. However, these improvements were more than offset by higher steel cost, the lag associated with passing along that ongoing inflation, and several smaller factors.","During 2017, we completed three small acquisitions, including a distributor and installer of Geo Components, a surface critical bent tube manufacturer supporting our private label ceiling strategy and work furniture and a producer of bonded carpet underway. We also continued investing capital to support organic growth opportunities, primarily in automotive, Bedding and Adjustable Bed. During the year, we divested the last remaining business within our commercial vehicle products.","In the past, we have provided segment narrative in our prepared remarks during this call. We are departing from that practice, since those results were both the quarter and the year are detailed in the yesterday's press release and in the slide deck we posted to the Investor Relations Web site. We are making this change to reduce repetition and allow more time for Q&A. We will be happy to discuss any questions you have relating to the segments during Q&A at the end of the call.","I'll now turn the call over to Matt.","Matt Flanigan","Thanks Karl and good morning everyone. First, I'll address the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Our fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings include a net $50 million or $0.37 per share charge for the estimated impact of the TCJA. This is comprised of $57 million charge related to the deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings, a $9 million charge for accrual of foreign withholding taxes on expected future cash repatriations and $26 million tax benefit from the revaluation of tax liabilities at the new lower U.S. federal tax rate. As provided in the act, the deemed repatriation tax will be paid over eight years.","We expect our 2018 effective tax rate to approximate 22%. This rate reflects the lower U.S. federal tax rate or anticipated mix of domestic and foreign earnings and the impact of state income taxes. While the U.S. tax rate has decreased, the benefit to Leggett is not as significant as might first be assumed. A larger share of our income is expected to be earned in higher tax foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. domestic production activities deduction has been eliminated and the deduction for a portion of executive compensation will be phased out. The 2018 rate also includes an ongoing accrual for taxes payable to foreign jurisdictions associated with repatriation of cash from future earnings. Finally, our tax rate is impacted by changes in stock compensation, which vary from year-to-year and is forecasted to be lower in 2018.","During 2018, we expect to repatriate approximately $300 million of cash currently held in foreign accounts. Both the timing and exact amount of this repatriation activity is difficult to predict and is subject to local foreign governmental requirements among other things. In keeping with our long standing priorities, cash will be used for; one, organic growth involving capital expenditures and working capital investments; two, dividends; three, strategic acquisitions; and four, share repurchases. In the short term, we may use a portion of that cash to repay $150 million of debt that matures in July. We do not plan to pay a special dividend or undertake significant incremental share repurchases with this cash.","Now back to our 2017 financial performance. We generated operating cash flow of $444 million. We continue to have a sharp focus on working capital management and we ended the year with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 10.6%, which was a notable improvement from our recent trends. In November, we declared $0.36 per share quarterly dividend, which was 6% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2016. The dividend payout as a percentage of adjusted earnings is within our targeted range of 50% to 60%, and we expect future dividend growth to approximate earnings growth.","At yesterday\u2019s closing price of $43.45, the current yield is 3.3%, which is one of the highest yields among the 53 companies that comprise the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. For the full year, we repurchased 3.3 million shares of our stock at an average price of $48.66 and issued 1.7 million shares primarily for employee benefit plans.","Our financial base remains very strong and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. In November, we issued $500 million of 10 year notes with a 3.5% coupon and used the proceeds primarily to repay outstanding commercial paper. We also increased our revolving credit facility, which supports our commercial paper program from $750 million to $800 million and extended the term of the facility to November 2022. We ended 2017 with net debt to net capital of 33% comfortably within our longstanding target range of 30% to 40%, and we have the full $800 million of credit available to us.","We also monitor debt-to-EBITDA and ended 2017 with debt at 2.1 times our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling three-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top one-third of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year.","For the three-year period that ended on December 31, 2017, we generated compound annual TSR of 7% per year. That performance places just below the midpoint of the S&P 500. While this is disappointing, we continue to believe our disciplined growth strategy and improved use of capital will support achievement of our top third goal.","We believe the macro environment should support modest growth in our end markets over the next few years. More importantly, we expect to grow organically at a faster pace in our markets as a result of content gains, program wins and other opportunities we have developed within our growth businesses such as Automotive, Bedding, Adjustable Bed, Work Furniture, Geo Components, and Aerospace. As we entered 2018 with continued steel inflation, we also expect sales to increase from the pass-through of higher raw material cost. Although, there will again be a lag in timing which occurs when we adjust our own selling prices.","With this backdrop for 2018, we are forecasting stronger sales growth. Sales from continuing operations are expected to be $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion or up 6% to 9% over last year. We expect mid-single digit volume growth from strength in many of our businesses. The PHC acquisition should add 2% to sales growth and raw material related price increases should also add to sales growth.","We expect 2018 earnings per share of $2.65 to $2.85 compared to our 2017 adjusted EPS of $2.46. We therefore expect earnings to grow 8% to 16%. This assumes an effective full year tax rate of approximately 22% as mentioned earlier. Based upon this guidance range, our 2018 full year adjusted EBIT margin should be 12% to 12.5%. Recent steel cost inflation is expected to pressure margins during the first quarter. Assuming cost stabilize, margin should improve for the remainder of the year.","Operating cash flow should approximate $500 million in 2018 with working capital expected to be a smaller use of cash than in 2017. Capital expenditures should be near $160 million for the year and dividend should require approximately $195 million. As has been our practice, after funding organic growth and dividends, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must meet stringent, strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition, we have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. No specific repurchase commitment or time table has been established. However, we currently expect to repurchase between 2 million to 3 million shares in 2018 and issue approximately 1 million, primarily for employee benefit plans.","18 months ago, we shared a set of three year operating targets that reflected our top TSR goal through 2019. With the modest decline in 2017's adjusted EPS from continuing operations, we're extending by year and slightly modifying our longer term targets. The 2020 operating targets are revenue of $5 billion and EBIT margin of 13%, and EPS of $3.50. This EPS target reflects our anticipated 22% tax rate. These targets assume a stable microenvironment that yields moderate demand growth. And they also assume that content gains continue and then organic growth will be augmented by strategic acquisitions. The targets anticipate no significant inflation, deflation, currency fluctuation or divestitures.","With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Susan.","Susan McCoy","That concludes our prepared remarks. We thank you for your attention. And we will be glad to answer your questions. In order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate, we request that you ask only one question and then yield to the next participant. If you have additional questions, you are welcome to reenter the queue, and we'll answer those questions as well.","Mitchell, we're ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Susan Maklari","I guess my first question is can you just talk a little bit to what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the Bedding side of things. The spring components look like they were basically flat in the fourth quarter. But given some of the events that are going on on the retail side that could come down over the course of 2018 and the fact that we\u2019ve got some easier comps coming into the first half of the year based on what happened last year. Can you just help us put that all together and give us some sense of how we should be thinking about that?","Perry Davis","We as you know just completed last week the January Las Vegas market in which most of the large Bedding producers roll out at least partial line introductions. And during the market last week, we saw some really significant action with regards to several of our key components. New introductions by most of the majors, particularly in the hybrid category which generally contains our Comfort Core product lines. We saw continued growth and introductions related to nano type upholstery coils, those coils that in a lot of cases will replace polyurethane or foam related type components and which incidentally have inflated significantly over the last year. But we\u2019re well pleased with the positioning of our products that we introduced last week. There are some headwinds that we\u2019ve seen so far this year. We\u2019ve seen some particularly the first couple of weeks of the New Year, we\u2019ve seen weather related issues that had stanched some of the weekend shopping activity. But overall, we think we\u2019re well positioned with not only our product category mix changes to higher price higher margin products, but also related to content gains that we continue to see as we go forward and we\u2019ll expect to see those throughout 2018.","Susan Maklari","And then my second question is perhaps a little bit bigger picture. But a lot of the steel inflation or some of the steel inflation that you\u2019ve seen I assume is coming off of some of the uncertainty around the section 232 and what can come down with that. And as we think about the potential for some lower imports on the steel side coming in, can you help us understand some of the puts and takes for Leggett as it could relate to that? And maybe within that remind us some of the economics around the rod mill and how that could potentially come together over time? I know it\u2019s a lot, but\u2026","Karl Glassman","Really at this point, 232 potential action is we don\u2019t think has had any effect to our steel pricing. We did see at the end of the year about $30 cost input from scrap at our Shorling mill and then we saw another $30 scrap increase in January. So as we talked before, those take a while to roll through the system, but they do impact rod pricing, which in turn impacts wire pricing which in turn impacts spring pricing. And by the time that all gets rolled through, we generally are talking about a quarter or so of activity.","The word I got yesterday for February scrap is side waste. So we don't see any additional inflation at this point in time, could happen later on. It's hard to predict 30 days out what's going to happen in the steel markets. But as we see those roll through, we'll begin to get recovery in early Q2. And at this point in time, it looks like if you look at year-on-year probably, we've seen inflation in steel components somewhere in the 8% to 10% range. But once those are in place as we've said in the past, they bode well for us and then once we lap those cost increases and we're able to recover, it's good for our margin outlook.","Susan Maklari","And then if we do see perhaps a shift in the volumes coming into the U.S., is there the potential that you could get more volume domestically from your rod mill?","Karl Glassman","I agree with Perry, 232 is just out there. It probably will be more impactful on flat product than long products. The long products being rod and wire round products are being impacted by significant demand increases globally, which are driving the primary input cost which as Perry said are scrap and iron ore back to its most basic form. There are anti-dumping provisions in place already that are protecting the domestic producers of rod and wired in some categories. Those recently lavvy will be in place for at least another four years, and then there will be a sunset review after that. So 232 is unknown at this point but I just don't think it will be impactful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Hughes","Margins were for the full company effectively flat in the fourth quarter given the steel movement in January. Are we must likely going to see down margins in the first quarter as you deal with this recent inflation?","Susan McCoy","Keith that was basically the comment we were making when we're talking about full year guidance. It's a bit qualitative set. But yes, I would say first quarter margins down because of the steel influence and pricing lag associated with that. But if we were just stabilize as move forward, we would expect to be up in margins in the back half of the year. And that's the full year improvement in overall margins.","Keith Hughes","And then on the acquisition, Karl. Is this going to be a platform for growth in the future? And if so, can you give us some kind of feel of what the structure of that market is the number players and sizes and maybe of that nature?","Karl Glassman","Keith, it certainly will be a platform for growth going into the future. We're really pleased to welcome PHC into Leggett & Platt. There has probably been more robust due diligence around not only the company but the sector than anything that I've seen in my 30 something years of Leggett. But I'll ask Mitch to go through the market dynamics. But I will say we would not have made this acquisition if we didn\u2019t intend to substantially grow our position in that arena.","Mitch Dolloff","So yes, we are very much excited about growing PHC. We see this as a very attractive market. The market overall is about $11 billion and we see our addressable portion at about $5 billion, so lots of room for us to play. We particularly like the fit of this business with the businesses where we win today. So the products are highly engineered. There is co-design with the customers, a deep interaction. There is a lot of large customers and a fragmented supply base. The products are programmatic in nature so you win it for program and it lasts for a number of years. It has long life cycles and it requires flexible manufacturing with large volumes across many product variations.","It sounds a lot like some of our businesses that are doing pretty well. So we think that it\u2019s something that\u2019s a really good fit for us. It\u2019s also a global business as you may have seen in the press release we have, PHC has operations both in the U.S. in the UK and in India. We think there is opportunity to help grow in other parts of the world, and they\u2019re heavily planed in lift trucks today. There is also opportunity to gain some traction in some other important segments, most notably construction where we achieve some activity today, but we think that\u2019s an opportunity for further growth down the road.","Keith Hughes","And this will be reported in specialized division, is that correct?","Mitch Dolloff","That\u2019s correct.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bobby Griffin with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Bobby Griffin","Just on the furniture product segment in the slide some production efficiencies were referenced. Just curious if maybe you could expand upon what those were and maybe what business units those impacted within the segment?","Mitch Dolloff","They\u2019re really primarily growth related issues that we had. First is in Adjustable Bed where you saw our huge volume increases in the fourth quarter and in some cases we struggled just to get enough capacity to get those out the door that led to some additional cost there. We\u2019ll get that worked out over time and we\u2019ll improve our processes. We\u2019re adding capacity, but in the near term it could cause some headaches. And I would say also in Work Furniture, primarily on our collaborative seeding growth, where also that business is growing rapidly and sometimes we struggle just to keep up with the demand there, same thing. We work on improving our processes. We work on increasing our capacity, but in the fourth quarter it definitely caused us a bit of pain.","Bobby Griffin","And then on the margin pressure faced in that segment furniture products. Was the majority of steel related or how do I think about the production issues versus steel related cost? And maybe the second part, how is the pricing recapture trending in that segment, because I know it\u2019s a longer and little bit more painful of a process to pass through price in there versus the Bedding components area?","Mitch Dolloff","Absolutely right that the biggest piece of it is the material related versus the price, and most painful in home furniture and fashion bed, are static base line there. So that is the biggest wait by far. In terms of the recovery of the steel inflation, a little bit of a complicated dynamic. So we have production in Home Furniture in Asia where we have been able to recover some of the material increase, probably about 70% of it or so in the fourth quarter. And continue to work there but it's challenging.","Then the other element of that dynamic is that the continued lower cost of steel in general in China than in the U.S. And so in our U.S. production, it\u2019s been really difficult to recover any of the material inflation. So we will work and we are working to not only continue to price increases, but to reduce cost significantly in that business unit, also to ship production to our lowest cost opportunity. So we think that while the market dynamics may remain a little bit challenging for us, there\u2019re some things that we can do to control our own destiny and improve our results.","Bobby Griffin","And then just lastly from me from a modeling standpoint. What is the forecast I guess for the Global Auto Build in '18? The most updated one imply for your markets when you guys weighted by the markets you\u2019re in?","Mitch Dolloff","Bobby, I think it's pretty consistent with what we've seen. We'll see a little bit of recovery in North America versus the decline last year. We're heavy weighted still, just from history, towards North America but have significant operations in throughout Asia and in Europe and those are growing as well as North America. But when we look overall at the developed markets, so call it North America, Europe, China, Japan, South Korea, pretty similar. Up about 1%, not a big change from what we've seen in the last few years. So we see steady as it goes. For sure, there were some disruption in North America as the first part of the year start up strong and then really fell apart in Q3 and Q4. That will give us some tough comps in Q1, but for the big picture for the long term, we still see the market growing 1% or 2% and we're still committed to beating the market growth by 1000 basis points. We really look to our program wins, what we did in 2017 and what we continue to do and we see it fueling that growth.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Moore with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your questions.","Daniel Moore","I wanted to circle back and drill down a little bit more on PHC as well. You gave some detail in terms of what's unique and what\u2019s attractive at the market. Maybe talk a little bit about the margin profile today expectations where we can get over the next couple of years, and the EPS accretion embedded in your 2018 guide?","Mitch Dolloff","So market margins are double digit EBIT. And of course, we will be impacted by purchase accounting when we have that. We see the business as being modestly accretive to EPS in year one.","Daniel Moore","And in terms of opportunities, I think synergies, cost savings and opportunity for larger expansion as we look out a little further?","Mitch Dolloff","I think as we build the platform, for sure that will be part of what we're looking for in the long term. This is our first swing in this area, so we've got some building to do.","Daniel Moore","And lastly 2020 goals. Any split between your organic growth, range of organic growth assumptions embedded versus what you might add the acquisitions?","Matt Flanigan","Definitely heavily leaned towards organic growth. We'd say of that 6% to 9%, you would imply closer to 5% to 6% be organic and then supplemented with strategic acquisitions. Certainly, not in any sense attempting to time acquisition of course, never do that. But we certainly anticipate that they will be part of that mix but it\u2019s definitely heavily weighted towards organic growth and the content gains and wins and programs we can see on the horizon to a great extent already.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Baugh with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed with your question.","John Baugh","If you can address and you already did Fashion Bed and residential Furniture. But are there any other parts of your business where you are seeing input cost inflation where you don\u2019t expect to fully offset the pressure with price increases. How might you otherwise combat that margin compression in those areas?","Karl Glassman","The short answer is no. We will get albeit with the lag that Perry spoke of get full recovery in Bedding than you know the connectivity to industrial. The Bedding commentaries global we are passing through that inflation in Europe, as we speak. So there is just no hesitation about our ability to get full recovery with the lag. We will continue to get recovery in the Home Furniture and to some degree in the fashion side of the business, but as Mitch said, add a lower than lesser rate. Though it\u2019s a more competitive and more commodity oriented business, though it really -- those businesses the opportunity really is a cost gain at this point.","John Baugh","And so there are -- Karl that sounded like a steel answer. Are there foam issues or fabric issues or anything relating to input cost outside of steel or new concerns there?","Karl Glassman","The foam cost, the global foam inflation, is really, really good for our Bedding businesses. As Perry said, we were getting content gain because of consumer preference anyway. It\u2019s been accelerated by the significant foam inflation not only the penetration of Quantum Edge. It\u2019s remarkable to me that while Comfort Core is 40% of our U.S. innersprings, Quantum Edge is 33% of that 40% for product that was introduced just two years ago. We expect that attachment rate to grow significantly this year. You would seen evidence of that last week in Las Vegas.","So foam inflation is good, doesn\u2019t impact us negatively is only a positive. Fabric inflation, we are seeing fabric inflation for sure in our Hanes businesses, both in the industry side and the Geo Component side. They do a wonderful job of full recovery so they have announced increases as well. They will get those. We\u2019re just not exposed anywhere else other than as we discussed in the Home Furniture and to a lesser degree, Fashion Bed because it\u2019s smaller business.","The question about the impact of commodity inflation on Automotive, our Automotive business is not real steel sensitive. Though, we\u2019re just not concerned about commodity inflation in our Automotive business.","John Baugh","And then international Bedding, I\u2019d like some color on trends there and what maybe similar or different from the U.S., which you always seem to talk about in the U.S. but it\u2019s an important part of your business? Thank you.","Perry Davis","John, this is Perry. It is an important part of our business and a growing part. The overall unit growth of about 11% year-on-year in the fourth quarter is significant, because of inflation, that growth also in excess of 20% in the fourth quarter and about 20% for the year last year. Significant growth in Europe. We've got an outstanding management team in Europe that continues to grow that business. We're building out infrastructure there to support that with a significant add-on to one of our facilities. We also see good opportunities right now in South America and in Brazil.","We've grown our position there significantly. Looking at opportunities in other geographies there to expand that business and doing it profitably. And in light of a pretty heavy economic headwinds in the Brazilian market, but we've been appropriately cautious in our growth there. And it's paying off for us and that we've been able to introduce new products. There has been a bit of winnowing out of some of our competitive activity because of the rough economic climate that all bodes well for us. So overall, those two markets in particular have been growth areas.","Other areas where we play to a lesser degree, but we do play is in the Pacific, Asia-Pacific, those are good strong markets for us that continue to grow modestly. And we provide in those areas products that generally are somewhat differentiated. We don't compete as heavily on the commodity side. And then we have small operations in South Africa. Well, that economy has definitely been not strong over the last two to three years, we continue to operate there and weather and the storms and at some point that will turn. But primarily our international business represented heavily by Europe and by South America. Those markets are strong for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your questions.","Peter Keith","I've question on the Auto business. So we've now had two quarters in a row of 8% growth. And then Mitch I think you addressed some of the destocking in the U.S. How should we think about that going forward for next few quarters? Because now you're bringing up the dynamic of tough compares. I guess when should we think about that segment getting back to double digit growth?","Mitch Dolloff","We did have double digit growth for the full year. So I look at this as very much a long term view. We may have some gyration to quarter-to-quarter as program launches happened, as other disruptions happened in the market. But over the long term, we see that double digit growth being really what our target is and what we've achieved. So I'm not -- I don't know that I can comment on it quarter-to-quarter fluctuation.","Karl Glassman","Peter to add, to pile on a little bit, based on significant program awards, we have clear visibility into 2020 and feel completely confident of that 1000 basis points growth over Global Build. And it looks like Global Build is forecasted to be in the 1.5% to 2% range. So our position hasn't changed at all. We are wonderfully happy with our position in Automotive.","Peter Keith","And then separate follow up is just on the adjustable base side. So there is absolutely phenomenal growth there right now. I am curious if that is primarily being driven by the maybe the gains at Mattress Firm this year, which will be launched in the first half of \u201918 or conversely are you seeing strong growth from multiple large customers that\u2019s driving that 40 plus percent growth right now?","Mitch Dolloff","I think it\u2019s more broad-based than that. For sure we\u2019re seeing growth with our large customers but we\u2019re also doing what we can to penetrate further down throughout the retail base, offering different types of programs to service those retailers and quick ship program, direct from factory, container direct program. So it\u2019s really important part of the combination of our Fashion Bed and Adjustable Bed business. So fortunately strong both at our major customers and continuing to drive further penetration throughout the retail chain.","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Bergner with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Bergner","My first question just relates to the 2018 guide. Are you expecting I guess U.S. spring component dollars to be up in 2018 within your guide and how about innerspring unit, how does that shape out within your 2018 guide?","Karl Glassman","The answer is yes. We expect dollars to be up as they were in 2017. And yes specific to innerspring so we tend to give you a Bedding data there, U.S. aggregated Bedding data. In the fourth quarter, innersprings were down 2% but dollars of just innersprings, take box spring constructions out of it, which is actually a comfortable loss, because it becomes really good Adjustable Bed business. But if it\u2019s just innersprings, we were up mid single digits, lot of it content gains and some pricing. We expect that same dynamic to continue through all of 2018. The answer to your last question, Justin, we do expect units to be positive in the U.S. in calendar 2018.","Justin Bergner","And then switching over to your long-term 2020 targets, it seems like the sales go slightly higher than what your previously budgeted for 2019, the margin goal slightly lower and then the EPS slightly higher when you adjust for the lower go forward tax rate. Is that the right way to think about things versus the prior long-term guide?","Susan McCoy","Justin yes, I think it is. We would be, with this framework, assuming somewhat higher EBIT dollars but also a beneficial impact from the tax rate. And I mean bear in mind that all of these targets were intentionally round and ended to be directionally where we\u2019re headed for 2020.","Justin Bergner","And then the earlier question asked about organic growth within the 2020 targets, and I think the answer was 5% to 6% organic. How much raw material inflation should we think of as being embedded in that organic growth to back out the underlying volume trend?","Susan McCoy","We have a qualifier, I think, in our narrative. So it basically is relatively neutral for inflation-deflation divestitures, et cetera. ","Karl Glassman","Yes, in currency.","Justin Bergner","So neutral would assume some modest inflation then, or zero?","Karl Glassman","No, we don't assume any significant inflation-deflation currency or divestitures. We'll be wrong on all four of those points, but for the purpose of the guideline and the targets, we assume that they are basically benign.","Justin Bergner","And then just one quick one. What was the adjusted tax rate for Q4, '17?","Susan McCoy","23%.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Ms. McCoy for any closing remarks.","Susan McCoy","Okay. I'll just say thank you for taking time to joining us today. And we'll speak to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for participation and have a wonderful day."],"12812":["Leggett & Platt, Inc (NYSE:LEG) Q2 2015 Earnings Conference Call July 31, 2015  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Dave DeSonier - SVP, Corporate Strategy & IR","Dave Haffner - Chairman & CEO","Karl Glassman - President & COO","Matt Flanigan - EVP & CFO","Dennis Park - SVP, Commercial Products","Susan McCoy - VP, IR","Analysts","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Josh Borstein - Longbow Research","Daniel Moore - CJS Securities","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates","John Baugh - Stifel Nicolaus","Herb Hardt - Monness, Crespi, Hardt","Fred Speece - Speece Thorson Capital Group","Operator","Welcome to the Leggett & Platt Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Dave DeSonier, Senior Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Dave DeSonier","Good morning and thank you for taking part in Leggett & Platt's second quarter conference call. With me this morning are the following; Dave Haffner, our Board Chair and CEO; Karl Glassman, who is President and Chief Operating Officer; Matt Flanigan, our Executive VP and CFO; and Susan McCoy, our VP of Investor Relations.","The agenda for the call this morning is as follows. Dave Haffner will start with a summary of the major statements we made in yesterday's press release. Karl Glassman will provide segment highlights. Matt Flanigan will discuss financial details and address our outlook for 2015. Finally, the group will answer any questions that you have.

This call may not be transcribed or recorded or broadcast without our express permission. A replay is available from the IR portion of Leggett's website.","We posted to the IR portion of the website a set of PowerPoint slides that contain summary financial information along with segment details.

I need to remind you that remarks today concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements.","Actual results or events may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the section in our 10-K entitled forward-looking statements.","I will now turn the call over to Dave Haffner.","Dave Haffner","Thank you, Dave. Good morning and thank you for participating in our call. Yesterday we reported record second quarter results from continuing operations and are very pleased to have extended our string of strong quarterly results that began in the second quarter of last year.","Sales increased 4% in the quarter. Higher unit volume and acquisitions added 9% to year-over-year sales growth. These gains were partially offset by raw-material-related price decreases and currency translation impact which combined reduced sales by 5%. We continue to benefit from the shift in bedding to comfort core springs, new adjustable bed programs that ramped up last year and ongoing content gains and new program awards in automotive.","Importantly, nearly all of our businesses experienced volume growth in the quarter versus strong prior-year comparisons with sales having grown 9% in the second quarter of last year. Earnings per share from continuing operations were also a second quarter record at $0.53 per share, up 10% from the $0.48 per share we earned in the second quarter of 2014. Earnings benefited primarily from higher unit volumes and pricing discipline, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate.","EBIT increased 17% and EBIT margin improved to 12%, up 130 basis points over second quarter last year. This was the highest quarterly margin that we've achieved in 15 years and reflects the improvements that we have made to our business portfolio and cost structure, as well as the strong market positions of our current businesses.","Since the recession in 2009, we have spoken about the earnings leverage from incremental volume produced, utilizing excess capacity. With market share gains and higher market demand, our capacity utilization has increased. The margin improvement that we have realized over the past few years reflects, in part, that higher utilization.","We still have available capacity to accommodate additional volume in many of our businesses, but there's less today than just a few quarters ago. In certain of our businesses and product lines we have little to no capacity left and we're investing meaningful capital dollars to support continued growth.","In automotive, we're expanding capacity to support new programs that will begin production in 2016 and later years. In bedding, we're investing rapidly in equipment that we build in our own Swiss operation to support the tremendous growth in comfort core which we expect to continue for the next few years.","In Adjustable Bed which operated a single large location just a year ago, we're adding new locations to broaden our geographic scope and expect to be operating four facilities in North America by the end of this year. We're very pleased to be making these investments, since they are directly associated with our expectation for continued meaningful growth in some of our strongest-performing businesses.","We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling three-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top one-third of the S&P 500 over the long term which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the three-year period ended on December 31, 2015, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 31% per year which places us in the top 20% of the S&P 500.","Now I will turn the call over to Karl Glassman.","Karl Glassman","Thank you, Dave and good morning. Most of our businesses continued to perform extremely well during the second quarter. In the Residential Furnishings segment, second quarter total sales increased 10%. Same-location sales increased 3% with 7% unit volume growth, partially offset by raw-material-related price decreases and currency translation impact.","Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding acquisitions, deflation and currency, were as follows. U.S. Spring component dollar sales increased 15%. Innerspring unit volume grew 17%, with comfort core up 71% during the quarter. Box spring unit volume increased 7%.","International Spring sales grew 6%. Furniture component sales increased 2%, with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper businesses up 6% and motion hardware unit volume up 2%. Sales also increased in Fabric Converting and Geo Components, while volume was down slightly in Carpet Cushion.","Segment EBIT increased slightly in the quarter, but EBIT margin declined with the benefit from higher unit volume largely offset by other factors, including increased performance-based compensation expense. EBIT margin also reflects the impact of higher Adjustable Bed pass-through sales and acquired facilities, both of which have lower-than-segment average margins.","In the Commercial Product segment, second quarter total sales increased 28%. Same-location sales increased 18%, primarily from continued strong demand in Adjustable Bed. Unit volume in that business increased 81% during the quarter. Fashion Bed sales grew 12%. Work Furniture same-location sales decreased 5% in the second quarter, reflecting currency translation impact, lower volume in our Chinese operation and a less favorable product mix. Unit volume in North America was up slightly.","In early March we acquired a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial and other settings. This business is complementary to our North American private-label operation and allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally. This acquisition added 10% to the segment's sales growth during the second quarter.","The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the second quarter, primarily due to higher sales. As Dave mentioned, we're rapidly expanding production capacity in our Adjustable Bed business to support continued strong demand in that category.","In the Industrial Materials segment, second quarter sales decreased 9%, entirely from steel-related price reductions. Unit volumes were roughly flat with growth in Drawn Wire driven by strong bedding demand, offset by lower trade sales from our rod mill. A soft, softer steel market and scheduled equipment upgrades at the rod mill resulted in fewer trade shipments, as was expected during versus the second quarter of last year.","EBIT and EBIT margin increased significantly during the quarter, primarily due to cost reductions and pricing disciplines. In the Specialized Product segment, second quarter sales were flat with an approximate 5% volume improvement offset by currency translation impact. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales increased 11%, Aerospace sales grew 10% and Machinery sales were up 13% during the quarter. These sales gains were partially offset by very soft demand in CVP, with second quarter volume in that business down 20%, largely due to an industry change related to marketing programs for four commercial vehicles.","The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin grew slightly with the benefit from higher volume largely offset by increased performance-based compensation expense and several smaller factors.","I will now turn the call over to Matt Flanigan, who will discuss some additional financial details along with our outlook for the full year.","Matt Flanigan","Thanks, Karl and good morning, everyone. Consistent with our normal seasonality and our internal forecast, operating cash flow in the second quarter was $95 million, down slightly from the same quarter last year. For the six months of the year, operating cash flow increased $44 million or 52%, to $127 million, due to higher earnings and a smaller increase in working capital which was primarily related to accounts receivable.","Adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales was 9.9% at the end of the second quarter. Excluding the foam litigation accruals which are included in current liabilities, working capital was a more seasonally normal 11.6% of annualized sales.","In May, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share. 2015 marks our 44th consecutive annual dividend increase at a compound annual growth rate of 13%. At yesterday's closing price of $50.22, the current yield is 2.5%. We repurchased 1.2 million shares of our stock in the second quarter at an average price of $48.04 and issued 200,000 shares, largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises.","Our financial base remains very strong and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the quarter with net debt to net capital at 36%, comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%. We also monitor debt to EBITDA which is another typical financial metric and at the end of the second quarter debt was 1.9 times our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA.","For the full year 2015, we continue to expect strong unit volume growth and margin improvement which should lead to another year of record earnings per share from continuing operations. As we announced yesterday, we increased our guidance and now anticipate 2015 earnings from continuing operations of $2 to $2.15 per share.","Our prior EPS range was $1.95 to $2.10. We also increased the low-end of our prior sales guidance and now expect full year sales of $3.95 billion to $4.1 billion. This revised sales range represents a 4% to 8% increase over 2014 and includes an approximate 5% impact from raw-material-related price deflation and currency translation.","Based upon this guidance, we now anticipate a full year EBIT margin between 11.3% and 11.6% which would be our highest EBIT margin level since the year 2000. We again expect operating cash flow to exceed $350 million in 2015. Dividend should require about $170 million of cash and capital expenditures should approximate $120 million for the year.","As has been our practice, after funding dividends and capital expenditures, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must meet stringent, strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year.","No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. However, we currently expect to repurchase between 3 million and 5 million shares in 2015 and issue approximately 2.5 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans and option exercises.","With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave Haffner.","Dave Haffner","Thanks, Matt. As I mentioned last quarter, we believe 2015 will be a very noteworthy year and the second quarter results certainly support that belief. Our teams are finding ways to gain market share and content and improve efficiencies by critically controlling throughput, quality and cost. We're listening carefully to our customers and are dedicated to developing and manufacturing what they need, while delivering when and where they need it.","We continue to be excited about the benefits our shareholders have recently experienced and those that lie ahead. Thanks to all for participating in our discussion today and I will now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier.","Dave DeSonier","That concludes our prepared remarks. We thank you for your attention and we will be glad to answer your questions. In order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate, we request that you ask only one question and then yield to the next participant. If you have additional questions, you are welcome to reenter the queue and we will answer those questions as well.","Jessi, we're ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Hughes","First question on the steel deflation, where are you in the cycle of that? Your guidance would imply that things are about to get better, but any details of what you think is coming in the future would help.","Karl Glassman","Our forecast has changed a little bit in the last 30 days. 30 days we would've told you that based on about a $15 a ton inflation in scrap from April through May, that we would see continued price reinflation. In the market there was a $15 to $25 a ton increase in wire and rod announced for June 1 and then another $25 for July 1.","And actually, from a market perspective, there's probably $40 of those increases were obtained. Now the current forecast, based on some softening prices in iron ore which is highly correlated to scrap or I should say vice versa, scrap is highly correlated to iron ore pricing -- that we expect some scrap deflation in August probably in the range of $15 a ton. So I thought we were at bottom of deflationary cycle; starting to see some recovery. That doesn't look to be the case. All that commentary was on long products.","On flat products, we believe that we will see another maybe 10% deflation during the third quarter as compared to second quarter, though we're uncertain.","Keith Hughes","Okay. If we see the deflation in scrap on both sides, will we see some of those increases come down or will there be a spread there for you to maintain for a period of time?","Karl Glassman","Once we stabilize, the spread will be enhanced. Once we reinflate, there will be a little bit of a lag in our ability then to pass through. There's always an ability to retain deflation on the downside and then a little bit of slowness in recovery on the upside. But if there is a period of steady-state, we will see a reinflation of our spread at the raw material level. Now I will complement our people. They've done a wonderful job at the wire and the component level of holding on to that pricing and showing really significant pricing discipline.","Keith Hughes","Second question, shifting to adjustables. I think you had said you have four facilities now or you will have four facilities in the future. Just an update on capacity there.","Dennis Park","We currently have three facilities, two of which have been added since the first of the year. The fourth facility that is mentioned in the release will be online by the fourth quarter and all four units will be fully operational by year-end.","Keith Hughes","The driver for filling up that capacity; is that going to be primarily new customer wins for your adjustable products or will it just be growth of the existing base?","Dennis Park","Combination of both, but we're continuing to see new customers come on board in 2015. We have just recently signed two major programs in the last 60 days, so it's really being driven by both.","Keith Hughes","Your new program wins, are they coming at the higher end of your price spectrum or the lower end of your price spectrum?","Dennis Park","I would say that, again, both, but probably would see a little more on the lower end from a price standpoint, because we're seeing an increase there in terms of the attachment rate on the more middle price point programs.","Keith Hughes","When you say low middle, can you kind of translate that roughly to a retail price point in round numbers?","Dennis Park","Well, the primary activity continues to be in that $1699 price point, so if you went down to that next level it would be growth in that $1200 to $1400 price level.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Josh Borstein with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Borstein","Just a question, Karl, on the innerspring unit growth, the 17%, that's the highest I can find in my model, so great quarter there. Can you give a little sense of how that trended during the quarter and maybe what you guys are seeing so far in the business or here in the third quarter?","Karl Glassman","Josh, I would be happy to. April we were up 22%; May was up 14%; June was up 15%, so that is an aggregation of the 17%. To date, through the first three shipping weeks of July, we're up 9%. We feel good about those trends. We continue to pick up some market share and, fortunately, the market demand is very robust.","Josh Borstein ","You had mentioned some market share gains. Just how do you feel about the underlying consumer right now? Certainly speaks to maybe some greater confidence on there. Was that what you see?","Karl Glassman","Yes, Josh, as we've spoke in the past, bedding is primarily driven by a competent consumer. So job formations, wage inflation, all of those things, because of the replacement nature of the product, while all of those macroeconomic statistics are choppy, they are all trending in the right direction. So it is highly correlated to consumer confidence, somewhat assisted by housing moves.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Daniel Moore with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Moore","Perhaps just if you could update us on where estimated penetration is of comfort core is today and how high you expect that or you think that can go over the next several years.","Karl Glassman","At the end of the first quarter it was 25% of our total U.S. mattress unit sales. At the end of the second quarter it was 28%. I believe we will be at a 30% or greater run rate by the end of the year. I certainly think that the market has capacity for the mid-30%s as a core itself, but there is also upward demand in toppers using micro coils as a replacement for foams. It gives the consumer the benefit of reduced body impression. So, we're not near the end of the growth potential for that category.","Daniel Moore","And given the expectations of your capacity builds across multiple lines, should we expect a flattening or perhaps modest step back in margins over the next few quarters or will that capacity build be entirely in the CapEx line?","Karl Glassman","The product is a high-margin product; significantly higher margin than the product that it replaces. The margin in dollars and as a percentage are better than the product that it replaces. But to your point, we're adding capacity.","I don't see the margin profile changing in that business, there's just too much demand. The machines come online very, very quickly. Our people are wonderfully talented at innovation around that category that allows us and the mattress manufacturer and the retailer to differentiate themselves. So we feel very good about the margin profiles as they exist today and expect long-term expansion.","Dave Haffner","And other fixed costs that aren't depreciation are more -- are absorbed over a broader base which certainly helps maintain or improve that margin, as Karl said.","Daniel Moore","Lastly and I will jump out. You continue to take share in auto obviously, but just talk more generally about the trends you are seeing. We're seeing sort of into the summer months very mixed trends by geography. Any data points or observations you can provide would be very helpful.","Karl Glassman","Dan, it's important, I wouldn't say that we're gaining share, because our shares are large. What we're gaining is content within each vehicle. It's not that we're selling into more OEMs or more platforms; it's just those platforms are more robust from a content perspective.","Demand is good. North American demand continues to be strong. Read a study last night that the average passenger vehicle is on the road in North America for 11.5 years which begs replacement. So the demand trends are expected to continue to be strong. We're seeing some recovery in Europe which is a good thing; year-on-year growth.","There certainly is a little bit of a step back in China, but that has been primarily in passenger cars. The SUV demand continues to grow. We have significantly more demand in each SUV than we do in the passenger car side of things. So the Chinese growth is choppy, but it still is growing at a faster rate than any of the other large geographies.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Budd Bugatch","I guess the question I would like to just parse on is to parse out the difference between currency impact and pricing impact. And not only for this quarter but, Karl, you talked a little bit about steel. It has had an impact in other areas too. Can you give us a feel of where that is going to happen; what your crystal ball tells you about going forward? And also maybe the impact on the LIFO for the year as well?","Susan McCoy","In the second quarter, you might remember in the first quarter currency and price combined to about a 3% impact. That was much larger currency at that point than price, probably a 2-1 split. In this most recent quarter, currency still is about a 2% hit, prices starting to approach 3%. Going forward we said, for the full year we think we've got a combined impact that is about 5% of a downdraft on sales.","That suggests that we will have a little bit more combined effect in the third quarter which lines up with expectations relative to price adjustments that are indexed that will kick in in the third quarter. So that 3-2 split in the second quarter, while we probably will see a similar effect on currency, assuming that both the euro and Canadian dollars don't move much, pricing will be somewhat more negative in the third quarter.","Budd Bugatch","Okay. And for the year then LIFO or is that -- any change in your thoughts on that?","Susan McCoy","We're still forecasting $20 million for the full year based on what we know right now.","Budd Bugatch","Okay. And what about price givebacks? That's the last side of that. Your customers are aware of what's going on in pricing as well.","Karl Glassman","Budd, at this point we think that there will be some price givebacks that impact us, to Susan's point, in the third quarter. I believe we will be through that in the fourth quarter, and it's so sensitive, as you said, to what happens from a raw material perspective. At this point we don't know if we're going to see a bottoming out in 4Q or start to see some reinflation. If we see reinflation, we will announce price increases pretty quickly.","Dave Haffner","Those were very important elements of our thought process, Budd, as we came forward with a revised and upward EPS forecast. Certainly, as Karl said, crystal ball isn't clear on some of those elements, but those are our best judgments.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question is coming from the line of John Baugh with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","John Baugh","I would like to delve into the CapEx. It's great you are growing, that's a high-class problem. You mentioned some areas where capacity gets tight. So CapEx, just kind of curious -- and maybe this is more a 2016 question than 2015 -- but how we see CapEx relative to, say, D&A over the next 18, 24 months.","Karl Glassman","John, D&A should be in the $113 million, $114 million range. At this point, while it's early, I would expect capital spending in 2016 to be in that $120 million range again. We're continuing to be fortunate enough to continue to get new automotive awards that allow us to reinvest in those long-term programs. As I said earlier in the answer to Dan, I don't believe we're near the end of the cycle from a comfort core expansion perspective.","The category of adjustable beds, to Dennis's point, the category is growing 30%, independent of program wins. So we're really bullish. As long as the economy stays strong, we're ready and willing to invest. There is about a $30 million annual call on just maintenance capital, so that's a given. It's hard to forecast, but we love those investments. Our people do a great job of getting a return on that.","John Baugh","Then as a follow-up to that and then one additional, you've talked in the past about having several hundred million dollars of excess capacity. I'm wondering if you could sort of update us today where that number sits and sort of what areas it's in.","And then, secondly, just on the Sealy plants you bought, here again high-class problem, volumes are good. But you probably haven't been able to address the consolidation or margins on those or update me on where you are on that process in light of those strong volumes? Thank you.","Karl Glassman","You broke all of DeSonier's rules. From an available capacity perspective, as you know, as you made reference, we used to talk in terms of $400 million. Today we believe that number is south of $200 million, probably in the range of $150 million. We're going to update that analysis internally. The areas of available capacity at this point are primarily in places like Work Furniture. There is a little bit available capacity in some of our International Spring. I assure you there's capacity in Brazil today.","Some available capacity in our home furniture components business. We'll always have some capacity there because there's always a trade-off between Asian demand and North American demand. Those would be the biggest areas.","CVP is a place that there's a lot of capacity; some of that we're taking offline now. So the answer to the Sealy plants is we have been fortunate in that the demand has been greater than the pro forma that our people developed and we just anniversaried the acquisition of those component facilities. The growth of unit demand and then their switch to comfort core has put us in a position where we're continuing to run the vast majority of those assets.","We just don't know. We expect that demand will continue to hold. We're ahead of our financial pro forma pretty significantly. Our people are doing a great job of executing in a demand environment where we're so pushed for capacity that we probably push some of our people to their elastic limit, so we need to continue to bring on capacity. But we're pleased with that acquisition. But back to the point of my prepared remarks, it is dilutive to Residential margins as we originally forecasted.","Dave Haffner","John, we're anticipating at least two of those consolidations and there will be a one-time cost associated with consolidation when we get to that point, but we've have built into our forecast as well.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Herb Hardt with Moness, Crespi, Hardt. Please proceed with your question.","Herb Hardt","I would also add my congratulations for a great quarter, you folks. And the question is about Aerospace. You haven't spoken much about it lately. If you could give us an update, particularly in Europe, where I believe a lot of the facilities are now?","Karl Glassman","We don't speak a lot about it. It's relatively small, but, boy, are we pleased. Our people are doing a great job of executing on what was a challenged acquisition in France. As you will remember, it wasn't performing well. They are really doing a great job. The throughput through that facility has increased significantly. The business is well-managed. It is significantly exceeding all the pro formas that we developed at the time of acquisition.","There is a facility in the UK that performs very, very well. It also exceeds all our pro formas. We're pleased with Aerospace and expect that we will continue to be. Thanks again for the opportunity to speak about that. It is well-managed, well-executed business.","Dave Haffner","Herb, while there isn't anything at all imminent, as I think you know, we continue to see that as a growth opportunity through niche-type acquisitions. So we continue to look at opportunities to add to the facilities that we currently have.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Josh Borstein with Longbow. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Borstein","Just a follow-up on the microcoils that you touched upon. Is that included in comfort cores?","Karl Glassman","Yes.","Josh Borstein ","What inning are you in this conversion of those toppers from foam to microcoils? Is this something relatively new?","Karl Glassman","Probably the first inning. You will see more product developed and placed in lines at the January Las Vegas furniture market. More mature in Europe than it is in North America.","Josh Borstein","And so this would be in addition to the comfort coils that are in the center of the bed. How much additional content might this add to a typical bed?","Karl Glassman","The average unit selling price of one of those toppers is in the range of $60 to $80 depending on the number of coils and the height of the coils, so it is a great opportunity for us. And, to your point, it's all share gains. We're replacing a combination of viscoelastic or latex and, in some cases, just standard polyurethane foams, little bit of fiber.","Dave Haffner","So even in the case where that topper goes in there, there will still be -- likely be some sort of comfort product, viscoelastic or latex on top of it, but significantly less of it, Josh.","Josh Borstein","And then just ,in Work Furniture could you break out the Chinese operation? Just trying to get a sense for the underlying trends you are seeing in office furniture right now.","Dennis Park","Yes, Josh, this is Dennis. Are you speaking about the year-over-year comparisons as it relates to the Chinese operation?","Josh Borstein","Right. So the Chinese operation that is included in your office furniture segment, right?","Dennis Park","Yes, we have an operation in China and that is one, as we have previously reported, that we're dealing with some issues there that we feel that we're close to finally getting our hands around. But it has been an ongoing issue from us and has to do with operating control of the business.","Susan McCoy","Apart from that business, Dennis can speak to what he feels is a reasonably decent volume in our North American traditional seating business which is the case.","Dennis Park","That's correct. And really looking at the second quarter, our unit growth in the U.S.-based operations was very much in line with the BIFMA numbers. We feel very good about current number of projects that we have. That's been an area of focus for the team.","Our actual project list is 2 times larger than it was just two years ago and we're experiencing a much higher hit ratio on those projects, because they are directly aligned with customer programs. As opposed to us developing programs and then taking that to the customer base, we're actually engaging them sooner in the process and so it has given us a much higher hit ratio.","Josh Borstein","Okay, great. That's exactly what I was looking for. Just for seating in general, is that a category that you guys are seeing growing this year at all? My sense maybe is seating hasn't been as strong this year as it has been in years past.","Dennis Park","It is growing, not quite at the level as other parts of the business, but definitely seeing overall unit growth and expect that to continue.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Budd Bugatch","I guess just kind of a cleanup question for me in terms of some of the other issues that have been hanging fire for a while there. You took some charges for some legal expenses and there were still a few items left on that I think. Can you talk a little bit about what the cash impact has been and maybe if there's anything left to clean up on that in terms of those foam lawsuits?","Matt Flanigan","Budd, as you recall that total accrual as of the end of last year was about $89 million. Through the second quarter end we had spent about or had unleashed about $20 million of that. Between now and 12 months from now we will have basically cut loose all of that. But if you just look in calendar 2015, we think we will probably have another $30 million to $40 million of that accrual that is already on the books paid out is our best guess right now.","And as we sit here today, we certainly feel very good about the appropriateness of that accrual level and where it stands and don't anticipate needing to bolster it anymore. Albeit we all know things change, but that's certainly what we feel like today confidently.","Budd Bugatch","Are all those suits now settled, Karl? Is everything done on that particular issue?","Karl Glassman","No, they are not all settled. The big ones are in settle mode and just putting final closure on those, but we have several smaller ones that are still trending along and in discussions, but I would not call them settled yet. Again, the magnitude of those exposures is much more modest than the big cases that we've described as direct and indirect.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Fred Speece with Speece Thorson Capital Group. Please proceed with your question.","Fred Speece","I think we can all remember when you put out the $2 number and we finally got there. Your yield is 2.5% today and it was at almost 9% once, so congratulations on the five years. Has there been any structural change in the company because it is different than it was five years ago -- that would cause you to change the metrics that got you to the $2 number?","Dave Haffner","I obviously didn't expect the economy to do what it did when I made that statement and it was basic algebra. I thought it might take us to $4.2 billion to get back to $2 and so we were able to get there a little bit earlier on revenue. But there has been such fundamental change in the portfolio mix over the last few years and in that process we have become -- I know you have read and have heard us say this, we've become a lot more definitive on how we spend our capital, our shareholders' capital.","And going forward, we still have a couple of businesses, they are not significant problems at this point, but a couple of businesses such as the mechanical tubing and the CVP portion of our business that are likely to find their way to somebody else's ownership.","But going forward we intend to use the same techniques that we have used in the last seven or eight years to grow. We may grow a little quicker than we had anticipated as things pick up, but our margins will continue to go up. Don't know what the end-all there in margins is.","I think it would be very difficult to get to 14%, because of the mix of businesses, but certainly we have line of sight through 13%. So we have got outstanding people running each of our business units. We're stronger today than we have been in really 15 or 20 years and I think the operating and strategic protocol that we put together will serve us well for the next several years.","Operator","Thank you. It appears there are no additional questions at this time. So I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional concluding comments.","Dave DeSonier","We will just say thank you. We appreciate your attention and we will talk to you again next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation and you may disconnect your lines at this time."],"12815":["Leggett & Platt Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David DeSonier, Senior Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","David DeSonier","Good morning and thank you for taking part in Leggett & Platt's first quarter conference call. With me this morning are the following: Karl Glassman, who is President and CEO; Matt Flanigan, our Executive VP and CFO; and Susan McCoy, our Vice President of Investor Relations. Mitch Dolloff, who is Senior VP of the Company and President of the Specialized Products segment is also joining us this morning to participate in Q&A.","The agenda for our call this morning is as follows: Karl Glassman will start with a summary of the major statements we made in yesterday's press release and provide segment highlights; Matt Flanigan, will discuss financial details and address our outlook for 2016, and finally, the Group will answer any questions that you have.","This conference is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material.

A replay is available from the IR portion of Leggett's website.","We posted to the IR portion of the website a set of PowerPoint slides that contain summary financial information along with segment details.

Before I start with our prepared comments, I want to stop for second and congratulate and thank Susan McCoy. Yesterday marked the 30-year anniversary of her employment with the company. Susan, not only does an outstanding job as our Vice President of Investor Relations, she is also a trusted advisor to many of us and is truly an outstanding person. Congratulations and thank you, Susan from the shareholders, the investment community, our fellow employees, and from me personally.","We are very pleased with our start to 2016. EBIT and EBIT margins were ahead of our initial forecast despite short-term demand softness in a few of our residential end markets. For the full-year, we expect record earnings per share from continuing operations, very strong EBIT margins, and significant improvement in operating cash flow.","As we reported yesterday, first quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.63, up 26% from the $0.50 we posted in the prior year. This increase reflects several factors including higher unit volume, a lower effective tax rate in the non-recurrence of a prior year Steel Tubing impairment charge.","Sales decreased 3% in the quarter to $938 million from the divestitures of the Steel Tubing business and a small portion of commercial vehicle products in late 2015. Higher unit volume added 4% to sales growth in the quarter and acquisitions added 1%. These improvements were offset by raw material related price decreases and currency impact which combined to reduce sales by 5%. Strong sales growth continued in automotive Comfort Core in both the U.S. and the Europe and adjustable bed. EBIT grew 14% and EBIT margin increased 190 basis points to 13.5% in the quarter also benefiting from higher unit volume, improved operational efficiency, and continued portfolio management.","Now on to the segment details. In Residential Furnishings, first quarter sales were down 5%, unit volume grew 2% but was more than offset by raw material related price decreases and currency impact. Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories excluding deflation and currency were as follows: U.S. spring component dollar sales were down 2%, Inner Spring units decreased 7%, and Box Spring unit volumes were down 6%. The favorable mix shift in Inner Springs continued with Comfort Core units up 15% during the quarter.","International spring sales grew 6%. Furniture component sales were up 3% with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper business up 8% and motion hardware unit volume down 6%. Volume also increased in Geo Components.","Segment EBIT and EBIT margin decreased in the quarter with the benefit from overall higher unit volume more than offset by FIFO inventory impacts and lower unit volume and typically stronger margin businesses. The FIFO impact occurred as expected from reducing selling prices as we were consuming higher cost inventory on hand at the end of 2015.","In the commercial product segment, first quarter same location sales increased 7% primarily from growth in adjustable bed with units of 18% during the quarter and continued strength in our fashion bed business. The work furniture acquisition completed in early 2015 also contributed 8% to the segment sales growth in the quarter. Segment EBIT grew and EBIT margin improved 280 basis points to 8.5% primarily from higher sales, operational improvements, and a gain from the sales of the building.","In the industrial material segment, first quarter same location sales were down 19% from steel related price decreases and lower unit volume and drawn wire. Total sales also decreased versus first of last year from the divesture of the steel tubing business in late 2015. The segments EBIT and EBIT margin increased significantly during the quarter from the non-recurrence of last year\u2019s steel tubing impairment along with cost and efficiency improvements, partially offset by lower unit volume.","In the specialized product segment, first quarter same location sales increased 10% with a 12% volume improvement, partially offset by currency impact. Excluding currency changes, automotive sales grew 11%, aerospace same location sales increased 7%, machinery sales grew 19%, and commercial vehicle product same location sales were up 7%. The segments EBIT increased and EBIT margin improved 140 basis points primarily from higher volume.","During the first quarter we acquired a small U.S. manufacturer of aerospace tube assemblies with annual sales of approximately $20 million. This business further expands our tube forming and fabrication capabilities and also adds precision meaning -- machining to our aerospace platform.","I will now turn the call over to Matt Flanigan.","Matt Flanigan","Thanks, Karl. Good morning everyone. A lower effective tax rate at $0.04 to first quarter earnings per share, this benefit resulted from the adoption of a new accounting standard related to stock-based compensation that was just issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.","The tax effect that arrives as when stock units or options are converted into shares will now be recognized as an adjustment to income tax expense instead of shareholders equity. While we have some of this activity in most quarters, the first quarter each year is impacted to a great degree due to the timing of issuances under our major stock compensation programs. As a result, we anticipate an approximate 28% tax rate for each of the remaining three quarters this year which should average to a whole year rate of 27%.","Cash from operations was a very strong $111 million in the first quarter. Operating cash flow increased $79 million versus first quarter last year due to higher earnings and a smaller increase in working capital. We entered the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales at a seasonally normal 11.1%.","In February, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share and extended our record of consecutive annual dividend increases to 45 years. At yesterday\u2019s closing price of $47.69, the current yield is 2.7%, which is one of the higher yields among the 50 companies that comprise the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats.","We also repurchased 2.5 million shares of our stock in the first quarter at an average price of $43.75 and issued 1.1 million shares through employee benefit plans and option exercises.","Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the first quarter with net debt-to-net capital of 37% well within our longstanding target range of 30% to 40%. We also monitored debt-to-EBITDA. At the end of March, our debt was 1.6 times our trailing 12-months adjusted EBITDA.","We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder returns to that of peer companies on a rolling three-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top one-third of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of about 12% to 15% per year.","For the three-year period that will end on December 31, 2016, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 25% per year. That performance places us within the top 10% of the S&P 500.","As we look forward in 2016, we believe the key macro drivers for our market remains favorable and positive trends continue in several of our businesses and product categories. With this backdrop, along with strong earnings in the first quarter, we\u2019ve raised our 2016 EPS guidance and now expect record full-year earnings from continuing operations of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. Bridging from 2015, this earnings guidance assumes that unit volume will generate typical 25% to 30% incremental margins but that benefit is expected to be partially offset by the non-recurrence from the 2015 pricing lag.","Sales guidance is unchanged at $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion or flat to 5% higher than 2015. This guidance assumes unit volume growth in the mid-to-high-single-digits. As partial offsets to the volume growth, sales guidance includes a 2% decrease from late 2015 divestitures we had a small acquisitions and an approximate 2% reduction from commodity deflation.","Steel scrap costs have began to re-inflate since the beginning of the year and we are implementing price increases in some of our businesses. As a result, full-year sales guidance now reflects slightly less deflation than previously anticipated.","We expect another year of very strong margin performance based upon our guidance range, we currently expect a full-year EBIT margin between 12.9% and 13.3% which is flat to up slightly compared to 2015.","In April, we settled, as plaintiff, a longstanding antitrust claim and expect to receive $25 million of after-tax cash proceeds in the second quarter. This claim was primarily related to the Prime Foam Products business that we divested in 2007. The majority of the benefit or $0.15 per share will be recognized in discontinued operations. The remaining $0.03 per share benefit will be recognized in continuing operations during the second quarter.","We expect to generate full-year cash from operations of approximately $500 million, which includes the cash proceeds from the litigation settlement. Dividend should require about $175 million of cash and capital expenditures should approximate $130 million for the year.","Our target range for dividend payout is 50% to 60% of net earnings. Actual payout had been higher until 2015, and as a result, dividend growth has been modest at about 3% per year. However, recent growth in annual earnings we are now comfortably within our target and payout range. This gives us greater flexibility to consider future dividend growth that will more closely align with our EPS growth. As has been our practice, after funding capital expenditures and dividends, remaining cash flow will be prioritized towards competitively advantaged acquisitions.","Potential acquisitions must meet stringent, strategic, and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established; however, we currently expect to repurchase 4 million to 5 million shares in 2016 and issue approximately 2 million shares primarily for employee benefit plans.","With those comments, I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier.","David DeSonier","That concludes our prepared remarks. We thank you for your attention and we will be glad to answer your questions. In order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate, we request that you ask only question and then yield to the next participant. If you have additional questions, you\u2019re welcome to reenter the queue and we will answer those questions as well. Kevin, we are ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions].","Our first question today is coming from Budd Bugatch from Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Bobby Griffin","Good morning everyone. This is Bobby filling in for Budd. Appreciate you guys taking my questions and congrats on another strong operational quarter.","Karl Glassman","Thank you, Bobby.","Bobby Griffin","Karl, in your prepared remarks that you talked quickly about kind of some short term demand softness in residential and I was wondering if you can may be provide some color as you saw some stuff in April that gave you confidence that it pick back up and that was only short-term in nature?","Karl Glassman","Bobby that first off, you will remember that from a residential perspective we were and continue to be up against some really difficult comps. Inner Springs volume in the first quarter of last year was up 15% from the previous year, we have those same headwinds in the second quarter with second quarter last year being up 17%. But direct answer to your question the first quarter was a little bit choppy. February was the softest; we think that it was correlated to a lesser tax refund season than is typical. March improved somewhat certainly compared to February and through the first three weeks of April, U.S. Springs sales are flat. So it was unit flat and the real favorable mix benefit that we have going forward, we were pretty bullish from a selling price perspective as our customers start to launch their new product lines that are very heavily weighted to our technology.","Bobby Griffin","Appreciate it. Comfort Core now crossed 30% of Inner Springs units?","Karl Glassman","33% in the first quarter.","Bobby Griffin","Thank you. I appreciate the color and best of luck moving forward.","Karl Glassman","Thanks, Bobby.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mark Rupe from Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Rupe","Good morning and congrats as well. On the upholstered furniture and the motion furniture down 6%, I know it was down a little bit in the fourth quarter, similar kind of choppiness or is there anything else to play there?","Karl Glassman","No, Mark it\u2019s actually furniture as we speak is softer than bedding, its April, as you know, isn\u2019t the strongest month for furniture, home furniture typically anyway and it is a little softer. We have a dynamic that\u2019s taking place in that, you\u2019ll remember year ago the industry or oil industry was significantly impacted by the West Coast port strikes. So we think that there was significant demand or shipment built in Asia product that did not hit the U.S. shores. So we saw abnormal growth in the U.S. mechanism business, in the first really half of last year that normalized in the back half. So those columns are difficult but admittedly, furniture is a little softer as we speak than bedding.","Mark Rupe","Okay. Just real quick on the Comfort Core just following up on Bobby\u2019s question, is the profile consistent in Europe as it is in the U.S. or is it a smaller piece of your business there?","Karl Glassman","In Europe actually it\u2019s 59% of our sales, total units in the first quarter. Now I will say in Europe we tend to mix higher to the medium price points and premium price points and for margin reasons, really don\u2019t participate in the real low entry price points in the bedding industry, where in the U.S.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Keith Hughes from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. Just shifting over to raw materials with steel now accelerating historically that\u2019s been a better environment for you but can you just give an update where the spread lies right now. How you think that will play out over the short-term?","Karl Glassman","Yes, Keith that market scrap was up $20 in the first quarter, selling prices didn\u2019t follow that. So the spread was tighter in the first quarter than it was during any of the quarters in 2015. With a $50 market increase in scrap in April and an expectation of another $50 increase in May that we have announced wire based increases. So the wire, the rod, and the wire level and has started to implement selling price increases in the bedding industry. So we were narrower on spread in the first quarter, the second quarter we will probably have that typical lag where you start to see inflation, there is a 90-day lag before we can recover it, we should start to see normal spreads in the back half of the year.","And again, I will remind listeners, our people do a great job of passing through inflation but there is a little bit of a lag on the upside, inflation is very, very good for our shareholders and badly needed at this point.","Keith Hughes","Okay. Just switching to the year, your same-store sales were down 1%, while I guess you were down 3% in total for the quarter, you\u2019re looking to be up flat to 5% for the year, I mean it feels like you would probably be towards the lower-end of that range given the slow start to the year but is there something that offsets that moving forward?","Susan McCoy","Yes, Keith, let me help you a little bit with that. We should, as we get into second quarter start to see some sales growth in the back half of the year we would expect more sales growth obviously we\u2019re gradually anniversarying the 2015 deflation as we move through the year. In first quarter of \u201815, we really didn\u2019t have too much price deflation has started to ramp up in second quarter and then we had quite a lot in the back half of the year.","And then to Karl\u2019s point, we also based on current commodity environment should start to see some inflation growing as we move through certainly in late second quarter but in the third quarter, fourth quarter. That along with the comp dynamics, if you will remember first quarter of last year was actually our most challenging kind of total company comp quarter with units up 8%. When you roll all that together it -- I think it helps to make some sense out of our expectation that our sales growth should start to improve, when we get into second quarter and certainly back half.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Daniel Moore from CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Moore","I just wanted to echo your initial comments on Susan did the best in the business, so thank you for your hard work.","Susan McCoy","Thanks.","Daniel Moore","Quickly you just in terms of industrial side, can you quantify the decline year-over-year in drawn wire volumes and perhaps what your expectations are for the remainder of the year?","Karl Glassman","Dan, it would be correlated to the relative softness in U.S. Spring. So the expectation is as the comps get easier that we will start up to consume more tons of wire internally were heavy weighted to internal consumption. So that\u2019s the softness. We don\u2019t quantify it in terms of tons.","Daniel Moore","Got it. But similar expectations for improved volumes as we go \u2013 as we move out through the year?","Karl Glassman","Yes.","Daniel Moore","Excellent. And then just kind of a housekeeping but the tax rate 27% lower given the changes, are those likely sustainable as you look out to fiscal \u201817 and beyond?","Susan McCoy","No, Dan actually 27% was, it was clinical that\u2019s not what our full-year tax rate for 2015 also. The dynamics that we\u2019re seeing this year are ongoing and first quarter in most years assuming that our shipments continues to over time move up, will typically kick out a tax benefit that will lower our effective tax rates in the first quarters. And then subsequent quarters just don\u2019t have as much of that new phenomenon that hits them because when our cost programs, stock-based comp programs ultimately payout.","But yes it\u2019s the wrong way of answering that 27% is reasonable this year, it was consistent with last year well we set our expectations at the start of each year but there would be no reasons I think ongoing years of the meaningful difference in that based on what we would know right now.","Daniel Moore","It\u2019s helpful and lastly and I\u2019ll jump back the 13-ish percent EBIT margin guide for the full-year obviously you started out the year higher than that, based on the lag that you described is Q2 likely to be the low point for margin and then start to be rebuild as the year goes on or there other factors that might cause that to be different?","Susan McCoy","That\u2019s a good question relative to progression. We would expect year-over-year in both the first and second quarter, obviously we did in the first quarter 150 to 200 basis points improvement back half. Year-over-year it\u2019s going to be down because of prior year comps being fairly challenging and collectively that gets us to the flat guidance that we\u2019ve issued.","Matt Flanigan","Yes and Dan this is Matt, I would just weigh in and echo what Susan basically said that first quarter came in very strong as you see the second quarter you should expect a pretty strong EBIT performance, internationally with some of the seasonality business as well as the lag going the other way with inflation possibly taking up in the back half of the year. You should see those likely to be a bit lower than the 13 what is going to be all year long we think the third and fourth quarters might be a tad on the underside of that, whereas the first two quarters will be on the tad on the upper side.","But we will see, we\u2019re certainly not surrendering at all to the margin opportunities for the rest of the year. But you should expect the second quarter also to be strong and then third and fourth quarter will probably be closer to our full-year guidance if not just a tad below that.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions].","Our next question today is coming from Herbert Hardt from Monness Crespi Hardt. Please proceed with your question.","Herbert Hardt","Good morning. And I would also say good quarter. I have two questions one is regarding aerospace; there are several suppliers to Boeing and Airbus you said there have been delays. So I would ask if you experienced the same thing. And secondly, on a broader basis, given the fact you\u2019ve held revenue guidance roughly the same margins going up, where do you really see the changes in terms of margins?","Karl Glassman","Mitch, why don\u2019t you hit the aerospace side of things.","Mitch Dolloff","Okay. I think for our aerospace business, I think it\u2019s been relatively steady. I think in the broader market, there is really solid build rates through 2019 mainly driven by more fuel efficient aircrafts, but I think that does create some disruption just through in the life of programs and new programs starting create some disruption at individual suppliers on those programs. But for us I would say it\u2019s been relatively steady.","Karl Glassman","And as it relates to global demand, Mitch, actually should probably answer part of that too because we continue to see really strong global auto demand, Europe is recovering significantly in the markets that we serve not only from an automotive perspective but from a bedding components perspective but there is a lot written about Asian automotive, it continues to perform extremely well. So we\u2019re -- if there is a little bit of softness it\u2019s hardly it\u2019s in U.S. residential, the rest of the globe and the rest of our businesses are performing extremely well.","Susan McCoy","And on your margin question, our full-year earnings guidance has come up by about $0.10 as we noted, but that\u2019s partly the tax benefit in the first quarter we\u2019re allowing for the $0.03 benefit from the litigation settlement that Matt made mention of. Our overall margin framework has improved a little bit. We were previously thinking that we would be flattish may be down a bit from last year\u2019s 12.9 and now we\u2019re thinking 12.9. So may be a few basis points higher than that even with current guidance and that essentially reflects the strong performance that we had in the first quarter and the fact that even though we had the FIFO carryover as we would have expected in residential, much of that impact was offset with really strong operating improvements happening in our industrial segment and in commercial some other parts of the company too.","So I think collectively those things are helping to buy us modestly, our overall margin being higher for the full-year. We have recognized to Karl\u2019s earlier point on potential on commodity inflation as we start to inflate that we would expect to come out by the end of the year in pretty good shape.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is a follow-up from Budd Bugatch from Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Bobby Griffin","Yes, this is Bobby again. I appreciate you guys let me ask one more question. I just want to touch real quickly on Susan\u2019s comments about the operational improvements really inside commercial products and industrial materials those two segments we saw very nice margin improvements in. I was hoping just to get a little color on what\u2019s taking place in those segments to drive that?","Karl Glassman","Yes, from a commercial standpoint it was volume that our people in fashion bed are doing a great job of picking up share, the recovery in adjustables is notable and a very good thing for us, so that the expansion is really just contribution margin on additional volume. Those businesses are all extremely well managed.","As regards industrial, the primary drivers margin improvement is significantly improved performance in our steel mill, it is running at record levels of productivity and obviously a tough market from a spread perspective with the tons output per hour, per kilowatt, both are fantastic and we were implementing some new manufacturing processes year ago first quarter. So we are comping at that steel mill to some a little bit of year-on-year softness but they are just doing a great job of executing.","Bobby Griffin","I appreciate that and one quick-follow on how is the capacity for the adjustable base business in terms of your guys -- are you guys riding CapEx for all last year?","Matt Flanigan","Bobby, I would encourage you and any of your friends to buy adjustable. We can ship and I would promise you. I would not have said that a year ago but with four manufacturing sites our people are very well aware of the market demand expectation for growth in that category and we are all -- we are dressed up and ready to go. We can serve this any bit of business that we are raised with.","Bobby Griffin","Are we starting to see that adjustable bed attachment move down to kind of the call it sub $1,500 to sub $1000 mattress units now?","Matt Flanigan","Yes, I think that\u2019s actually been the real growth in the category but that\u2019s a story from 2015 as well that if the ultra premium side the attach rates probably continue to expand slightly but as you know there is not a lot of units there but to be able to sell more adjustables in that pricing band between a $1,000 and $2,000 all of the manufacturers and the retailers are attacking that brand and that\u2019s where we are seeing in the largest unit growth for sure.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.","Karl Glassman","Just one quick one, before we sign off. If this was really a great quarter from an operating perspective but our tax, our accounting and legal people really did some herculean work with adopting new accounting rules and the tax folks working well together and the legal folks getting some of this home litigation behind us. So to each and every one of them, I want to thank them as well.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Wendy Watson, Vice President of Investor Relations for Leggett & Platt. Thank you. You may begin.","Wendy Watson","Good morning and thank you for taking part in Leggett & Platt fourth quarter 2019 conference call. I am Wendy Watson. With me today are Karl Glassman, Chairman and CEO; Mitch Dolloff, President and COO; Jeff Tate, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Susan McCoy, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.","The agenda for our call this morning is as follows: Karl will start with a summary of the major statements we made in yesterday's press release; Jeff will discuss financial details and address our outlook for 2020, and finally, the group will answer any questions that you may have.","This conference call is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material. This call may not be transcribed, recorded or broadcast, without our expressed permission. A replay is available from the IR portion of Leggett's Web site. We posted to the Investor Relations portion of the Web site yesterday's press release and a set of PowerPoint slides that contain summary financial information along with segment details. Those documents supplement the information we discuss on this call, including non-GAAP reconciliations.","I need to remind you that remarks today concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results, constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results or events may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release in the section in our 10-K and 10-Qs entitled Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors.","I'll now turn the call over to Karl.","Karl Glassman","Good morning and thank you for participating in our fourth quarter call. First, I want to thank our dedicated fellow employees around the world for your efforts during this past year.","In 2019, our employees accomplished the acquisition and integration of ECS, the largest acquisition in our history, the very successful restructuring of our home furniture business, where we are already seeing an EBIT margin benefit, the orderly closure of our Fashion Bed business, and successful liquidation of that inventory, all while keeping a sharp focus on de-leveraging, generating record cash from operations, and delivering our 48th consecutive annual dividend increase. This represents tremendous work by our employees across the company, and these efforts are very much appreciated. Thank you all.","As a reminder, in November, we filed an 8-K that discussed changes to our segments structure. These changes align with how we manage our businesses, effective January 1, 2020, all of our bedding-related businesses including our innerspring and specialty foam businesses, our steel rod and wire, and machinery businesses, and our adjustable bed business will be one bedding product segment. This optimizes efficiency, and allows us to holistically manage our bedding value chain of rod, wire, spring specialty foam. The newly-formed furniture flooring and textile product segment will contain our home and work furniture businesses, our flooring products business, and our fabric converting and geo-components businesses. Our specialized product segment is not changing, and includes our automotive, aerospace, and hydraulic cylinder businesses.","The segment commentary in yesterday's press release is based on the historical reporting format as we continue to report under the prior segment structure through 2019. Before we report first quarter 2020 earnings, we will furnish an 8-K providing five years of historical segment data based upon the new segment reporting structure.","We have several items to highlight in our 2019 performance. Full-year sales grew 11%, EBIT grew 18%, and adjusted EBIT grew 12%. Full-year EPS was $2.47, and adjusted EPS was $2.57, a 4% increase over 2018 adjusted EPS. We generated record operating cash flow of $668 million. Adjusted working capital as a percent of annualized sales improved to a low 9.9% at year-end. We experienced fluctuations in sales and earnings from the effects of raw material costs, primarily steel scrap cost and selling prices for steel rod, wire, and innersprings along with corresponding movements in LIFO benefits or expense. We passed our steel costs increases or decreases along to our customers after an approximate 90-day lag. Because of this lag, in the first-half of 2019, our selling prices for steel, rod, wire, and innerspring increased from the recovery of cost inflation that occurred in 2018.","At the same time, our costs for steel scrap were deflating. This had a positive impact on both sales and earnings as sales dollars were increasing, and earnings benefited from the lower cost. In the second-half of 2019, we began to pass our lower steel scrap costs along to our rod, wire, and innerspring customers. Despite the downward effect on our sales dollars, we continue to experience earnings growth from steel cost deflation through October of 2019. We also experienced increased earnings from LIFO benefits as steel costs deflated.","Steel scrap costs began to rise in November 2019, and have continued inflating through January of 2020. We expect steel movements to cause sales and earnings fluctuations in 2020, and anticipate negative earnings impact in the first quarter. We also expect year-over-year changes in LIFO as we had $32 million LIFO benefit in 2019. As the quarters progress, we will update you on the changes in steel scrap and rod, and our full-year LIFO expectations. While we are most affected by moves in steel scrap and rod, we also experienced a negative effect on sales from foam chemical deflation in our ECS business that I will discuss later in the call.","Fourth quarter sales increased 9% to $1.14 billion. The ECS acquisition added 13% to sales in the quarter. Organic sales were down 4%, 1% from volume, and 3% from raw material-related price decreases, and a negative currency impact. Most of our businesses grew in the fourth quarter. The growth was more than offset by the planned exit of business in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture, which reduced sales 3%, and continued weak trade demand for steel, rod, and wire. Absent declines from exited businesses, volume was up 2%.","We are pleased with the performance of our bedding businesses in the quarter. U.S. Spring sales were up 7%, international spring sales were up 4%, and adjustable bed sales were up 22%. In addition, our automotive business was up 8% in the quarter, while global auto production was down 5%. Our aerospace business was up 11% in the quarter.","Fourth quarter EBIT increased $51 million over fourth quarter 2018, and adjusted EBIT increased $20 million or 17% to $140 million. Adjusted EBIT benefited from the ECS acquisition, even after $12 million of amortization expense, lower raw material cost, including LIFO benefits, and improved earnings performance in furniture products. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 70 basis points to 12.2%, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 160 basis points to 16.4%.","Fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.64. This included restructuring-related charges that reduced earnings $0.04 per share. Adjusted fourth quarter earnings were $0.68 per share, a 10% increase versus fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in fourth quarter earnings reflects higher adjusted EBIT, partially offset by higher interest expense and tax rate.","For the full-year 2019, sales grew 11% to $4.75 billion. ECS and other smaller acquisitions added 14% to sales. Organic sales were down 3%, on 3% lower volume. Raw material-related selling price inflation from increases implemented in late 2018, were offset by a negative currency impact.","Full-year organic sales growth in most of our businesses including U.S. Spring, automotive, work furniture, and aerospace was more than offset by the planned exit of business in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture, which reduced sales 3%, and weak trade demand in steel, rod, and wire. Volume was flat for the year absent declines from exited business.","Content gains continue to drive sales growth in both our bedding and automotive businesses in 2019. U.S. Spring sales were up 6%, benefiting from the continued shift to higher value innersprings. Our automotive sales were up 2% for the year with global auto production down 6%. Full-year EBIT increased $76 million, and adjusted EBIT increased $56 million, or 12% to $529 million. Adjusted EBIT benefited from the ECS acquisition even after $50 million of acquisition accounting, lower raw material costs, including LIFO benefits, and improved earnings performance in our furniture product segment. Full-year earnings per share increased to $2.47, adjusted earnings per share increased 4% to $2.57, adjusted EPS benefited from higher EBIT partially offset by higher interest expense and tax rate.","In January 2019, we acquired Elite Comfort Solutions, and gained critical capabilities in proprietary phone technology along with scale in the production of private label finished mattresses. ECS's full-year 2019 sales were flat with 2018, primarily from deflation and weaker demand in non-bedding markets. Volume was up 11%. As expected, ECS's EBITDA margin is accretive to our total company EBITDA margin, and their cash flow generation is strong.","In the fourth quarter of 2018, we have initiated restructuring activities after an in-depth analysis of our Fashion Bed and Home Furniture businesses. Total restructuring-related charges were $15 million in 2019 and $16 million in 2018. The restructuring activity is substantially complete. In November, the U.S. mattress industry's anti-dumping petition on imported Chinese mattresses came to a successful conclusion. With the International Trade Commission making a unanimous final determination that the U.S. industry had been materially injured by Chinese mattresses sold at prices that violates the U.S. trade laws.","Jeff will discuss our 2019 financial details and full-year guidance for 2020. I'll now turn the call over to him.","Jeff Tate","Thank you, Karl, and good morning everyone. In 2019, we generated record cash flow from operations of $668 million, a $228 million increase over 2018. This improvement was driven by significant reduction and working capital across the company, and strong operating cash generation in many of our businesses, including ECS. We ended the year with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales of 9.9%, an improvement versus 10.6% at the end of 2018. In addition, we brought back $96 million of offshore cash in the fourth quarter, bringing our full-year total to $279 million.","In November, we declared a $0.40 per share quarterly dividend, a 5% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2018. At yesterday's closing price of $46.96, the current yield is 3.4%, which is one of the higher yields among the S&P 500 dividend aristocrats. Consistent with our de-leveraging plan, share repurchases were limited in 2019. For the full-year, we repurchased only 700,000 shares of our stock, primarily surrounded for employee benefit plans at an average price of $44.20. We issued $2 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans and stock option exercises.","From an acquisition perspective, during the year, we acquired ECS in one small geo component operation. We also continue to invest in capital to support organic growth opportunities. Total capital expenditures in 2019 were $143 million 10% lower than the prior year, reflecting a balance of investing for the future while controlling our spending. Our financial base remains strong. We ended 2019 with debt at 2.9 times our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA.","We remain committed to maintaining a strong investment credit rating, and continue to expect to deliver to a ratio of debt to trailing 12-months adjusted EBITDA of approximately 2.5 times by the end of 2020. We expect to accomplish this by limiting share repurchases, controlling the pace of acquisitions, and using our operating cash flow to repay debt. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder returns to that appear companies on a rolling three-year basis.","Our target is to achieve TSR in the top third of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. Our annual TSR was below the 11th of 14% targets in both 2017 as well as 2018, but significantly above the target in 2019. Over those same years, the TSR, the S&P 500 was well above historical averages. As a result, our recent three-year performance did not meet our top third goal. However, we believe our disciplined growth strategy, portfolio management and prudent use of capital will support achievement of this goal over time.","Now, moving to a discussion of our 2020 guidance, 2020 Sales are expected to be in the range of $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion or down 1% to up 3% over 2019. Acquisitions in 2019, should add 1% of sales growth in 2020. Raw material related price decreases implemented in the second-half of 2019 shouldn't lower sales 1%. We expect mid-single-digit volume growth in 2020 for most of our major businesses. This includes automotive, U.S. Spring, ECS, aerospace, geo components and work furniture. We also expect the growth in these businesses to be offset by approximately 1% of further year-over-year sales decreases from flat exit volume in both fashion based and home furniture, as well as continued with trade demand for steel rod and wire. So, absent exited business volume is expected to be flat up 4%. 2020 earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.40 cents to $2.60 cents, reflecting earnings growth in our automotive, bedding, and other businesses to be more than offset by increasing steel costs, including the non-recurrence of 2019's LIFO benefit.","Additionally, we expect increased cost in 2020 because of investments we're making to support the growth, security, and continuity of the company. These investments include network and cyber security upgrades, and personnel to support those activities. We're also investing in our human resources organizations and related technology.","Finally, employee benefit costs are increasing due to a valuable change we made to our 401(k) plan, adding employee auto enrollment. We're very pleased that this change increased employee participation rates in the 401(k) plan. Earnings per share guidance assumed a full-year effective tax rate of 23% versus 22% in 2019. We expect 2020 depreciation and amortization to approximate $200 million. Net interest expense of approximately $80 million and fully diluted shares of $136 million. Based upon this guidance framework, our 2024-year adjusted EBIT margin should be in the range of 10.7% to 11%.","Cash from operations should approximate $550 million in 2020. Capital expenditures should approximate $160 million for the year and dividends should require $220 million of cash. Finally, we know impacts from the coronavirus, our top of mind for many of you, and we're closely monitoring global developments. Our current 2020 guidance does not include possible impacts from the virus. It's still too early to develop reasonable quantitative data related to the impact. Our first priority is the health and safety of our employees around the world.","For employees in China, we've extended the Lunar New Year plant shutdown in accordance with Chinese provincial and local government extensions. We are establishing protocols in all 16 of our Chinese facilities to better protect our 5200 employees in China when they can return to work. And for all negative flat employees around the world, we've implemented a travel ban to Asia and are severely restricting all international travel.","We're assessing the potential impact of this pandemic on our business, including demand for our goods and our customer's good, inventory availability throughout our supply chain as well as our customer supply chain, the global movement of goods and workforce availability. We do not anticipate that there are factors unique to us that will cause the impact from this coronavirus to be greater to our company than our global manufacturers -- than other global manufacturers. We continue to monitor the situation, and we'll take all reasonable mitigation steps as facts unfold.","With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Wendy.","Wendy Watson","That concludes our prepared remarks. We thank you for your attention, and we will be glad to answer your questions. To allow everyone an opportunity to participate, we request that you ask only one question and then yield to the next participant. If you have additional questions, you are welcome to re-enter the queue and we will answer those questions as well.","Melissa, we're ready to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Susan Maklari","Good morning, everybody.","Karl Glassman","Good morning.","Susan McCoy","Good morning, Susan.","Susan Maklari","I guess my first question is just - can you talk a little bit to ComfortCore maybe in the quarter overall bedding how that did, and anything that we should be aware of in the channel as we head into the President's Day weekend and kind of the sales events around that?","Mitch Dolloff","Sure. This is Mitch, Susan. So, for ComfortCore units continue to be very strong on the U.S. Spring side. They were running at about 62% of the units for the quarter, and about 48% of those included are quantum edge as well. So, I think that you know, the bedding outlook continues to be strong, I'll let Karl comment on any trends going forward into the holiday period.","Karl Glassman","Good morning, Susan. That as Mitch said, continued adoption of ComfortCore driven somewhat by the growth of hybrid mattresses, both compressed and uncompressed, is at a level -- the rate of 62% for the quarter, 56% for the year that we didn't anticipate. So, we are pleased with the launch of new product lines at the Las Vegas market, which was last weekend that there was a greater introduction of ComfortCore. The bedding industry feels pretty optimistic in terms of that there's relative stability in that industry, which is kind of a change, compared to last five years, and advertising investments seem to be in place new product launches, so there's excitement around there. We feel pretty good, Presidents Day is a tough one to call, I know there'll be heavy advertising going into it, but it's always one of those holidays that is performance is subject to weather, just because of being in February, but there is a build up to it. We're exciting. Bedding was a great story in 2019, and we expect the same in 2020.","Susan Maklari","Okay, great. That's very helpful. And then, you gave a lot of color around the impacts that you've seen over the last year and then into the beginning of this year from steel prices, and understanding that it's kind of hard for you to project going forward, but can you just kind of give us some sense of maybe what's going on in that market? You talked to the weakness of trade demand in your rod and wire segment in there. So, can just talk a little bit to, how we should think about that as we move through 2020? What's driving that weakness and demand, and any other color there?","Karl Glassman","Yes. Let's talk first pricing and then we'll go through weakness and trade demand, which is very different than our internal demand, but what happened is a continual deflation of input costs as 2019 progressed until November, where we saw the first move up in scrap. So, we saw steel scrap inflate in November at a rate of $20 a ton, followed by $25 a ton in December, and then $30 a ton in January. So, we're dealing now with kind of the reverse lag effect from the standpoint that is prices deflated in 2019. We kept that benefit for 90 days. We are flipping that situation in 2020, but because of the kind of oddities of year-end, we actually decreased our customer prices in January of 2020, because we adjust every quarter. So, where those contracts actually in the phase of our increase in input costs, we lower prices, because of lag effect. We will be increasing our customer's prices starting in April. So, with that, there is a LIFO swing. There is zero impact of LIFO expense in our forecast for 2020 as we laid out guidance, but who the heck knows to your point. So, that's what's happening from a pricing standpoint.","From a trade market perspective, again, this is trade, so think of us for about the 25% of the total tons that we produced from the perspective as you would a large public steel company. In that case, we are like them from the standpoint that our metal margins are okay. Margins aren't so bad, because of the deflationary cycle, but the demand is incredibly soft. It's not specific to any particular sector. It's just macro U.S. economic and export demand for steel products in virtually every channel of distribution. So, people may question, \"Well, wait a second. The U.S. steel industry was protected by Trump tariffs last year, while the products weren't.\" So, there was a continued inflow of products in an environment, where export demand was very, very soft. So, from a trade perspective, that's really what happened in 2019, and we don't see a change in that in 2020. So, I apologize for the longwinded answer, but steel moves are really, really complex.","Susan Maklari","Yes, I know. That's very helpful, and it sounds like it's having quite an impact on the 2020 and how we think about the guidance. So that's really helpful for us. And in a\u2026","Karl Glassman","That really does from a quarter perspective, Susan. So, expect Q1 is going to be negatively impacted by that pricing decrease, while costs are rising. So yes, it is impacting the kind of the quarterly sequencing.","Susan Maklari","Okay. And then, as we go through the year though, your comps also in that segment, I know the segments are going to change, so it's going to make it a little -- that's going to change things as well for us, but the comps get a little easier, and then as we move through the year, from a revenue\u2026","Karl Glassman","Said differently, we will become more fully recovered from a margin perspective, but the revenues, you are right, because we have the business that we appropriately walked away from that still impacts us in the first-half of the year that we anniversary. So, Fashion Bed, that kind of headwind of Fashion Bed really goes away in the back half of the year, but we still deal with that legacy exposure in the first-half, and Home Furniture has little of that same situation, but we'll move to an inflationary environment, which will help offset some of that from a top line perspective.","Susan McCoy","Susan, I am going to go ahead and take an opportunity here really quick. You didn't specifically ask the question about kind of progression of sales guidance and margin, sort of progression through the year, but Karl has introduced that idea already. So, I'll complete that discussion by saying just to be clear, as we look at quarters throughout 2020, we expect sales in the first-half of the year to be down slightly, and then in the second-half of the year to be up slightly, and so the stuff he was talking about, you guys have alluded to, there's more impact from the excess volume in the first-half of the year, we've got the flip from deflation to inflation, but the second-half of the year, we expect to have anniversary most of the excess volume. So, that's on the sales side.","On the earning side, we would expect to see our quarterly margins, the margin trend to be very similar to what we experienced in 2019, including the first quarter being lower than our expectations for the rest of the year, and that gets to the steel lag that Karl was talking about flip on the steel side, and then for the full-year, we would pattern the margin progression basically to be flat to down slightly, versus each quarter in 2019, and then for the full-year 2019.","Susan Maklari","Okay, all right. That's very helpful. And then, I assume like as we get closer to you restating the information according to the new segments to -- we'll get some of that historical, so we'll have a sense of how to model it going forward?","Susan McCoy","Absolutely.","Susan Maklari","Yes, okay.","Karl Glassman","It actually will help things having that historic industrial and residential pulled together in this bedding segment, I think it should help, because there's been this kind of offset. You had to read through to try to figure out where the impacts and when the event in industrial was rolling through residential. So, I think it will help you from an analytic standpoint, and more importantly that's how we manage the business.","Susan Maklari","Yes, I know, I think it's going to be very helpful, and especially as we get ECS in there, and a lot of those pieces of that supply chain. So, I think it is going to be helpful. So, yes, I will let somebody else talk now.","Karl Glassman","We have a lot of time on that, so\u2026","Susan Maklari","I know. I am going to let someone else talk now.","Karl Glassman","Thanks, Susan.","Susan Maklari","All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Daniel Moore with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your questions.","Daniel Moore","Thanks. Good morning.","Karl Glassman","Good morning, Dan.","Daniel Moore","I guess, wanted to start with just one or two real quick, number one, can you quantify the dollar amount or EPS impact of increased costs for some of the investments you described network cyber security etcetera as well as the increased employee benefit related costs in '20 versus '19?","Jeff Tate","Hi, Daniel, this is Jeff. Good morning. That number is approximately $10 million in total.","Daniel Moore","Between the two?","Jeff Tate","Between the two, correct.","Daniel Moore","Perfect. And second is more philosophical, but obviously remain committed to de-leveraging, which I know a lot of investors appreciate, given the guidance little light relative to expectations as well as just the incredible powerful cash generation. Why be quite that rigid the shares were to come under pressure for any reason disappointment, whatever, why not being perhaps a little bit more opportunistic and flexible regarding potential buybacks?","Jeff Tate","Hi, Dan, this is Jeff again. Thank you for the question. I think that's a very appropriate one, but I think if you will go back and look at what we discussed that Investor Day, I think we're going to stay very disciplined, very methodical and very intentional with our uses of cash. I mean, for us, we're going to continue to invest for growth from a prioritization standpoint, we're going to continue to protect the dividend and we're going to continue on the path to reaching our de-leveraging commitment that we've made to all of our stakeholders, and after that with comp share repurchases as a potential opportunity as well as acquisitions that may come down to path as well. So, the point is well taken, but for us, we're going to continue down that sequential path in terms of our prioritization of uses of cash.","Daniel Moore","Okay, understood. I'll pass it over. Thank you.","Karl Glassman","Thank you, Dan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of John Baugh with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","John Baugh","Thank you and good morning. I guess we'll start with ECS, could you clarify -- I wasn't clear, I guess I'm interested in volumes in Q4 than the year. I think you said the year was up 11%, and then of course, you talked about non-bedding being weak. I'm curious for 2020 in terms of the guide, if we're looking at -- I think mid-single digits of volume up for ECS, how does that sort of break out between non-bedding and bedding?","Mitch Dolloff","Hi, John, this is Mitch. Yes, so far I think we see that the same trend that we saw in '19 in terms of decline in some of the non-bedding markets, but continued strong opportunities in 2020 in the bedding markets both with pure foam mattresses and hybrid mattresses.","John Baugh","Yes.","Wendy Watson","Sorry. We are going to see some continuing deflation in 2020, and it's -- and some of that's due to just the softness in the furniture market and the furniture bands at ECS though.","John Baugh","Okay, so it's the mid-single digit guide for volumes for ECS for 2020 comprised of high single or almost double in bedding and declines in non-bedding or any help?","Karl Glassman","Yes, John, I think that's accurate, and that melt-off of non-bedding and move to bedding from a margin perspective is good for us. Remember the non-bedding tends to be blocks of commodity foam to the most part replaced by higher value bedding related products that may be either specialty foam components or finished mattresses. So, the answer to your question is yes, we would expect that the bedding related side of it would be in the double-digit range. The net 5% is a continuation to Wendy's point of deflation, which continues through the year, even into the fourth quarter, and the softness of the non-bedding business.","John Baugh","Great, thank you. And then in the 2020 guide again on it looks like I guess excluding the exiting of the Fashion Bed on the Home Furnishings, but is the guide for volume exclusive of the exits also down, and if so, sort of how much and why?","Karl Glassman","At the midpoint, it's up about 2%, and there's an expectation we rattle off all these businesses that are growing mid-single digits, and you heard that list, so some thing is down, and that's a continued expectation of soft demand in the trade steel industries is the primary driver of that.","John Baugh","Okay. And then, incredible job on working capital in the year, and a huge source of cash, particularly in Q4 in accounts receivable, Jeff, was there something timing-related there, or how do we think about either working capital as a percentage of revenue for 2020, or what are some of the big moving pieces on that, obviously it's a tough compare?","Jeff Tate","All right, thanks for the question, John. I mean, first of all the team you're right did a tremendous job on working capital during the course of 2019, and you saw that reflected in the 9.9% ratio there. I mean there were quite a few efforts that were contributors in 2019 especially the combination of liquidating the inventory of the exit businesses that we've highlighted during the call and increased overall and the focus of inventory level reductions. You saw the deflation of raw material costs throughout the course of 2019, it also contributed to that. As we think about 2020 John for us, the rigor and the focus will not change or not let up at all, as it relates to our working capital efforts and improvements, but we don't see where we will have as many of those significant huge wins that we saw in 2019 and 2020. However, again the focus will continue to be there and will continue to drive that result as best we can across the organization.","John Baugh","Great. And my last question is just sort of this high level focus that's taking hold on the investment side of the world on ESG, I'm wondering kind of where you are internally thinking about that, whether you hired a consultant or sort of measuring yourself, what early inning gleanings you may have on that, and what we might expect going forward? Thank you.","Wendy Watson","Yes. Hi, John. This is Wendy. Yes, we are working on ESG. We hope to finalize our first sustainability report sometime in 2020. We're working with some external consultants to help us as you know, we feel like we've long been doing the right thing and have a really strong story to tell from an ESG perspective, but gathering all that information from our different businesses around the world has had been a challenge. And so, we have some help to do that. So we're thanks for the question. And we're looking forward to being able to issue that for sustainability report. But there is a lot of work going on across the company on those factors every day, not in order to report great ESG but because it's the right thing to do in our businesses, but we are going to be pleased to be able to report them later this year.","John Baugh","Great, thank you and good luck.","Jeff Tate","Thank you, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bobby Griffin with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Bobby Griffin","Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking my questions and hope everybody is doing well. But just quickly, Susan I want to go back to your comments about the regression for the year just to make sure I'm grasping it correctly, but for 1Q based on the steel, sequential kind of inflation that you're seeing from steel on the input side, we would want to model or the expectations for 1Q EBIT margins to be down year-over-year in the low point of 2020?","Susan McCoy","We would -- year-over-year in the first quarter expect each of the quarters not just the first quarter, but each of the quarters to be maybe in line with or slightly below what the prior year's quarter was. That means sequentially, it goes down from fourth quarter to first quarter because of the steel issues that Carl was talking about and just normal seasonality, frankly with our fourth quarter to first quarter in that business, very aggressive businesses.","Bobby Griffin","Okay. And that would mark\u2026","Jeff Tate","In case the low point to your question, the low point being the first quarter.","Susan McCoy","That's right.","Bobby Griffin","Okay, okay, that's helpful. And I realized you guys are still doing some of the initial work on what the potential impact could be from the virus but can you maybe just remind us of what products are produced in China that are consumed backed by the U.S. consumer because I know typically you set up your production as produced in the local country consumed by the local country. So any color on that would be helpful.","Mitch Dolloff","Good morning, Bobby. This is Mitch. We are happy to comment on that. So we have 16 plants, as we mentioned in China, probably the biggest China to U.S. shipment comes in our home furniture business. There's some of that that's consumed by our customers in China converted to finish goods and then comes to the U.S. as well as best direction for us from China to the U.S. And then, we have 10 automotive plants in China. And as you mentioned, primarily those are local production for the local market, but there is some portion of our -- of those goods, particularly motors and actuators that are consumed all around the world, including Europe and the U.S. So those are probably the two largest impacts. There's a small operation on the work furniture side that has shipments to the U.S. but home furniture, automotive are probably the biggest exposures.","Bobby Griffin","Okay. That's very helpful. And I guess lastly for me, Mitch, I think this would probably be back towards you again, but can you made a comment a little bit of detail on hydraulic cylinders? We had another decline in the fourth quarter, maybe what would happen over the last two quarters in that business, and then, maybe the outlook going into 2020 for that growth area?","Mitch Dolloff","Okay, Bobby. Sure. Yes, it's been a bit tough. Sales were really strong in hydraulic cylinders from the second quarter of '18 through the second quarter of '19. And then, really began to fall off rapidly. Our customers, who are really the leading forklift producers, started forecasting significant demand drops at 15% to 20%, and that's really what we started to see in Q3 and again saw that accelerate in Q4, we don't have a lot of great data but the industry data we do see shows that shipments were down over 20% in the fourth quarter, so, pretty much in line with where we were and down 13% for the full-year, again, with that same kind of accelerating decline trend in the fourth quarter. We expect some of this impact to continue as we look into 2020 probably, at this point we would see sales year-over-year down in the low double-digits.","Bobby Griffin","I appreciate all the detail, best of luck in 1Q and in 2020.","Karl Glassman","Thanks, Bob.","Bobby Griffin","Thank you.","Mitch Dolloff","Thanks, Bobby.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. Just a question on pricing, you talked about the raw material relationship throughout this call, with pricing you're going to be putting on your customers coming in April. I think you're talking about spring related products there. Can you talk about your foam products, what pricing it's looking like going into the New Year on that product?","Karl Glassman","Steel it's hard to forecast, but we think that the foam chemical inputs have stabilized. There was a little bit of a continued deflation in the fourth quarter but at a much lesser rate. So we think it's near bottom. Keith, there's frankly not a lot of room to go. Coronavirus may have some impact on it that, but we think we're at bottom, but we have not seen any signs of recovery. So in steel, we certainly are seeing inflationary cycle. We do not have that call on foam chemical inputs.","Keith Hughes","Okay. Second question, excuse me, on the shape of the year, is the LIFO impact going to be spread out evenly over the year, or is it a quarter-by-quarter sort of determination based on where inputs have moved?","Susan McCoy","Keith, we're starting the year with zero LIFO in 2020.","Keith Hughes","All right.","Susan McCoy","So, if nothing else changes, LIFO purely as a standalone element would basically unwind from last year. So, in quarter-to-quarter I think increased a little bit first quarter, second quarter, the third quarter and fourth quarter. We can provide these amounts to you, if you need the extra details.","Keith Hughes","Yes, I'll probably get those from you. I'll probably get those from Wendy offline.","Wendy Watson","Yes, I have that report. We don't -- I mean, it's also we don't know, Keith, we will update our LIFO estimates as the quarters progress, but it's way too early to make a call.","Keith Hughes","Yes, I didn't know if you either accrued something, and then make adjustments to the accrual as time went along, or just as that somewhat later?","Wendy Watson","That's how it works Keith, but again - because it's so early in the year, it's too early to make a call on where we think steel, the cost of our steel inventory will be at December 31, and that's - so those are the quarterly adjustments we make, and then we threw it up at the end of the year.","Keith Hughes","Okay. Final question, on the Home Furniture products, you've been moving LIFO businesses there, where are you in this process, you would call that out it's kind of a negative for the year, I thought that was mostly done as something else might come up on the radar that you just don't want to do anymore?","Mitch Dolloff","This is Mitch, Keith. No, you're right; it is essentially complete on the restructuring. We're looking at the year-over-year comparisons, we will continue to show some decline from revenue standpoint, and as Karl mentioned, we will face that in particularly in the first-half of next year as well, but from the point of the restructuring around improving margins and earnings that's been very successful, teams have done a great job there.","Karl Glassman","Keith, when you think about steel moving from a deflation to an inflationary environment, you remember the last time we went through this cycle, we had a hard time passing through steel inflation in a portion of our Home Furniture business, that we no longer participate in the side of the business and in Fashion Bed, which we no longer participate in. So we feel that as we move into this steel inflationary cycle, our company is better positioned and the pricing power that we had years ago, we now have again, and with a lot of good work and Home Furniture.","Keith Hughes","Yes.","Mitch Dolloff","And from again, going forward just to add-on in your Fashion Bed that exit, it will be particularly as we go into next year, those are significant dollars just don't repeat as we exited Fashion Bed.","Keith Hughes","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from line of Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Peter Keith","Hi, thanks a lot. Good morning everyone. I didn't want to dig into the auto business because you guys have actually done quite well there the last two quarters. I think with global market down five, you guys rebate? So, now you're back to outperforming the industry by over 1,000 basis points. Could you help us understand what's going on with some of that performance and if there's any ongoing continuation of that?","Mitch Dolloff","Yes, sure Peter. This is Mitch. Yes, and all it took was taking the basis point that 1000 basis points targeted were killing each other.","Peter Keith","So we're\u2026","Mitch Dolloff","Great, great timing, but no, I think we're glad that we did that. I mean - as we said before, it really is a long-term target. But we think it's fair to look at ourselves against you how the overall markets performing. But again, that's a longer term kind of basis. We did have stronger Q3 and Q4, as we expected, right, as we know it early in the year was tough to have confidence in us, but we I think we came through with what we expected, and I think we continue to see that same kind of optimism in 2020. Right now, I think we'd see somewhere in the mid-single digits improvement year-over-year for 2020 with the market right now, flat to down half of 1% who knows I think that'll continue to move around a bit, but we continue to have strong gains, content and new products. So, I think we remain very positive on that business.","Peter Keith","Okay, thank you. Then I wanted to ask a question around spring and also the adjustable basis. So the U.S. spring business accelerated sequentially, but the raw material headwind also picked up notably, if I'm remember correctly, I think you did cut prices at the beginning of Q4. So, the two part question would be, does that imply the units of spring, which I know you don't report anymore, but did that accelerate it with the fourth quarter and then on a related note, why did the adjustable beds business pick up so strongly in Q4?","Karl Glassman","I'll take the mattress units. It's really a content story. For us to run 62% ComfortCore, as Mitch said, and then connectivity to an increasing adoption of Quantum Edge, so it's dollars are significantly outpacing units, but on adjustable\u2026","Jeff Tate","Yes, on adjustable, yes, very strong quarter, up over 20%, but it's also you have to look - it was strong, it's been strong for the last few quarters I think that outsized year-over-year comparison is in part because of a very weak Q4 in '18. So the run rate was good, but pretty consistent with what we've been seeing for the last few quarters.","Peter Keith","Okay. And lastly from me just on which is trying to understand the timing of processes and price increases, so are we corrected it was the beginning of Q4 there was a price cut. Now there's another one at the beginning of Q1, and that would be followed by a price increase in April. I guess I'm trying to get at is that raw material headwind looks like it could have a -- worse in Q1 and then start to stabilize and in Q2 to Q4?","Karl Glassman","You're exactly right based on what we know today. You're absolutely accurate.","Peter Keith","Okay, thank you very much, guys.","Karl Glassman","Thank you, Peter.","Wendy Watson","Thanks, Peter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Bobby Griffin with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Bobby Griffin","Yes, thank you. Let me ask one more, I just want to quickly touch on the fabric and flooring product segment. How did that perform during the quarter, and is we haven't talked about in a while, but is that business still kind of the same strong cash flow generation business that we used to talk about it before?","Karl Glassman","The answer is yes. It's a really good business that consumes very little capital. Mitch and the team have done a really good job of winning those businesses out from working capital perspective. So, a greater focus there, but in floorings case, it's slow growth. Matter of fact, we would call it probably over time. Carpet adoption is probably negative 2% to 3% a year, but its returns on capital employed are very, very high as it's the proverbial cash cow, it's a good business. The fabric business is somewhat similar to that with the exception of geo components, which we continue to invest in and is performing very, very well.","Bobby Griffin","Okay, I appreciate that. Thank you for the update.","Karl Glassman","Thanks, Bobby.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is another follow-up from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Susan Maklari","Hello again.","Karl Glassman","Hello, Susan.","Susan Maklari","Karl, in your remarks you said that your arrows space volumes were up 11% in the quarter. Can you just give us any color there? Has there been any disruption as it relates to obviously some of the issues that the OEMs have been having this year with some of their models and, how are you seeing the health of that supply chain and how we should be thinking about that for 2020?","Karl Glassman","Susan, I just read numbers, Mitch is going to answer the question.","Susan Maklari","Okay, all right, we will let Mitch talk.","Mitch Dolloff","Okay, I will give it a shot. Yes. So, we actually haven't seen disruption so far. Of course, the Boeing 737 max production halt is big news in the industry, but the supply chain deep the supply chain had been struggling to catch up for a long time. And so while they have stopped production, it really hasn't impacted us at this point. We're also seeing really strong production on some of the engine platform that we are on and remember we service not only Boeing, but the Airbus planes as well. And so that's really what has been driving our strong growth in the last couple of quarters, particularly in on our fabrication facilities in the U.S. and in Europe, and we see that continuing into 2020. I think that right now our outlook is for low double-digit growth there, and aerospace continuing.","Susan Maklari","All right. All right, very good. Thank you.","Karl Glassman","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Ms. Watson for any final comments.","Wendy Watson","Thank you everybody for your attention and questions this morning, and we will talk to you again next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David DeSonier, Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations for Leggett & Platt, Incorporated. Thank you. Mr. DeSonier, you may begin.","David M. DeSonier","Good morning, and thank you for taking part in our first quarter conference call.","With me this morning are the following: Dave Haffner, our CEO; Karl Glassman who is President and Chief Operating Officer; Matt Flanigan, our Executive Vice President and CFO; and Susan McCoy, our Staff VP of Investor Relations. Perry Davis who is Senior Vice President of the company and also President of the Residential Furnishings segment is also joining us this morning. We plan to periodically include each of the segment presidents in these calls to participate in Q&A, and this quarter we're starting with Perry.","The agenda for the call this morning is as follows: Dave Haffner will start with a summary of the major statements we made in yesterday's press release. Matt Flanigan will discuss financial details and address our outlook for 2013. Karl Glassman will provide segment highlights, and finally, the group will answer any questions you have.","This conference is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material.

Haffner","Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call. We are pleased with our start to 2013 and remain optimistic longer term that we will continue to realize benefits from ongoing consumer and housing market recoveries.","As we reported yesterday, first quarter earnings were $0.33 per share, up 10% versus the $0.30 per share we earned in the first quarter of 2012. First quarter same-location sales decreased 2% with lower trade sales from our rod mill and deflation in rod and wire prices contributing in roughly equal parts to the decline. Lower volumes in bedding, portions of residential furniture, office furniture and machinery were offset by growth in carpet underlay, store fixtures and Commercial Vehicle Products. Despite sluggish demand in some of our key businesses, earnings increased during the quarter from cost improvements and strong product mix within certain business units. These improvements were partially offset by an unusually high accrual for our TSR-driven and other long-term stock based incentive compensation plans. Matt will discuss this further in his comments.","Including all of these issues, EBIT grew and EBIT margins also improved to 8.5% in the quarter compared to 7.9% in first quarter of 2012.","Optimizing returns on capital employed continues to be a major focus for our operations. We ended the first quarter with working capital at 12.9% of annualized sales, well below our 15% target. Operating cash was $24 million during the quarter, which was consistent with our internal expectations. In February, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.29 per share and extended to 42 years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases. At yesterday's closing price of $33.65, the current yield is 3.4%, which is one of the highest yields among all of the S&P 500's Dividend Aristocrats.","During the quarter, we purchased 1.6 million shares of our stock and issued 2.4 million shares. 2\/3 of the issuance is related to employee stock option exercises, which have increased in recent quarters with a significant share price appreciation. Consistent with our stated priorities for the use of excess cash flow, we will prudently buy back our stock subject to the outlook for the economy, our level of cash generation and other potential opportunities to strategically grow the company. We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year, but have established no specific repurchase commitment or timetable.","We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1\/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that will end on December 31 of this year, we have so far generated TSR of 23% per year on average, which currently places us in the top 21% of the S&P 500 companies.","I'll now turn the call over to Matt Flanigan who will discuss some additional financial details along with our outlook for the remainder of the year. Matt?","Matthew C. Flanigan","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned, quarter earnings were impacted by an unusually high accrual of $0.03 per share related to our stock-based incentive compensation plans. This was primarily due to the significant increase in our relative TSR performance as our stock price increased from $27 to $34 during the quarter.","In accordance with GAAP, we adjust our incentive compensation accruals each quarter to reflect the related performance metrics. For our TSR-based incentive plan, the stock price increase during the first quarter resulted in top quartile performance versus our 320-member peer group against which our performance is measured. This level of performance, if sustained, would result in a maximum payout for each of the 3 ongoing 3-year measurement periods, and therefore, our first quarter results included a large accrual to reflect the increase in the expected payout levels. Since the TSR-based incentive accruals now reflect maximum payout for each of the measurement periods to date, expense in subsequent quarters should be lower than the first quarter.","In addition, if our relative TSR moves into a lower quartile of the peer group, then we would reduce our accruals to reflect the corresponding lower payout levels in accordance with GAAP. The majority of this incentive cost was recognized in the selling and administrative expense line of our income statement with a smaller amount also impacting cost of goods sold. The $10 million increase in SG&A costs versus the first quarter last year was comprised in roughly equal portions of this unusual stock-based compensation expense and an unfavorable ruling on a patent infringement case.","Now on to a few other financial topics. The reduction in operating cash during the first quarter to $24 million versus $65 million in the first quarter of 2012 is consistent with our internal expectations and results primarily from changes in working capital with the largest impact from an increase in accounts receivable since the beginning of the year. Accelerated payments by some of our large customers in late 2012 resulted in much lower levels of accounts receivable at year end. In the first quarter, receivables returned to more normal levels with days of sales outstanding at 48 days, which is in line with the first quarter last year.","For 2013, we expect to generate over $350 million of operating cash, again comfortably exceeding the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends. During calendar 2013, dividends should require about $125 million of cash, which is notably lower than a typical year since the dividend normally paid in January of 2013 was accelerated into December last year in anticipation of higher tax rates.","Capital expenditures in 2013 should not exceed $100 million.","Our financial base remains very strong. We ended the quarter with net debt-to-net capital of 29.6%, slightly below the conservative end of our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%. During the quarter, we issued $100 million of commercial paper and ended with $500 million of our $600 million program available. As planned, earlier this month, we repaid $200 million of long-term debt that matured with an interest rate of 4.7%. In each of the remaining quarters this year, interest expense is currently estimated to be approximately $2 million less than it was in the first quarter.","As we stated yesterday in our press release, we narrowed our 2013 guidance. We now expect sales growth between 2% and 6%, resulting in full year sales of $3.8 billion to $3.95 billion versus previous guidance of the $3.75 million to $3.95 billion. Given the sales growth and the contribution margin we expect from incremental unit volumes, we now anticipate 2013 earnings of $1.55 to $1.75 per share versus prior guidance of $1.50 to $1.75 per share. This compares to the $1.46 of adjusted EPS from continuing operations we reported in 2012.","While we do not issue quarterly guidance, it is important to note that our Store Fixtures business is expected to have an improved second quarter but faces a very challenging year-over-year comparison in the upcoming third quarter.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Karl who will provide some additional segment comments.","Karl G. Glassman","Thank you, Matt. In the Residential Furnishings segment, same-location sales decreased 1% in the first quarter from lower unit volumes. In our U.S. Spring business, sales decreased 3% in the quarter compared to a relatively strong first quarter of 2012. Innerspring unit volumes were down 9% and boxspring units were down 1%, primarily from market weakness at promotional price points. Growth continued in Comfort Core, which is our pocketed coil product line with those units up 32% in the quarter. This category shift is driving higher average unit selling prices and a favorable product mix in U.S. Spring and offset some of the decline in unit volumes in the quarter.","In furniture components, sales decreased 7% in the first quarter. Combined volume in our seating and sofa sleeper businesses were roughly flat during the quarter, but motion hardware unit volumes declined 14%, primarily from weak market demand at promotional price points. In both the bedding and furniture markets, the first quarter each year typically has a larger amount of volume at promotional price points as a result of the annual cash infusion consumers get from tax refunds. This year, a delay of those refunds past the key mid-quarter President's Day shopping period, along with the 2% payroll tax increase have had a negative impact on market demand.","Adjustable bed units declined for the first time in several years with volume down 4% in the first quarter. We expect this to have been a temporary event and should return to unit volume growth in the second quarter.","In carpet underlay, sales grew significantly in the first quarter. Margins in this business unit remain under pressure from rising scrap foam costs and we have implemented price increases to recover these higher costs.","First quarter EBIT and EBIT margins increased versus the first quarter of 2012, primarily from a hurricane insurance gain.","The earnings impact from a unit volume declines in many of the key residential businesses was largely offset by cost improvements and a favorable product mix in U.S. Spring.","The Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, sales -- same-location sales increased 1% in the first quarter. Store Fixtures sales grew 6%, but were largely offset by a 6% decrease in Office Furniture components. We are optimistic about the longer-term view of the office furniture industry, but we expect 2013 volume in this business to be somewhat soft.","EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus the first quarter of 2012, reflecting the absence of last year's divestiture gain, costs associated with programs that will ship in the second quarter, competitive pricing and lower sales of Office Furniture components, which typically have higher margins.","In the Store Fixtures business, some of the programs we initially expected to ship in March were moved to April and have been shipping for the past few weeks. As a result, performance should improve in the second quarter. However, as Matt mentioned in his comments earlier, we will face a very strong third quarter comparison from large programs that shipped last fall.","In the Industrial Materials segment, first quarter same-location sales decreased 7% as slightly higher unit volume was more than offset by lower trade sales at our rod mill and wire and rod price deflation. The decrease in trade sales of steel rod during the quarter was more than offset by an increase in intercompany rod sales and the rod mill continues to run at the 100% capacity utilization. As we've stated in past quarters, the change in the mix of rod sales from trade to inter-company is generally positive to earnings since that change tends to also shift the production mix to higher valued, high carbon rods.","EBIT and EBIT margins for this segment increased during the quarter, primarily due to the absence of last year's acquisition-related costs, cost improvements and higher unit volumes in certain businesses.","In the Specialized Products segment, first quarter same-location sales increased slightly. Sales growth in Commercial Vehicle Products was largely offset by lower machinery volume. Automotive sales were essentially flat with growth in North America and Asia offset by lower demand in Europe.","EBIT and EBIT margins decreased during the quarter with the impact of a litigation accrual, partially offset by slightly higher sales and cost improvements. Automotive industry forecast project low to mid-single-digit growth in both North America and Asia this year and low single-digit declines in Europe. These forecasts aggregate to global growth of 2% for the year. With content gains, we expect to outperform this industry growth rate.","With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave.","David S. Haffner","Thank you, Karl and Matt, for those comments. As shareholders ourselves, we are pleased with the company's performance since making the strategic change a few years ago. We continue to focus on the multiple levers that influence total shareholder return, including profitable growth and margin enhancement. We demonstrated that focus in 2012 with the very attractive Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition in addition to meaningful margin increases that we realized. Our guidance anticipates additional margin expansion this year with an implied midpoint EBIT margin of approximately 10%, which, if achieved, would be the highest in over 10 years. While pleased with the progress, we're still not content with this level of performance. To further our focus on value generation, this year we've implemented additional initiatives to enhance profitable growth and EBITDA margins.","And in closing, I'll repeat my initial comment. We're confident that as the overall consumer and housing markets recover, Leggett & Platt will realize corresponding benefits.","And with those comments, I'll turn the call back over to David DeSonier.","David M. DeSonier","That concludes our prepared remarks. We thank you for your attention, and we'll be glad to try to answer your questions. [Operator Instructions].","Claudia, we're ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","This is Josh Borstein in for David MacGregor. On the adjustable foundations, you had mentioned this was the first time you had seen a decline. Was the -- 2012 had been up year-over-year. You said it was temporary, expect growth back in 2Q. Could you discuss a little bit what went on and what you saw to have that decline?","Karl G. Glassman","Yes, Josh. This is Karl. The first and second periods, January and February, sales were significantly softer than we had experienced in the past. Some of that is most probably embedded in the results of one of our large customers. Select Comfort's been very open that their volume was off in the first quarter. They have also said, and we can certainly confirm, that their volume recovered in March. Our adjustable bed business was up 8% in March. It continues to be strong in April. So while Select is a very, very important customer to us, they're not our only customer. The market was significantly impacted by the softness that we experienced across the whole bedding industry in January and February.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, great. And then just one follow-up. On the Comfort Cores, again some nice performance there. When do you expect to anniversary the easy comps with your Comfort Cores?","Karl G. Glassman","Perry, why don't you go ahead and take that one?","Perry E. Davis","Josh, I really don't expect to anniversary -- the category itself just continues to grow beyond any of our other product categories within the bedding group. Although we may see some slight reduction in the rate of growth over this year, but we really anticipate that product category to perform well beyond any of the other product categories for the bedding group.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And I know a lot of those Comfort Cores they'll go into the iSeries, but can you offer maybe the percentage of the Comfort Cores that go into iSeries as opposed to some of the other products. I'm just trying to get a sense for the breadth of customers that you have for that product.","Susan R. McCoy","All right, Josh, we don't -- this is Susan, obviously. We don't get quite that specific with any of our product line details to go to the customer level.","Karl G. Glassman","But we would probably say that the product is extremely broadly placed. The iSeries product line's important, but the product is being utilized by a number of different manufacturers as they all grow their hybrid offerings.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Questions on the commercial segments on the Store Fixtures, you're looking at some business from J.C. Penney last year. If you could just give us sort of an update on what that's going to look like moving forward and specifically what kind of comp you're going up against in the third quarter on that?","Karl G. Glassman","Okay, Keith. This is Karl. The new CEO of J.C. Penney, Mr. Ullman, has made it very clear that they were going to continue to release all programs that they had envisioned at least through the end of this second quarter. We're in the process of shipping a good bit of that product now. At this point, based on POs in the hand and commitments that we have, we would expect that the 2013 J.C. Penney-related Store Fixtures volume would be very close, if not slightly exceed, the demand that we saw in 2012. But a warning, remember that what was very heavy weighted to the third quarter of last year will be more equally spread through this year. But the heavy shipping period is right now with second quarter being the high point.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on Residential, what's sort of your outlook in the furniture and spring sales for the next quarter or 2 based on what your customers are telling you?","Perry E. Davis","Keith, this is Perry. I'll take that question. Right now, after having just completed the High Point Market earlier this week, the overall attitude amongst our customers, I would say, is good. If you turn to the furniture side, most all of the major players that were representative -- represented at the market reported their order writing was brisk. A lot of new programs rolling out this year. We continue to see an upgrade in the product category. More and more product from the furniture side empowered motion. So the outlook amongst the furniture group was positive. As to bedding, although the first quarter was a little bit lackluster, we think for a variety of the reasons that Karl mentioned with the delayed tax refund situation and also a tax increase to hit in the first quarter, that outlook also is up. It seems to have a little lift over prior periods. In fact, over the last 4 weeks, I can report that our innerspring shipments are slightly up about 2% year-on-year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Baugh with Stifel.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, the first question is could you just address the annual sales guidance? Actually, I think you raised the lower end slightly, kept the higher end the same. And I guess the question is the first quarter was certainly below my model and I think most others on the Street. Was it on plan with your internal model or is there something, if it wasn't, that you're more optimistic now about the rest of the year?","David S. Haffner","Yes, John, this is Dave. It was fairly close to our internal expectation. We had not planned on a litigation expense, but -- and we realize that people develop their models differently and so we're certainly aren't critical of consensus being different than what our internal numbers are. It's just that the quarterly forecast that we had and some of those that were out there were different. We're very close to what we expected to see happen.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you mentioned litigation, that was my follow-up. Could you just give us a little color on what happened there?","David S. Haffner","Yes, it has to do with a product that we developed several years ago having to do with some semiautomatic stapling of some foundation products. And while we feel comfortable that our design was novel, there were some other people that felt that it wasn't. And we certainly respect other people's intellectual property. And as a result of a ruling, which resulted in a $5 million penalty, we went ahead and booked that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Herb Hardt with Monness, Crespi and Hardt.","Herbert Hardt - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","If your stock would go back to where it was at the beginning of last quarter, down to $26 or $27, what kind of adjustment would there be in SG&A?","Matthew C. Flanigan","Herb, well, there are a lot of -- this is Matt. There are a lot of moving parts, of course, that go in that calculation. But assuming that our relative performance went down as well compared to the peer group, of course, in essence that we would be the one having that pullback versus the rest of that peer group, then we would largely clawback almost all of that incremental expense that appeared here in the first quarter. Again, it's quite a complicated calculation per GAAP. But sure enough, it would cough up quite a bit of accrual that is currently now maxed out.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Moore with CJS Securities.","Daniel Moore - CJS Securities, Inc.","If we look back to prior housing recessions and recoveries, do bedding and furniture tend to lag recovery and housing starts? And if so, generally by how long?","Karl G. Glassman","Dan, this is Karl. Yes, there is certainly a lag. I need to take out the housing recovery of 2004, '05 and '06 because it was truly an outlier of anything that we've seen in the past. There was more speculation and more people in homes that, as we've seen retrospectively, couldn't afford those homes so they weren't fully furnished. So that we were criticized in the market or certainly questioned as housing was booming during that time frame, how come we weren't seeing a significant uplift in bedding and furniture sales. And like I said, we found out the consumer couldn't afford the house, much less the furnishings. So going prior to that, there's generally a lag of about 6 months to 1 year. As housing recovers, there's a higher correlation actually in consumer confidence. So as housing recovers, consumer becomes more confident, jobs are gained at a greater rate. And all of that rolls together in above-average GDP growth in the recoveries of those businesses. Knowing also that post any economic downturn because those -- the purchases of those products are deferrable, there is a little bit of pent-up demand and we believe that it's out there and we've yet to experience it.","David S. Haffner","Daniel, this is Dave. I think you probably know, we all know that the supply of available homes has fallen very significantly this past year and that's a good thing for companies like Leggett & Platt because if it takes 5 to 7 months now to gobble up the rest of that inventory, construction obviously is recommencing and there is this correlation between new housing and furniture and bedding. So that's one of the reasons I reiterated my statement of confidence as we see that recovery continue, we know that Leggett and many other companies that are associated with the housing market are going to feel the benefit of that.","Daniel Moore - CJS Securities, Inc.","And as a quick follow-up, much of the gains we've seen so far in the multi-family arena, what's the ratio of the benefit to Leggett of an uplift in multi-family versus, say, single-family housing starts?","Karl G. Glassman","Dan, we don't have that statistic. It's more tightly correlated, again, to consumer confidence than it is to housing. Housing moves are important, but it's probably only 30% of our demand. Remember, most of our products are replacement oriented. So I just don't know that data point, I apologize.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Dan Stolper with Wells Fargo.","Herbert Buchbinder","This is Herb Buchbinder. Can you comment on the aerospace business? I don't see any mention of how their sales did. Hopefully, they're still growing.","Karl G. Glassman","Herb, this is Karl again. Yes, they continued to grow. We're very pleased with the progression of that business. That acquisition, Western Pneumatic, is performing better than we originally had forecasted and the imputed growth rates are better than we expected a year ago now. We're very pleased.","Herbert Buchbinder","Is there any acquisitions possible in that area? Or if you do something, it probably would not be in aerospace?","David S. Haffner","Herb, this is Dave. The answer is yes to the first question. We're looking at multiple opportunities, none of them great big, extraordinarily large. But we're looking at some businesses that would enhance the offering that we have for the current customer mix that we have. So we're not in a position to give specific details because of confidentiality arrangements. But as you know, and we talked about, the interest we had in not just making one acquisition but trying to grow a business group and that's exactly what we're doing. So stand by, if you will, and hopefully in the not-too-distant future, we'll have something to talk about in that regard.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","Josh Borstein again. Just on the Office Furniture business, sales declined there 6%, which seems somewhat a bit counter to recent numbers and commentary coming out of the Office Furniture names. Was there any share loss in that number? Is it temporary? Or is there any additional commentary you can offer to help us understand what's going on in that part of the business?","Karl G. Glassman","No, Josh, there certainly wasn't any share loss. The sales were softer in January and February than they were in March. We're very pleased with the programs that we have in place that will be launched at NeoCon here in a couple of months. And our current forecast show that, that business will be flat to slightly up the remainder of the year. It was just first quarter macro market weakness that was probably correlated to some of the softness that our customers are experiencing in the government area.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then just on the tariff protection from your innersprings from the Chinese coils, I think they come up for rollover, I believe, in 2014. First, is that assumption correct? And if so, do you expect that tariff protection to be extended?","Karl G. Glassman","Go ahead, Perry.","Perry E. Davis","Yes, it does come up for a sunset review. We're already working on that issue. We expect that decision to be reaffirmed.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from the line of John Baugh with Stifel.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, could you give us just a little help on a couple of things, expectations on LIFO for the year, where the share count might shake out with the increased exercise?","Matthew C. Flanigan","This is Matt, John. LIFO, we see it being relatively modest throughout the rest of the year. I mean, I don't think you'll see -- we don't know yet for sure, of course, but we don't see some dramatic swings, a total of $10 million for the full year. And then relative to share count, don't quite know in terms of the option exercise. By the end of the year, we would expect to have issued both through benefit plans and stock option exercise around the 4, maybe a little more than that, million share count such that at the end of the year, obviously this will be based upon how many shares we also buy back during the year, but we should be somewhere between 146, 147 or thereabouts.","Susan R. McCoy","That's the diluted share count.","Matthew C. Flanigan","Yes, fully diluted.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So you would expect -- because I think you ended last year at 146, it's a very slight increase maybe?","Matthew C. Flanigan","Although again, we'll be mindful of our share repurchase activity during the year as well, of course, and hope to have [indiscernible] to spend those dollars. But if we don't, we'll look to step up our share repurchase activity as well.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Two other quickies. There was a reference to competitive pricing in the commercial segment. If you could discuss that and then also some strength in CVP and maybe discuss why that occurred and the outlook for the remainder of the year there.","Karl G. Glassman","I'll deal with the CVP issue first. That business is very, very cyclical; not so much seasonal, but cyclical. It's based on programs and there were a number of large programs that went through in the first quarter. So we were pleased with the demand there. As it relates to pricing pressure, that was really a Store Fixtures comment, not an Office comment. And as that business is seasonally weak in the first quarter, there's a number of us that are hunting for volume. So there was some pricing pressure there.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Daniel Moore with CJS Securities.","Daniel Moore - CJS Securities, Inc.","Focusing on Residential Furnishings, EBIT margin improved 50 bps despite the 1% revenue decline. Could you perhaps break that out between cost control and operational efficiency versus mix? And do you see the favorable mix shift being sustained through the remainder of the year?","Matthew C. Flanigan","It will have to do with some product mix obviously in some of the bedding products.","Susan R. McCoy","Let me just mention first, we don't have -- we're not going to provide a specific detail relative to the cost versus the mix. Both our contributing favorably. The mix issue is what, I think, Karl and Perry have both discussed relative to the growth of Comfort Core. But both are favorable. Both are likely going to continue to help us in the coming quarters.","David S. Haffner","Yes, and I might add -- Perry, sorry to get in front of you here. But Daniel, one of the things that will likely cause an improvement in those margins that volume, which we expect to see an uptick in volume, and obviously, we've got fixed costs that are observed over whatever volume we have. So if that volume picks up, we're going to see contribution margins pick up in both Residential and bedding.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from Herb Hardt with Monness, Crespi and Hardt.","Herbert Hardt - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","Do you have any comments on the overseas business? You have some modest exposure there.","Karl G. Glassman","Actually, Herb, thank you for asking that question. We'd probably surprise some listeners to know that our European spring business was actually up strongly in the first quarter. The units were up 5%. The mix was good. We're pleased with that business. We made comment that the European automotive business was soft. That is really a year-on-year comp issue and that we were a little surprised that the demand held as strong as it did in the first half of last year and then really fell off in the back half. So we'll anniversary that comp. Asian demand continues to be very, very good in automotive, less strong in the residential side, mostly impacted by that softness in our promotional price point volume.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Fred Speece with Speece Thorson Capital.","Fred H. Speece - Speece Thorson Capital Group Inc.","What's your calculation of the incremental margin for this quarter? And what's your guidance for the midpoint assume?","Susan R. McCoy","Fred, I think we're coming close for the full year up to the 30% contribution margin that we've talked about. I mean, obviously, 25% to 35% continues to be our range. We've, at the midpoint of the guidance, have a very good strong contribution margin contributing there. Obviously, that's mix-sensitive. It matters where volume comes from. But as we peel the layers back, we would expect that somewhere in and around that sort of 30% range is close to what we were able to deliver in the quarter.","David S. Haffner","Fred, good to hear your voice. This is Dave. One thing you might be interested in and some of the other listeners may have an interest in it. As you know, we monitor our capacity utilization by business unit and each one of the business unit managers and segment heads, and Karl specifically really look over this closely, and so we still -- we're in the low 60% average utilizations. Those vary. There are some, they go all the way up to 100% like at the rod mill. But we're seeing some improvement in this utilization, which you would expect as our overall demand goes up. But we still have plenty of room. So depending upon mix, is that $400 million, $450 million, $500 million worth of incremental sales at that margin that Susan is suggesting? We think so. So not a lot of capital expenditure requirements for capacity are going to be needed here for at least another $400 million worth of top line.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing remarks.","David S. Haffner","We thank you for participation, and we'll talk to you again next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

Thank you. You may begin.","David DeSonier","Good morning and thank you for taking part in Leggett & Platt\u2019s third quarter conference call. With me this morning are the following: Karl Glassman, who is President and CEO of the company; Matt Flanigan, our Executive Vice President and CFO; and Susan McCoy, our VP of Investor Relations.

For the full year, we continue to expect record earnings per share from continuing operations, strong EBIT margins and a significant improvement in operating cash flow. Third quarter sales decreased 6% to $949 million, with 4% of the reduction due to four small divestitures completed in the past 12 months, same location sales were down 2% from slightly lower unit volume, raw material related price decreases and currency impact.","Our third quarter EBIT decreased versus third quarter last year primarily reflecting a lower year-over-year benefit from commodity deflation and lower unit volume. Third quarter EBIT margin decreased by 30 basis points compared to the prior year, but it was stronger than expected at 13.7%.","Third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.67 or flat with the same quarter last year. The EBIT decrease was offset in the quarter by a lower effective tax rate related to the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation and a reduced share account, both of which were in line with forecast. Given our third quarter results and lower current commodity costs, we have increased our full year EPS guidance on a lower sales outlook. Matt will discuss our 2016 guidance in a few minutes.","Last month that at Investor Day, we outlined our TSR framework, including an expectation for long-term revenue growth of 69%. We believe the macro environment driven by consumer confidence, housing, employment, wages and interest rates should support modest revenue growth in our end markets over the next few years. In addition, we continue to focus on content gains and new program awards across our businesses and therefore expect to continue growing organically at a rate faster than our markets. Strategic acquisitions are also expected to add to long-term growth.","Margin expansion and share repurchases should contribute modestly to long-term TSR and our commitment to dividend growth is unwavering. In short, we remain fully committed to our longstanding goal of achieving TSR that ranks in the top third of the S&P 500.","Now to the segments. In residential furnishings, third quarter same location sales were down 8%, unit volume decreased 6% and raw material related price deflation and currency reduced sales by 2%. Lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds represented 3% of the unit volume decrease. Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories excluding deflation and currency were as follows; U.S. Spring component dollar sales decreased 6%. Innerspring units decreased 7% and boxspring unit volume was down 9%. Comfort core units decreased 2% during the quarter.","International spring sales decreased 3%, furniture component sales were down 5% with sales in the seat and sofa sleeper businesses down 7% and motion hardware unit volume down 2%. The segments EBIT decreased slightly in the quarter with the impact from lower unit volume largely offset by pricing discipline. EBIT margin improved impart to the lower adjustable bed pass-through sales.","In the commercial product segment, third quarter same location sales decreased 4%, growth in work furniture was more than offset by lower sales and adjustable bed with those units down 10% during the quarter. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin decreased slightly, primarily from lower volume.","In the industrial material segment, third quarter same location sales were down 8% from steel related price decreases and lower unit volume in Drawn Wire. Total sales also decreased versus the prior year from two divestitures. The first was the steel tubing business that we sold in late 2015 and the second was the small wire products operation that we sold in the second quarter. The segments EBIT decreased slightly in the quarter, primarily from lower unit volume. EBIT margin improved a 110 basis points to 9% impart from divesting lower margin businesses.","And the specialized product segment, third quarter same location sales increased 6% from continued strength in automotive, excluding minor currency changes automotive sales grew 14%, machinery sales decreased 5% and aerospace same location sales were down 9% in the quarter. The segments EBIT grew and EBIT margin improved a 150 basis points primarily from higher volume and currency benefits.","I'll now turn the call over to Matt.","Matt Flanigan","Thanks, Karl, and good morning, everyone.","Cash from operations was once again strong during the quarter at $124 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $200 million to $386 million. Operating cash flow continues to benefit from working capital management. We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales at 10.8%.","With strong year-to-date performance through the third quarter, we now expect full year cash from operations to exceed $525 million. As uses of cash for the full year, dividend should require about $175 million and capital expenditure should approximate $125 million.","In August, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share, which represents a 6.3% increase versus the third quarter of 2015. Our target range for dividend payout is 50% to 60% of net earnings. Actual payout has been higher until last year, but with our strong earnings growth we are now within the targeted payout range. Accordingly, future dividend growth should more closely align with earnings growth.","At yesterday's closing price of $44.39, the current yield is 3.1%, which is one of the higher yields among the 50 companies that comprise the S&P 500 dividend aristocrats. During the third quarter, we've repurchased 500,000 of our stock at an average price of $52.77 and issued 800,000 shares through employee benefit plans and option exercises. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 4.2 million shares at an average price of $46.47 and issued 2.2 million shares.","As has been our practice, after funding capital expenditures and dividends, the remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantage acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must meet stringent strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. However, no specific repurchase commitment or time table has been established.","Our financial base remains very strong and this gives us considerable flexibility, when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the third quarter with net debt to net capital at 36% well within our longstanding targeted range of 30% to 40%. We also monitored debt-to-EBITDA. At the end of September our debt was 1.7 times, our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA.","We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of pure companies on a rolling three-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top one third of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. For the three-year period that will end on December 31, 2016, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 17% per year. That performance places us within the top 14% of the S&P 500.","As we announced yesterday, we are raising our 2016 EPS guidance. We now expect record full year earnings from continuing operations of $2.55 to $2.62 per share versus our prior EPS range of $2.45 to $2.60. Full year guidance now anticipates 2016 sales of approximately $3.75 billion or a 4% decrease from 2015. This assumes approximately 2%-unit volume growth offset by a 3% reduction from divestitures net of small acquisitions and a 3% decrease from commodity deflation and currency. Prior guidance anticipates sales of approximately $3.9 billion on mid-single digit unit volume growth and slightly less impact from commodity deflation. Our implied fourth quarter EPS guidance range is now $0.53 to $0.60 on sales of approximately $900 million.","We expect to close the year with strong margin performance based upon our guidance range the full year adjusted EBIT margin should be between 13.3% and 13.7%. The two main changes in our full year EPS guidance are one, the lower expected level of unit volume growth and two, an offsetting benefit from lower than expected steel prices, both of which were also reflected in our strong third quarter EPS performance.","In our July forecast, we assume that the second quarter steel cost inflation withhold through the remainder of the year. Therefore, our prior guidance reflected short-term earnings and margin pressure from the typical pricing lag associated with pass no long hard cost, instead of inflation holding market prices for certain types of steel actually began to deflate as the third quarter progressed.","Our updated full year EPS guidance now assumes less benefit from unit volume growth, but that impact has offset by lower commodity cost.","With those comments, I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to David DeSonier.","David DeSonier","That concludes our prepared remarks. We thank you for your attention and we will be glad to answer your questions. In order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate, we request that you ask only one question and then yield to the next participant. If you have additional questions you are welcome to reenter the queue and we will answer those questions as well. Melissa, we are ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from the line of Dan Moore with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Moore","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Susan McCoy","Hi, Dan.","Perry Davis","Dan.","Daniel Moore","I wanted to just drill down on residential furnishing volumes a little bit maybe give us a little bit more color over the last few months obviously decelerated is it simply tough comp do you see the consumer pulling back a little bit or was it more primarily office in commercial maybe just a little bit more color around the trends that you\u2019re seeing there?","Perry Davis","Yeah, Dan, this is Perry Davis, so I think it\u2019s a little bit of combination of both. Things are a little bit tough at retail just was at the high point furniture market over the weekend and that was generally the mood of that although in the fracture business there seems to be a little momentum building right now, but it has been kind of a tough slot there.","In bedding, we really do have some tough comps last year as an example we reported here a 2% drop in our comfort core volume, which had been on a pretty much a tear for the last couple of years. We\u2019re kind of lapping some strong numbers last year and if you look at the increase in comfort core in the third quarter of \u201815 as opposed to the third quarter of \u201814 we were up 37% so being down to here, well that\u2019s now where we want to be obviously, it\u2019s still indicative of some of the retail comps that we have.","Daniel Moore","One quick follow-up perhaps just wanted to talk a little bit about 2017 in your analyst day you gave a three year TSR guidance range in terms of high single-digit or I should say earnings guidance range in terms of high single-digit CAGR, next year you\u2019ve got perhaps tax braids normalized a bit higher, maybe a little bit more LIFO headwind if steel picks up. How should we think about \u201817 as it relates to that kind of longer term guidance?","Susan McCoy","Dan, we\u2019ll talk about our 2017 guidance when we get to the end of January and we release on the full year. You touched on a couple of the independent variables to think about, we don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll have sustained inflation that at some point, we would expect to encounter some and that would typically give us a little bit of short term margin headwind that we've had to deal with for a while.","Our tax rate this year 25% is probably lower than where we will end next year something in the 27, 28 range would be a reasonable place to start thinking about and you'll remember that we also last quarter had sixth sense of unusual things that they are embedded in this 2.35 to 2.62 continuing up in the guidance and so from there it goes to top-line and like I said, we\u2019ll create some framework around that after we get enough the quarter behind this, get a better look at forecasts and try to get a feel for where we think next year will go.","Understand that the 2019 framework that we put out there, as I know you do, is clearly a bit longer-term and the comments that Karl had in his prepaid remark. We still feel good about kind of the macro backdropping supportive of reasonable health in our markets and the things that we\u2019ve been doing on the content front in auto and bedding and category growth and adjustable and the things other things that we highlighted at Investor Day, we still have confident in our ability to make those things happen over the next two to three years.","Daniel Moore","Great colors, thank you. I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. Could you talk about within the merger and mattress components the coming the piece of the business in the quarter and but any update you can give us in October in terms of where trends are going month a day?","Karl Glassman","Keith, there was a quarter generally the revenue lot of fluctuation between particular periods in the quarter, it was pretty much evenly spread over that period of time. Looking at current business through the first three weeks of October, our business is flat to just slightly up compared to year ago. If you look at our bedding business in Europe, currently we have been successful in taking some share there and I think in a market there is a little bit sluggish track right now, we - the first three weeks have been up healthy on that. So, I think right now from a comparison standpoint we\u2019ll holding our own with last year, don\u2019t obviously, we\u2019re early end of the quarter so it will yet to be seeing how that plays out.","Keith Hughes","Is that in the furniture market, you would say that not to put words in your mouth that the thing seems to be reasonably strong to your comments regarding the highpoint, that things are less bad.","Karl Glassman","Yes, we saw although I wasn't particularly impressed with the attendance in high point. It seems like our furniture customers were happy with the order writing they were doing. We obviously have - had some opportunities there that we spoke about it in Investor Day with some content gains with things like tilt head and lumbars and things like that so, that all bodes well for us, but it does seem like there has been a bit of a step change in the pace for furniture, which we normally would kind of expect this time a year.","Keith Hughes","So, that\u2019s last comment through October, is that both mattress and furniture or is that a mix of both?","Karl Glassman","Well, I was referring specifically to bedding on the first three weeks of October, but furniture would be probably outpacing that just a little bit right now.","Keith Hughes","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lee [ph] with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. I want to talk a little bit about what pricing looks like going forward with the recent steel inflation and the Susan I know you just said you expect steel inflation at some point, what does that mean for pricing going forward?","Karl Glassman","This is Karl. Steel is really tough for us to forecast. Susan\u2019s commentary on an expectation of ultimate inflation is kind of steeped in the thought process that it can\u2019t go much lower at this point, that we had a little bit of head fake on steel, where scrap traded up little north of $50 a ton in the second quarter. We expected that there would inflation off of that. It did not take place actually scrap traded down about $20 a ton in September and now $20 in October.","So, there is a little bit of softness. At the current price of scrap, scrap probably won't be collected, so hopefully into 2017 that there'll be a resurgence in demand, there'll be an equalization of pricing. As odd as it sounds, we badly want inflation that admittedly there is a 90-day lag on pass-through. While we appreciate the short-term margins that we booked in the third quarter of this year, we want inflation, we need inflation and we expect it to some degree next year, but to predict timing is a real challenge.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bud Bugatch [ph] with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Bobby Griffin","Good morning, everyone. This is Bobby filling in for Bud, I appreciate you guys taking my questions.","Susan McCoy","Hi, Bobby.","Bobby Griffin","I just want to touch real quick on the adjustable base business, I believe this is kind of - I think believe it\u2019s a second quarter in a row, units were down, is that just a function of tougher comps maybe some competition in the lower price point, or you see changing consumer behavior and some pressure in attachment rates?","Matt Flanigan","Bobby, actually all those things, that as you know that comp was tough, adjustables were up 55% in 3Q 2015. Some of that was a pull forward by large customer of ours that was about go through and ERP implementation, so they pull forward some 4Q 2015 volume into 3Q 2015. So, that made that comp, that comp that much tougher.","There is no question that we\u2019re been impacted by soft market demand. We are also going through a conversion of adjustables been sold through OEM mattress manufacturers and taking out that inefficiency and now being sold directly to retail.","So, therefore you should see significantly fewer adjustable sold through the residential side of the business which as the commentary previous stated that those as you know, those were just pass-through sales, had very little margin impact.","On the residential side, but certainly there were a lot of sales dollars associated with that. The product is manufactured and the commercial segment will now primarily be sold out of the commercial segment and we\u2019re going through this transition where we\u2019re ramping down inventories at the OEM side, ramping up inventories at the direct-to-retail.","So, mix that altogether, we have not lot share by the way if the low end you made reference there, that there is no question that AUSPs are dropping on adjustables which is probably a good thing for the business from a long-term perspective and that it means longer term there\u2019ll be more unit sold. But we are not disadvantaged it in that equation.","Bobby Griffin","Given that the AUSPs are dropping as you reference, have you seen attachment rates start to pick up at the lower end of the mattress industry, the sub 1,000 mattresses.","Matt Flanigan","Yes, there is no question that there is a pickup at the lower end and there probably is a little bit of softness at the ultra-premium and that ultra-premium consumer is probably a little bit of little cautious and I would think that the way you heard on Tempur\u2019s call yesterday that they made reference to the fact that their attach rates were less at premium price points. We are seeing that across the market.","Bobby Griffin","Good, I appreciate the color. And then maybe lastly for me. At the Investor Day, we saw some exciting things with Quantum Edge and Micro Cores inside the bedding division, can you maybe update us on how the penetration is going for those items and maybe what the kind of - what we might see in next year for some of those?","Matt Flanigan","Bob, you\u2019re really becoming the bedding guy, I appreciate the fact that you - was exciting because he is just really excited, but anyway go it Perry.","Perry Davis","Bob it\u2019s - we are seeing some pretty steady growth on the upholstery layer replacement side of our business, which is basically our nano coils and our soft-tex tac products the lower height pocket springs that we manufacture. Quantum Edge is - I really I am excited about I think as we get into next year I believe that we will see that pace really quick and that obviously, ad gives us content gains. It also will affect our average unit selling price going forward that\u2019ll be a little bit of a disconnect there where we are now but we think there is some really strong introductions going to happen in the part - and we\u2019re excited about being able to replace a lot of that form edge with spring products.","Bobby Griffin","I appreciate the color. Best of luck in the fourth quarter.","Matt Flanigan","Thank you, Bobby.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dillard Watt with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Dillard Watt","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Only if you can talk a little bit about the aerospace business, it\u2019s I guess two quarters in a row here where we are negative. Anything in particular going on or is it just some lumpy orders.","Matt Flanigan","No, Dillard, actually we\u2019re experiencing some softness in our welded tube business, the straight tube business, which was the first acquisition Western where there is a little reduction in selling price and candidly we have lost a little bit of market share. In the seamless to the French business that that business is performing really, really well as is the value-added businesses that we added subsequent bolt on acquisitions. So, it's the original base business where we're experiencing some softness. The market is lumpy overtime, but two quarters in a row I can't blame on lumpiness.","Dillard Watt","Thank you very much.","Karl Glassman","Thanks, Dillard.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Hughes","Thanks. Just wanted to drill down a little bit on Karl on your discussion on the adjustables. Specific to Leggett, are you having any shifts of your customers, accounts you've won or accounts you\u2019ve lost things of that nature. And also, just, do you expect overall the price point of an adjustables to continue to fall, I think that's what you're saying. And does that mean some of the functionality in adjustables will go away.","Karl Glassman","Yeah, Keith, thanks for the questions. Yes, there are the customer wins and losses all the time, especially as we migrate, the industry migrates from predominantly distributed through OEM to predominantly distributed through retail. So, there is those shifts. And the magnitude of volume through each channel changing pretty significantly.","Interestingly enough as the product is decreasing or let's call it more fully penetrated in terms of units and price points, the features aren't changing all that much that as you drop into the promotional price points historically that would be a wired bed, it's a wireless product today. The head-only product hasn't sold significant well, so as electronics, the cost of electronics dropped, the significant volume growth from the macro market in terms of throughput through assets that the consumer is not losing much functionality as the pricing at retail drops.","Keith Hughes","And just one other question on bedding the comfort core negative 2% kind a looking like the industry right now or it been well outperformed or do you think those kinds a hit at the top in terms of this market shift?","Perry Davis","No, Keith, it's Perry, I don't. We're in the mid-30s now as far as percentage of springs that we sale that are in the company four categories. We have the base among ourselves as to how strong it will get in the U.S. market. But I certainly think we got opportunities to go kind a well north of 40 some people say to be 50% in the future. But I don't think we're by any means done with the growth of that category and like I said just a little bit ago. I don't think we're we've scratch the surface with the content gain that we look to gain over the next couple of years.","Keith Hughes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Mr. DeSonier, there are no further questions at this time, I'd like to turn the floor back to you for any final remarks.","David DeSonier","We'll just quickly close by saying, thank you. We appreciate your time and we'll talk to you again in about three months.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David DeSonier Senior Vice President Strategy and Investor Relations. Thank you, sir, you may begin.","David DeSonier","Good morning and thank you for taking part in Leggett & Platt's first quarter conference call. I'm Dave DeSonier and with me today are the following; Dave Haffner, our Board Chair and CEO; Karl Glassman, who is President and Chief Operating Officer; Matt Flanigan, our Executive VP and CFO and Susan McCoy, our VP of Investor Relations.","The agenda for our call this morning is as follows; Dave Haffner will start with a summary of the major statements we made in yesterday's press release; Karl Glassman will provide segment highlights; Matt Flanigan will discuss financial details and address our outlook for 201; and finally, the group will answer any questions that you have. Jack Crusa, who is Senior Vice President of the company and President of the Specialized Products and Industrial Materials Segments, is also joining us this morning to participate in the Q&A.","This conference is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material. This call may not be transcribed, recorded or broadcast without our express permission. A replay is available from the IR portion of Leggett's website.","We posted to the IR portion of the website a set of PowerPoint slides that contain summary financial information, along with segment details. Those slides supplement the information on this call, including non-GAAP reconciliation.","I need to remind you that remarks today concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results or events may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the section in our 10-K entitled forward-looking statements.","I'll now turn the call over to Dave Haffner.","Dave Haffner","Good morning and thank you for participating in our call. Yesterday, we reported record first quarter results from continuing operations and are very pleased to have maintained the strong performance with which we ended 2014.","Sales increased 10% in the first quarter from a combination of strong unit volume growth and acquisitions. Currency translation impacts and raw material-related price decreases offset a portion of these gains.","We continued to benefit from the shift in bedding to Comfort Core springs, new adjustable bed programs that ramped up last year and ongoing content gains and new program awards in automotive. Importantly, nearly all of our businesses experienced volume growth in the first quarter.","Earnings per share from continuing operations were also a first quarter record at $0.50 per share, up 32% from the $0.38 per share we earned in the first quarter of 2014. Earnings benefited from strong unit volume growth, pricing discipline and operational improvements in certain businesses, partially offset by a $6-million impairment charge associated with our industrial steel tubing operation.","EBIT increased 30% and EBIT margin improved to 11.6%, up 180 basis points over first quarter last year. We completed one acquisition during the first quarter which is a European private label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial and other settings. This business is complementary to our existing North American private label operation and allows us to support our work furniture customers as they expand globally.","We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on rolling three-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top one-third of the S&P 500 over the long term which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the three-year period that will end on December 31, 2015, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 28% per year which places us in the top 34% of the S&P 500.","Now before Karl comments on the individual segments performance for the quarter, I'd like to take a minute to discuss the change in our segment structure that occurred during the first quarter. Because of the recent divestiture of the majority of the store fixtures business, along with the retirement of Joe Downes, who was the President of the Industrial Materials Segment, our management organizational structure and all related internal reporting changed during the first quarter.","The adjustable bed and fashion bed businesses were moved from residential furnishings to commercial products. The aerospace business was moved from industrial materials to specialized products. And the spiel machinery operation which produces wire-forming equipment, primarily for Leggett's internal use, was moved from specialized products to residential furnishings.","Perry Davis continues as President of Residential Furnishings. Dennis Park continues as President of Commercial Products. Jack Crusa is now President of both Specialized Products and Industrial Materials. We revised the prior-year financial data for each of the segments to allow for comparison with ongoing results. These revisions only affect segment information.","There have been no changes to previously reported consolidated financial statements. You will find all of these details, including an overview of the revised segment structure, on our website and in the 8-K that we filed on April 16th.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman.","Karl Glassman","Thank you, Dave and good morning. Most of our businesses continue to perform extremely well during the first quarter and all four segments posted volume growth. In the residential furnishings segment, first quarter total sales increased 18%. Same location sales increased 10% from strong unit volume growth, partially offset by currency translation impacts.","Excluding acquisitions, U.S. spring component dollar sales increased 14%. Innerspring unit volume grew 15%, with Comfort Core up 66% during the quarter. Box spring unit volume increased 8%.","Sales decreased 3% in international spring, with strong volume growth of 11% more than offset by currency translation impacts. Excluding acquisitions, furniture component sales increased 4% in the first quarter, sales in our seating and sofa sleeper businesses grew 2% and motion hardware unit volume increased 14%. Sales also increased in fabric converting, geo components and carpet cushion.","First quarter segment EBIT increased, with the benefit from higher sales and pricing discipline partially offset by the non-reoccurrence of last year's $4 million building gain. EBIT margin in the quarter also reflected the impact of higher adjustable bed pass-through sales and acquired innerspring facilities, both of which have lower than segment average margins.","In the commercial product segment, first quarter total sales increased 21%, including the work furniture acquisition that Dave mentioned earlier. Same location sales increased 17%, primarily from continued strong demand in adjustable bed. Unit volume in that business increased 87% during the first quarter.","Fashion bed sales grew 7%. Work furniture, same location sales were essentially flat, with 3% volume growth offset by currency translation impact. EBIT and EBIT margin increased modestly in the first quarter due to higher sales.","We're rapidly expanding production capacity in our adjustable bed business to support continued strong demand in that category. Work furniture margins improved slightly versus the prior year, but continue to be well below target levels due to underutilized capacity and poor performance in our Chinese joint venture operation.","In the industrial materials segment, first quarter sales increased 6%, primarily from higher unit volume within our drawn wire operations, driven by strong bedding demand, partially offset by steel-related price decreases. EBIT was flat and EBIT margin decreased slightly, with the benefit from higher unit volume offset by a $6-million impairment charge related to the steel tubing business.","In the specialized product segment, first quarter sales grew 6%. Automotive sales increased 8%, with very strong volume growth of approximately 15%, partially offset by currency translation impact. Modest volume growth in aerospace was more than offset by currency translation for a slight sales decrease in the quarter. Machinery sales were up 5% and CVP sales declined slightly.","The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin grew primarily due to higher volume and operational improvements in several parts of the segment, including aerospace, where we continue to benefit from integration of the European operations that we acquired in 2013.","I'll now turn the call over to Matt Flanigan, who will discuss some of the additional financial details, along with our outlook for 2015.","Matt Flanigan","Thank you, Karl and good morning, everyone. Consistent with our normal seasonality and our internal forecast, operating cash flow in the first quarter was $32 million. Cash flow increased $52 million versus the first quarter of last year, due to higher earnings and a smaller increase in working capital, primarily in accounts receivable.","Adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales was 10.1% at the end of the first quarter. Excluding the litigation accruals that we recorded in 2014 which are included in current liabilities, working capital was a more seasonally normal 12.3% of annualized sales.","In February, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share and extended our record of consecutive, annual dividend increases to 44 years at a compound annual growth rate of 13%. At yesterday's closing price of $42.47 per share, the current yield is 2.9%, one of the highest dividend yields among the 52 companies that comprise the S&P 500 dividend aristocrats. We repurchased 1.5 million shares of our stock in the first quarter at an average price of $44.53 and issued 1.5 million shares, largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises.","Our financial base remains very strong and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the quarter with net debt to net capital at 35.3%, comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%.","For the full-year 2015, we again expect strong unit volume growth which should lead to another year of record earnings per share from continuing operations. As we announced yesterday, we're raising the low end of our prior guidance and now anticipate 2015 earnings from continuing operations of $1.95 to $2.10 per share.","Our expectation for sales is unchanged at $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion. This range represents a 3% to 8% increase versus our reported $3.78 billion of sales in 2014. As was the case in the first quarter, we expect full-year volume growth and acquisitions to be partially offset by currency translation impact and raw material-related price decreases. Based upon this guidance range, we currently expect a full-year EBIT margin between 11% and 11.5% which would be our highest EBIT margin level since the year 2000.","We expect operating cash to exceed $350 million in 2015. Dividends should require about $170 million of cash and capital expenditures should approximate $120 million. We continue to make investments to support growth in businesses and product lines where sales are strong and for efficiency improvement and maintenance.","Our incentive plans emphasize returns on capital which include net fixed assets and working capital. This emphasis, we believe, helps ensure that we're efficiently utilizing our asset base and investing capital dollars where the highest return potential exists.","As has been our practice, after funding dividends and capital expenditures, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must meet stringent strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the Board of Directors to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year.","No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. However, we currently expect to repurchase between 3 million and 5 million shares in 2015 and issue approximately 3 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans and option exercises.","With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave Haffner.","Dave Haffner","Thank you, Matt. It truly was an exceptional quarter and a great start to what we believe will be a very noteworthy year. Now, because we know that many of our employees, themselves shareholders, listen diligently to these conference calls, I want to sincerely thank them for their continued efforts.","This shoutout is for you and the commitment to with which you go about executing your respective duties. All of you are very important elements in the makeup of this global enterprise. Thank you all very, very much.","I'll now turn the call back over to David DeSonier.","David DeSonier","That concludes our prepared remarks. We thank you for your attention and we will be glad to answer your questions. In order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate, we request that you ask one question and then yield to the next participant. If you have additional questions, you are welcome to reenter the queue and we will answer those questions as well. Jesse, we're ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Bobby filling in for Budd. Thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on another strong quarter. First off, on the innerspring unit growth of 15%, can you please give us a little sense of how that trended during the quarter and maybe what you guys are seeing so far in that business unit quarter to date here in the second quarter?","Karl Glassman","What I'm going to give you is organic growth only and it's on a same number of sales day basis, okay. So it's as pure as the driven snow. January units were up 21%; February units were up 25%; March units up 3%. The interesting thing is through the first three weeks, again organic-only same number of days of sales units are up 19%. So what we're experiencing is the producer's start of their line conversions as they position their floors for Memorial Day.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And was the comparison for March last year something notable in there to cause it to decelerate from February to March?","Karl Glassman","Yes, you'll remember that from an ISPA reported perspective, January and February units last year were negative, slightly flat. We saw a spike because of the weather-related issues, so the comps became more difficult in March. The comps for April actually aren't particularly easy, so we're really heartened by this 19%. Again, it's only three weeks, but it's feeling pretty darn good.","Unidentified Analyst","And then lastly, Karl in your comments you called out adding capacity to the adjustable base business. Can you maybe give a sense or a little bit additional color on how that expansion's going and maybe what time frame until the capacity is added all the way?","Karl Glassman","Yes, we historically have produced adjustable beds almost exclusively in North America and in a large facility in Georgetown, Kentucky that has been well exceeding its theoretic maximum capacity for quite some time. So what we did is we greenfielded a facility in the first quarter in Juarez, Mexico that's adjacent to our current automotive facility.","Derisking the start-up of that operation, the automotive people have operated a very nice, very successful facility for a number of years. So they're managing the production of that product and then shipping it across the border to El Paso where the adjustable bed folks take possession.","So the facility is in production. It's ahead of its pro forma. We also have started a relatively small facility here in Joplin; it's more associated with initial production of new product runs. So it's allowing us to run all of our R&D launches into a production environment before we put them into the two larger manufacturing facilities which historically we've had to do that in Georgetown.","So we feel good. It's pressured margins a little bit in the first quarter, but with the significant growth of adjustables which we expect to continue, that it was a prudent move and probably a little bit past due.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Josh Borstein with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Borstein","Just on the $6 million impairment charge in the industrial segment for steel tubing, could you go over that a little bit?","Dave Haffner","Yes, I think I'll start. Matt you might want to comment, too. But Josh, good morning, this is Dave. What we effectively did was took a look at the fair value of that business and went through very normal accounting protocol and determined that there was a significant portion of that $6 million associated with standard goodwill impairment. What it also does, Josh, is more closely aligns the value on our books to the likely proceeds that we will get from disposition of that business. Matt, can you --","Matt Flanigan","Yes, Josh a little specificity. The goodwill piece of the $6 million number was about $4 million of it and you will find it in our held for sale on our balance sheet as you see it reported.","Josh Borstein","Okay. So excluding that, margins in that business would have been around 12.5%. Is that the right way to think about the run rate for the business in terms of margins?","Susan McCoy","Josh, your percentage looks a little different than ours because you're calculating that just on the external sales and not on the total sales. I think we still believe there's some room for the margins there to improve.","Josh Borstein","Okay. So adjusting for that, what's a better margin run rate to look at for that business? Or what would this quarter have looked like excluding that?","Susan McCoy","It'd be around 7%s as we look at it. And for the full year with everything that's going on, something in that ballpark would probably be a reasonable place to think about its margins.","Josh Borstein","And then, Susan, just given the new reporting structure, can you give us the guidance at the midpoint, what the guidance implies for each segment?","Susan McCoy","Yes, for margins for residential, I would think something in the 9 to 10 range. For commercial and industrial both, probably in that 6 to 7 range and for specialized, somewhere in the mid-teens. Relative to sales growth and again, this is on segments total sales for residential, mid-single-digit order of magnitude growth.","Commercial pipings, industrial, down low single digit, but remember there's some commodity impact that's happening there and then in specialized mid to high single digits. As you would have noticed going through the slides, both residential and specialized have some currency headwinds and who knows what's going to happen between now and the end of the year, but we would expect those likely to continue.","Josh Borstein","And then just one more if I could. Just Karl on scrap costs and wire rod pricing and the spread between the two, could you give us an update there, please.","Karl Glassman","Sure, Josh. Scrap deflated every month through the first quarter. Into April, we saw about a $7-a-ton decrease which is the least decrease of the previous months. We think that we're nearing bottom. It's hard to know. At current scrap prices it gets to the point where it's just not profitable for folks to collect scrap, but scrap is, as you know, correlated to iron ore prices and iron ore is under pressure.","So it will be interesting. We're pretty confident that we're near bottom. The -- because of the normal lag that we've spoken to, both on an inflationary and a deflationary cycle, we've said in an inflationary environment, expect a 60-day lag and deflationary environment, expect about a 90-day lag. The spreads in the first quarter were actually better than they were in the fourth quarter of last year, but those spreads or metal margin will compress a little bit in the second quarter.","Now, as we transfer product into the rest of the segment from a rod to wire perspective and then into components, we would expect some expansion of those margins because of the lag at that level. So it gets complicated. Long answer, but we think we're near bottom in scrap pricing pressures.","Josh Borstein","Okay. So some compression in 2Q, but then expansion you're saying in 3Q, 4Q.","Karl Glassman","That's what we would expect.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Hughes","Yes, another question on industrial. You discussed the higher unit volume, 11% in the numbers. Is that all owing to the strength you're seeing in bedding or are there other drivers to that number?","Karl Glassman","It's primarily bedding-related. There's some strength in some adjacent markets, but it's primarily bedding.","Matt Flanigan","Automotive is one example of a much, much smaller positive impact.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dan Moore with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Magic","This is Robert Magic filling in for Dan Moore. In residential furnishings, 10% growth in same location sales was exceptionally strong. What were the key drivers there and remind us was weather a factor last year?","Karl Glassman","Every business unit in residential grew, as we stated, there was significant growth in our bedding components, significant growth in home furniture. We saw growth in our carpet cushion businesses, in our industrial fabrics and geo. So that's all of it. There was pretty significant growth across the segment and we expect that to continue.","Robert Magic","And operating cash flow improved significantly year over year this quarter. Do you see upside to your full-year $350 million estimate?","Matt Flanigan","Robert, this is Matt. You may notice that at the beginning of the year we said cash flow would be approximately $350 million for the full year. We've now modified that just a bit to express it as that we fully expect it to exceed $350 million. Working capital continues to be the number that is most difficult to pin down. As you know, we feel really good about our earnings outlook and D&A is pretty readily discernible. So, yes, I think we feel really good about $350 million-plus as the right metric to bear in mind as we sit here today.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Baugh with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","John Baugh","These growth rates are so good, I'm not sure I'm following the same company I have for the last 25 years. I had two unrelated questions. One, if you could help me with the math on a pure flow-through EBIT margin, excluding acquisition, revenue, et cetera, how that looked in the quarter. And secondly, if you could give us some thoughts around the acquisition, size, profit margins, how it fits in, synergy opportunities, et cetera. Thank you.","Susan McCoy","John, I'll take a shot at the first question and when you have time and for others that are listening, in the slide deck we posted to the website, there's a sales and EBIT bridge for the quarter that we include and it's on slide number 4.","But basically what that shows you is it breaks down the sales change, is that there was about $73 million of incremental sales in the quarter that was related to volume gain. That was offset by currency and raw materials, so that our same location sales change was a little bit less than that.","EBIT increased by a fairly notable amount on that volume improvement. We do think that we're hitting our long-term expressed 25% to 35% incremental margin on that -- on the volume that we're getting. And in addition, there's some other things that are helping EBIT in the quarter, as we've mentioned, including some pricing discipline operational improvements in some important areas. And all of that collectively is helping our aggregate flow-through EBIT benefit.","Karl Glassman","And then John, as it relates to the acquisition, I assume that you mean the transaction related to the three Sealy component plants last July. What's happening there is the volumes are very good.","And from an EBIT perspective, what we're experiencing is exactly what we told you at the time of the acquisition in that it's barely accretive, that it's going to take us some time to get some more efficient, more productive manufacturing capacity in place. It's taken us a little longer than we expected because the volumes are greater than we expected. The macro market is just pretty darn strong, so we feel good about the progress.","We will get some uplift as Sealy is just now starting to ship their new product line. So every time there's a product launch and we're able to replace the older, less efficient product with newer, more efficiently produced product, it will help us incrementally. So we continue to be very optimistic. We've internalized, really 30 days after the acquisition, those additional wire tons which have been beneficial to industrial, things are going well.","John Baugh","Actually, that was my third question and I appreciate you answering that. I was actually asking about the European private label business you just bought.","Dave Haffner","Yes, let me take a stab at that and Karl might want to flesh it out a little bit. But I think you know, John, the first quarter only had about, I think, $4 million or so worth of revenue and for the full year that's closer to $47 million or $48 million pro forma. And the margins there, the pro forma margin is higher than what we have experienced recently in the segment, but certainly below our overall corporate target.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Herb Hardt with Monness. Please proceed with your question.","Herb Hardt","I have a couple questions. One is I'm just wondering what the earnings would have been had you done that $50-million share buyback.","Karl Glassman","I knew that question was coming, Matt.","Dave Haffner","I ask Matt that question often, Herb.","Herb Hardt","I'm not suggesting you do it now, but way back then.","Dave Haffner","Yes.","Herb Hardt","I see very -- in fact, no restructuring charges which would imply you're in pretty good shape across the board. First of all, is that true? And secondly, with the European private label business, will there be some charges?","Dave Haffner","Yes, we're in very good shape, quite honestly. A lot of the heavy lifting has already been done. The operating men and women have done a yeoman's job, I think, Herb, of having to deal with a lot of those restructuring costs. It doesn't mean that we won't periodically have the odd amount that we'll call out, but the significant, vast majority of restructuring costs have already been done. And Karl, do you want to comment on the European aspect of that?","Karl Glassman","No, there won't be any charges related to the European acquisition at all.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question is coming from the line of Allen Zwickler with First Manhattan. Please proceed with your question.","Allen Zwickler","I remember when it used to be just us talking and then John and Budd would maybe throw in a question to say they were there but it was just us. But anyway, I certainly also wish you had bought back stock when the stock was a couple of dollars a share, but that's all right. Anyway, one quick question and then a little longer. One is, it certainly looks like you must be gaining some market share in the U.S. and so I just wondered whether that was a function of pricing.","And the second question, just moreover is capacity, because what you've mentioned a couple times on the call and back a few years ago, you certainly took down the CapEx because you were -- at that [indiscernible] you had more capacity than you needed. Where are you now if we were playing baseball in a nine-inning game?","Dave Haffner","Before Karl addresses market share and capacity, I do think it's prudent to thank you for what has really been decades of following our company and knowing our company, so thank you for that. Now Karl, do you want to take market share?","Karl Glassman","Yes. Allen, yes, we're picking up market share in the United States and every geography in the world that we participate. It is not predicated on price; it's predicated on product development and innovation. That's part of the reason for our margin expansion. So, yes, I appreciate the fact that you're noticing that we're picking up share, but I assure you it's not on price.","As it relates to capacity that we used to speak in terms of $400 million of available capacity. That shrunk significantly. We're, as we said, out of capacity from an adjustable perspective. We're adding capacity from an automotive perspective every day. We're nearing full capacity on most of our innerspring categories in the United States. Ballpark, we're probably within the $200 million area of available capacity, but it's very specific to businesses.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up coming from the line of Josh Borstein with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Borstein","Yes, on the work furniture volumes there up 3%, that was a little below what I was assuming, just given the strong big win numbers and some of the numbers reported by the office furniture companies. Anything noteworthy there?","Karl Glassman","Josh, it's disappointing to us as well. That business, as you know, is inherently choppy from a quarter-to-quarter basis. We believe -- the big win numbers for the year forecasted industry to grow at 5%; we believe that we'll grow greater than that rate, excluding the acquisition. It was just a little bit softer in the first quarter. We continue to gain share with new programs. The first quarter, in my opinion, was a bit of an outlier.","Josh Borstein","And just a question on the slide deck under the residential key points, you mentioned that EBIT was impacted from higher adjustable bed pass-through sales. Is that just referring to floor display models going out to the retailers?","Karl Glassman","No, Josh. What happens is the product is produced in the commercial segment and then it is shipped to the residential segment for certain customers, primarily bedding manufacturers. There's two large manufacturers that are customers. We ship those products just in time. So the residential guys are really on the fulfillment end, so they have very little incremental margin. They're just handling the product, so the sales are recorded in the residential and the profitability is in commercial.","Josh Borstein","I see, okay. So that's why that was listed in the residential slide instead of the commercial slide?","Dave Haffner","Exactly.","Karl Glassman","That is correct. The bucket that the sales were reported in.","Josh Borstein","Okay. And then just the Comfort Core is now as a percentage of your total innerspring, what's it look like today?","Karl Glassman","The end of the first quarter it was 26%. I believe it will be pretty significantly higher than that at the end of the second quarter, because as I said, the manufactures are just now shipping their new product launches that are very heavy weighted to Comfort Core, though we expect continued outside growth.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up coming from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Hughes","Switching back to commercial now with the new reporting structure, can you give us an idea of the rank order of those three businesses, just in terms of size of the unit?","Karl Glassman","Boy, if we look in terms of total sales, adjustable would now be the largest. Work furniture would be next and consumer products or fashion beds, if we want to call it that, is the smallest.","Keith Hughes","Karl, what's your view now of adjustables and their penetration rate in the mattress industry? Is there any way to get a good number on that?","Karl Glassman","Keith, no and it's a heavily debated number. The penetration at premium price points is very high. I think that there's some large manufacturers at certain price points that are probably at a 50% attach rate; when we move into the promotional price point, there's almost no attach rate.","So aggregate everything together, we're probably in a 10% area, but that's a heavily debated number. It just depends on what sector or segment of the market that you look at. I'm absolutely convinced we will see outsized growth being double digit once we normalize. You know that we'll annualize our program wins at the end of this second quarter, but even past that I expect double-digit growth.","Keith Hughes","And it's still coming at the high end. Is that your projection?","Karl Glassman","Not exclusively, but primarily.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up coming from the line of John Baugh with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","John Baugh","So maybe, Dave, you could walk us through the European private label business you bought, tell us the acquisition criteria that I know you employ and how that's layered on this business. And then what the plan is, what you bring to the table. Is it revenue growth opportunities, is it margin, both etcetera? Thank you.","Dave Haffner","Yes. Excuse me, John. As Matt mentioned in his commentary, our acquisition criteria are significantly more stringent than they've ever been in the past and so we're looking at a lot of businesses that we decide to pass on for various reasons, strategic or otherwise.","But this particular acquisition being a private label manufacturer is one that I and Karl and Matt and many of us in the company have been strong proponents of, especially due to the fact that our current North American private label business does so well, performs a very, very good service for some of our key customers and makes a very fair return for our shareholders.","Many of our North American customers have an interest in expanding globally and so it was either a matter of acquisition or greenfielding another business similar to our genesis business here in the United States.","And then synergistically, some of [indiscernible] customers and other European customers of ours are interested in growing their market here in North America and doing so through private label initiatives and asked us to consider that. So it was very fortuitous of -- the individual that -- and his sister that were the owners of this business are very young people, very energetic and enthusiastic and we believe we've got an outstanding group of people associated with this acquisition.","But it passed all of the screens that we use for strategic and financial return on invested capital, et cetera and simultaneously met two of those long-term strategic goals, both here in North America and in other parts of the world associated with private label growth.","Karl Glassman","The only thing that I would add, Dave, is that being Polish-based, it's in an area and a region of Poland that is low cost, high quality. We're very, very comfortable, as are our European customers, with the quality standards out of that facility. And as you know that there is a lot of global move of European manufacturers in North America and vice versa. So that consistency, as Dave said, between the two markets is important. We're very, very comfortable putting our name on the Trio Line building, very proud to do so.","John Baugh","And any sense of what the revenue growth rate has been for this business and what that might go to? Or is it a margin expansion story more so than a revenue growth story? Thank you.","Dave Haffner","John, it's combination of those. The past revenue growth as a percentage has been almost ex-- it's extraordinary. It's good. On the other hand, as it gets bigger, I know you've heard me say this before, the bigger you get, the harder it is to continue to compound.","But we're expecting substantial growth, substantial top line and simultaneously, there are some synergies here as well as some new business that is going to be priced a little bit differently than what we've done in the past which will also enhance the margins. So I know that's sort of a mealy mouthed answer to your question, but it's really a combination of continued meaningful growth rate and relatively straightforward margin enhancement.","Operator","Thank you. There are no additional questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional concluding comments.","Dave Haffner","We'll just say thank you for your attention and we'll talk to you again next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation and you may disconnect your lines at this time."],"12817":["Leggett & Platt Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. Dave DeSonier, Senior VP of Strategy and Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. DeSonier, you may begin.","David DeSonier","Good morning and thank you for taking part in our fourth quarter conference call. With me today are the following: Karl Glassman, who is President and CEO; Matt Flanigan, our Executive VP and CFO; and Susan McCoy, our VP of Investor Relations. Perry Davis and Mitch Dolloff both Executive VP\u2019s of the Company are joining us today to participate in Q&A they have each been past participants on these calls and they will now both join us regularly.","Also with us today is Wendy Watson who joined our IR department at the start of the year and will be working directly with Susan as Director of Investor Relations. Wendy brings a lot of background with work in M&A, business transaction support trade law, government relations, and treasury and banking support. She has been with Leggett for 19 years and has worked with our operations for the past five years in a business development role supporting strategy and growth process development. We are excited to have Wendy as the newest member of our IR team.","The agenda for our call this morning is as follows. Karl will start with a summary of the major statements we made in yesterday\u2019s press release and provide segment highlights. Matt will discuss financial details and address our outlook for 2017. And finally, the Group will answer any questions that you have.","This conference call is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material. This call may not be transcribed, recorded or broadcasted without our expressed permission. A replay is available from the IR portion of our website. We posted to the IR portion of the website, yesterday\u2019s press release and a set of PowerPoint slides that contains summary financial information, along with segment details.","Those documents supplement the information we discuss on this call, including non-GAAP reconciliations. I need to remind you that remarks today concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements, actual results or events may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements.","For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday\u2019s press release and the section in our 10-K entitled forward-looking statements.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Karl Glassman.","Karl Glassman","Good morning and thank you for participating in our fourth quarter call. We are pleased with our 2016 operational performance despite the challenging demand environment that persisted throughout the year in many of our markets. We thank our dedicated fellow employees around the world. Their efforts during this past year where impactful and are very much appreciated.","For 2017, we expect market improvement and Leggett initiatives to drive sales growth and further increases in earnings per share. Our businesses are extremely well-positioned for long-term profitable growth and we remain confident in our ability to achieve the 2019 targets that we provided last September.","Fourth quarter sales decreased 4% to $904 million largely due to four small divestitures completed in the past 12 months, unit volume was up slightly. Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.60 compared to $0.57 in the fourth quarter last year. The current fourth quarter earnings included a $0.07 per share benefit from a divestiture gain and the prior year fourth quarter included a $0.07 per share reduction from a lump sum pension buyout and a litigation settlement.","Excluding these unusual items, adjusted fourth quarter earnings decreased to $0.53 per share from $0.64 last year. This reduction was due in large part to rapid inflation in steel cost in late 2016 versus significant deflation in steel that was occurring in late 2015. The effects in both years were amplified by LIFO accounting. The commodity impact on earnings was partially offset in the quarter by a lower effective tax rate and a reduced share count.","For the full-year, sales decreased 4% with 2% unit volume growth and small acquisitions, more than offset by divestitures, raw material related price decreases that had occurred before the recent spike in steel cost and currency impact. Full-year earnings per share from continuing operations increased to $2.62 from $2.27 in 2015.","Current year earnings included a $0.13 per share benefit primarily from divestiture gains and in the prior year included a $0.09 per share reduction from unusual items. Adjusted earnings per share increased to $2.49 from $2.36 in 2015. This increase was largely due to lower effective tax rate related to a new accounting standard for stock-based compensation and reduced share count. The earnings benefit from unit volume growth during the year was more than offset by recent steel inflation and the non-reoccurrence of the pricing lag benefit that we experienced in late 2015.","In 2015, steel cost deflated significantly especially during the fourth quarter and our earnings benefited from the normal lag we experienced in adjusting selling prices. This cost deflation ultimately led to lower selling prices, which impacted our sales growth throughout 2016. In recent months, steel costs have begun to rapidly inflate. We are implementing price increases to recover this recent inflation.","Our commitment to portfolio management over the last several years has resulted in higher margins and returns and stronger strategic positioning for the Company as a whole. During 2016, we completed three small acquisitions including a manufacturer of aerospace tube assemblies, a distributor of geosynthetic products, and a South African innerspring manufacturer.","We also purchased the remaining minority interest in a key automotive joint venture in China and continued investing capital to support organic growth opportunities in automotive and bedding. During the year, we completed the divestiture of four small businesses with annual revenue of approximately $100 million. This included a wire products business sold in late December that resulted in a pretax gain of $16 million or $0.07 per share.","In September, we outlined our TSR framework, including an expectation for long-term revenue growth of 6% to 9%. We believe the macro environment driven by consumer confidence, housing, employment, wages and interest rates should support modest growth in our end markets over the next few years. In addition, we continue our focus on content gains and new program awards across to our businesses and therefore expect to grow organically at a rate faster than our markets.","Strategic acquisitions are also expected to add to long-term growth. Margin expansion and share repurchases should each contributes to long-term TSR and our commitment to dividend growth is unwavering. In short, we remain fully committed to our long-standing goal of achieving total shareholder return that ranks in the top third of the S&P 500.","In November, we filed an 8-K that discussed changes to the management organizational structure in our segments. As a reminder, effective January 1, Perry Davis was promoted to Executive Vice President and he is now President of Residential Products and Industrial Products segments. Also effective January 1, Mitchell Dolloff was promoted to Executive Vice President and in this now President of the Specialized Products & Furniture Products segments.","We continue to report under the prior management structure throughout the end of 2016, so all of the segment commentary that we make today is based upon the historical reporting format. In Residential Furnishings, fourth quarter same location sales were down 7%, unit volume decreased 5%, about half of which resulted from lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds. Raw material related price deflation and currency reduced sales by 2%.","Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding deflation and currency were as follows: U.S. Spring component dollar sales decreased 4%. Innersprings units decreased 5%, and boxspring unit volume was down 7%. Comfort core units decreased 6% during the quarter. International spring sales increased 3%. Home furniture component sales were down slightly with sales in the seating of sofa sleeper business down 2% and motion hardware unit volume down 1%.","Segment EBIT increased during the quarter as a result of lower foam litigation expense, excluding these charges EBIT decreased primarily from lower unit volume, partially offset by continued pricing discipline. Adjusted EBIT margin improved slightly in part due to the lower adjustable bed pass-through sales.","For the full-year, total sales in the segment decreased 6%. Unit volume was down 3%, about half of which resulted from lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds. Commodity deflation and currency impacts also reduced sales by 3%. U.S. innerspring units were down 6% and comfort core units were up 4% for the year.","Full-year segment EBIT increased as a result of a $7 million benefit from a litigation settlement and lower foam litigation expense, excluding these items EBIT for the year decreased slightly with lower unit volume largely offset by pricing discipline. Adjusted EBIT margin improved 50 basis points to 10.7% in part due to lower adjustable bed pass-through sales.","In the Commercial Products segment, fourth quarter same location sales were flat. Adjustable bed units grew 4% and work furniture sales were up slightly, but these increases were offset by lower sales and fashion bed. Segment EBIT increased and EBIT margin improved primarily from a favorable sales mix and a $1 million gain from a building sale.","For the full-year, total sales in the segment grew 1%. Adjustable bed units were up slightly for the year, the segments full-year EBIT increased and EBIT margin improved 150 basis points to 8.3% primarily from operational improvements, gains from building sales of $3 million and a favorable sales mix.","In the Industrial Materials segment, fourth quarter same location sales were down 4% from steel related price decreases that had occurred before the recent spike in steel cost. Unit volume was essentially flat in the quarter. Total sales also decreased as a result of divestitures. The segment EBIT increased significantly in the quarter due to a $16 million gain from the sale of a wire products business and a non-reoccurrence from a $3 million loss from last year's divestiture of the steel tubing business. Excluding these unusual items, fourth quarter adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBIT margin decreased largely due to recent steel cost inflation that had not yet been recovered through selling price increases.","For the full-year, total sales in the segment decreased 25% from a combination of divestitures, steel related price decreases and lower unit volume. The segment's full-year EBIT increased due to the divestiture gain and the non-reoccurrence of a prior year impairment charge and divestiture loss. Excluding these unusual items, EBIT was down slightly with the impact from lower sales largely offset by operational improvements. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 290 basis points to10.1% in part from the divestiture of lower margin businesses.","In the specialized product segment, fourth quarter same location sales increased 4% with continued strength in automotive, partially offset by currency impact and lower volume in machinery and aerospace. Excluding currency changes, automotive sales grew 15%, machinery sales decreased 23%, and aerospace same location sales were down 9% in the quarter.","The segment's EBIT grew and EBIT margin improved primarily from higher unit volume and currency impact. Full-year, total sales in the segment grew 6% with a 9% volume increase and a small acquisition, partially offset by divestitures and currency impact. Strong performance in our automotive business drove the majority of the sales growth. Excluding currency changes, automotive sales increased 13% for the full-year. The segment's full-year EBIT benefited from $11 million divestiture gain, partially offset by a $4 million goodwill impairment charge. Excluding these unusual items, EBIT grew and EBIT margin improved primarily from higher sales and currency impact.","I'll now turn the call over to Matt.","Matthew Flanigan","Thanks, Karl and good morning everyone. In 2016, we generated very strong operating cash flow of $553 million, which included $25 million of after-tax litigation settlement proceeds. Operating cash flow continues to benefit from a sharp focus on working capital management.","We ended the year with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales at 9.4%. In November, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share, which represented $0.02 per share or 6% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2015. Our target range for dividend payout is 50% to 60% of net earnings and we have been within that range in each of the past two years. Looking forward, we would expect future dividend growth to approximate earnings growth.","At yesterday's closing price of $47.19, the current dividend yield is 2.9%, which is one of the highest yields among the 51 companies that comprise the S&P 500\u2019s dividend aristocrats. We repurchased 400,000 shares of our stock in the fourth quarter at an average price of $47.10. For the full-year, we repurchased 4.5 million shares at an average price of $46.52 and issued 2.4 million shares primarily for employee benefit plans and stock option exercises.","Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. During the year, we expanded the capacity under our revolver and commercial paper program from $600 million to $750 million and extended the term by two years to 2021.","We ended 2016 with over $550 million available under the commercial paper program and our net debt and net capital ratio was at 34%, comfortably within our longstanding targeted range of 30% to 40%. We also monitored debt-to-EBITDA and then in 2016 with debt at 1.6 times our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA.","We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling three-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top one-third of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. For the three-year period that ended on December 31, 2016, we generated compound annual TSR of 20% per year and that performance placed us within the top 11% of the S&P 500.","As Karl mentioned earlier, we believe the macro environment should support modest growth in our end markets over the next few years. Even more importantly, we expect to grow organically at a faster pace than our markets as a result of content gains and new program awards. As we enter 2017 with renewed inflation, we also expect sales to increase from the pass through of higher commodity costs, although, there will be a lag in timing which typically occurs when we adjust our own selling prices. With this collective backdrop for 2017, we are forecasting another year of strong performance.","Sales from continuing operations are expected to be $3.95 billion to $4.05 billion, or up 5% to 8% versus 2016. We expect mid single-digit unit volume growth from strength in Automotive, Bedding, Adjustable Bed, Work Furniture, and Geo Components. The sales impact from divestitures completed during 2016 should be largely offset by small acquisitions and as just mentioned raw material related price increases should also add to sales growth.","We expect 2017 earnings per share of $2.55 to $2.75. Bridging from our 2016 adjusted EPS of $2.49, we therefore expect earnings to grow from between 2% to 10%. This guidance assumes that the benefit from higher unit volume will be partially offset by the pricing lag, we typically experienced in recovering increased raw material costs. We expect the largest impact from the pricing lag to occur during the first quarter. We also anticipate our higher effective full-year tax rate of approximately 26% this year. Of course, this tax rate estimate is assuming that current laws do not change in 2017.","Based upon this guidance, we currently expect a full-year EBIT margin between 12.8% and 13.5%. Operating cash flow should exceed $450 million in 2017 with working capital increases attributable to sales growth and inflation expected to be a use of cash. Dividend should require about $185 million of cash and capital expenditures should approximate $150 million for the year.","As has been our practice, after funding capital expenditures and dividends remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must meet stringent, strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to provision and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. However, we currently expect to repurchase between 3 million to 4 million shares in 2017 and issue approximately 2 million shares primarily for employee benefit plans.","With those cause, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier.","David DeSonier","That concludes our prepared remarks. We thank you for your attention and we will be glad to answer your questions. In order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate on the call, we request that you ask only one question and then yield to the next participant. If you have additional questions you are welcome to reenter the queue and we will answer those questions as well.","Michele, we are ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Griffin","Hi guys. This is Bobby, filling in for Budd. I appreciate everyone taking my questions.","Susan McCoy","Hi, Bobby.","Robert Griffin","Just real quickly I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the volume guide of mid-single-digits assumed in the sales guidance and maybe just kind of what your assumptions are that kind of give you confidence of unit volume accelerating here. And is there any timing that you guys expect for kind of the accelerations, is it more backend weighted or are you seeing stuff already that gives you that confidence early on in the quarter?","Karl Glassman","Good morning, Bobby. This is Karl. I\u2019ll deal with kind of the high level and then Susan will take a swing at quarterizing it for you. The way that we build our forecast up is we use a baseline of GDP, so then we adjust by product category. So as an example, we\u2019re pretty confident using the IHS forecast, the global auto build in the major markets is going to be 1.7% in 2017. So that's the spark for auto.","We have in U.S. spring as an example. We have an expectation that units will grow 2%. Then we go back and look at each one of the markets around the world have a greater expectation for growth based on market drivers in the bedding industry as an example in Asia and in Europe, so that becomes baseline.","Then we have a high degree of confidence of content gains. In automotive, we continue to believe based on awarded programs that will grow at a 1,000 basis points greater than global build, so call it 12% forecast there. And in U.S. spring, as you saw in Las Vegas, we're very confident with the advent of the Quantum Edge and the proliferation of that product, just as examples, in the comfort layer of micro coils, adjustable bed, significant market share gains and then also a market that's growing greater than GDP. So we boil that altogether knowing that our new product innovations in each one of our disparate markets and feel really comfortable from a unit perspective of that call it 5%. Susan?","Susan McCoy","Yes. Bobby, so to take that a step further and think about by quarter and then our total sales guidance, I would \u2013 obviously, we've talked about mid single-digit unit volume growth and think of unit volume growth strengthening as the year progresses, some of those new programs and products ramp up.","Inflation is the other part of our forecast for sales and I would also allow for inflation increasing particularly in the second quarter, third quarter, and this is the impact on sales of course, based on recent commodity trends and then to kind of complete the view on all-in sales completed divestitures and small acquisitions that we know about right now would effectively offset in the year.","Now you usually go on to ask about a sort of segment level assumption around that midpoint sales growth, so I\u2019ll offer that up to with the comment around residential being, call it mid single-digit commercial much stronger than that more like mid-teens and again the growth that we've gotten adjustables that also in work furniture will contribute to that.","Industrial would be flat. We do have some carry on impact from divestitures that have been completed in 2016, but we would expect that to be offset by steel inflation and some higher volume, and then specialized, as it's been doing, likely growing high single-digit. So when you blend all that together, you get back to that midpoint, call it 6.5% to 7% all-in sales growth for the full-year.","Robert Griffin","Okay, I appreciate that. Susan, you did read my mind. That was going to be my follow-up, but I do have one other one. On the timing of the pricing increases, can you help us maybe understand if there's a timing difference between the segments? I realize bedding might be a little bit later, more towards April, and wire could be a little sooner. Is there anything else we need to keep in mind as we try to model out 1Q?","Karl Glassman","Actually you characterized it accurately, Bobby. Wire closer to raw material the earlier, so we've announced rod and wire increases and have implemented them already based on the scrap moves that we saw in November. The only outlier to what you said is that steel prices have inflated earlier and to a greater degree in China.","So as an example in our furniture hardware facilities in China, we're implementing price increases that are significant in 9% to 11% range depending on product category that go into effect next Monday, when the Chinese are back from New Year and embedding as you said, starts to roll through domestic bedding would roll through really early second quarter.","Robert Griffin","I appreciate all the detail. Best of luck in 2017.","Matthew Flanigan","Thank you, Bobby.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Moore with CJS Securities.","Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Moore","Thank you and good morning.","Karl Glassman","Good morning, Dan.","Susan McCoy","Hi, Dan.","Daniel Moore","I just wanted to follow up a little on those price increases. Obviously you gave us good detail in terms of the timing. It's still early, but how are those being received thus far and obviously you sound very confident about your ability, as you usually do, to push those through. I just wanted to get a sense of that?","Perry Davis","Dan, this is Perry Davis. As we look at recent history, through the latter part of the year fourth quarter and going into the first quarter of this year, we've seen pretty significant movement on scrap up somewhere in the neighborhood of $110 and that ramp-up really did accelerated at the end of the year, so as we move forward that scrapped in terms to rod into wire in the following months.","We anticipate that we will have early second quarter price increases reflected from that movement. Now bear in mind, some of our contracts that we have in the bedding group, at least our formulaic and are delayed by about 90 days. We talk about that regularly. So, we'll begin to see those movements as we get into the early part of the second quarter.","Daniel Moore","Very good. CapEx ticking up a bit in 2017, just talk about where the incremental spend is going and do you expect it to remain at those levels looking out beyond this year?","Karl Glassman","Yes. Dan, this is Karl. The CapEx ticking up is really good news for us. It's a tribute to organic growth, it goes back to those awarded automotive programs, additional investment in adjustable bed as we gain market share. Significant investment in U.S. bedding as this Quantum Edge and Microcoils rollout products all introduced in Las Vegas being extremely well received.","In investment in Europe, where our bedding operations continue to gain share in premium products, so that capital is the best money that we can spend and feel really good about that $150 million forecast. If there's a bias, it could be slightly higher, but it will all be steeped in every one of those programs having excellent returns for our shareholders. In the out years, I would assume $150 million. At this point, I don't have any better data.","Daniel Moore","Got it. Appreciate the color. Thanks very much.","Karl Glassman","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Baugh with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","John Baugh","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I guess this is directed at either Perry or Karl. There was a small announcement in the bedding trade yesterday that changed some things and was curious. I know Serta is a big customer and it seems like they're going to gain from this, but you were very excited about your placements with Sealy and I guess my question is for Leggett, how do you see that playing out and does Serta Simmons bedding have enough capacity to take on all the extra business? I'm just curious how you see that yin and the yang.","Karl Glassman","John, Perry and I talked about this last night and I thought he should answer the questions and he thought I should answer the questions, and he is bigger than I am, so I guess, I'll take a swing at it and Perry will interject at any time that we wants that. You are right sort of appears to be the primary beneficiary and mattress firms announcement they specifically cited an exclusively launch of the I-series product line, which has a lot of our product in it. And iComfort, which to us it\u2019s a foam product; there are some hybrid iComfort that are good for us, we'll get all of the foundation's related to those products.","As regards capacity that's really a Serta Simmons question that there is capacity in the market. There is always the ability to flagships. I was told yesterday that the majority of the Serta facilities are running single shift. They can ramp those to a second shift. The majority of the Simmons facilities are running two shifts, but there is capacity from our perspective has Simmons historically gets busier we've always been the beneficiary of the overflow in the demand.","We also expect Mattress Firm to continue to heavyweight their private label programs. We\u2019re in exclusive supply agreements with those two vendors. And to go back though, we are \u2013 we continue to be very enthused about the Sealy introduction of Quantum Edge. We think that we know that that product was extremely well received at retail and we expect significant demand there as well.","What I think is most notable about the announcements and the decisions, and I'm not going to get into why the decisions are made. That's none of our business, but what Tempur Sealy has said, and Mattress Firm has said, and SSB Serta Simmons have said is we are going to jointly or individually, but from an industry perspective have a significant impact by increased consumer faced advertising spend.","Frankly, Select Comfort has been on their own investing it a lot of ad dollars over the last couple years. Mattress Firm certainly participates in advertising, but with elections last year, you just didn't see a lot of ad spend. You will see significant ad spend by all of those players that historically is really good for the bedding industry. It's what the industry's has been lacking the last few years. While we use that baseline of 2% unit growth, I would probably bias it up based on these announcements because of that investment and consumer awareness. So we'll see all sorts out, I think it will be good for the consumer. Perry, do you have anything?","Perry Davis","I would just add that in the area of adjustable beds and maybe Mitch could add some color to this. But we do anticipate that our position as the market is shifted over the last couple of years from an OEM model to a direct to retail model. We expect also there that we should enjoy some additional pick ups in adjustable beds as relates to Mattress Firm.","John Baugh","Okay. And just maybe the follow-up, I don't know if I heard or if I did, I didn't understand that or missed it. What were units of innersprings in calendar 2016 in terms of a percent change?","Perry Davis","So John, for the year on a per day basis 2016 versus 2015 units were down 5% with regards to the fourth quarter, basically they were down 5% they are also, so 5% for the year.","John Baugh","And that\u2019s a springs comment that doesn't have this pass-through of adjustables or does?","Perry Davis","That is just innerspring shipments.","Karl Glassman","In just the [U.S.]","John Baugh","Okay. So I guess that the point is we do have at least to your 2% or bias upwards. That's quite a steep decline, so we have nothing else, a very easy comparison?","Matthew Flanigan","That\u2019s a fair statement. Yes, 2016 had a very, very difficult comparison to an abnormally strong 2015. We're reversing that this year. We're 2017 frankly is up against a pretty easy 2016.","John Baugh","Thank you and good luck.","Matthew Flanigan","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. Within Specialized, we had aerospace and machinery down. You talked a little bit about it before, but can you just give us more detail what's going on there and will that those turn positive here near-term in the New Year?","Perry Davis","Keith, I\u2019ll tell you what Mitch has got the best story in the room to tell on automotive and you ask them about the two negatives, but go ahead, Mitch.","Keith Hughes","Well, you just brought the numbers down guys.","Mitchell Dolloff","Okay on aerospace, I think a couple factors at play. Mainly we had some really aggressive pricing in our North American Tube operations I think cost as some market share. We've adjusted our pricing to be more competitive as appropriate there and we think that we stabilized.","We also have experience some year-over-year declines in the space business that we have in that area and that business isn't inherently less steady. So it tends to come and go year-to-year. So I do think that we'll see some positive impact in 2017 in the aerospace business.","Our operations in Europe and our two forming operation continue to perform really well. So it's more an issue of getting our pricing correct in this North American Tube market. On the machinery side, the first half of the year was really strong and it started to slow down in the second half and that some of our major bedding customers curtailed their capital spending. That's really the driver there. It's really it tale of two halves of the year.","Keith Hughes","Okay, and the adjustables within Specialty, up 4%, I know you've done a lot of introductions, a lot of focus on that for you selling directly to retailers as opposed to going through just the OEMs. So I guess my question is within that number are you seeing strong new account growth, strong existing growth? How does it breakdown?","Karl Glassman","Okay, it\u2019s great question. I\u2019ll kind of tag along to what Perry mentioned earlier. So I think there's really three factors impacting our growth there. The first as you said, sales to our bedding OEMs are down as we ship to direct retail strategy, that's not a surprise, and so that shows up due to bedding numbers. Sales to our existing retailers are up as the market continues to grow, and then finally we're gaining shares. We ramp up programs with new retail customers, so really all of those factors are helping at this point.","Keith Hughes","And just final issue on that, are you seeing faster growth at the lower price points in adjustables?","Karl Glassman","I think that we continue to see pressure on price points for sure. I think we look at it as a higher more feature driven segment as well as a large more price conscious segment and we're playing with both of those.","Keith Hughes","Okay, thank you.","End of Q&A","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. DeSonier for closing remarks.","David DeSonier","Thank you. We appreciate your participation. We don't have anything else to add. So we will talk to you again next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Wendy Watson, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Watson. You may begin.","Wendy Watson","Good morning and thank you for taking part in Leggett & Platt\u2019s fourth quarter conference call. I am Wendy Watson. With me today are Karl Glassman, President and CEO; Matt Flanigan, EVP and Chief Financial Officer; Mitch Dolloff, EVP, Chief Operating Officer and President of the Furniture Products and Specialized Products segment; Perry Davis, EVP and President of the Residential Products and Industrial Products segment; and Cassie Branscum, Manager of IR.","The agenda for our call this morning is as follows: Karl Glassman will start with a summary of the major statements we made in yesterday\u2019s press release; Matt will discuss financial details and address our outlook for 2018. And finally, the group will answer any questions that you have.","This conference call is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material. This call may not be transcribed, recorded or broadcast without our expressed permission. A replay is available from the IR portion of Leggett\u2019s website. We posted to the Investor Relations portion of the website yesterday\u2019s press release and a set of PowerPoint slides that contain summary financial information along with segment details. Those documents supplement the information we discuss on this call, including any non-GAAP reconciliations.","I need to remind you that remarks today\u2019s concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results or events may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday\u2019s press release and the section in our 10-K and 10-Qs entitled Forward-Looking Statements.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Karl.","Karl Glassman","Good morning. And thank you for participating in our fourth quarter call. First, I would like to thank our dedicated fellow employees around the world for your efforts during this past year. They are very much appreciated. We are pleased with our 2018 operational performance despite the challenges we faced and some of our businesses, most notably Home Furniture and Fashion Bed.","Fourth quarter sales increased 6% to $1.05 billion on flat volume. Raw material related price increases net of currency impact at a 3% to sales growth and acquisitions also added 3%. Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.39. This includes several items outlined in yesterday\u2019s press release that amount to a $0.23 per share reduction in earnings. Excluding these items, adjusted fourth quarter earnings increased 5% to $0.62 per share from $0.59 last year. This increase is primarily due to improved metal margins in our Steel Rod business.","In 2018, sales grew 8% to $4.3 billion with organic sales up 6% from a combination of 3% volume growth in a 3% benefit from raw material related price increases and currency impact. Acquisitions, net of divestitures completed in 2017 added 2% to sales growth. Full-year sales benefited from ongoing content games and new program awards in Automotive, market share gains and continued shift that Comfort Core and Quantum Edge inner springs in U.S. Spring and strong growth in Adjustable Bed, Work Furniture and Aerospace. These improvements were partially offset by declines and other businesses primarily Home Furniture, Fashion Bed and Flooring Products.","Full-year earnings per share from continuing operations increased to $2.26 from $2.14 in 2017. Earnings from 2018 include the fourth quarter $0.23 per share reduction just mentioned and a third quarter $0.01 per share benefit related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for a net reduction of $0.22 per share.","Full-year 2017 earnings included a $0.32 per share net reduction, primarily from cost associated with a Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Adjusted full-year earnings per share increased 1% to $2.48. Adjusted EPS benefited from improved metal margins at our steel mill and higher sales. These improvements were largely offset by higher steel cost, including LIFO expense and the lag associated with passing along ongoing inflation.","In 2018, we made some important strategic moves that should reinforce and achievement of our long-term financial goals. In January, we acquired Precision Hydraulic Cylinders, a leading global manufacturer of engineered hydraulic cylinders, primarily for the materials handling market. PHC is our first business in the hydraulic cylinder industry, a market we identified through our styles of competition analysis.","In November, we announced the acquisition of Elite Comfort Solutions and we have completed the acquisition last month. ECS is a leader in proprietary specialized foam technology primarily for the bedding and furniture industries. The purchase price was $1.25 billion and was financed through an expansion of our commercial paper program and the issuance of a $500 million five-year term loan with our current bank group.","Through the ECS acquisition, we have gained critical capabilities in proprietary foam technology along with scale in the production of private label finish mattresses. Our combined expertise in spring and foam technology, make us the leading provider of differentiated products for the global bedding industry. ECS\u2019 annualized sales for the fiscal year ended September 2018 were $611 million and we expect ECS to add approximately $675 million to sales growth in 2019. ECS is in our new specialty foams business unit within the Residential Products segment reporting to Perry.","As previously discussed, we continued an in-depth analysis of our Fashion Bed and Home Furniture businesses, and initiated restructuring activity late last year. Restructuring related charges in 2018 were $16 million and we expect an additional $17 million of charges in 2019. The restructuring activities should be substantially complete by the end of this year. In 2019, we expect these acquisitions and Leggett initiatives to drive sales growth and increased margins. Matt will discuss our guidance for the year later in the call.","Finally, the quarterly slide decks that we posted to the Investor Relations website, contains unit growth rates for inner springs and box spring pieces within our Residential Products segment. Because of content and gains including strong growth of our Comfort Core inner springs and other higher dollar value units, dollar growth and unit growth have become increasingly disconnected. Accordingly, beginning in the first quarter of 2019, we will stop reporting unit growth or inner springs and box spring; we will continue to provide dollar growth as we do for our other business units.","With all, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Matt.","Matt Flanigan","Thank you, Karl, and good morning everyone. In 2018, we generated our operating cash flow of $440 million, which once again included our typically strong fourth quarter cash flow performance. We continue to have a strong and sharp focus on working capital management and we ended the year with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 10.6%. We repatriated $141 million of offshore cash in the fourth quarter bringing our full-year total to $314 million.","In November, we declared a $0.38 per share quarterly dividend, a 6% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2017. Our dividend payout as a percentage of adjusted earnings was 60% for 2018 at the top of our target dividend payout range of 50% to 60%. Beginning in 2019, in conjunction with the increase in leverage from the ECS acquisition, we announced a modest change in our dividend payout target to approximately 50% of adjusted earnings. We expect to continue increasing the dividend as we repay debt associated with the ECS acquisition.","At Friday\u2019s closing price of $40.97, our current yield is 3.7%, which is one of the highest yields among the 57 companies that comprise the S&P 500\u2019s Dividend Aristocrats. For the full year, we\u2019ve repurchased 2.6 million shares of our stock at an average price of $43.10 and issued 1.2 million shares primarily for employee benefit plans and stock option exercises.","During the year, we acquired PHC and two small Geo Component operations. We also continued investing capital to support organic growth opportunities primarily in automotive and bedding. We increased the borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program from $800 million to $1.2 billion in connection with the funding of the ECS transaction. We ended the year with a debt at 1.9 times our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. After completing the ECS acquisition in January, our debt levels increased as expected to approximately 3.5 times. We are committed to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating and expect to deleverage to a target ratio of debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA of approximately 2.5 times by temporarily suspending share repurchases, reducing other acquisitions spending and using our operating cash flow to repay debt.","We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling three-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top one third of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. While our recent performance has not met this target, we continue to strongly believe our disciplined growth strategy and prudent use of capital will support achievement of our top third goal over time.","Sales growth in 2019 will benefit significantly from the ECS acquisition. We also expect sales growth in Automotive, U.S. Spring, aerospace and Hydraulic Cylinders, partially offset by planned declines in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture related to restructuring efforts and from less promotional activity in Adjustable Bed. 2019 sales are expected to be $4.95 billion to $5.1 billion, or up 16% to 19% over last year.","ECS should add approximately $675 million to sales. In addition to ECS, same location sales growth is expected to be flat to up 3%. Earnings per share are expected to be $2.35 to $2.55 including approximately $0.10 cents per share of restructuring related cost. Therefore, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.45 to $2.65 reflecting slightly higher organic sales and moderating steel inflation partially offset by higher tax rate.","As we have previously stated, the ECS acquisition is expected to be neutral to EPS in 2019. EPS guidance assumes a full-year effective tax rate of 24% versus 20% in 2018. This higher rate reflects the non-recurrence of some valuation allowance releases we benefited from in 2018, a smaller expected stock compensation benefit in 2019.","The impact of TCJA executive compensation limits and tax implications from higher interest expansion due to the financing of the ECS transaction. We expect 2019 depreciation and amortization to approximately $210 million, net interest of approximately $95 million and fully diluted shares of $136 million.","Based upon this guidance framework, our 2019 full-year adjusted EBIT margin should be 10.8% to 11.2% while we do not issue specific quarterly guidance, we expect revenue growth rates to be somewhat consistent across the quarters in 2019. We expect adjusted margins in the first quarter to be lower than first quarter last year in part due to the purchase accounting for acquired ECS inventory and we expect year-over-year adjusted margins to be flat to slightly improving by the second half of the year.","Cash from operations should approximate $550 million in 2019. Capital expenditures should be near $195 million for the year and dividends should require $205 million of cash. Our dividend pay out ratio for 2019 is anticipated to be above our target of approximately 50% of adjusted earnings.","Our long-term priorities for use of cash remain; one, organic growth involving capital expenditures and working capital investments; two, dividends; three, strategic acquisitions and four, share repurchases. As previously stated, we will temporarily suspend share repurchases, reduce acquisition spending, and prioritize debt repayment after organic growth and dividends.","With those comments, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Wendy.","Wendy Watson","That concludes our prepared remarks. We thank you for your attention and we\u2019ll be glad to answer any of your questions. In order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate, we request that you ask only one question and then yield to the next participant. If you have additional questions, you\u2019re welcome to re-enter the queue and we will answer those questions as well.","Michelle, we\u2019re ready to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Kalata","Hi. This is Chris Kalata on for Susan. Thanks for taking our questions. First question is just on the Industrial Products segment. You\u2019ve been able to realize the significant amount of pricing in the second half of 2018. So, I was just wondering, how much additional pricing are you expecting this year and what benefit could that have to your margins?","Perry Davis","Chris, we \u2013 this is Perry Davis. We definitely saw a run-up last year in both scrap and particularly in rod pricing. We feel at this point in time that we are pretty much at the peak. We in fact, saw some slight deflation in scrap inputs in January, which is a little uncommon. I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve seen a January decrease in scrap pricing since 2006. But, overall, we believe that over the next few months our input cost and rod prices will remain relatively constant.","Chris Kalata","Okay, thanks. And then just my second question, does your full-year guidance that include the impact of the \u2013 a full 25% tariff environment? And are you able to quantify what the incremental headwinds would be between the 10% and 25%?","Karl Glassman","Chris, it\u2019s Karl. The answer to that is no. We don\u2019t know what to expect as it relates to tariff. We assume that if the tariffs are in fact increased to 25% will pass them through. But in our top-line forecast, they do not include the expansion of tariff activity. We just don\u2019t know.","Chris Kalata","Okay. Thanks for that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bobby Griffin with Raymond James Financial. Please proceed with your question.","Bobby Griffin","Yes, thank you. Good morning everybody and I appreciate you guys for taking my question.","Karl Glassman","Good morning, Bobby.","Bobby Griffin","First, I want to touch on the automotive segment and kind of see what the outlook is, assuming your guidance for 2019 and how kind of the program went trended in 2018?","Mitch Dolloff","Good morning, Bobby. This is Mitch. I will take that one, of course, our Automotive business continues to perform really well and our long-term outlook hasn\u2019t changed. Our strong pipeline of awarded future program continues to give us confidence in our goal of beating the vehicle production growth by a 1000 basis points. We\u2019ve had double digit increases in our new awards every year since I\u2019ve been counting this since 2011. overall, CAGR of over 15% since that time. So, we take the visibility that we have there, it really gives us a strong case to stand by our goal. for 2019, production is forecast to be up about 1% globally and about 0.6% in the major markets, and we look at what we have net of coming online versus program\u2019s ending. We still feel confident at our double-digit target.","Bobby Griffin","Okay. Does the production forecast assume any type of a stimulant for China Automotive demand that they announced recently?","Karl Glassman","I don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s kind of hard to tell with a variety of factors that are happening in China. Certainly, people have been hopeful that there\u2019s some kind of incentive that kicks in, but you still have some general economic malaise there, it\u2019s certainly some impact from the trade disputes. So, I think that China forecast for 2019 is a little bit better. So, it was down 3.5% in 2018 and the forecast that I see shows it up 1.7% in 2019. So by historical terms, that\u2019s still not a \u2013 that\u2019s still fairly low for China.","Bobby Griffin","Okay. I appreciate that detail. And then lastly for me, just from a modeling standpoint, is there any help you guys can offer on the sales wind down of Home Furniture and Fashion Bed? I know Fashion Bed was probably roughly a $200 million or so business last year and Home Furniture, half that business is motion and half stationary and that was probably around $370 million combined. How should we think about those two businesses in 2019? I understand they\u2019re going to be smaller, but from a modeling standpoint, any help would be greatly appreciated.","Mitch Dolloff","Okay, Bobby. this is Mitch. Again, I\u2019ll take a shot and when you can jump in if there\u2019s additional detail. but on the whole, let me talk about home Furniture first and I think that we\u2019re making good progress there and we\u2019ve got a lot of good activity underway in terms of passing loan price increases are shedding low margin business. We made good progress transferring production to our Chinese operations to take advantage of lower input costs and we\u2019ve been reducing overhead and operating costs and we\u2019ll move forward to further reduce excess capacity. I think you\u2019re starting to see that performance stabilize in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re moving aggressively and expect to complete the implementation largely by the end of the first half of the year.","So, for 2019 in that business, I think we do see some shrinkage of sales probably thinking about it in terms of like mid single digits, but with increased \u2013 significantly increased earnings power on that side. On the Fashion Bed side, I think we\u2019ll see more significant sales declines as we continue to trim product categories there and really focused on monetizing inventory. I would think about the sales decline they are being closer in the 20% to 30% range with probably very little earnings impact.","Bobby Griffin","Okay. I appreciate all that detail. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue and best of luck this year.","Mitch Dolloff","Thank you, Bobby.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Baugh with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","John Baugh","Thank you. Good morning. I just have two questions. I guess first 2019 guidance. Is there anything assumed around timing or rate on the antidumping situation?","Karl Glassman","John, no, we continue to be optimistic and have every reason to be optimistic. The timing with the government shutdown is pushed out until end of May for the early determination. We do expect some positive impact that don\u2019t know how to quantify us. So we just were kind of ignored it, from a guidance perspective.","John Baugh","Okay. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, could you comment on one on the flooring weakness, what you saw both in the fourth quarter and maybe for the year last year and what you\u2019re seeing right now? And then, anyway appreciate the comment about not giving us units like on box springs, and obviously they\u2019re in steep decline. But how do we think about the dollar, maybe the net dollar impact of gaining units on the adjustable side, but then losing the box springs. What\u2019s that net trade? Thank you.","Karl Glassman","I\u2019ll take the last one. Remember those two are in different segments. So they\u2019re reported differently with adjustables being in furniture and box springs being a subset of U.S. Spring in Residential. But I guess the one order is significantly positive, the average unit selling price of an Adjustable Bed is in the $200 to $300 range, higher in some cases, and of a box spring is probably $10 to $15.","Remember, that\u2019s just a steel bridge structure, so that trade is a good trade. There\u2019s other things going on in that, there are fewer bed frames sold because of the advent of box beds and platform beds, when there\u2019s fewer box springs, there\u2019s \u2013 fewer bed frames and box springs correlate, so there\u2019s just a lot going on in those markets. As it relates to flooring weakness, go ahead, Perry.","Perry Davis","Yes. John, looking at Q4, and there were a few factors that kind of played into a little bit of a down drop. First of all, we had some customers and then some secondary customers, which \u2013 secondary, I mean, down the value chain. So during the fourth quarter, mattress firm went through a, where they \u2013 a period of time where they liquidated some excessive inventories. We also had that occur among some of our major customer groups during the fourth quarter. And then, also, we feel like, based on the conversations we\u2019ve been having, that in preparation for the preliminary determinations of the dumping duties, we saw a glut of dumped Chinese mattresses that have been exported into the U.S. And so as they work through that, we think probably through the first quarter, something like that, that had an effect definitely on fourth quarter results.","The other thing, going back to Karl\u2019s comments on the effort to get in place a dumping order. With that delay, because of the government shut down being pushed out, we now feel like that somewhere around the end of February, product that is landed would be subject to the 90-day look back. And in a lot of cases that has a cooling effect, because obviously an importer of record needs to understand their cost basis whenever they\u2019re importing product. So we still believe that somewhere around the end of May or somewhere along in there, we\u2019ll see that preliminary determination, hopefully it\u2019s favorable and we\u2019ll repatriate to the U.S. product in place of some of that dumb product.","Karl Glassman","Hey, John, I think you also asked about Flooring. Flooring, the external reports on carpet sales in the fourth \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, the fourth quarter, they were down 9% in the square yards. So that led, there\u2019s obviously a high correlation between our Carpet Cushion sales and carpet sales. Again, highly correlated with the housing market in total, so I think it\u2019s just that general softness. We have not at all lost share. The answer to your question, just through January, the Flooring Products business is down about 2%, but with one fewer shipping day, so it\u2019s flattish in January.","John Baugh","Thank you for that color. Good luck.","Karl Glassman","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. One question on Elite. Do you have a better feel at this point what the purchase accounting kit in 2019 is going to be on Elite?","Matt Flanigan","Keith, this is Matt. We\u2019re still reviewing that, but the upshot is in the first quarter, we will have some inventory accounting impact, it will be a few million dollars we don\u2019t it specifically quantified. And bigger picture we currently estimate that the goodwill associated with the transaction would be something around 40% to 50% of purchase price. I don\u2019t know if that helps some of your modelling expectations, but that\u2019s all very much being finalized and you\u2019ll certainly see all that as we get the case filed.","Keith Hughes","And the amortize that goodwill over kind of what period of time, right now, there\u2019s different parts of it, but some of it drops off after like three years.","Matt Flanigan","That\u2019s just straightforward goodwill that will be on the balance sheet.","Keith Hughes","Okay. And then second question on LIFO, that was a negative here in the year as you\u2019ve discussed in the press release. Did it impact the fourth quarter? And what kind of expectations do you have in your guidance from 2019 on LIFO?","Matt Flanigan","As of \u2013 Keith, this is Matt, again. As always we start the year not assuming we have a better crystal ball than anything else, anyone else and that we assume there will be basically flat LIFO to the year neither income nor expense. You certainly heard Perry talk a bit about commodity trends right now and trends will move around all throughout the year. But at the moment, we don\u2019t have any assumption of LIFO income or expense in the guidance we provided and that\u2019s consistent with all of our past practice historically.","Wendy Watson","And I\u2019d just say, Keith, we expect full year LIFO would be lower than $31 million it was in 2018.","Keith Hughes","Okay. It will play over on the fourth quarter positive or negative?","Wendy Watson","It will \u2013 it was we had estimated at the end of the third quarter that it was going to be $33 million and when we trued-it out as of the fourth quarter, it came in at $31 million.","Matt Flanigan","So, it basically came in almost spot on with what we thought 90 days before and that rarely happens of course.","Keith Hughes","Okay.","Matt Flanigan","But if you look forward to this year, we don\u2019t anticipate nearly that magnitude of LIFO expense of 2019 and for modelling purposes here, we assume right now out of the gate that there won\u2019t be any LIFO in some of our expense.","Wendy Watson","And we\u2019ll estimate that each \u2013 we\u2019ll update that estimate each quarter.","Karl Glassman","Keith the impact to the fourth quarter of LIFO was $7 million.","Keith Hughes","Fourth quarter LIFO was $7 million. Okay $7 million negative, correct?","Matt Flanigan","Yes.","Karl Glassman","The expense, that\u2019s correct.","Keith Hughes","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Karl Glassman","You\u2019re welcome. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Moore with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Moore","Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. As it relates to Elite, it\u2019s been only a very short while now, but wondering what you\u2019ve learned, if anything good or bad, since closing the acquisition?","Karl Glassman","Dan it\u2019s \u2013 you are right, it will be just three weeks tomorrow, but a number of us were at the Las Vegas Furniture Market last week and Perry and I\u2019ve had a number of conversations as amongst ourselves and then with the Elite management team. And all I can tell you is, thank goodness that we own that business with the growth of high-grade products, the numbers of boxed bed mattresses that were displayed in Las Vegas, really it\u2019s very, very early, but the predictions that we made in our analysis of the strategies around Elite are proving true and that we\u2019re seeing a lot of box beds that are being sold or marketed to conventional brick-and-mortar environments that are very, very apparent in Las Vegas.","We\u2019re also seeing significant increased conversation around specialty foams and the attributes of specialty foams in terms of heat dissipation. So we feel, again, admittedly early, we\u2019re always cautious, but thank goodness we\u2019ve done that deal. And what a fantastic group of managers and employees in that business. Culturally, there\u2019s such an incredible connectivity that frankly we\u2019re blessed to have them on the team.","Dan Moore","Got it. And just a little bit of pencil sharpening in terms of the remaining restructuring charges, do you expect those to be front-end loaded, more evenly spread through the year, any sense there?","Karl Glassman","First-half loaded for sure, there may be a little residual into the back half, but heavily loaded to the first half.","Dan Moore","Got it. And then lastly, a little bit more philosophical, but just the thought process, understanding you are very cognizant of leverage and it\u2019s appreciated. But why automatically suspend share repurchase rather than kind of remain opportunistic given the really strong free cash flow outlook?","Karl Glassman","Dan, it almost sounds like you\u2019re trying to pick a fight between Matt and I, but \u2013 because we have that conversation, it will be very difficult based on our belief as to what the value of the equity is for us not to repurchase shares, if there\u2019s any fall off in the stock price. We are extremely bullish on the company\u2019s future and believe \u2013 well, personal opinion the stock is probably undervalued from a trade perspective right now.","So, it\u2019s difficult but we\u2019ve made a commitment to the lenders and to ourselves that we\u2019ll continue to deleverage for us to be at 3.5 times is remarkably high in either, Matt or I\u2019s history for sure, and Perry has been here longer than both of us. So it will \u2013 we\u2019ll continue to watch it but any melt off, it would be hard to pounce. But Matt and I will arm-wrestle for that one later.","Matt Flanigan","Yes. Dan. We\u2019re all certainly aligned with the considerations in order deployment of cash and capital and the very good news is our cash flow is quite predictable typically. There\u2019s some seasonality to it, but it is predictable, and we have a lot of it. So the deleveraging that we\u2019re earmarking take place over the next 12 to 18 months is something we feel very comfortable in estimating and that it will happen promptly.","Dan Moore","Okay. Understood. Appreciate the color again.","Karl Glassman","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Peter Keith","Hey, thanks. Good morning everyone. So just to follow-on that last point, the operating cash flow of $550 million is pretty big step-up from the $450 million run rate in the last two years. Could you just get us comfortable on, I guess, your comfort of that acceleration? What is the key levers you plan on pulling and what are the drivers?","Matt Flanigan","Yes, Peter, this is Matt. I\u2019ll jump in and then Wendy and Karl, Perry and Mitch certainly can amplify. But first of all, don\u2019t be surprised of course that it reflects the ECS acquisition, and we have been very clearly stating that the sales expectation that will arrive from ECS this year is estimated to be $675 million.","You also recall reading that we anticipate fully that the EBITDA margin on that sales base will be higher than the company average. So you could do math there, to see the EBITDA will be driving significantly higher from this 2018 level of $573 million that we just posted companywide for Leggett before we owned ECS.","Secondly, as you saw on the fourth quarter, once again our working capital performance strongly ended the year and I know both Mitch and Perry and certainly, Karl are working hard to be able to not ride in that 12% range of working capital, which we did most of 2018. We\u2019re working hard to make sure that improved performance of a pretty significant nature by the end of the year is sustained throughout 2019. That will naturally flush up in meaningful amount of cash. And otherwise, when you think about go further to the cash flow statement and capital expenditure is pretty predictable. We talked about M&A dialing down significantly share repurchases same as Karl just mentioned. So that circa $550 million of operating cash flow is readily correlated to the higher earnings ECS being part of the family, working capital concentration and focus and really, no surprise uses of cash on the operating side. And again, we feel very confident about that expectation that you should use in your model.","Peter Keith","Okay. Thanks, Matt. One of the bigger picture follow-up and I guess I\u2019m just referred back to the TSR target, where you are looking for historically around 7% to 10% EPS growth. And this year, at the midpoint, I guess, you are guiding for 3%. So there are sort of lots of puts and takes in the business right now, but I was hoping you could maybe just provide a high-level sweep on, what are the main challenges to not being in line with your TSR for 2019?","Wendy Watson","Yes. This is Wendy. I\u2019ll take a stab at this. If you think about EPS, it\u2019s going to be a big generator in the short-term really over at least the first three-year period for the sales growth. We expect margin to be consistent of course, share repurchases are going to be lower. But as Matt said with the strong operating performance in ECS added to expected margin improvement in our other businesses, we think we\u2019re going to be able to achieve that 11% to 14% TSR.","So think about it as long-term, we\u2019re not changing our TSR target and we\u2019re not changing the individual components of TSR. In the short-term, while we, for instance, it\u2019s been share repurchase, they\u2019ll change a little bit, but we think we position the company well to achieve that 11% to 14%.","Peter Keith","Okay. And maybe just a follow up, I guess I was even \u2013 I was speaking about earnings growth ex buyback is at 7% to 10%. So, the top-line growth is a little light, margins are kind of flat to down. If someone say, why is Leggett in that guiding a mic, could you just give us, again any broad brush strokes on what the key challenges are for this year even if those are going to go away looking out to 2020?","Karl Glassman","Yes. The key challenge is, well we have the \u2013 from an ECS perspective, we\u2019re dealing with the purchase accounting issue, which will be mitigated to some degree in time. So that\u2019s one issue, one of the challenges with doing an acquisition of that size you kind of pay for it from an accounting perspective in year one to a lesser degree in year two. There certainly is uncertainty in the macro environment, it\u2019s difficult to guide in this environment, the other good earlier good question about tariffs we don\u2019t know. Government shut downs we, don\u2019t know. Brexit impact we don\u2019t know. So, we\u2019re coming up with the best guidance that we feel comfortable putting out there. And as Wendy said, those TSR\u2019s targets are longer term and we feel very comfortable as we sit here today that we\u2019ll be in that range.","Peter Keith","Okay. I appreciate all the color, Karl. Thanks a lot.","Karl Glassman","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Bergner with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Bergner","Good morning everyone.","Karl Glassman","Good morning.","Matt Flanigan","Good morning, Justin.","Justin Bergner","I guess just to start with ECS, should I think of the increase in depreciation and amortization from sort of that $140 million run rate at the end of the year to $210 million, that step-up is almost all ECS?","Karl Glassman","Virtually all\u2026","Matt Flanigan","Yes. So, we\u2019ve had some higher capital spending as you know in the last few years, but yes, the vast majority of that is associated with ECS.","Justin Bergner","Okay. And so you\u2019re not adding back any ECS cost outside of transaction cost in your adjusted EPS framework, correct?","Karl Glassman","We are not adding back any additional \u2013 make sure I understand your question. So...","Justin Bergner","The only cost you\u2019re adding back for ECS are transaction costs?","Karl Glassman","Well, maybe at the end \u2013 and an inventory write-up phenomena and it\u2019s an accounting gap treatment that will happen in the first quarter that we\u2019ve talked about. Beyond that, there\u2019s no significant add back and cost associated with ECS.","Justin Bergner","But the inventory cost will not be added back for your adjusted EPS framework. You\u2019ll eat that cost in the first quarter.","Karl Glassman","Yes. Yes.","Justin Bergner","Okay. Should I think of the 10% sales growth for ECS in 2019, maybe a little bit less than 10% sales, because it\u2019s compared to a $611 million for the 12 months through September? I mean, it seems like when you announced the deal, you might have had expectations for sort of sales growth more in the double-digit range. Has that tapered down or the end markets caused that view to taper down?","Karl Glassman","It\u2019s not \u2013 Justin, this is Karl. It\u2019s not end market, its deflation. So, there\u2019s about 5% of the early expected growth in ECS that is being pulled back. Said differently that the chemical input cost have decreased significantly. So, the resultant sales dollars will be lower than originally expected, but the EBITDA margins will not be negatively impacted by that. So you are \u2013 your observation is correct. The forecast is about a 10% growth. If raw material input cost would have stayed neutral, we would have been looking at about a 15% growth rate.","Justin Bergner","Okay. So when you said EBITDA margin will stay similar, or do you mean EBITDA dollars will stay similar?","Karl Glassman","I should have said dollars.","Justin Bergner","Okay. That\u2019s what I thought. And then just two other non-ECS related questions. You mentioned that in the earnings framework for 2019, you\u2019ll have some benefit from the timing related to steel pricing offsetting tax, keeping your margin profile I guess pretty constant, or at least organically. And I guess I\u2019m wondering, why aren\u2019t you seeing operating leverage besides deal timing related from the 0% to 3% organic sales growth, given that you should be seeing some benefit in your Fashion Bed and Home Furniture from the actions you\u2019re taking.","Wendy Watson","Justin, we do expect to see some margin improvement from our \u2013 in the core Leggett business. Remember, ECS is going to be slightly dilutive to EBIT margins. And in addition to higher tax rate, we\u2019ve got higher interest expense and we\u2019re going to have a higher share count. So, we have a few small headwinds, if you will. But we do expect to see margin improvement in the core Leggett business.","Justin Bergner","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then lastly, any comment on Quantum Edge growth in the quarter. I think you spoke about last quarter.","Perry Davis","Justin, this is Perry. Yeah. Quantum Edge and the overall category of Comfort Core, continues to grow. For the full year last year, our Comfort Core as a percentage of our innersprings is about 46%. It was a little stronger than that in the fourth quarter. And of those, Comfort Core innersprings, in the fourth quarter, about 37% were Quantum Edge.","That continues to grow. In fact, we saw a great representation of what we call ActiveEdge, which encompasses Quantum Edge. All of those coil encased products as opposed to foaming case products, we saw a great representation of new introductions and existing product lines at the recently completed Las Vegas market. So, we believe that content gain story that we\u2019ve been preaching for some time now will continue throughout 2019.","Justin Bergner","Thank you for taking all my questions.","Karl Glassman","Thank you.","Perry Davis","Thanks, Justin.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Ms. Watson for any closing remarks.","Wendy Watson","Thank you everybody for participating today, and we\u2019ll talk to you again next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day."],"13479":["Leggett & Platt, Inc.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David DeSonier, Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations for Leggett & Platt, Incorporated. Thank you, Mr. DeSonier. You may begin.","David M. DeSonier","Good morning, and thank you for taking part in Leggett & Platt's second quarter conference call. With me this morning are the following: Dave Haffner, our CEO; Karl Glassman, who is President and Chief Operating Officer; Matt Flanigan, our Executive VP and CFO; and Susan McCoy, our Staff VP of Investor Relations. Dennis Park, who is Senior Vice President of the company and also President of the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment is also joining us this morning to participate in Q&A. As we mentioned last quarter, we plan to periodically include each of the segment presidents in these calls.","The agenda for our call this morning is as follows: Dave Haffner will start with a summary of the major statements we made in yesterday's press release. Matt Flanigan will discuss financial details and address our outlook for 2013. Karl Glassman will provide segment highlights, and finally, the group will answer any questions you have. This conference is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material. This call may not be transcribed, recorded or broadcast without our expressed permission. A replay is available from the IR portion of Leggett's website. We posted to the IR portion of the website a set of PowerPoint slides that contain summary financial information, along with segment details. Those slides supplement the information we discuss on this call, including non-GAAP reconciliations.","I need to remind you that remarks today concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results or events may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release in the section in our 10-K entitled forward-looking statements. I'll now turn the call over to Dave Haffner.","David S. Haffner","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our call. As we reported yesterday, second quarter earnings from continuing operations were $0.44 per share, up 13% versus the $0.39 per share from continuing operations that we earned in the second quarter of 2012. Same location sales grew 2% during the quarter. Unit volumes increased 3%, but were partially offset by lower trade sales from our rod mill. Unit volume growth was largely driven by strength in carpet underlay, Store Fixtures, automotive and Commercial Vehicle Products. EBIT grew and EBIT margins improved by 100 basis points to 10.3% in the second quarter, primarily from higher unit volumes. During the quarter, we exited 3 small operations, and as a result, recorded a $0.05 per share benefit in discontinued operations, primarily driven by taxes. These 3 operations collectively generated only about $15 million of annual sales during 2012, but posted slightly negative EBIT. We are also exploring possible strategic alternatives for our Commercial Vehicle Products business, one of which is the potential divestiture of that business. In late May, we acquired a small aerospace 2 fabrication business, adding to the aerospace products business unit that was formed in early 2012 with the acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube. We continue to look for opportunities to carefully grow the company through well-screened acquisitions in attractive markets.","Optimizing returns on capital employed continues to be a major focus for our operations. We ended the second quarter with working capital at 12.5% of annualized sales, which is well below our 15% target. In May, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.29 per share. 2013 marks our 42nd consecutive annual dividend increase at a compound annual growth rate of 13%. At yesterday's closing price of $31.71, the current yield is 3.7%, which is one of the highest among all of the S&P 500's dividend aristocrats. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1\/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2013, we have so far generated TSR of 19% per year on average, which currently places us in the top third of the S&P 500 companies. I'll now turn the call over to Matt Flanigan, who will discuss some additional financial details along with our outlook for the remainder of the year. Matt?","Matthew C. Flanigan","Thank you, Dave. And good morning, everyone. Operating cash flow grew during the quarter to $99 million, an increase of 22% over the second quarter of 2012. For the full year, we now expect to generate over $350 million of operating cash flow, again, comfortably exceeding the amount required of fund capital expenditures and dividends. During calendar 2013, dividends should require about $125 million of cash, which is lower than a typical year since the dividend normally paid in January 2013 was accelerated into December last year in anticipation of higher tax rates. We now expect capital expenditures in 2013 to be approximately $85 million. We repurchased 1.2 million shares of our stock in the second quarter. Consistent with our stated priorities for the use of excess cash flow, we will prudently buy back our stock, bearing in mind our level of cash generation, other potential opportunities to strategically grow the company and the overall outlook for the general economy. We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year but have established no specific repurchase commitment or timetable.","Our financial base certainly remains very strong. We ended the quarter with net debt to net capital at 29.3%, slightly below the conservative end of our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%. As we stated in yesterday's press release, sluggish demand in certain of our end markets led to a reduction in our full year guidance. We now expect sales growth between 1% and 4%, resulting in full year sales of $3.75 billion to $3.85 billion. That's versus previous guidance of $3.8 billion to $3.95 billion. Given this expected lower level of sales growth, we now anticipate 2013 earnings of $1.55 to $1.70 per share. This includes $0.05 per share from discontinued operations, which we just reported in the second quarter. Earnings from continuing operations are now expected to be between $1.50 and $1.65 per share. Our prior guidance anticipated that continuing operations would earn between $1.55 and $1.75 per share for the full year. As a reminder and for comparison purposes, we earned $1.47 of adjusted EPS from continuing operations in 2012. While we do not issue quarterly guidance, we want to remind everyone again that our store fixtures business faces a very challenging year-over-year comparison in the upcoming third quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Karl, who will provide some additional segment comments.","Karl G. Glassman","Thank you, Matt. In the Residential Furnishings segment, same location sales increased 3% in the second quarter from higher unit volumes in certain product categories and raw material related price increases in carpet underlay. In our U.S. Spring business, sales increased 2% in the quarter. Innerspring unit volumes decreased 1%, however, the growth in the Comfort Core innerspring category continued, with those higher margin units up 13% during the quarter. Our box spring volume growth outpaced the market, with units up 12%. In furniture components, sales decreased 2% in the second quarter. Volume in our seating and sofa sleeper businesses grew 6%, but was more than offset by an 8% decrease in motion hardware unit volume. Adjustable Bed units were down 14% in the quarter. Product introductions planned for next week's bedding market in Las Vegas should benefit volumes in the back half of the year. In carpet underlay, sales increased significantly in the quarter from higher unit volume and price increases implemented to recover higher raw material cost. In this segment, second quarter EBIT and EBIT margins increased slightly versus the second quarter of 2012. The benefit of higher unit volumes, favorable product mix in U.S. Spring and gains from building sales were partially offset by margin compression in our fabric converting business.","In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, same location sales increased 11% in the second quarter. As expected, strong program shipments in store fixtures drove 17% sales growth in that business. In Office Furniture components, volume was down slightly during the quarter. We are optimistic about the longer-term view for the office furniture industry, but we expect 2013 volume in this business to be somewhat soft. EBIT and EBIT margins increased versus the second quarter of 2012, reflecting higher sales in the absence of last year's restructuring related expense. As Matt mentioned in his comments earlier, we will face very strong third quarter comparison in this segment from large store fixture programs that were shipped last fall. In the Industrial Materials segment, second quarter same location sales decreased 9% due in roughly equal parts to lower trade sales in our rod mill and steel related price deflation. The decrease in trade sales of steel rod during the quarter was more than offset by an increase in intercompany rod sales, and the rod mill continues to run at 100% capacity utilization. As we've stated in past quarters, a change in the mix of rod sales from trading intercompany is generally positive to earnings since that change tends to also shift the production mix to higher value, high carbon rods. EBIT and EBIT margins for this segment increased during the quarter, primarily due to the absence of last year's acquisition-related cost, gains from equipment sales and earnings from small acquisitions.","In the Specialized Products segment, same location sales increased 7% in the second quarter. Automotive sales increased 6% with strong growth in Asia and North America, partially offset by lower demand in Europe. We also experienced strong sales growth and improving performance in Commercial Vehicle Products. Machinery volume increased slightly. EBIT and EBIT margins increased during the quarter, primarily from higher sales. Automotive industry forecast project low to mid single-digit growth in both North America and Asia this year and low single-digit declines in Europe. These forecast aggregate a global growth of 2% for the year. With content gains, we expect to outperform this industry growth rate. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave.","David S. Haffner","Thanks, Karl. As fellow shareholders, we are pleased with the company's performance since making this strategic change a few years ago. We continue to focus on the levers that influence total shareholder return, including profitable growth and margin enhancement. The very attractive Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition in 2012 and the more recent addition of other small companies to that business or another small company to that business platform are examples of our high priority on disciplined growth. In addition, the meaningful margin increase in recent years with further improvement anticipated in our current year guidance is further indication of our high priority on value creation. Despite the progress we've made, we're not content with the current level of performance, and we have implemented additional initiatives to further enhance profitable growth and EBITDA margins. And with those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier.","David M. DeSonier","That concludes our prepared remarks. We thank you for your attention, and we will be glad to answer your questions. [Operator Instructions] Claudia, we're ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Josh Borstein with Longbow Research.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","On the raw material front, could you discuss what you're seeing currently? I know some steel prices have been rising, so I was hoping to get some color on that and what the potential impact it might have.","Karl G. Glassman","Josh, this is Karl. Actually, since the third quarter of last year, steel has been flat to slightly softer biased. There has been some announced increases that are expected to go into effect sometime August, September based on about a $25 a ton scrap increase. We'll see if those increases hold. But right now, our forecast is for the third and fourth quarter show flat to slightly upward trend.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, great. And then just one more related question on steel. You mentioned in the press release some raw material price increases in the Residential segment, but some price decreases in your Industrial segment. Can you discuss the dynamics there?","Karl G. Glassman","Yes, the price increases in Residential were singularly placed in carpet underlay, where there had been a significant shortage of the scrap material that ultimately becomes rebonded carpet underlay. In the first half of this year, there were a number of price increases implemented. We now believe as we start the third quarter that we're fully recovered, the first time we've been in that position since the tail end of the fourth quarter of last year. In Industrial, there was a slight downward pressure at the rod and then wire level in the second quarter of this year. As I said earlier, we expect that there will be some reinflation in both wire and rod in the latter part of the third quarter based on currently announced increases.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, great. And then just one more for me, on the adjustable foundations, could you discuss what you're seeing in that business currently? And I think you had mentioned in April that was back on track. So just hoping to get some color on that and maybe a peek into July, what you're seeing.","Dennis S. Park","This is Dennis Park. Basically, what has occurred there, in the second quarter, there was a major promotional effort nationwide on a program that we did not participate in, and quite frankly, it was successful. We had not lost any 4 position, and next week, we will be making an introduction of 2 new programs at the Las Vegas Furniture Market, and the early reports are very positive about how that will be received in the marketplace. So we feel very good about the back half of the year.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And in July, has things -- have they picked up at all?","Dennis S. Park","They're basically flat. July is in line with what we experienced over the last -- really, over the last 6 or 8 weeks.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Daniel Moore with CJS Securities.","Daniel Moore - CJS Securities, Inc.","Last quarter, you brought up the bottom end of the guidance range, and obviously, this quarter's shifting back down slightly. Maybe just rank order the biggest change or changes in the demand environment over the last 90 days.","Karl G. Glassman","Dan, this is Karl. It's all sales related. It's across all of our businesses that I can't point to any one single business unit or certainly at a segment level. It's our expectation in April that there would be a stronger back half of the year. We did not experience that obviously in the second quarter. While we think we had a really strong second quarter from an operating performance standpoint, the one area of disappointment was lack of top line, and we're forecasting the continuation of that through the back half. Generally, we were more optimistic just a quarter ago as it relates to sales than we are today.","Daniel Moore - CJS Securities, Inc.","Okay, maybe a quick follow-up. The strides you've made in bringing down working capital are pretty remarkable. Can you maintain the 12%, 13% range of revenue? Or should we expect that trend to trend back up toward your stated 15% objective over time?","David S. Haffner","Dan, this is Dave. I'm glad you asked that question because I ask it often. Karl?","Karl G. Glassman","Dan and Dave, the answer is yes. Short of a real severe increase in raw material inflation, call it steel, there may be periods of time before we cycle through that bump up, which we did not forecast that. We have no visibility. I don't see that in the future. That's the only caveat that I continue to give to Dave and Matt, who want to continue to push our target down below 15%. Absent that, that 12.5%, 12% to 13% range is where we live. And Dan, I appreciate what you said. Our operating folks have done a really good job in that area. It's a constant area of focus, and they're incentivized to keep the working capital in line.","Matthew C. Flanigan","And I'd just add to that, that as time goes on, one of the things that we look at when we look at acquisitions, of course, is the overall use of capital and some of the businesses may have longer receivable terms and things like that. So it could be biased slightly upward or for that matter, downward, with businesses that Karl, really, and the team, the segment guys, have done just an incredible job of keeping that working capital in place.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I just want to dig back into the adjustables a little more. What is your sense of the growth rate in the industry there? Have we found a top at all in adjustable, or is it still just straight up?","Dennis S. Park","Keith, this is Dennis Park. Actually, in the second quarter, industry-wide, it seems our sales check indicate that the industry growth rate did slow, still continues to be a pretty positive category. It -- and looking at where it's going from here, we certainly feel that if you look at the attachment rate, it is still relatively low, and we think it continues to have significant upside. And our investment in new product introductions and innovation that we will be bringing out here shortly, we think we'll tap into that opportunity quite well.","Karl G. Glassman","Keith, this is Karl. I'll pile on a little bit. Very much agree with what Dennis said with an attachment rate of sub-5% and demographics of the U.S. population going forward and what we've seen in International markets, we absolutely believe that the category has a lot of upward capability in it and the second quarter was just a soft quarter.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And switching over to furniture, what kind of sense for the second half of the year are you getting from your furniture customers at this point?","Karl G. Glassman","Actually, Keith, the second quarter started pretty slow. April and May were slow. We started to see some pickup in June and I would say, collectively, the furniture manufacturers feel a little bit more bullish than the bedding side. Our domestic hardware units were up 8.5% in June. It feels like there's more strength in U.S. manufacturing, certainly, some Chinese domestic consumption softness and some softness in Europe that had a negative impact on our mechanism sales in the second quarter. But, yes, I would say that overall, we'll know more next week in the Las Vegas Market. The furniture manufacturers are pretty bullish right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Baugh with Stifel.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","My one questions is\/are, what are the issues, you mentioned Chinese local demand and Europe, I guess, impacting that motion upholstery figure? And then I'd love some color on the compression on fabric margins and what to expect there going forward.","Karl G. Glassman","John, all of the mechanisms that we sell in Europe are manufactured in Asia, and Asian -- as a matter of fact, let me separate from a furniture hardware standpoint. We gave you an aggregate at 8% number down. Domestic was up 3%. International was down 12%, and some of that is impacted by soft consumption in Europe, some of it, again, soft consumption. Domestic China is relatively a small part of the market, and we had some market share loss that is minimal, and we expect that we've anniversary-ed now in the second quarter to a maker\/user, a Chinese based maker\/user, who is using a larger percentage of their own mechanisms. And as far as fabric converting goes, there was a little bit of inflation in the first quarter, polypropylene based, and then some deflation in the second quarter. And from a competitive perspective, it looks like the market got a little ahead of itself in some price deflation activities, both Asian produced and U.S. distributed. That will normalize here in the third and fourth quarters from a year-on-year perspective. But really, what that is, is a comp issue in that the margins in the second quarter of 2012 were pretty darn healthy, and they narrowed in the beginning of the second quarter of 2013.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Herb Hardt with Monness, Crespi & Hardt.","Herbert Hardt - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","First of all, good to see you back in buying stock back. You expected that, I know. My question is the discontinued operations, are they just going to be shut down? Are you selling them off? And the follow-on is does this free up any cash of significance?","Karl G. Glassman","Herb, this is Karl. The one facility, which is a geo mold facility based in Texas, is in the process of being closed. The little CVP action was a divestiture that closed during the second quarter, and the other, which was in industrial, was a dishwasher rack business that has been closed. In terms of freeing up some cash, the answer is yes because there'll be some working capital pickup, and we will certainly gain on the sale of some of those assets.","Susan R. McCoy","Herb, I'd add, the little CVP businesses, just to be clear, is not our entire CVP unit. We've talked about that being under review. This is a small operation that was a subset of that particular business unit that was actually built during the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Apologize if we get some speaker noise behind me. I guess, my question, David, one is to kind of a larger issue of reinvigorating growth of the company, and we've been at the operating model now for a number of years, which you've done a great job on. You've delivered a lot of TSR. That way -- can you hear me?","David S. Haffner","Yes, we can hear you, Budd.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. But I'm just curious now, how do we start to see growth? I know we've got the -- we had the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition, and I just want to hear from you where you want to drive the company in terms of growing top line and the bottom line over an extended period of time for the next, maybe, 3 to 5 years.","David S. Haffner","Sure. Be happy to respond to that, Budd, and we've said fairly often recently that we want to grow our top line somewhat conservatively at 4% to 5% per year, and maybe half of that comes from GDP-type activity. The other half of it comes from other initiatives. Those initiatives, of course, include acquisitions, and just a side comment, our acquisition radar screen, if you will, is significantly more attractive at this point than it has been in the past, that, of course, coupled with the fact that we're more critical in the screening protocol that we use when we look at those acquisitions. But I feel comfortable that acquisitions and then some new product developments, which we don't talk about every new product that is developed, but generally speaking, even if a new product cannibalizes an existing product, there tends to be an incremental improvement in revenue and a simultaneous improvement in margin. So I do believe that you're going to see more on the acquisition front. I hope that you'll be comforted with the fact that we're more critical than we've ever been on what we pay for acquisitions and what their long-term strategic fit will be for the corporation and new product development. And then day in, day out, the operating people, the sales and marketing people are out there looking for ways to gain market share in the markets that we already participate in with the products that we have. And the last comment I'll make, sorry to ramble, is that we've also modified our compensation program just this year so that we will be compensated -- we're no longer issuing options. And what we're doing is we're issuing performance grants that may or may not be paid out, and they will only be paid out if we see meaningful growth in revenue above a defined target and\/or increases in EBITDA margin. And that's really what I was referring to in that brief comment in my opening comments. All those things combined, we think, will give us what we need, not just for the next 3 to 5 years, Budd, but hopefully, for a much longer period of time than that.","Karl G. Glassman","And, Budd, if I could add, on an organic opportunity standpoint, and I'll speak just to 2014, the auto statistics show 6% growth rate next year with our increased content. Our auto should grow at greater than that if that 6% industry growth holds together. The forecast for office is stronger for next year than this. Aerospace is expected to grow from a production perspective greater this -- next year than this. As long as consumer confidence holds together with the housing statistics that we're dealing with now, we're confident that we'll see continued growth in carpet underlay, and we continue to be very bullish on furniture and bedding, but it takes a confident consumer. We'll see what happens to the consumer in the back half with inefficiency of our government over the whole debt ceiling situation, which makes us a little bit nervous, but we'll see how all that plays out. Another positive trend is we are now just eclipsed 3 quarters in a row, where innersprings are growing at a faster rate than non-innerspring bedding. So the belief that innersprings are dead is proving to be not factual. So we're very, very bullish, but we're just concerned about the back half of this year.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes, to me, I think you pay more for the -- you get more value for organic growth than you do for the acquisition growth. Western Pneumatic was a fine acquisition, but it was expensive. I just would love to hear at some point in time, talk a little bit -- give us a product vitality metric or something that lets us know how we're doing in really generating new product sales for the company to deliver some organic growth that is visible to the investment community.","David S. Haffner","Yes, Budd, that's a very good point. It's Dave again. Well, I didn't bring the vitality index information in here. We do monitor that, and I apologize because I don't have it in front of me. The vitality index is up, and the way we define that is revenue generated from products that did not exist 36 months ago, and we're not talking about just changing an SKU from white to blue. It has to be a bona fide new product. So we do monitor that, and we will provide some additional information. You should make a note, and we'll talk about it next time we all get together. And we agree with you, incidentally, that generic growth is worth more than the acquisition growth. We clearly agree with that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Moore with CJS Securities.","Daniel Moore - CJS Securities, Inc.","Any update on the potential time line of divestment or sale of CVP? And then beyond that, are there other business or product lines that the board is looking at as potential divestment candidates?","David S. Haffner","Yes, Dan, we're still gathering information through the M&A department and an investment banking firm that we've engaged. We have a meeting, I guess, it's next -- I can't remember which day. Two weeks, yes, on Tuesday, week after next, to assess that situation, and that'll give us very contemporary data. And at that particular point in time, we believe we'll be able to at least cross the -- or make the decision on whether we pursue divestiture or keep it in our portfolio, and if we do, then what are the attributes of changes that we'll do. So we're not there. We're not ready to say we're definitely going to sell this business, but strategically, we think it would make sense for our shareholders to trade that business for some dollars that we could reinvest in something that would provide better returns and\/or some shares that we would buy back.","Daniel Moore - CJS Securities, Inc.","Helpful. And Susan, I'm going to take a crack at one, just being really lazy, can you perhaps quantify the EPS impact of the spike in the store fixtures demand that took place during last year's Q3?","Susan R. McCoy","Dan, we have not quantified that data externally.","Daniel Moore - CJS Securities, Inc.","Understood. Thought I'd give it a shot. Appreciate it.","David S. Haffner","Dan, I will tell you from a modeling standpoint, we expect that sales will be off about $35 million in the third quarter from a top line standpoint. I, like Susan, won't give you the EPS impact, but expect that, that's the magnitude of the top line effect.","Karl G. Glassman","Offset significantly by the other segments.","David S. Haffner","Correct. Yes, just in store fixtures.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up question. If you do sell CVP, will those proceeds just go into the normal [indiscernible] use of cash flow, or will there be a special use for those? Or what's kind of the view now?","Matthew C. Flanigan","Keith, they become generic dollars, if you will. We've got some opportunities to invest in the not-too-distant future, either in acquisitions or obviously in our shares. So we don't have them earmarked. It's not something that's driving us to generate x number of dollars that we're immediately going to redeploy. It just goes into Matt's pocket over there, and then we'll go back down when we need the cash and ask him for it for an acquisition or the share repurchase.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","One other follow-up. You had mentioned your July mattress business was more or less flat, what you've seen for the last couple months. Was there any sort of -- let me ask it this way, did you see kind of a spike on 4th of July and then kind of a tail-off after that? That's kind of been the history of the industry for the last couple years. Did that occur here again in July?","David S. Haffner","Yes, Keith, it did. It absolutely occurred over Memorial Day, and then again over the 4th of July, there's a -- some softness that builds to really pretty good holidays. But then, there's a vacuum that's created, really, before and after each one of them. So the bedding industry, both at the manufacturing and the retail level, has conditioned the consumer to only buy mattresses when they're heavily discounted and heavily promoted. So it's a little bit of a feast or famine.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","When you add it all up, you get kind of a flattish industry, is your opinion, is that right?","David S. Haffner","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Herb Hardt with Monness, Crespi & Hardt.","Herbert Hardt - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","Could you give us a breakdown of the carpet underlay business as to how much would go into residential versus commercial?","David S. Haffner","Boy, it's primarily -- Herb, it's primarily residential based, but there is a healthy mix in that we supply all types of carpet underlay. So it's residential, industrial and commercial, actually, because of the foam rubber and fiber attributes of each one of those. But off the top of my head, I don't know what that mix is.","David S. Haffner","I don't either, Herb, but I may have mentioned this previously. But on industrial applications, that is significantly biased towards the fiber and the rubber based product, whereas residential is virtually all a foam based component.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from John Baugh with Stifel.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I hit the lottery this morning. Let's see, I just wanted to clarify, I guess, Dave, that your reference, I think, it was additional initiatives, does that relate to this compensation issue for growth and\/or margin? And then, secondly, a Comfort Core question, I recall those percentage gains year-over-year being up in the 20%, 30%, 40% range in, I think, it was '13. Is that just anniversary-ing really tough numbers? Or is there something else going on there as it relates to Hybrid?","David S. Haffner","Okay. Yes, John, on the first one, the initiatives was curled because while that modified compensation program, which we feel comfortable will assist us in generating incremental sales of higher margins, is important. There are a lot of other, I mean, almost countless initiatives. A pretty good -- across the company. A pretty good example is in Dennis' group, where they've redefined the sales protocol to incentivize our salespeople to go out and gain incremental volume, which is a different compensation program than they've had in the past. Many of those types of things are happening across the board.","David S. Haffner","John, and on the Comfort Core question, first quarter sales were up 32% in units. And as we said, the second quarter was up 13%. The second quarter was a little soft. We have certainly anniversary-ed, but we would expect in the back half of the year to run at that 13% rate or greater as more lines of Hybrid or Comfort Core -- Comfort Core is used in lines other than just Hybrid. But as more products are launched, there certainly has been widespread industry acceptance to that product offering. So the rate of growth might -- probably less than long term, less than that 32%, but it still should be very healthy.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Josh Borstein with Longbow Research.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","In Office Furniture, could you say what your customers are seeing right now, their expectations for the back half of the year?","Karl G. Glassman","Yes, Josh, the BIFMA statistics show about 2% gain forecasted for 2013 across all of the categories. Seating is probably a little softer than that, maybe flat. They're starting to anniversary some stronger numbers in the first half of last year. So I would say they and we believe that the second half year-on-year comparison will be positive.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And any insight yet into what 2014 may hold?","David S. Haffner","Yes, they're forecasting about 4%, but it's early. It's mitigated somewhat by the loss of government-related spending.","Joshua Borstein - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then in Europe, you saw some nice gains in the Spring business. Again, this happened in the first quarter as well. What's causing that business to perform so well while most other things in Europe are either flat to down?","David S. Haffner","Actually, you are right. European units were up 18% in the second quarter after a strong first quarter. I will say the mix isn't as good as it was a year or so ago. So we're selling more units, but of lower average unit selling price and lower specification. The reason for our relative success in Europe is we tend to be U.K. and Northern Europe based, Scandinavian countries, where higher quality, higher average unit selling price is consumed. We don't have much of a position in the southern part of Europe. We continue to gain some share because of some currency exchange rate negatives to others that are trying to ship into the U.K., where we're really the only large producer of any size on the island.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing remarks.","David S. Haffner","We'll just say thank you.

Yesterday, we reported another quarter of strong earnings despite softer than forecasted volume. For the full year, we continue to expect record earnings per share from continuing operations, strong EBIT margins and a significant improvement in operating cash flow. Second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were$0.72 and included a net $0.06 per share benefit from unusual items. Excluding this benefit, earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.66, up 25% versus the $0.53 that we earned in the prior year. This increase reflects several factors including higher unit volume, favorable product mix, operational improvements, a lower effective tax rate and reduced share count.","Second quarter sales decreased 4% to $959 million, from divestitures and a 1% decline in same location sales. Unit volume grew 2%, but was more than offset by raw material related price decreases and currency impact, which combined to reduce sales by 3%. Adjusted EBIT grew 9% in the quarter and adjusted EBIT margin increased 170 basis points to 13.8%.","During the quarter, we settled, as plaintiff, a long-standing anti-trust claim, and received cash proceeds of $38 million. Since this claim was primarily related to the Prime-Foam business that we divested in 2007, the majority of the benefit was recognized in discontinued operations. The remaining $0.03 per share benefit related to our carpet cushion business and was recognized in continuing operations.","Late in the quarter, we completed two small divestitures. The first was a wire products operation with annual sales of approximately $50 million. This divestiture was completed in early June, and was part of the Industrial Materials segment. The second was a CVP operation with annual sales of approximately $30 million. This divestiture occurred in late June, and was part of the Specialized Product segment. The $0.05 per-share divestiture gain that we\u2019ve recognized in the second quarter related to this CVP transaction. The $0.02 per-share goodwill impairment charge that we recognized in the quarter also related to the CVP business, but was associated with the operation that remains.","During the quarter, we purchased the minority interest in our automotive joint-venture in China. This is a strong performing business that we\u2019ve controlled and operated for several years, and we are pleased to now have full ownership.","Now, on to the segments. In Residential Furnishings, second quarter same-location sales were down 6%, unit volume decreased 2%, and raw material related price deflation and currency reduced sales by 4%. Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding deflation and currency, were as follows: US Spring Component dollar sales were flat. Innerspring units decreased 4% and boxspring unit volumes were down 6%. The favorable mix shift in innersprings continued, with comfort core units up 9% during the quarter.","International Spring sales grew 6%. Furniture Component sales were down 6%, with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper business up 2% and motion hardware unit volume down 18%. Volume also increased Geo components. The segment's reported EBIT, included a $7 million benefit from the portion of the litigation settlement that was related to corporate cushion. Excluding this gain, segment EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the quarter with the impact from lower unit volume, more than offset by pricing discipline, a favorable product mix within US and European bedding, and the non-reoccurrence of last year's foam litigation expense.","In the Commercial Products segment, second quarter same-location sales decreased 4%. Growth in Work Furniture was more than offset by lower sales in adjustable bed, with those units being down 5% during the quarter. Adjustable bed sales also reflects a decrease in industry-wide AUSP, as more product introductions are occurring at lower retail price points. Segment EBIT was flat and EBIT margin increased slightly, with operation and all improvements offsetting the impact from lower sales.","In the Industrial Materials segment, second quarter same-location sales were down 13% from steel-related price decreases and lower unit volume and drawn wire. Total sales also decreased versus the prior year from two divestitures. The first was the Steel Tubing business that we sold in late 2015, and the second was the small wire products operation that I mentioned earlier.","The segment's EBIT increased in the second quarter, primarily from operational improvements, partially offset by lower unit volume. EBIT margins in the segment have improved significantly this year, and were up 350 basis points to11.1% in the second quarter. The segment's margins have structurally improved, as a result of the divestitures.","In the Specialized Product segment, second quarter same-location sales increased 9%, with a 10% volume improvement, partially offset by currency impact. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales grew 13%, machinery sales grew 4%, and commercial vehicle product same-location sales were up 29%. The Aerospace same-location sales decreased a 11% in the quarter. The segment\u2019s reported EBIT, included an $11 million divestiture gain and a $4 million goodwill impairment charge, both related to CVP. Excluding these items, EBIT grew and EBIT margins improved 360 basis points, primarily from higher volume, currency benefits and cost reductions.","I'll now turn the call over to Matt.","Matt Flanigan","Thanks, Karl, and good morning, everyone. Cash from operations was a very strong $151 million in the second quarter. Operating cash flow increased $56 million versus our second quarter last year, in part due to the collection of our $38 million of proceeds from the litigation settlement that Karl discussed. Operating cash flow also benefited from continued working capital management. We entered the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales at 10.4%.","In May, we increased the quarterly dividend by $0.02 to $0.34 per share. This was our largest quarterly increase since 2007, and marked a $0.03 per share or 9.7% increase versus the second quarter of 2015. Our target range for dividend pay-out is 50% to 60% of net earnings. Actual pay-out had been higher until last year, but with earnings growth, we are now within our targeted pay-out range. At yesterday's closing price of $54.53, the current yield is 2.5%, which is one of the higher yields among the 50 companies that comprised the S&P 500's dividend aristocrats.","During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares of our stock at an average price of $49.39, and issued 300,000 shares to employee benefit plans and option exercises. Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. During the quarter, we renewed our bank facility, which supports our commercial paper program and increased the capacity to $750 million, up from $600 million previously.","We also extended the maturity by two years to May 2021. At June 30, we had $467 million available under this program. We entered the second quarter with net debt to net capital at 37%, well within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%. We also monitored debt-to-EBITDA. At the end of June, our debt was 1.6 times our trailing-12 months adjusted EBITDA.","We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling three-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top one-third of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the three-year period that will end on December 31, 2016, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 27% per year. That performance places us within the top 6% of the S&P 500.","As we announced yesterday, we are narrowing our 2016 EPS guidance, and now expect record full-year earnings from continuing operations of $2.45 to $2.60 per share. This revised range includes the $0.06 per share of unusual items that we recognized in the second quarter, $0.03 of which was in our prior EPS range of $2.40 to $2.60.","Full-year guidance now anticipates our 2016 sales to be roughly flat with 2015 at $3.9 billion. This assumes unit volume growth in the mid-single digits, offset by 3% reduction from divestitures, net of small acquisitions and a 2% decrease from commodity deflation and currency impact. We expect another year of strong margin performance. Based upon our guidance range, our full year adjusted EBIT margin should be between 12.6% and 13.1%. Margins in the back half of the year are forecasted to be lower than our first-half margins, primarily due to the expected pricing lag associated with passing through recent inflation in commodities.","The three main assumptions that have changed from our prior guidance are: the level of unit volume growth; the divestiture impact on sales; and the tax rate. Unit volume growth is now expected to be at the lower end of our prior range, which was mid-to-high single-digit growth. First half unit volume was roughly flat versus strong prior-year comps. We expect unit volume to grow in the back half of the year. We also have more sales impact from divestitures following the two transactions that were completed in the second quarter. The $100-million decrease from the midpoint of our prior sales guidance is evenly split between lower unit volume growth and divestitures.","EPS guidance is also impacted by the lower unit volume growth assumption, but this is offset by an expected lower effective tax rate. This tax rate change is driven primarily by the new accounting treatment for stock-based compensation. The implied full-year adjusted margin of approximately 13% is consistent with the margin derived from prior guidance at the mid-single-digit unit volume growth level.","Full year cash from operations is now expected to exceed $500 million. Dividends should require about $175 million of cash and capital expenditures should approximate $130 million for the year. As has been our practice, after funding capital expenditures and dividends, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must meet stringent strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition, and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. However, we currently expect to repurchase 4 million to 5 million shares in 2016, and issue approximately 2 million shares primarily for employee benefit plans.","With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave.","David DeSonier","That concludes our prepared remarks. We thank you for your attention, and we will be glad to answer your questions. [Operator Instructions]. Melissa, we're ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Bobby Griffin","Good morning, everybody. This is Budd filling in for Bobby, I mean this is Bobby filling in for Budd. Thank you for taking my questions. It\u2019s been a long earnings season as you can tell. I\u2019m sure everybody will have a good reading the transcript with that matter, but thank you for taking my questions nonetheless. Karl, just real quickly on the reduction and kind of the unit volume expectations, can you give us a little bit of color on maybe what segments you're seeing that at more versus some other areas in the business?","Karl Glassman","Yeah, Bobby, good morning. Sometimes I don't know who I am either by the way, especially today. It's pretty broad-based that there's some softness in residential that continues, feels a little bit more like Home Furniture than Bedding at this point. The strength continues to be Automotive, but it's more of a step function change down from a macro perspective that we perceive to be impacting us. There's a - from a forecast standpoint, there's some softness in our European forecast that it's yet to be seen as to what the BREXIT impact will have, maybe we're a little pessimistic, I don't know. So that's a change from the previous forecast. But, I certainly can't isolate it to any one business unit.","Bobby Griffin","Okay, I appreciate that color. And then, just real quickly, on the raw material and kind of the pricing outlook has much changed since the last time we spoke going to the back half of the year?","Karl Glassman","Yeah, a little bit in that. If we look at second quarter to first quarter scrap, it was up in excess of $50 a ton, which is about 30%. So, as the quarter continued, we continued to see scrap inflation that will manifest itself into on the flat products side, US steel cost inflation in the third quarter, the forecast is about a 30% level. And we're now passing through pricing on the long products, the rod and wire. That impact we told you about last quarter that we have launched some of those increases, we continue to implement increases. There's no real good visibility as to how scrap is going to move in the back half of the year. It traded down slightly in July. We think August maybe flat to slightly up bias. We'll see, but really what's happened, the way to think about it, Bobby, is that commodities deflation was a tailwind and now inflation has turned into a bit of a headwind, remembering that we have about a 90-day lag of pass-through time.","Bobby Griffin","Okay. And following the 90-day lag, you should start to see some of the actual reported revenue start to reflect some of the higher prices and everything going there?","Karl Glassman","That's correct.","Bobby Griffin","Margin headwinds on a higher revenue number would be the way to think about it in our model, right?","Karl Glassman","Absolutely.","Bobby Griffin","Alright, I appreciate the detail and best of luck moving forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Moore with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Moore","Thank you, and good morning. I wanted to hone in a little bit on the Adjustable Beds. Obviously, you mentioned some introduction of lower price points, I think. Is it simply tough comps or their changing consumer buying patterns out there?","Karl Glassman","Dan, I think it's more of a tough comp issue in there. Our adjustables in 2Q15 were up 70%. So, and the fall back, actually in this quarter was very much early quarter-weighted. April was tough, and then we saw a recovery as the quarter progressed. We expect units to be positive in the back half of the year, in part because of the significant rollout of a new retail program, and frankly, the fourth quarter comps are very, very easy. So I don't think it's a step function changed at all, Consumer demand is real, I think it's just a by-product of a tough comp.","Daniel Moore","And maybe one more, just Specialized Products, obviously, auto remains really strong, commercial vehicle products in particular was strong, maybe just talk about the sustainability of those growth rates as we look out in the back half of the year.","Karl Glassman","The forecast now, by the way, the CVP business is just one single location after the series of divestitures that we've gone through. That's a Atlanta-based facility. It was actually the largest of the CVP businesses at least in recent years. Their volume had really been good. They had a very, very good first quarter as well. So, we see some pickup in demand, but I'm not willing to claim victory yet. That business is inherently choppy. Our current forecasts show a little bit softer demand in the back half, which is typical that we'll see some choppiness in that business, but everything said, it is performing much better than it had in the past.","Daniel Moore","Thank you, again, for the color.","Karl Glassman","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Rupe with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Rupe","Good morning, everyone. Nice execution.","Karl Glassman","Thank you, Mark.","Mark Rupe","As it relates to the innerspring demand, I think, Karl, you\u2019d mentioned through maybe the first part or the first three weeks of April, demand from a unit perspective was flat. So, that kind of implies May and June being a little bit tougher than that, I just wanted to confirm that. And then, how does that relate versus the Adjustable comment you made that was, April was tough, and May and June was a little bit better?","Karl Glassman","Perry, you don\u2019t you take it.","Perry Davis","Yeah, Mark, this is Perry. Although, we don't really provide color now on a period-by-period basis because it's so confusing with the different period ins amongst our customers and some of the information that's out there from an industry standpoint, but we did find it pretty choppy throughout the quarter. We had demand that was well below where we had earlier thought we would be. However, if you look at the quarter overall, in 2015, in innerspring volume, we were up 17% last year year-on-year. So, this year being down about 4%, if you took the two years and put them together, it would be a 13% rise over 2014. If somebody had told me that, that two years we double, I would [indiscernible].","Mark Rupe","Yes. Okay. And just really quickly on Furniture Hardware, I had to ask on the last quarter when it was down, I believe high singles maybe in the first quarter. The commentary was the first half with tough comps with the port issues last year, I assume it's the same answer on that tough comps, but I think given that it's minus 18, and I at least want to ask whether or not there is anything else going on from a furniture hardware component standpoint.","Perry Davis","Yeah, Mark, we did have some small benefit last year, the second quarter still pertaining to the port situation, but there have been some shifts within the market. We are seeing right now raw material, primarily steel, a delta in US versus China pricing at a - the highest level that I have seen. It's north of 40%. In some cases, on the flat steel, we're using mechanisms. We produce both here in the US and China obviously. What that has caused is a shift of product being sourced out of China over the last three or four months, we've seen a significant shift. Along with that, we've seen some bounce back by some of the manufacturers and retailers, and that they will take a product that may not be quite as high of quality as they had before, but it's still acceptable to them with that big delta in steel pricing. And we consistently are saying business volumes that are generating below last year's numbers and it's been that way pretty much for the full year.","Mark Rupe","Okay. Perry, thank you and good luck.","Susan McCoy","Thanks Mark.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dillard Watt of Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Dillard Watt","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I just wanted to maybe confirm on the change in the EBIT margin guidance. Is that solely related to the slightly lower unit volume assumption? I know, Matt, you made that comment, but I just wanted to make sure there's nothing else going on there.","Susan McCoy","Dillard, it's very much in line with what our prior guidance would have suggested if we would have then been guiding for unit volume growth to be in mid-single digit instead of mid-to-high single digit.","Dillard Watt","Okay, great. That does it for me.","Susan McCoy","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. This maybe a repeat, I've gotten disconnected a couple of times here on the call. But on LIFO, any sort of sense in the second half of the year, what that's going to look like given the inflation? Is it going to turn into a negative on the future quarters?","Susan McCoy","Keith, we booked a little over $7 million of LIFO expense in the second quarter, which was basically first half catch-up given where quantities have moved during the course of the second quarter. Our current best view of the LIFO scenario would put us in a little over $14 million for the full year, but as you well know that has a tendency to move around and we'll continue to revisit that estimate each quarter.","Keith Hughes","Okay. And I just - but the bias on that turned to the negative given the information that\u2019s going on?","Matt Flanigan","Yes. Keith, this is Matt. Basically, it's reflecting inflation that's occurred from the beginning of the year to where we find ourselves now. It gets a little bit confusing when you think about last year and all the deflation that was happening. So, LIFO is a calendar quarter sort of phenomenon. And so sure enough, just like Susan said, it was $7 million recorded in the second quarter. Full year expectation, as we stated today, is $14 million. So that means in the next two quarters, if that turns out to be exactly right, you'd see another $3.5 million of LIFO expense in 3Q and then 4Q as well.","Keith Hughes","I know this is tough for you to gauge. It could move around a lot from quarter-to-quarter just based on the various ups and downs of what's going on in steel prices, correct?","Matt Flanigan","Correct.","Keith Hughes","Thank you.","Susan McCoy","Thanks, Keith.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes the line of Herb Hardt with Monness, Crespi and Hardt. Please proceed with your question.","Herb Hardt","Good morning. I\u2019ve got two questions. One is on the pension side, with interest rates where they are, is there - what are the thoughts in terms of the next year or two as to the rollover of order volumes and higher rates come through?","David DeSonier","Herb, this is Dave. We're not forecasting any change in our mix. In the frozen plans, we're roughly 60% bond and 40% stock, and we feel pretty good about that. I mean, if you could tell me when interest rates were going to move, we would be able to forecast better what we should do with pension. But we feel pretty good with the mix we've got and we're pretty well-balanced obligations versus asset mix.","Herb Hardt","What's your assumption on discount rate?","David DeSonier","I'll have to get that, Herb. I don't recall offhand.","Herb Hardt","Okay. The next question is part of the Chinese venture that you purchased, could you give out any of the numbers on that in terms of multiple EBITDA, or sales or whatever you would pay for?","Susan McCoy","No. There's - you can see a line item in our cash flow statement that actually isn't in investing activities, because it was a JV before we had when down in the financing section, I want to say $35 million or something in that ballpark. We were already consolidating all of the sales and EBIT under the accounting rules for treating the additions and business where we had the majority ownership already. So, all that\u2019s really change in from our financials relative to the earnings profile is that, the next to last point on our income statement that used to back out the non-controlling interest is no longer going to exist, and that's really the extent of the disclosures that we'll make around it. It's pretty small, but it has been a really important part of that profile for the business unit, more and more happy to have full ownership.","Herb Hardt","Thank you very much.","Susan McCoy","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Moore with CJS securities. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Moore","Thanks again. Just turning to capital allocation, curious if the expansion of the credit facility, does it indicate any incremental likelihood of M&A activity in the next several quarters or are you simply maintaining dry powder and flexibility?","Matt Flanigan","Dan, this is Matt. Thanks for the question. A combination of things really, first of all, the market is quite receptive as you well know, and we decided it was a good time to go in and extend our facility, the additional two years out to May of 2021. We have done so much divestiture work as everyone is well aware of over the last several years. And so, we do believe that we're basically largely done with that effort, so there's an opportunity to continue, and this has always been the case to be mindful of any attractive growth opportunities that are coming through the M&A pipeline. Certainly, Karl can comment on how he views the pipeline looking right now, but we just wanted to take advantage of the market as it currently resides to make sure we have plenty of flexibility, and that really is the number one driver behind that. And sure enough, we do anticipate that we'll have perhaps a bit more opportunity to look at some growth prospects, not that we haven't been looking at them all along, but since so much of the divestiture work has now been done, that's kind of a natural opportunity it appears over the next 12 to 24 months, and of course, that credit goes up five years. So it's a nice position to be in.","Daniel Moore","Oh, the best time to taking capital is when you don't need it. So I appreciate the color, and again, congrats on a solid quarter.","Matt Flanigan","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is another follow-up from Mark Rupe with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Rupe","Hi, guys. Just a quick follow-up, and I don't believe it's been addressed, but the aerospace business was down in this quarter, and I don't remember being down in a while. I assume it's probably some timing with some of the projects but I just wanted to see if you had any comment there?","Karl Glassman","Yeah, Mark, you are right. It has not been down in the past, it actually was up greater than double digits in 2Q '15, so that's what the comp was out there. The newly acquired or more recently acquired businesses are performing very well. Those are the more value-added businesses. We'll say the French operation continues to exceed all expectations. Our people in France are doing a great job. The softness that we experienced was just some demand choppiness and it's back at the original Western nomadic investment that we made in the first quarter of 2012, and you'll remember that was just a straight tube business, and it\u2019s - just aerospace demand is inherently choppy.","Mark Rupe","Okay. And then, just one last real quick one, the wire products divestiture, the rationale, that kind of surprised me, I guess, was there some rationale in that one being divested?","Karl Glassman","Yes. There were a lot of sales and not much EBIT. The return profile wasn't acceptable. We were pleased with that divestiture that we received a long-term supply agreement with the acquirer of that business. So it was originally purchased many years ago to be a wire play. So from a future standpoint, we'll still have those wire tons to run through our operation. We just won't have the low-margin sales associated with the value-added product.","Mark Rupe","Perfect. Thank you.","Karl Glassman","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is another follow-up from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. [Operator Instructions]","Bobby Griffin","Hi, guys, it's Bobby, so I was having some issues with my headset. Thanks for letting me jump back in here. Susan, can you give us just some detail on the line items or the segments, I mean, for revenue and operating margins as we typically kind of get?","Susan McCoy","Yeah. This is steeped, and basically the current guidance would say midpoint that we've got sort of an approximate revenue guidance down $3.9 million. At this point, we would assume full year Residential Sales volume that would be down probably low single-digit. We'll have some volume growth, we think, in the segment, but we also have some first half deflation, not sure that that deflation is going to be completely overcome with price increases in the back half of the year.","Commercial will be looking at up high single digits, combination of acquisition and some volume growth. Industrial is still looking to be down quite notably, and in fact, kind of mid-20s is where it would be. But keep in mind, that they're taking the largest hit from divestitures. So, simple math would say 15%, 16% off just because of the divestitures and maybe 8% to 10% down organic, which is also a major reflection of steel deflation. And then, specialized up high single digits with continued good growth across most of that segment.","The margin profiles, interestingly enough, and it's similar to what we said before, those don't really look very different from what we said last time. In fact, Residential is still kind of 10% to 11% range, up slightly from where they were last year. Commercial up 50 to 100 basis points from last year, which would put them in the 7% to 8% range. Industrial, 10% to 11%, which is up a lot from last year we mentioned structurally a lot of improvement because of the divestitures. And then, Specialized up 100 basis points, still from where they were last year, which puts them in the high teens as well. So when you blend all that together, you're still closing in on about somewhere close to a 13% blended margin for overall.","Bobby Griffin","Thank you, guys, very helpful. I appreciate the further detail.","Operator","Thank you. Mr. DeSonier, there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the floor back to you for any final remarks.","David DeSonier","We'll just say thank you for your participation. We do appreciate your time and we'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Wendy Watson, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Ms. Watson, you may begin.","Wendy Watson","Good morning and thank you for taking part in Leggett & Platt second quarter conference call. With me today are Karl Glassman, President and CEO; Matt Flanigan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mitch Dolloff, EVP Chief Operating Officer and President of the Furniture Products and Specialized Products segment; Perry Davis, EVP and President of the Residential Products and Industrial Products segment; Susan McCoy, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations; and Cassie Branscum, Manager of IR.","The agenda for our call this morning is as follows: Karl will start with a summary of the main points we made in yesterday's press release; Matt will discuss financial details and address our outlook for 2019. Finally, the group will answer any questions that you may have.","This conference call is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material.

First, I want to thank Perry Davis for his nearly four decades of dedicated service to Leggett & Platt and congratulate him on his announced retirement early next year. Perry is a leader within Leggett and the global bedding industry with contributions too numerous to detail today. Perry is a good friend. He will be missed both personally and professionally.","Yesterday, we reported second quarter sales increased 10% to $1.21 billion. Growth from ECS and other smaller acquisitions was 16% in the quarter. Sales also increased from continuing market share and content gains in U.S. Spring where sales were up 4%. This was more than offset by lower volume from business exited in our Furniture Products segment, weak trade demand in the Industrial Products segment and softer demand in Automotive.","Organic sales declined 6% with volume down 6%. The exited business accounted for 3% of the decline. Negative currency impact offset raw material related selling increases implemented in 2018. Second quarter EBIT increased $15 million or 12% over the second quarter last year to $136 million primarily from lower raw material cost including the LIFO benefit and the ECS acquisition even after $12 million of amortization expense.","These increases were partially offset by the impact from lower volume in several businesses and other smaller items. Second quarter EBIT margin increased 20 basis points to 11.2%. Second quarter EBITDA increased $31 million over the second quarter of 2018 to $186 million and EBITDA margin increased 130 basis points to 15.3%.","Second quarter earnings per share were $0.64 up $0.01 from the second quarter last year, impacted by the items mentioned, as well as higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. We reduced our full year sales guidance due to lower than previously expected sales at ECS and low organic sales. The ECS reduction is a combination of lower volume, primarily from programs that were delayed or did not develop weakness in some of our non-bedding markets and raw material related selling price decreases. We also have shifted some production to our U.S. Spring operations.","The reduction in full year organic sales guidance is primarily from lower than previously expected production in the Automotive market and lower trade demand for steel rod and wire. In addition, we expect currency and steel-related selling price decreases to be a headwind in the back half of the year. Even with these changes, we continue to expect full year sales growth in Automotive, U.S. Spring, Aerospace, Hydraulic Cylinders and Work Furniture. Matt will discuss full year guidance details as well as our near record operating cash in the quarter later in the call. But I wanted to update you on several operational items first.","We received positive news in the quarter, related to the Mattress industry's antidumping matter on imported Chinese mattresses. The Department of Commerce made a preliminary determination that mattresses were being sold at prices that violate the United States trade laws and impose preliminary dumping duties that range from 69% to 1,732%. This should allow domestic mattress producers to compete on a more level playing field. We anticipate a final determination in the antidumping matter by the end of the year. We continue to be excited about the combined strength of ECS in our traditional Bedding business and the opportunities it presents for us going forward.","In our Home, Furniture and Fashion Bed businesses, the restructuring activities are going very well. The most significant elements of both plans are behind us and we expect to be substantially complete by the end of the third quarter. We already are seeing a positive impact from the restructuring with EBIT and EBIT margin up in the second quarter from lower fixed cost attributable to the restructuring as well as improved pricing and lower raw material cost.","We continue to expect full year restructuring related charges of $17 million with $11 million of which is non-cash. We also wanted to update you on the Automotive market. Year-to-date, production in the major global markets which are North America, Europe, China, Japan and South Korea is down 6% and is now expected to be down 3% for the full year. Based on the latest forecast, vehicle production in the second half of the year is expected to be flat with both 2018 and the first half of 2019. While global production will be significantly lower than originally forecasted and will tamper our sales growth, we expect our Automotive business to continue to significantly outperform the market.","I will now turn the call over to Matt.","Matt Flanigan","Thanks, Karl, and good morning, everyone. Operating cash flow was $172 million in the second quarter, an increase of $92 million versus the second quarter last year and within $2 million of our all-time record for a 2Q operating cash flow performance. A keen focus upon working capital levels was reflected by our quarter and adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 12.4%, which improved from both last year's second quarter and sequentially from this year's first quarter. We continue to expect our full year operating cash flow to approximate $550 million.","We are decreasing our full year capital expenditure expectations to $180 million from our prior estimate of $195 million. Dividend should require $205 million of cash. We ended the quarter with debt at 3.45 times our trailing 12-month pro forma adjusted EBITDA, which is right in line with our deleveraging plans. We have so far brought back $60 million of offshore cash in 2019 and expect to return an additional $110 million before year end.","As we announced yesterday, we are lowering our sales and EPS guidance for 2019. Full year sales are expected to be $4.7 billion to $4.85 billion or up 10% to 14% over last year. Acquisitions should add 15%. We expect organic sales to be down 1% to 5% including a 3% reduction from exited business.","Our full year earnings per share guidance range has been reduced by a nickel and is now $2.30 to $2.50 per share. Including approximately $0.10 per share of restructuring related costs and therefore adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.40 to $2.60. This decrease is due to the lower than expected sales, partially offset by decreasing steel cost.","Based upon this guidance framework, our full year adjusted EBIT margin should be 11.1% to 11.4%. This EPS guidance also assumes a full year effective tax rate of 24%, full year depreciation and amortization of $200 million, net interest of approximately $90 million and fully diluted shares of $136 million.","With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Wendy.","Wendy Watson","That concludes our prepared remarks. We thank you for your attention and we will be glad to answer your questions. In order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate, we request that you ask only one question and then yield to the next participant. If you have additional questions you are welcome to reenter the queue and we will answer those questions as well.","Dana, we're ready to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Daniel Moore with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Moore","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. And extend the congratulations to Perry. Look forward to meeting with you shortly. Wanted to focus on the -- two things; one looking at the topline guidance for vision, you gave us a number of kind of key elements is it possible to bucket or maybe rank order the biggest deltas relative to your initial guide, be it FX, lower raws, industrial auto maybe just kind of rank order those to give us a sense of the magnitude?","Susan McCoy","Dan, I would start by saying that, we've got declines again all of these businesses that you named, we've got auto down lower than we originally expected. We have more inflation -- I'm sorry deflation impact on our sales than we originally expected and currency continues to be a headwind.","The other businesses that we named, well steel industrial rod and wire business are also, I think demand in that market is softening as well. And then, I don't know Perry or Karl or Mitch one of you have anything else?","Perry Davis","Yes. And obviously ECS expectation is softer than originally thought. Right? Although weighing in ECS -- it appears that deflation impacts have stabilized at this point. So going forward second half of the year, barring any unforeseen circumstances we expect that to be relatively stable.","Q \u2013 Daniel Moore","Helpful. I am going to speak one other if I can. Shifting gears, the antidumping rules, can you help us frame what type of impact do you expect that those to have on the supply of Chinese imports as we think about 2020? And is it possible to translate in that potential for incremental growth for your overall bedding business?","Karl Glassman","Dan it's tough math because we're so early in the process. We do know that Chinese imports in May which is the last published data were down by 55% in units. There has been some upshift in places like Vietnam that admittedly don't have near the manufacturing capacity that China had.","To actually frame it that the Chinese units last year averaged 475,000 mattresses a month and much has been written about the Vietnam surge, which was 109,000 pieces in May as they start to build some capacity.","What we do know the facts are that our U.S. inner spring sales were positive in June and are positive in the first three weeks of July. We think some of that is coming from anti-dumping. We know ECS mattress unit sales are up in the 13% to 14% range year-to-date. We think some of that is the benefit of anti-dumping. We have an expectation that their growth will be greater than that in the back half as the inventory of Chinese mattresses has worked out. But -- so it's really kind of anecdotal. Things are moving in the right direction, but to try to quantify it going forward is a bit of a challenge.","Daniel Moore","Understood. That\u2019s good color. Appreciate it. And as I sneak out if you have organic volume growth on ECS for the quarter that would be helpful? Thank you. ","Susan McCoy","We don't have that detail, Dan.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Budd Bugatch","It's Budd substituting for Bobby who's in Vegas for the market.","Karl Glassman","Budd, I never thought I would hear that Budd Bugatch substituting for Bobby Griffin. My goodness, things change. Good morning, Budd.","Budd Bugatch","Things improve, Karl. Things improve. And Perry, congratulations and best wishes to you. I think I resemble your remark.","Perry Davis","Thanks, Budd.","Budd Bugatch","I guess, I want to go back to that guidance changes too. I was hoping to get maybe a little bit more detail and numerical changes that went into it. I know, its $50 million of sales decrease in the guidance to ECS. Then we only have $0.05 decrease. But my thinking deflation is greater than expected. Can we kind of pinpoint some of those numbers? Susan, I heard you give kind of a higher level of that. But I know you've got the numbers so maybe you can give us either some numerical ranges on the detail of that.","And secondly and I'll just ask this as well what does all of this says about the health of the consumer and the health of the economy how much of that factors into these guidance changes?","Susan McCoy","Budd, as far as numbers go relative to our organic guidance. What I say is at minus 1 to minus 5 the midpoint is minus 3 and that is our exited volume out of the FBG -- Fashion, Bed and Home Furniture businesses. That leaves a range of plus 2 to minus 2 around that organic expectation and those are the factors that we talked about before largely if not exclusively volume. We would expect that currency and the inflation\/deflation effect from raw materials will probably be largely offset for the full year if not slightly negative but not -- the two combined not hugely negative.","Remember in the first quarter we were the net of the two factors were up 2% and we went flat in the second quarter and probably be negative in the third and fourth quarters, but not by a lot but slightly driven by the fact that last year we were still implementing selling price increases. This year that's beginning to turn to decreases and as we anniversary last year's increases then that's going to allow those two to net to something lower than they have been so far this year. That's the amount of numeric reference or details that we're really in a position to comfortably say.","Karl Glassman","And from the health of the U.S. consumer Budd, its -- we think that the U.S. consumer is reasonably healthy. The surprise to us really is the downshift in demand in Industrial Products on wire and rod, but that's industrial demand that's -- there is too much deal capacity in this country chasing too few opportunities. We have no interest and that's trade commentary. So we have no interest in selling tons of steel at less than reasonable returns we don't need to that's not why the Steel business exists.","So that's a pull-off of demand, which is hurt our sales, but again, it isn't commentary on the U.S. consumer. We think the U.S. consumer is reasonably healthy \u2013 the healthiest consumer in the world for sure. We're seeing some greater softness certainly in the European market and the Asian markets.","Budd Bugatch","And just if I could ask you to just expand a little bit on the Automotive situation where that \u2013 where those markets have turned weak? Maybe Mitch can give us a kind of a read on what to expect in Automotive going forward that's such a profitable and growing business for you? Big disappointment to see that \u2013 those headwinds develop?","Mitch Dolloff","Sure, Budd. This is Mitch. Thanks for asking. Yeah. And that's another element the production forecast has continued to decline month-over-month and took another big step downward in July, which certainly impacts our outlook. I think now it feels like we're at a less optimistic and more realistic place with the forecast. I'm not talking about the IHS production forecast on our own. So now as Karl mentioned, a place where the production forecast, the market forecast for the second half of the year is now basically flat with the first half of 2019 as well as the second half of 2018. So when you look at the comps, it's quite impactful, right.","The second half of 2018 was down about 9% from the first half. So we are now facing less difficult comps, But \u2013 take for our business we still very pleased with it, it continues to perform very well, and our long-term outlook hasn't changed. I think with the disruption in the market that we see this year, we're not likely to get to our full 1,000 basis points over the market target, but I think we'll be able to get to something closer to 600 to 700.","So we do see the back half as being stronger for us on two factors. One as we said, here the comps are simply easier. And two, we see the back half up a bit for us not huge. I don't think anything overly optimistic at this point, but more based on the traditional program \u2013 new program launches that take place in the back half of the year. I would also say that, the profitability of this business even in this difficult environment continues to be incredibly strong and the team has done a really good job of reallocating, or taking cost out of the business as we've seen some of the growth slow in this market. And I anticipate that will offset a very, very good chunk of the impact from the volume decline that we've seen from an EBIT standpoint. So \u2013 and then you have a very positive outlook. Hope that helps?","Budd Bugatch","One thing you didn't talk about were project wins. You normally talk a little bit about that. Have they decreased this year?","Mitch Dolloff","No. But it's hard. The project \u2013 the program awards are typically heavy weighted for the back half of the year. There's not really a meaningful comparison for the \u2013 on a year-over-year basis. They're very lumpy. But as we've said before, we've won over $370 million in new awards last year that will launch over the next couple of years and last about six years. So we have a really good visibility for the long-term and we don't expect that to change.","Karl Glassman","And 2018 was a record win year for our team.","Mitch Dolloff","Well, we've had consecutive record win years for quite a while that's been around. So\u2026","Karl Glassman","Yeah. Sorry they keep on stacking up just\u2026","Budd Bugatch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. A couple of questions. First, I'm still a little confused in Automotive. So in the second half of 2019 in your guidance are you assuming you're up a little bit year-over-year? Is that what you're saying?","Mitch Dolloff","Yes, Keith. We're up somewhat in the second half year-over-year.","Keith Hughes","Okay. So just the bigger picture\u2026","Mitch Dolloff","For the full year, we end up being slightly up with the market slightly down.","Keith Hughes","Okay. So you were down about 3% to 4% in the first half. How are you getting \u2013 seems like you would be down a little bit for the year how does that work out?","Mitch Dolloff","You're right that we're down about 3% in the first half. We expect to be up more than that and be up about 3% for the full year.","Keith Hughes","So that would mean you'd have to be up mid to high single digits in second half of the year correct?","Mitch Dolloff","That's correct.","Keith Hughes","Okay.","Karl Glassman","Remember the costs are up\u2026","Mitch Dolloff","Yeah. Remember the cost comes into play as well. So that's the factor that I didn't explain very well. But you have both the easier comps, but we are up more in the second half than in the first half.","Keith Hughes","So, that gets you back to this -- regularly back to 600 basis points, 700 basis points above global build, right, is that the math?","Mitch Dolloff","Exactly. Yeah, that's right.","Keith Hughes","So, I guess what's -- really for first half of -- assuming first half of 2019 and really back into 2018, your spread there\u2019s probability come way down. What happened during that period of time? And what's causing it to reaccelerate in the second half of the 2019?","Mitch Dolloff","I think that -- it's kind of tough to put a finger on it, but you had a lot of things going on that really cause disruption in different parts of the market, right, you had Brexit impact and the WLTP emissions standards impact in Europe, which impacts particular -- disproportionate impact on certain programs, so it's not an overall market phenomenon.","Then you had China trade dispute impact and the significant decline there. You had this recent acceleration of emission standards there that has really slowed sales. You had then the tariff impact, and just the concerns in North America. So, we're inherently -- we picked this metric as sort of a long-term big picture guide post. And to compare it in a sort of detailed way on a quarter-to-quarter basis, just doesn't work very well.","We were inherently comparing market unit production of vehicles to our sales dollars, not our unit dollars, or not our units. And there's a time lag in the supply chain. So, it's inherently an imperfect comparison, but it really is just meant to say, hey, we look at where we are in the market, the size of the market and where we participate and the growth rates and our win rates that this is within expectation about the long-term growth that we have for the business.","Keith Hughes","Okay. And you -- the 1,000 basis points you already -- you've used, and well, you really haven't been that in a while as 600, 700 pick your -- something like that basis points above. Is that kind of the new normal? Or is there something that would cause it to reaccelerate back to a 1,000?","Mitch Dolloff","I'd like to see a new normal in the market, right? It's been hard to know what the market is doing when every month it's been getting a little bit worse. So, I think I'd say, we're still stand behind our 1,000 basis points target, but we'll be realistic about it. So, to get in a period of stability and if we need to adjust it, we'll be the first ones to come back to you. But for now, we stand by it.","Keith Hughes","Okay. And then finally switching to adjustables. Adjustable maths were up a couple of points in the quarter. There was some industry numbers that rolled out a week or so. Can you give me sort of a feel of what you think is going on in the adjustables market?","Mitch Dolloff","Yeah. That's a good question, Keith. I think -- we think that based on a calendar basis, remember that industry numbers the industry numbers are lagged. But on a calendar basis, I think the first quarter was down about 12% year-over-year, and we think the industry was down about 1% in Q2. I know that's a lot less than the industry numbers.","And I think there's a couple of things that are going on to impact that. We think that if we look back at the industry numbers for the second quarter of 2018, I think they were at something like a million units, which seems really, really high for that period of time. So I think that's probably throwing off the year-over-year comparison to a large degree.","And I don't mean to be critical, I say this isn't an easy task. Tracking the import data is difficult. There's multiple HTS codes. They get shifted around. So I -- we don't believe -- we certainly haven't seen negative impact anything like the industry is reporting. So, we just -- we think there's a data problem there.","Keith Hughes","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Mitch Dolloff","Thanks, Keith.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Baugh with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","John Baugh","Good morning. And Perry, congrats on the experiment. Susan good to hear your voice.","Susan McCoy","Thank you.","Perry Davis","Thanks.","John Baugh","I was wondering, you work through all of these revenue shortfall items. And particularly on the deflation, the question is simple, which of those really affected the earnings, in other words, some of the deflating items? I don't know what the timing might be in terms of the impacting your cost of goods sold, but I'm thinking it's more neutral. So I'm curious as to -- obviously, auto being soft and I guess ECS being soft would impact earnings. But if you could parse that out that would be great.","Susan McCoy","Yes. Deflation, not so much. There's a lag, both directions with the raw materials typically, with prices going -- or costs going up, our pricing typically lags and more often caught in a bit of a squeeze there. And coming down, it can work the opposite direction. You would have seen a big uptick in our LIFO benefit this quarter versus where we would have been earlier, obviously, in the first quarter. Its first time we took a swing at actually recognizing our full year estimate.","So that helped our earnings and it's built into the full year forecast now too. Now LIFO is not a unique creature that's standing out there on its own. It's going to have offsetting dynamics happening within the operations that -- so deflation has been a net positive for us so far this year. And for the volume, obviously, it's not.","Karl Glassman","But restructuring impact has been positive as well that the team has done a really good job on the restructuring and walking away from unacceptable priced low-margin business, working on our cost structure and it's -- that's kind of a thankless task. But for that team to see the bottom line positively impacted and the forecast being so from a future perspective is a really good thing, it's a much healthier business. Home Furniture is a much healthier business going forward, than it has been in the recent past.","John Baugh","And then apologize to join a couple of minutes late, if you've addressed this. But on ECS, referencing the slide, there was some volume shortfall relevant to your expectation. Did you walk through -- assume that's not deflation, there was something about program delays or something. Could you be a little bit more specific on what you see there and the dynamics of that business short-term?","Perry Davis","Yes, John. So definitely top line deflation effects that we've seen more heavily weighted in Q2, we'll see those kind of going forward. And a reset of our forecast going forward, we also have -- we have experienced a couple of programs that have either been delayed or canceled altogether. As you know, there's a lot of puts and takes and shifts of business around in the marketplace and some of those impact us, we don't talk specifically about customers, but there's been some of that also.","And then, one of the things that was a little bit unforeseen that we have experienced is, some weakness in the non-bedding part of ECS business and that's primarily related to furniture, some automotive, but furniture where we've not seen the growth that we earlier would have expected in the marketplace.","And then, also, there's a portion of that business that we're quite busy making compressed finished mattresses. The growth is -- has been plus double digits and we expect that to be the case in the back half of the year. We've actually moved some of that production capacity over to the U.S. Spring side, where we have a facility where we can make hybrids and we're seeing continued strength in demand going into the back half and expected demand in both foam and hybrid mattresses.","John Baugh","Perry, if you were -- just a follow up, on some of those programs, were either delayed or -- particularly the ones that were canceled or maybe business you didn't get that you expected to get, is there some common -- the customer found a lower price, they wanted to diversify their supply, was there some common theme?","Perry Davis","I guess, what I'd say, John, is that, where there's a lowered expectation on the ECS side, we feel like that there'll be a balancing pick up on the component side. So we really look at it as a shift it -- obviously, the finished product primarily comes through ECS. We pick up some on the Spring side, if it shifts elsewhere and so on-balance, though, it's a quite healthy situation. And like I said, I think in the back half that cadence of finished mattress business will continue to get quicker.","John Baugh","Thanks. Good luck.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Bobby Friedner","Hey, good morning everyone. It's actually Bobby Friedner on for Peter. Just wanted to follow-up on steel inflation LIFO benefit, looks like there was a nice benefit in Q2 for the first time in a few quarters. Can you talk what's baked into guidance now from a LIFO benefit standpoint for Q3 and Q4? Thanks.","Susan McCoy","Yes. Peter we have half of our full year estimate booked now at $10.4 million, so double that about $20.8 million, $21 million is our full year estimate. We'll continue to look at that as the year progresses and it will likely change, could go up, could go down, and you can assume whatever amount we haven't yet booked, we would expect to book an equal portions in the remaining quarters.","Karl Glassman","And Bobby it's important to remember that as Susan said earlier that LIFO is not a discrete accounting activity. So, there is a related FIFO impact in the operations. So, it's not like LIFO is a gift from heaven because there's a FIFO offset. Over time it's not perfectly correlated in each quarter, but over time, matches up on the FIFO side.","So, it gets to be -- year-on-year comparisons get to be a challenge because in 2017 and 2018, we were in an increasing steel environment. Now, we flipped to a decreasing steel environment, so it has the opposite impact on the LIFO and then related impact -- opposite impact on FIFO if that makes any sense. But they true up over time.","Bobby Friedner","Got it. Thanks for the color. And just one more if I can on the impact of exited business. I noticed the furniture margins swung nicely from down in Q1 to up in Q2. How should we be thinking about the overall impact from your exited businesses on both sales and EBIT for the back half of the year?","Mitch Dolloff","Bobby, this is Mitch. I think we see pretty similar impact in the back half of the year from a sales perspective and I think probably pretty similar maybe a little bit of improvement from a margin perspective.","As Karl mentioned, the team has done a great job of both planning and executing that plan and taking out overhead cost and moving through the big parts. So, the riskiest elements are behind us. It's a little tricky as we wind down fashion bed, that we've moved through a very good portion of the inventory we have there. So, we'll see definitely lower sales in the back half of the year. But I expect that we'll see a bit less decline from home furniture -- on the home furniture side as we compare that first half and the second half. So, I think probably pretty similar to what we've seen in the first half.","Bobby Friedner","All right. Thanks a lot guys and good luck.","Karl Glassman","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Herbert Hardt with Monness Crespi Hardt. Please proceed with your question.","Herbert Hardt","Good morning.","Karl Glassman","Good morning, Herb.","Herbert Hardt","I actually two questions. One is given -- I noticed your Aerospace was up 10% this quarter, but given all the problems that Boeing is having, are you involved with any of those programs?","Mitch Dolloff","Good morning, Herb. This is Mitch. We do have involvement there, but it does not have huge impact on us. As you mentioned, Boeing's reduced the production rate from about 52 per month to 42, so down about 20%. The supply chain was struggling to keep up with production anyway, so we haven't really seen the impact of that rate reduction yet.","If this continues to drag on longer than people expect, right now, the expectation deliveries will resume in early 2020 or late 2019, but who knows at this point, right? It continues to stretch a bit.","So, we sell about $1 million per month on that platform, so the 20% reduction would be about $3 million or so to us annually. So, not a huge impact and we have good content on the Airbus alternatives. So, that's good part of what's driving the good performance there.","Herbert Hardt","Thank you. My other question is, as we go into next year, let's assume that, retail doesn't hold up as well as you've been expecting and industrial tends to drift. How much room do you have for margin's erosion?","You're really good at kind of squeezing cost out. Is there a lot left over the next say 18 months if the world continues to drift?","Karl Glassman","Herb, I appreciate the compliment. And that actually is the answer. Our teams are really good in a downshift environment. Unfortunately, we learned a lot in 2008, 2009.","And all the restructuring that's taking place in parts of our business, the real difference between now and 2008 and 2009 is our portfolio, is a lot healthier today than it was then.","So, we can absolutely take cost out. We won't -- from a long-term perspective compromise product development, CapEx for efficiency reasons. So that's one of the wonderful things about Leggett is we manage from a very long-term perspective. But yes, there's an opportunity to take additional cost out.","The other thing that happens in a downshift is historically there has been significant improvement in cash generation. So, in cash it doesn't become compromised, actually it helps. So, dividend in a downshift is absolutely solid. It's very important to us going forward.","So, yeah, we don't want to learn those skills, relearn those skills. But we know how to. Automotive Mitch, I think that's a good point.","Mitch Dolloff","Yeah. What we -- the impact of 2007, 2008 has never left our mind. And so, as we've grown that business, particularly adding the capacity and new plants in Asia, we've done that with the downturn in mind.","And so we purposely sized them to be smaller, to be close to our customers to have not a lot of overheads support them from some regional centers where we can. So, if we need to take action there, we'll do that.","Matt Flanigan","And Herb, this is Matt. I'll just add to amplify what Karl said. You may have heard us mentioned in their prepared remarks that, our 2Q operating cash flow performance we just had, was $2 million within the best we've ever experienced, the best 2Q performance we ever had was in 2009.","And it's because of that unwind phenomenon. And our ability to bring home cash when things get soft and we would absolutely do that again in a notable way.","Herbert Hardt","Okay. Thank you very much.","Mitch Dolloff","Thanks, Herb.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. And I would like to turn the floor back over to Wendy Watson for closing comments.","Wendy Watson","Thank you everybody. And we'll talk to you again next quarter."],"12819":["Leggett & Platt, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Dave DeSonier, Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations. Please begin Mr. DeSonier.","Dave DeSonier","Good morning and thank you for taking part in Leggett & Platt second quarter conference call. Joining me this morning are the following: Karl Glassman, who is President and CEO; Matt Flanigan, our Executive VP and CFO; Perry Davis, EVP and President of the Residential Products and Industrial Products segments; Mitch Dolloff, EVP and President of the Furniture Products and Specialized Products segments; and Wendy Watson, our Director of Investor Relations. You will note that Susan McCoy, our VP of Investor Relations is not joining us today for the call. I can't remember when the last time Susan missed one of these. She is out of the office today attending to a medical issue.","The agenda for our call this morning is as follows. Karl will start with a summary of the major statements we made in yesterday's press release and provide segment highlights. Matt Flanigan will discuss financial details and address our outlook for the remainder of 2017 and finally the Group will answer any questions that you have.","This conference call is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material. This call may not be transcribed, recorded, or broadcast without our express permission. A replay is available from the IR portion of Leggett's website. We posted to the IR portion of the website, yesterday's press release and a set of PowerPoint slides that contain summary financial information along with segment details.

Yesterday we reported another quarter of sales growth despite weak demand in several of our businesses. For the full-year we continue to expect sales growth and strong earnings.","Second quarter sales increased 3% to $989 million. Organic sales grew 4% from continued strength in automotive and adjustable bed and raw material related price inflation. Divestitures completed in the last 12 months reduced sales 2.2%, while acquisitions added 1.8% to sales growth.","Second quarter earnings per share were $0.64 versus $0.72 in the second quarter 2016. Compared to last year's adjusted EPS of $0.66 in the second quarter, EPS declined $0.02.","Adjusted EBIT decreased in the quarter versus second quarter last year primarily due to the pricing lag associated with passing along higher raw material cost. The second quarter EBIT margin of 12.4% is a 290 basis point decrease from second quarter 2016 reported EBIT and a 140 basis points decrease from second quarter 2016 adjusted EBIT.","Price increases went into effect during the quarter to recover higher steel costs but we had not fully worked through our typical 90-day pricing lag.","Earnings and margins continue to be compressed during the second quarter but should improve over the remainder of the year. Given our second quarter results and continued softness in some of our end markets, we have narrowed our full-year EPS guidance on a 1% lower sales outlook. Matt will discuss our 2017 guidance in a few minutes.","Now to the segments. In residential products second quarter sales were flat with a 3% decrease in organic sales offset by acquisitions. Lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds reduced segment sales by 4%. Volume decreased an additional 1% offset by a 2% sales increase from raw material related price inflation.","As a reminder, the adjustable bed sales headwind will begin to anniversary in the third quarter. U.S. Spring component dollar sales were down 6%. Innerspring units were down 8% with a 2% decrease in Comfort Core units. Box spring unit volume was down 6% in the quarter. International spring sales were strong with dollars up 11%. Machinery sales decreased significantly primarily from a large sale in 2016 that did not repeat, offsetting organic growth from the other parts of the segment.","Setting aside last year's litigation gain, segment EBIT increased and EBIT margin improved primarily due to the pass-through of raw material cost increases in the second quarter and a favorable sales mix.","In the Industrial Products segment, second quarter total sales decreased 7% largely from divestitures completed during 2016. Organic sales were up 1% with steel related price increases offsetting lower volume. The industrial segments EBIT and EBIT margin are more directly affected by raw material price increases and the lag in passing those increases along. The second quarter EBIT and EBIT margin decreased due to higher raw material cost and lower volume.","In the Furniture Products segments, second quarter sales increased 7%, adjustable bed sales grew 29%, work furniture and home furniture sales also increased. These gains were partially offset by lower sales in fashion bed. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin decreased primarily from an unfavorable sales mix and raw material cost increases.","In the Specialized Products segment, second quarter organic sales increased 5% with continued strength in automotive and aerospace, partially offset by currency impacts and declines in CVP. Excluding currency changes, automotive sales grew 11% and aerospace organic sales increased 7% in the quarter. The segments EBIT and EBIT margin were down slightly with the benefit from higher volume offset by growth related costs in automotive, higher raw material cost, and other smaller items.","I'll now turn the call over to Matt.","Matt Flanigan","Thanks Karl. Good morning everyone. Cash from operations was $98 million in the quarter, a decrease of $53 million versus second quarter last year primarily due to lower earnings and increased working capital. This working capital increase resulted primarily from higher inventory to support sales growth in new programs, increased accounts receivable, and the inflation impact on both inventory and accounts receivable.","We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 11.8%. We expect our full-year operating cash to approximate $450 million as uses of cash for the full-year, capital expenditures should approximate $160 million, and dividend should require about $185 million. In May, we increased the quarterly dividend by $0.02 to $0.36 per share, a 5.9% increase versus the second quarter of 2016.","The dividend payout as a percentage of adjusted earnings is within our targeted range of 50% to 60% and we continue to expect future dividend growth to approximate earnings growth. At yesterday's closing price of $51.79 the current yield is 2.8%, which is one of the higher yields among the 51 companies that comprise the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats.","During the second quarter, we repurchased 200,000 shares of our stock and issued 200,000 shares, largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises. For the full-year, we currently expect to repurchase around 3 million shares and issue approximately 1.5 million primarily for employee benefit plans.","As always our top priorities for use of cash are organic growth, dividends, and strategic acquisitions. After funding these priorities, if there is still cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock rather than repay debt early or stockpile cash. We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year however no specific repurchase commitment or a timetable has been established.","Our financial base remains very strong. We ended the second quarter with net debt to net capital of 39%, near the high-end of our longstanding target range of 30% to 40% reflecting working capital investment in our typically large first quarter stock repurchases.","We also monitor debt-to-EBITDA and ended the quarter with debt at two times our trailing 12-months adjusted EBITDA. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of companies on a rolling three-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top one-third of the S&P 500 over the long-term which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. For the three-year period, they will end on December 31, 2017; we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 11% per year. That performance places us within the top 39% of the S&P 500.","As we announced yesterday, we lowered our sales guidance for 2017. Full-year sales are now anticipated to be $3.9 billion to $4.0 billion or up 4% to 7% versus 2016. We expect low-to-mid-single-digit volume growth from strength in automotive, adjustable bed, International Spring, Work Furniture, and Geo Components.","Raw material related price increases should also add to sales growth. The sales impact from divestitures completed during 2016 should be largely offset by acquisitions in 2017.","We are narrowing our 2017 EPS guidance and now expect full-year earnings from continuing operations of $2.55 per share to $2.65 per share versus our prior range of $2.55 to $2.75 thereby lowering the mid-point of our guidance by a nickel to $2.60.","With those comments, I will now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier.","Dave DeSonier","That concludes our prepared remarks. We thank you for your attention and we will be glad to answer your questions. In order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate, we will request that you ask only one question and then give it to the next participant. If you have additional questions please reenter the queue and we will answer those questions as well. Rob we are ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions].","Thank you. Our first question today comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse. Please shoot your question.","Susan Maklari","Good morning.","Karl Glassman","Hi Susan.","Susan Maklari","It's so good to be back.","Karl Glassman","It's great to have you back, Susan.","Susan Maklari","Yes. So from my first question can we talk a little bit about the bedding market maybe how things trended during the quarter, it sounds like Memorial Day maybe was a little softer than what had been expected and how that industry sort of positioned as we think about the back half of the year.","Perry Davis","So Susan this is Perry Davis. Yes as far as the pace during the quarter we saw our shipments of product weaken kind of as the quarter went along. June was a particularly tough month, obviously overall unit shipments down 8%. ComfortCore our category that has over the last three to four years grown significantly down too so as a percentage of what we're shipping is still a relatively high percentage and growing. I think in the quarter we shipped 36% of our shipments were in the ComfortCore category. But again we saw that the quarter get ComfortCore went along.","Now I would add to that though in looking at the last three weeks during this July now we're encouraged by some stronger year-on-year numbers that we've seen so hopefully we'll begin to see a little bit of the turmoil that's affected the industry over the first half of the year. Again to settle out and hopefully with all the four placements in place now that we can see a more normalized business right as go into the third quarter.","Susan Maklari","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then just thinking about the inflation that came through during the quarter sounds like you've got the price increases in place to sort of offset that but how are you thinking about steel prices as we go forward and maybe you know how that could impact the results?","Perry Davis","Yes, well. We had a longer-term vision obviously that's always a case with steel commodities. But right now it looks like things are relatively stable. We anticipate scrap rod pricing to be relatively stable at least through August. As you're aware there are numerous things that have been going on behind the scenes in the steel market with the potential for the 232 action by the President. There is an ongoing anti-dumping case against Tim Geographies that we will see commerce review in August.","So there is some uncertainty out there. The 232 action now looks like it's been delayed on into the first part of next year. So, I don't really know what the effects of that will eventually be but it looks like as of now that's kind of been set back on the back burner a little bit.","The dumping case if it should go through. I think there's a reasonable chance of going forward if we see scrapped fall slightly. We would probably see rod not move, if scrap goes up I believe we'll see rod goes up probably give a little bit more leverage to those rod producers in the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Robert Majek with CJS. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Majek","Just on your operating cash flow guidance to remain unchanged at $450 million or so. Was there previously cushion built in or are there some other offsetting factors that play here?","Matt Flanigan","Robert this is Matt. I mean the operating cash flow now and so for the full-year approximately $450 million is really representing a little bit higher investment in the working capital than we would have anticipated through the first half of this year. Again something we're excited about doing because those are supporting organic growth opportunities but nonetheless our DSOs out a little bit longer than we would have thought and our inventories are just a tad longer. So we feel very good about where our operating cash flow obviously is positioned and again where that cash has been going.","You'll also notice just relative to the uses of cash. We bought back most of the shares already this year. We're earmarking about $3 million for the full pace of 2017 and we're about $2.4 million thereabouts as we sit here today. So, no, no surprises on the operating cash flow story except that again working capital is a bit higher right now but we'll -- we'll make sure that's managed well.","Robert Majek","Thank you. I'll hop back in the queue.","Matt Flanigan","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Bobby Griffin","Good morning everybody. This is Bobby filling in for Budd. Thank you for taking my questions.","Karl Glassman","Good morning, Bobby.","Bobby Griffin","I just want to follow-up back on Susan's questions about bedding. I'm really just looking at the delta between U.S. Spring Component dollars and then innerspring units and it narrowed this quarter in 2Q versus 1Q which is a little bit surprising to me given all the content gains. So I was hoping that maybe just get an update on how the content gains are progressing and kind of what we should think about with that delta moving forward.","Karl Glassman","Yes, Bobby, I think the content gains that we've talked about in the past with our Quantum Edge products and with those upholstery layer, pocket spring products those things we haven't change any of our modeling around that. Those things are all good and well add content as time goes along really one of the things we didn't anticipate so much is just a general challenge in overall unit volume.","And as I said as we ended the quarter on a kind of a weak note that's been our challenge the -- I think we'll begin to see with a little bit of a pickup and again some finalization of some flooring on some of these products that now we will begin to enjoy those content gains. But they are masked by the overall macro demand environment right now.","Bobby Griffin","Okay. Is the challenge inside the industry is it facing more on kind of a lower promotional price unit in a pretty broad base I'm just trying to get a sense if some of the -- some of the customers that might have more content get being added to their units are struggling a little bit more than maybe the lower prices they don't have as much of the new technology that we saw in Las Vegas.","Karl Glassman","It's generally pretty much across the board right now. I can't say that there's one particular category such as premium or mid liner. It -- there is the pain has been a little bit spread across the board. There's no doubt that with what's happened over the last few months within the industry and the turmoil and the remixing of the ingredients it's not helped the situation.","Now we talked about last quarter, the fact that increased promotional activity in general should be good for us and we believe it is and will be. But I don't believe it's been able to this point offset the overall macro demand environment. As we go forward and that promotional activity stays at the pace it is or possibly even picks up as we get towards the Labor Day weekend selling period I think we'll begin to see the effects of that. There's no question our demand and the demand of our customers and retailers is directly correlated to the amount of promotional activity that goes on.","Bobby Griffin","I\u2019m sorry go ahead Karl.","Karl Glassman","Let me help a little bit in that, you noticed while it was probably a little scuttle, while our call on CapEx forecast for the full-year moved from $150 million to $160 million. There were, there are three drivers of that. One is continued automotive awards so that's gobbling up a little bit more the CapEx that we've been -- we expected some of it is continued growth in our International Springs primarily Europe. But the third kind of the leg of that stool is that continued penetration of both Quantum Edge and microcoils. So, the adoption of that product category by a broader subset of U.S. bed based manufacturers continues to grow.","So, to your question that it was just into Perry's point it was just a bizarrely odd unpredictable nobody could have predicted the disruption in the bedding markets in the second quarter that in no way mitigates our long-term enthusiasm for content gains.","Bobby Griffin","Okay, okay that's helpful and that's actually a good segway into my last question there about automotive appreciate the extra detail there. But just Mitch can you maybe provide us a couple examples or help us think about some of the growth investments as the new technology or kind of new product offerings or anything like that.","Mitch Dolloff","I think both. I mean we think about our products very much as technology drive in the industry towards increased Comfort content or convenience features coupled with light weighting which means smaller space, lower weight products, all that drives significant technology change for us. We think that's a very good thing. That's what we hang our head on to win. So, if some of that\u2019s fits around account both at the engineering level, at the plant level as new programs ramp up some of investment in equipment, some investment in actual plant capacity in terms of building. So that's really what drives it.","Bobby Griffin","Thank you. I appreciate all the detail and best of luck going forward.","Mitch Dolloff","Thanks, Bobby.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Peter Keith","Hey good morning team. Karl, I wanted to get your big picture perspective here you're halfway through the year, what's your view on the global consumer spending environment and are there any pockets of strength or weakness that that would stand out to you at this point?","Karl Glassman","Peter, that\u2019s interesting as I kind of deconstruct the first half which obviously done a lot of them in this last week. I tend to think of the negatives and not the positives but there are a lot of positives out there Mitch's commentary around the global auto build there is a lot of conversation, a lot of the U.S. investment community too much focuses on U.S. demand where we're so well positioned around the globe. We've seen significant auto demand recovery in Europe and forecast that going forward along with the Asian build. The commentary around the global Innerspring business, there is strength in Europe it's significant but also South America and Mexico we've had significant market share gains there as well.","So there's pockets of demand from a U.S. perspective that's probably the most disappointing consumer market and it wasn't just bedding you saw it in our fashion bed business which is highly correlated to this function in U.S. retail. But the rest of the globe seems to be performing more fully in this recovery post-recession in the U.S. right now. I don't know if it's just a step function change. The external data flow tells us that things should be better than it is at the point of sale.","Peter Keith","Okay, that's interesting and maybe just a follow-on, so with the reduction of the sales growth outlook of 1%, what areas of business are you guys revising down the most?","Karl Glassman","It's a recognition of the soft bedding environment in the second quarter and actually the first quarter was a little disappointing in U.S. bedding as well, so that would be the primary driver. Concerns about machinery has been soft albeit small, CVP certainly has underperformed. The bedding -- U.S. bedding weakness has a high correlation to the softness in our industrial materials demand while the -- you've heard us speak to the pricing power there. My goodness we could sure to use more tons. So it really is U.S. focused.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. Questions in the specialized segment in the slides you talk about the reason for the margin decline being cost associated with growth. Is that kind of a ramp up of costs associated with some of these automotive awards, you talked about the CapEx are there other things going on?","Mitch Dolloff","This is Mitch. Yes if you think about it the award cycle for automotive, we win a program a couple years ahead of start up production. We have to get production equipment ready, we have to sample off of the Live tools, so we have a lot of cost ahead of the actual zero production. Then when it starts the production it doesn\u2019t start up at full volume, it starts at lower volume and ramps up over time.","So you're sort of this constant cycle of programs ramping up and ramping down. But so in this case, we have significant investment in people, in plant, in overhead for some large new programs that aren't ramped up to full volume. So that's really had a little bit of disparity between the timing of the investment and getting up to full sales volume.","Keith Hughes","And when will those go into production or show up in sales or margins things like that?","Mitch Dolloff","It's hard to say that. I mean this sort of this constant cycle it\u2019s just that we tend to have a few large ones that are ramping up now. So we -- it\u2019s a little bit lumpy as a way to think about it right, we may -- we have to have some building expansion, we have to do have significant capital equipment or people expansion as volumes ramp up. So it's kind of part of a normal cycle, it just has to be a little bit lumpy. So we've added capacity today that will smooth out over the coming year.","Keith Hughes","And that\u2019s your segment with margins being down, exactly how our customer base will love to hear about price increases is that something you can offset some of the inflation in the second half of this year?","Mitch Dolloff","In the specialized segment, no not really, we signed up for fixed pricing, we think our -- that margin profile is still very strong in the long-term.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Spencer Joyce with Hilliard Lyons. Please proceed with your question.","Spencer Joyce","Hey good morning guys, just a quick one for me, perhaps if you could update us a little bit on the M&A pipeline and now we saw a nice little deal in Q1 that's by my math turned out pretty well so far, just any broader kind of macro updates there and maybe if we should be modeling anything into the cash flow for the back half of this year?","Karl Glassman","Yes, Spencer, from a model perspective, we've said based on last three years assume about 2% top-line growth from M&A going forward. We're pretty much there with what we've done in the first quarter. But I will say the pipeline is more robust than at any time that I can remember our corporate development people have been extremely busy. So there is a lot of opportunities that we continue to make our way through obviously we will only always make acquisitions that are strategic and add value. So we continue to be very disciplined in our analysis. But yes I would think that there would be more acquisition activity in the future than there has been in the last couple of years but the timing of acquisitions is a game that we can play, I know that there is a lot of analysis.","Spencer Joyce","Absolutely well understood and that's very helpful. Perhaps if I could just pivot very quickly to the bedding environment. Do you just talk for a second or two about what give us confidence that the weaker sales that we saw in the first half is really just an anomaly for the industry and not the results of any kind of competitors or any kind of industry permanent dislocations there?","Mitch Dolloff","I think part of it is an anomaly, the demand environment as Karl said is not where we thought we would be just a few months ago and based on some of the macro factors we see it's hard to understand why other than a lot of the disruption, there's a lot of talk still about the bed in the box phenomena. We are -- that is an area of growth in the business, I believe that is having some effect on retail. But from our standpoint, it's not something that we're overly concerned about because we participate in that. And we have recently perhaps just the last few weeks seen some indications of the folks that are participating in that market trending towards hybrid type products, an awful lot of interest right now in hybrid products and there will be introductions happening over the next several months that will bear that out.","So from the standpoint of a component supplier to that industry, we're not concerned about that detracting from our business. I would say when you look at our foundation pieces which were off during the quarter, our box spring pieces some of that is being well the macro environment has its effect. Some of that is being affected by a continuing market share gain in adjustable foundations and so that's a switch out and that switch out for us obviously overall is a good thing.","Spencer Joyce","Okay. Yes, points well taken, that is exactly what I was looking for very helpful. That's all I have. Thanks guys.","Karl Glassman","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Herb Hardt from Monness Crespi Hardt. Please go ahead with your question.","Herb Hardt","You folks have been pretty successful with acquisitions as mentioned earlier, are there any new areas you're thinking about?","Karl Glassman","Herb, you've heard our commentary on the analysis that we've done on styles of competition or areas of competitive advantage and we continue to do that analysis and analyze markets that may be more attractive to us as new growth platforms much like the analysis we did on aerospace that's now nine years ago it's hard to believe. So yes there's areas that we -- we continue to look at that we think that we can add value but it's too early to call any of them out.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Justin Berger with Gabelli. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Berger","Good morning. It's nice to be on the call.","Matt Flanigan","Hi, Justin.","Karl Glassman","Welcome Justin. Thank you.","Justin Berger","I want to adjust the change in the operating margin guidance and just try and clarify if that is mix driven, sort of priced raw material cost timing or P&L investments related to auto CapEx.","Karl Glassman","Actually Justin it's a combination of all of those things. It's a recognition that the first half was softer than we expected. So we had lack of unit growth so that's part of it in the associated overhead recovery that comes with it. I don't think it's pricing to a great degree. It's a recognition that there are some imputed cost as we grow programs so it's little bit of all of those things.","Justin Berger","Okay. But I guess if we adjust for the sort of lower tax rate, the negative leverage on the 1% volume seems larger than what would be normal so I'm trying to sort of understand beyond the volume deleverage what might be at play.","Karl Glassman","Boy, it's not like you said it's not any one thing that stands out, it's just looking at our forecast and giving a best swing from a guidance perspective and then doing the result in math.","Justin Berger","Okay. But there's no mix issue, material mix issue at play.","Karl Glassman","Not significantly mix always changes ebbs and flows but nothing no significant customer loss or program loss or market sector change so it\u2019s mix shifts or little ancillary adjustments but nothing of substance.","Justin Berger","Okay. And then on the cash flow guidance I guess you're taking up your CapEx $10 million you're claiming working capital might be a little bit more negative in the year than you thought so and then of course earnings is slightly lower so what's allowing you to keep operating cash flow guidance intact is that -- is there a cash tax impact that's going to benefit you that wasn't part of earlier guidance or something else.","Matt Flanigan","Well good question Justin. So we're guiding now on cash flow to be approximately $450 million in the first half of the year we estimated $450 million so really it's just the working capital component really that is a little bit difficult to predict just because of the pieces involved there whether it's inventory what's happening in then asset category account receivables obviously and offset by payables.","It's very clear as you know in our seasonality in that in the third fourth quarter particularly the fourth quarter is a significant timeframe where we generate cash coming out of working capital. So, as you look at the first six months of this year and having had working capital collectively bracket at about $110 million on our operating cash flow that's higher than we would expected probably about $30 million higher than we would expected at this point in time. But then again as we go through the back half of the year we expect that to be a positive number bringing down that full-year impact.","And just my opinion I think certainly there's -- there's a bias we that will do better than approximately $450 million. But we will say again some things in that mix that are a bit hard to predict but I would again reiterate just like Karl did on the capital spending side that these dollars we feel really good about where they're going because they're underpinning our organic growth game plan in many of our business units.","Justin Berger","Okay, it's just still hard for me to sort of reconcile that $10 million higher Cap Ex. I guess $7 million lower net income and call it I don't know maybe $10 million higher working capital to a relatively unchanged operating cash flow guide I mean is there some offset I'm missing. ","Perry Davis","We changed the verbit so, last quarter we would have said in excess of $450 million and today we're saying approximately $450 million. So it did come down. There's not discrete numbers that we posted that the way we speak to it has changed.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Dillard Watt with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Dillard Watt","Mitch any change on the spread you expect on global auto unit growth versus what you're going to recognize you talked a little bit about new program wins but of course I know you had things rolling also so, any change over the next 12, 18 months or even further out I guess.","Mitch Dolloff","Yes, thanks for the question. No change in our long-term outlook we've said consistently we -- our goal is to grow at 1,000 basis points over the market. We continue to do that and we see still believe our ability to do that going forward. Karl made a lot of discussion around declines unit volume year-over-year in North America. We're still performing very well in North America as well as the rest of the world so we remain very positive.","Dillard Watt","Sort of still a low-single-digit global production forecast.","Mitch Dolloff","Yes, that's right. We look at IHS vehicle production forecast and so we kind of break it up into the developed markets U.S., Europe, China, Japan, South Korea. And we see that at about 1.7% both for 2017 and if you look at it say at 16 to 20-20 CAGR right around that 1.5% or so percent. And then we\u2019d see, a little bit faster growth in the emerging markets which typically have less content than the developed markets but still as an opportunity is very much a global business for us. So that would bring global growth to up maybe a pointed to 2, 2.5 so, yes we think that\u2019s the right somewhere around 2% is probably right way to think about it.","Dillard Watt","Okay, thanks and saying in that segment couple of quarters ago I know there is some I guess some market share loss in aero business in I think that improved in the first quarter and is looking pretty good here in the in the second. Is that all sort of back on track and did you have to I know pricing was a component of that in the fourth quarter when you, when it slowed down so are we operating it maybe a little bit lower of a products margin there or where do we stand.","Karl Glassman","No, it's a good question. Thanks. I think that today we are in better position than we were in the fourth quarter. It's very business specific. So our seamless tube business is doing very well. Our fabricated tube business is doing very well. We had more trouble with our web tube business than the U.S. the fourth quarter I think we've got that stabilized today. We have had in some places where we had too aggressive margin expectations to correct those but it's not really very broad based so its I think we've, we've done a good job to stop the share loss and to get some of that product back so, I don't see any major change going forward.","Dillard Watt","Okay. And then finally on adjustables, I know in the first quarter we talked about some program wins that went in earlier than you expected obviously a very strong number here in the second quarter which is sort of disconnected from what the overall market is doing. I'm sure it's due to the program wins does that kind of slow down meaningfully in the second half. Just this you get all the stuff shipped out in the first. ","Karl Glassman","No, we just not we expect the rest of the year to continue to be very strong for us in adjustable beds.","Dillard Watt","In that you talked about mix being a margin drag is that partially due to some of it, I guess more entry level price point products that are shipping out here more recently as the high end stuff is little bit more penetrated.","Karl Glassman","It's not really an adjustable bed issue, it's more of an impact from our fashion bed business where we had significantly less sales of our threat core bending support business there so from it's true that that we see average unit selling price decrease in retail for adjustable bed base that our guys have done a really good job of keeping up with that on the cost side and the development side.","Operator","Thank you. At this time I\u2019d like to turn the floor back to management for closing remarks.","Karl Glassman","We\u2019ll just say thank you. We appreciate your time and we\u2019ll talk to you again next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David DeSonier, Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations for Leggett & Platt, Incorporated. Thank you, sir. You may now begin.","David M. DeSonier","Good morning and thank you for taking part in Leggett & Platt's first quarter conference call. With me this morning are the following: Dave Haffner, our Board Chair and CEO; Karl Glassman, who is President and Chief Operating Officer; Matt Flanigan, our Executive VP and CFO; and Susan McCoy, our Staff VP of Investor Relations. Perry Davis, who is Senior Vice President of the Company and President of the Residential Furnishings segment, is also joining us this morning to participate in Q&A.","The agenda for our call this morning is as follows: Dave Haffner will start with a summary of the major statements we made in yesterday's press release, Matt Flanigan will discuss financial details and address our outlook for 2014, Karl Glassman will provide segment highlights and finally, the group will answer any questions that you have.","This conference is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material. This call may not be transcribed, recorded or broadcast without our express permission. A replay is available from the IR portion of Leggett's website. We posted to the IR portion of the website a set of PowerPoint slides that contain summary financial information along with segment details.

Actual results or events may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements.","For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the section in our 10-K entitled forward-looking statements.","I'll now turn the call over to Dave Haffner. Thank you, Dave.","David S. Haffner","Good morning, everyone and thank you participating in our call. Yesterday we reported record first quarter earnings of $0.37 per share and 12% increase versus EPS of $0.33 in the first quarter of 2013. This increase reflects an improved mix of sales across business units and a small gain from the sale of a building. These factors were partially offset by the earnings impact of lower same location sales.","Same location sales decreased 3% during to the quarter primarily from lower volume in Store Fixtures and Commercial Vehicle Products, versus strong prior year comps in both businesses. In addition, to weather-related demand weakness in the U.S. bedding and wire markets, these declines were partially offset by continued growth in automotive residential furniture and international spring.","Consistent with market in public company commentary over the past few months, virtually all of our U.S. based businesses were negatively impacted in the first quarter by extreme winter weather. These impacts included softer than expected market demand production and transportation in efficiencies and higher energy costs. Weather-related issues subsided in the later part of the quarter in sales momentum improved notably.","Following a very soft January and February, March same location sales were up 6% and April sales should be positive as well. Karl will discuss various business impacts in his comments. Despite the first quarter challenges EBIT margin adjusted to exclude the $4 million building gain, remained at the level achieved in the first quarter of 2013. The Company has a high priority on margin enhancement and has engaged in many continues improvement, lean manufacturing and cost containment initiatives throughout the enterprise.","We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling three year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top one-third of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe we\u2019ll require in average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. So far to the three year period that will end on December 31 of 2014, we\u2019ve generated TSR of 22% per year on average, which places us just about mid-point of the S&P 500 companies.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Matt Flanigan, who will discuss some additional financial details along with our outlook for 2014. Matt.","Matthew C. Flanigan","Thanks Dave, good morning everyone. Increases in working capital from very low-end 2013 levels, led to negative operating cash of $20 million for the first quarter. This compares with positive operating cash of $24 million in the first quarter of 2013. Working capital typically increases in the first quarter and operating cash is normally added slowest quarterly levels of the year, due to the seasonal pattern of our businesses. This year, there was a larger number than usual in working capital of these factors.","Accounts receivable were impacted by the timing of sales in the quarter and growth in businesses and geographies that typically have longer payment terms. As Dave stated earlier, sales improved as the first quarter progress contributing to increase receivables towards the end of the quarter.","Inventory also increase in the first quarter, primarily from specific opportunistic raw material purchases ramp-up of new product lines and weather related transportation delays. We continue to gradually optimize accounts payable levels, but the rate of incremental improvement has slowed. We entered the first quarter with days payable outstanding at 43 days, which represented a four-day improvement compared to last year.","With these increases, we ended the quarter with working capital at 13.3% of annualized sales, slightly above the 12.9% we reported in the first quarter of 2013. But still, well below our 15% target. Based upon our current annual forecast and our normal seasonality we expect to again generate operating cash of over $350 million for the full year. Dividend should require about $170 million of cash in 2014 and capital expenditures should approximate $100 million.","Our depreciation and amortization expansion total about $120 million. With current capacity utilization rates still relatively low, our need to invest in additional productive capacity is limited. We continue to make investments for maintenance, efficiency improvement and growth in businesses and product lines where sales are strong. As volumes improve, we expect capital expenditure levels to increase. But longer term, they will likely remain at or below total depreciation and amortization.","Our incentive plans emphasize returns on capital, which include net fixed assets and working capital. This emphasis, we believe, helps ensure that we are efficiently utilizing our asset base and investing capital dollars where the highest return potential exists. Returns should continue to improve as we expand EBIT margins while controlling invested capital.","In February, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, and extended our record of consecutive annual dividend increases to 43 years. At yesterday's closing share price of $33.74, the current yield is 3.6%, which is the fourth highest among the 54 companies that comprise the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. ","In other uses of cash, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of our stock in the first quarter, at an average price of $30.25 and issued 1 million shares. Consistent with our stated priorities for the use of excess cash flow, we will prudently buy back our stock, bearing in mind our level of cash generation, other potential opportunities to strategically grow the Company and the overall outlook for the general economy.","We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year, but have established no specific repurchase commitment or timetable. Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions.","We ended the quarter with net debt and net capital at 31.5%, which is near to conservative end of our longstanding targeted range of 30% to 40%. We continue to expect sales growth to accelerate in 2014 and EBIT margins to expand. Reflecting recent strength in key markets we have raise the low end of prior earnings per share guidance by a nickel or leaving sales guidance unchanged.","Specifically, we still anticipate sales of $3.85 billion to $4.05 billion or 3% to 8% growth versus 2013. We now expect 2014, earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.85 which would represent another year of record earnings from continuing operations. This compares to adjusted continued operations EPS of $1.54 in 2013.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Karl who will provide some additional segment comments.","Karl G. Glassman","Thank you, Matt and good morning. In the residential furnishing segment, same-location sales increased 2% in the first quarter. Volume trends were mixed across the segment. In our US spring business, sales decreased 4%, inner spring unit volumes were down 6%. However, growth in comfort core inner spring category continued with those higher priced and higher margins units of 19% during the quarter. Box spring volume decreased 1%.","Sales grew 10% in international spring primarily from market share gains and increased comfort core sales in Europe. In furniture components, sales increased 6% in the first quarter, volume in our seating and sofa sleeper business grew 6%. And motion hardware unit volume was up 5%. Adjustable bed units were up slightly in the quarter. New adjustable bed programs have begun to ramp up and this should drive significant volume growth in the back half of the year.","Weather negatively impacted most of our based residential businesses early in the quarter, but especially our bedding-related operations and carpet cushion. Volume improved across the segment as the quarter progressed, and stronger demand patterns should continue as we move through the second quarter. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin for the quarter increased versus first quarter of 2013 primarily from higher sales and cost improvements.","A $4 million from a building sales in the current quarter was largely offset by the non-reoccurrence of $3 million Hurricane related insurance gain last year. In the commercial fixture and component segment, same-location sales decreased 22% in the first quarter. Store-fixture sales declined significantly due to the non-reoccurrence, as expected of certain major retailer programs from early 2013.","Volume and office furniture components grew 4% during the quarter, from a combination of new programs, and improved market demand. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin decreased versus the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to lower sales. We are disappointed with the current year demand levels in store fixtures. In the second quarter, the group sales are forecasted to be approximately $25 million lower than they were on the second quarter of 2013, due to the non-reoccurrence of major retailer programs.","In the past year, we have refocused our sales efforts in an attempt to decrease customer concentration and seasonality in this business. While we believe we are making progress with new customers, many expected new programs have been slow to start. In response, we are reducing costs in each operation to offset some of the earnings impact very soft sales.","In the industrial materials segment, first quarter same location decreased 12% primarily from lower unit volumes in wire and rod. EBIT and EBIT margin for the segment decreased during the quarter. In many of the segments' operations, but especially in wire and rod, sales volume, product efficiency, transportation, and energy costs were negatively impacted by extreme weather. These issues have begun to subside, as we move into the second quarter.","In addition, metal margins continued to be under pressure in the first quarter, as market conditions did not allow us to fully recover higher scrap costs. But we expect improvements in the back half of the year, as overall steel market conditions improve. Our domestic aerospace business, which resides in this segment, continues to perform very well, and earnings should further benefit in 2014 as we fully integrate our European acquisitions. In the specialized product segment, same-location sales grew 6% in the first quarter.","Automotive sales increased 17% from a combination of expanded content, participation in new vehicle platforms, and demand strength in each of our major geographic markets. Same location sales increased 3% in machinery. In commercial vehicle products, sales declined significantly, versus a strong first quarter of 2013. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin increased during the quarter, primarily from higher sales in the nonreoccurrence of a litigation accrual from the first quarter of last year.","With those comment, I will turn the call back over to Dave Haffner.","David S. Haffner","","Okay. Thanks Karl. As we look ahead at the balance of 2014 and beyond we continue to be very encouraged by the opportunities we are seeing in many of our markets. With consumer confidence in housing generally on an upward track our residential furniture components and bedding businesses are poised to benefit as demand in those end markets improves.","Expected global growth in the automotive production, along with new programs that we are winning should support strength in that business for the next several years. The outlook for the office furniture industry anticipates improving long-term demand, and consumer specific programs should augment that growth for us. Excuse me, customer specific programs. And customer backlogs in aerospace support industry demand strength in that business for several years into the future. ","And with those upbeat closing comments, I will turn it back over to David DeSonier.","David M. DeSonier","That concludes our prepared remarks. We appreciate your attention and we will be glad to answer any questions. In order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate, we request that you ask your single best question and then voluntarily yield to the next participant. If you have additional questions, please re-enter the queue and we will answer all of the questions that have you. Christine, we're ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Thank you, our first question comes from the line of Josh Borstein with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Josh A. Borstein \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","","Good morning everyone. Thank you for taking my questions here. In the industrial materials segment, if you back out the aerospace business, it looks like margins in the rest of the segment were perhaps mid-single digits. Can you talk about the current steel costs, the traction on some of the price increases you recently placed into the market, and also your expectations for metal margins over the next quarter or two?","Karl G. Glassman","","Yes, Josh. Good morning, this is Karl. As you recall, that scrap costs increased pretty significantly in November and December of last year. And reactive to that, we implemented price increases in both wire and rod, and actually extended into the wire-based component side of our businesses. All of those increases stuck and are in place as we speak.","Scrap has continued to inflate, or I should say re-inflate in April and May, so we have announced a new round of price increases in both rod and wire. So we expect the metal margin, while it improved as the first quarter progressed, that it will improve in the second quarter, but the real upside in that segment is in Q3 and Q4, where last year, at that time, selling prices were significantly depressed, by the importation in the market of some very low cost Chinese rods.","While scrap moved about flat. So those rods depress selling prices, an anti-dumping suit was filed against the Chinese for dumping significant quantity of rods. Those rods have stopped coming into the U.S. So we expect metal margin re-expansion certainly to be somewhat significant in the back half of the year.","Joshua Borstein \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","Thank you for that. So you have price increases, in wire and rod, you have additional price increases coming in, did you also have price increases in downstream products?","Karl G. Glassman","We did in the first quarter. Primarily in our U.S. based bedding businesses and those were certainly implemented and we were successful as we are each time we have raw material inflation.","Josh A. Borstein \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you for that. And then just a follow-on to the bedding that you touched on. You also talked about positive momentum as the quarter progressed. Does that refer to the U.S. international comfort cores or traditional inner spring or a combination of all of them?","Perry E. Davis","Well, Josh, this is Perry Davis. I will answer that question. We did see an uplift in U.S. spring as the quarter progressed. If you look back in January, a lot of this weather related, we were off in terms of inner springs in the neighborhood of 11%, in January. In February, about 9%, and then in March, about 1%. So the quarter finished about 6%.","If you look internationally, though, Karl made reference to the fact that our European spring division had a particularly good quarter. We have had growth there in the first quarter of the year, of about 14%, close to it. Our Latin spring operations are performing well. Although somewhat smaller than European spring, but about 20% growth in terms of units there. In both markets, along with U.S. spring, we're seeing a real explosion in the comfort core product category.","Josh A. Borstein \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","Okay, and on the springs, units you said were down 6%. Box springs were down only 1%. What accounts for the variance between those two things?","Perry E. Davis","Yes. A couple of things, we have seen a trend over the last few months that has begun to impact the numbers on \u2013 in terms of steel wire foundations in the marketplace. Some of the I will call it second tier or third tier bedding manufacturers that are our customers have begun to put steel back in their lines and replace some of what formally had been a would foundation. So we have seen some growth there. And then the other part of it is just some mix shifts between customers where we have more or less penetration with regards to inner springs and box springs.","","Josh A. Borstein \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","Great. I will hop back in the queue. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Keith B. Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Thank you. A couple of questions. One within the furniture components business. It is a very strong number where discretionary spending was in the first quarter. Do o you think that number is going to accelerate in terms of growth as you go through the rest of the year?","Perry E. Davis","Keith, this is Perry. I do think that we will continue to see strong growth in our furniture component business, particularly domestically. If you go back and look at the first quarter our U.S. based mechanism and business grew significantly more so than our international business. At the recent high point markets, the mood was upbeat amongst most all of the upholstered motion manufacturers, and we think we have significant growth opportunities for remainder of the year in that business unit.","Karl G. Glassman","Keith this is Karl. I\u2019ll add to it. Our people in our home furniture business has done a really job of product development and innovation. We are gaining some market share and have an ability because of some patents being issued, to push back some low cost, low performance Chinese mechanisms that were being shipped into this country. So the market is very robust. Our shares are growing and our people are doing really a solid job in that business.","Keith B. Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","And in mattress components, have you turned positive here in April? Has the trend continued the progression you gave earlier?","Perry E. Davis","Well, I wish I could say we had. It has not. We had a bit of an anomaly. In the first week of April, we just saw a significant downturn in our sales. Since then, they have rebounded and we been maintaining a pace along with last year since then, but that first week really for whatever reason dropped. Some of it could have been a little bit weather related, but really we are pretty much passed that this point.","So on a per day basis, during April, our shipments at this point are all circa 7% on inner spring volume but a lot of that again goes back to that first week of the month and since then the trends have been good.","Keith B. Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","And Perry, that's all U.S. oriented?","Perry E. Davis","That's all U.S. oriented. Our sales internationally in Europe and in Latin America continue at a pace well above last year.","Keith B. Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","And final question on it. You raised the low end of the guidance. I know you had the asset of the building sale in the quarter. Was that the driver or are there other factors that caused to you raise the limit?","Matthew C. Flanigan","That wasn't the primary factor Keith. As you know, what we do is we ask each and every profit center to go back and recheck or reanalyze their expectation for the quarter. We do that on a monthly basis. And there are some significant margin enhancing initiatives that are coming to bear. We\u2019ve got some incremental volume, of course discussed these in the past, that are now starting to reach stride, which is really helpful in some of those businesses.","So the upshot of it is we take that whole pot of reforecast and bring it forward and then we will take a look, test it at our in this room for credibility, due to some expected value analysis on it, and the numbers are better than what we originally had by some \u2013 and so just \u2013 and we've got a quarter behind us, and we should have a little more insight. So it was just a matter of analytical analysis and coming up with what appears to be a better number.","Keith Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Moore with CSJ Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Moore \u2013 CSJ Securities","Good morning. ","David S. Haffner","Hi, Dan.","Daniel Moore \u2013 CSJ Securities","Is it possible to quantify the impact that weather had in the quarter on inner spring sales in the US? And the same question for wire and rod sales.","Karl G. Glassman","Dan, this is Karl. I don't know how we would do that. Really, from U.S. inner spring, we would have to compare it to macro market demand in a normalized environment, and there is a lot of other noise going on as it relates to tax refunds and a lot of other things. So it would be difficult. On the wire rod side, weather had a significant selling price, or sales trend impact, but more importantly, was a huge issue as it relates to cost.","Our total energy costs were up about $3 million, year-on-year. Most of that was experienced in the industrial. Many of our facilities across the country in industrial and really residential, were shut down for days on end. But the big steel mill in sterling, Illinois, actually went through a 24-hour period of curtailment that was imposed on them by the electric utility.","So it is difficult Matt made reference to our working capital numbers. Our inventories are a little longer than we would expect especially in industrial material. There is wire and \u2013 I'm sorry, rod on the ground at that steel mill that we were unable to ship because of the lack of availability of rail cars. So that helps us from a guidance perspective going forward.","Daniel Moore \u2013 CSJ Securities","Very good, and that leads into the next question. Obviously, your confidence has increased with regards to the guidance on EPS. Given the start to the year on revenue, is the high-end of the range still as realistic as it was as when you went into the year? I'm just wondering why there wasn't maybe a tweak with regards to the range of guidance for the full year, for revenue.","Matthew C. Flanigan","Dan, I would answer that question, I think that there is a higher probability that we will hit the top end of the range on EPS than the probability that we will hit it on sales.","David S. Haffner","","Dan, it is Dave. As you would expect, we take that same forecasted income statement from everybody, and roll it up, I mean we would rather be a bit conservative than the other way, and so we effectively used what people rolled up to us for that.","And so hopefully it will be better than that, but again, we wanted to use the algorithm that we used as the mechanism for making that forecast. Margins are enhanced several places throughout the enterprise. And the guys won't admit it necessarily very directly, but the revenues probably a little conservative, but we're not willing at this point to bump the top line. In 90-days we will have a much better feel and if it needs to go up we will definitely bump it up at that point.","Karl G. Glassman","","Dan, this may help a little bit. To put things, as you know, we don't give quarterly guidance so you can't hold us accountable for consensus, but our internal forecast for the first quarter was sales of $955 million, even though consensus was $972 million. We knew the first quarter was going to be soft from the store fixtures and a CVP perspective. Our rollup aggregated forecast for the first quarter, and this goes back to when we gave guidance in January was for $0.37. Remembering our sales came in much softer than we originally forecasted. So roll that all together, through the process that Dave spoke to, and we thought our first quarter was pretty darn good, and have every expectation that our margins will improve at a greater rate in the back half than we originally forecasted.","Daniel Moore \u2013 CSJ Securities","Extremely helpful. I will try more and jump back in queue. Talk a little bit about the acquisition landscape. I know it is always tough to say, but what are you seeing out there, your confidence around being able to allocate capital with regard to M&A through the balance of the year?","Perry E. Davis","Yes. I will take the first stab at it, Dan, and then if Matt or Karl wants to comment, they can. There are some projects, there are some initiatives that are in the works right now, and you are right, we can't talk about them, but we like the opportunity to critically invest dollars over there before we buy shares back, as long as it meets our criteria, and there is a few that look like they're really good investments for our shareholders.","I will also say that that they're spread out amongst some of the various segments. Obviously, we're not looking to grow parts of our company that are underperforming but parts of the company that are doing very well. We are. And then also I know this is not very helpful Dan, but I will also say that it is not limited to just acquisitions here, in the United States, we're looking at some other opportunities outside the country, too. Do you guys have other things you could add?","David M. DeSonier","","No, we're pleased with the activities that are in the pipeline.","David S. Haffner","","Yes.","Daniel Moore \u2013 CSJ Securities","Very good. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Bobby K. Griffin \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.,","Good morning, everyone. This is Bobby Griffin filling in for Budd. Thank you for taking my questions.","David S. Haffner","Hi, Bobby.","Bobby K. Griffin \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.,","My first question - could you guys comment a little bit on the CVP business? I know it was up against a tough comp in quarter one, but how does the outlook for that business look going forward? And did your comps get easier in the remaining part of the year?","Karl G. Glassman","Bobby, this is Karl. The second quarter comp is forecast versus last year's actual. We expect that sales will be about $3 million less this year than last. Then the comps get much easier as the year progresses. From a CVP perspective, our opportunity more is bottom line than top at this point. We have a facility that is \u2013 has not been performing well. It is starting to slightly improve. But we need to see continued improvement in that particular facility.","Bobby K. Griffin \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.,","Perfect. And then maybe additional question on the commercial fixtures unit. It is going up against another tough headwind in Q2, but in Q3 and Q4, could we start to see something maybe get a little more normalized there and maybe even see some organic growth there in that segment?","Karl G. Glassman","Bobby, if you take the forecast out of 2Q, then I would say the back half is going to be about flat with last year. Remembering that there is not much volume. It is really a third quarter business. There is not a lot of volume that shipped in the fourth quarter. So the third quarter for that business is always the big quarter. And right now, that forecast would look like it is about on par with third quarter last year.","Bobby K. Griffin \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.,","","All right. That answers my questions. Best of luck going forward. I appreciate it.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of John Baugh with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","John A. Baugh \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.,","Good morning, Leggett team, and I think an admirable job in a tough environment.","David S. Haffner","","Thanks, John.","Matthew C. Flanigan","","Thanks, John.","John A. Baugh \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.,","Automotive, could we get a sense from you, and I know there is some considerable lead times in terms of the future, of what, if we assume flat vehicle production around the world, what your revenue gain would be in terms of content, mix, price, or whatever is going on there?","David S. Haffner","That\u2019s a good question. Its sort of like what momentum do you have if everything stopped right and it\u2019s a significant number, I don\u2019t know how to quantify it.","Matthew C. Flanigan","Yes, I would ballpark it at about 10%. So put it in the terms that you ask, if the market grow for we should grow 14 ballpark. It changes over time, but we feel pretty comfortable that we will exceed the market growth somewhat significantly.","David S. Haffner","Hey John.","John A. Baugh \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And that's, I assume, that's a calendar 2014 comment, I assume, Karl. And is there any look into 2015 or 2016?","Karl G. Glassman","No, my comment was looking into 2015, 2016. Those programs run out, you know that\u2019s there is an expectation that macro market will grow in that 3% to 4% range. So my 10% delta certainly is alive and well for 2014, should be in good shape for 2015, 2016. We start to lose some visibility but we certainly continue to gain content.","Matthew C. Flanigan","John you have heard us say before that there were a couple of positive factors that give us some gearing there. One is just overall content; the average Leggett content of an automotive or light truck interior is going up and then secondly some of that functionality or comfort and functionality is being built into a standard specification in more vehicles. So we get a double positive there. The other thing I would mention is that \u2013 and we are all or most of us are significantly impressed with the rate of growth of the Asian automotive build and the percentage of market share that we enjoy.","As Karl mentioned the team has done an outstanding job of gaining new awards all over the world, but in Asia it\u2019s almost staggering, it\u2019s so good. So anyway, I hope I didn't jinx us, but all those things bode very well and that\u2019s why I was as positive in my commentary on automotive initially in the conference call.","John A. Baugh \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you. And my follow-up is on the import duties on springs. Can you just update us on the status of that whole situation? Thank you.","Perry E. Davis","John this is Perry. As you may or may not be aware, the sun set review for the anti-dumping issue related inner springs from China, Vietnam and South Africa was reaffirmed on April 11, so that sunset review actually at an accelerated pace that was reaffirmed, overwhelmingly by the ITC, and so that will extend for another five years.","John Baugh \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Five years.

Please proceed with your question.","Herbert Hardt \u2013 Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co.","Good morning. My question is, I noticed that your equity is lower this quarter than it was in the December quarter, and also a year ago. Yet you have been profitable during the whole period. What is the accounting on that?","David S. Haffner","","Herbert, basically reflecting share repurchase activity and the impairment that we incurred at the end of last year $65 million-ish, but those are the two big aspects.","Herbert Hardt \u2013 Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question is it follow-up question from Josh Borstein with Longbow. Please proceed with your question.","Josh A. Borstein \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","On the adjustable foundations you saw a slight uptick, much better than what you were seeing in the previous year. Is that some of the positive impacts from the recent initiatives you took? I know you mentioned that would be more back-half loaded, but have you started to see it here in 1Q?","David S. Haffner","","Josh, very little of it. Really, what we saw in 1Q was strength by our \u2013 of our historic business. Those two new large programs are just starting to shift now. They won't be fully floored until just prior to Memorial Day. So it is just a recovery of our historic customers.","Josh A. Borstein \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","Okay thanks.","David S. Haffner","","Very, very enthused about that business that the products were, as you saw it, the Las Vegas furniture market extremely well received. And so from an historic basis, new programs, new products and then just the demographic trends that we're very, very bullish on adjustables going forward and that\u2019s part of the optimism in our guidance.","Josh A. Borstein \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","Okay, great. And on the office furniture piece, recently the office furniture Company has reported some pretty positive numbers. What is your sense for 2Q that you're getting from your office furniture customers right now? Do you think trends appear to be accelerating maybe beyond BIFMA low single-digit forecast for the year?","David S. Haffner","As you know Josh, that the current BIFMA forecast is for shipments of just a little bit more than 3%. I would expect our business would exceed that as it did in the first quarter, so we are bullish on that industry; BIFMA\u2019s forecast was much higher than ratcheted down, probably adjusted for weather. I would expect that their forecast, at least for 2014, would increase with the next print. And as you know they're in print at double digits in 2015. So, we\u2019ll see, but we are very bullish on the office industry, but more importantly, our position within that industry.","Josh A. Borstein \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","","And the new programs that you mentioned, could you dig into any detail about what those entail?","Karl G. Glassman","They are customer specific, so we don't generally go there. A lot of it is product development based, new programs that will be launched at NEO-CON. So we feel very comfortable with where we are. But I can't tell you about specific programs.","Josh A. Borstein \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","","And then a last one for me, on the slide deck with the guidance, I notice you took back the contribution margin back to 30% versus 25% that you had in your last quarter slide deck. And I thought that lower contribution margin last quarter was to account for pricing. Has the dynamic changed at all? What accounts for taking that contribution margin back up to 30%?","Susan R. McCoy","Josh, I think it has more to do with where we see our sales coming from. We have, as we saw in the first quarter, we have a good mix of revenues going on with where the growth is the strongest. And where we've got some softness, contribution margins, across our businesses, as you know, vary, some of them are higher than others, so I think that is a bigger issue than really in price and as you know, this is our best kind of guess at this point in year as how earnings and where the contributions are going to come from.","Josh A. Borstein \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And with respect to guidance, do you still anticipate that the midpoint the same growth rates per segment that you discussed in the \u2013 on the last conference call?","Susan R. McCoy","Let me go through that with you just real quick, josh, because no, we would have had a little bit of a shift in that, I think in residential at the mid-point of our guidance, we would be looking at revenue growth somewhere in the 4% to 5% range. Commercial, we would now expect to be negative, down somewhere in the mid-single digit range, maybe 6%, 7% negative. Industrial up, somewhere in the 6% to 7%, with about half of that coming from acquisitions. And specialized up mid teens on the strength that we have been talking about in automotive. And that basically, if you roll all that together, would get you back to around a 5% to 5.5% revenue growth at the mid-point of our guidance.","Josh A.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David DeSonier, Senior Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","David DeSonier","Good morning and thank you for taking part in Leggett & Platt's third quarter conference call. I'm Dave DeSonier. And with me today are the following; Dave Haffner, our Board Chair and CEO; Karl Glassman, who is President and Chief Operating Officer; Matt Flanigan, our Executive Vice President and CFO; and Susan McCoy, our VP of Investor Relations.","The agenda for the call this morning is as follows: Dave Haffner will start with a summary of the major statements we made in yesterday's press release; Karl Glassman will provide segment highlights; Matt Flanigan will discuss financial details, address our outlook for the remainder of 2015 and provide some general framework for 2016; and finally, the group will answer any questions that you have.","This conference is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material. This call may not be transcribed, recorded or broadcast without our express permission. A replay is available from the IR portion of Leggett's website.","We posted to the IR portion of the website a set of PowerPoint slides that contain summary financial information along with segment details. Those slides supplement the information we discuss on this call, including non-GAAP reconciliations. I need to remind you that remarks today concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements.","Actual results or events may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the section in our 10-K entitled forward-looking statements.","I'll now turn the call over to Dave Haffner.","David Haffner","Thanks, Dave. Good morning and thank you for participating in our call. We continue to be extremely pleased with our performance this year, and again reported strong quarterly results from continuing operations.","During the third quarter we achieved record levels of sales, EBIT and earnings per share. Sales from continuing operations were $1.01 billion and increased 1% over the prior year. Higher unit volume and acquisitions added 7% to year-over-year sales growth. These gains were largely offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impact, which combine to reduce sales by 6%.","We continue to benefit from the shift in bedding to Comfort Core springs, strong growth of adjustable beds and ongoing content gains and new program awards in automotive. Importantly, nearly all of our businesses again experienced volume growth in the quarter versus strong prior-year comparisons, with sales having grown 14% in the third quarter of last year.","Third quarter earnings per share were a record $0.67, up 31% from the $0.51 of adjusted EPS from continuing operations reported in the third quarter last year. Earnings grew primarily from higher unit volume and pricing discipline. EBIT increased 33% when compared to last year's adjusted EBIT and EBIT margin improved to 14%, up 330 basis points over third quarter last year.","We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on rolling three-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top one-third of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the three-year period that will end on December 31, 2015, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 23% per year, which places us in the top-29% of the S&P 500.","I'll now turn the call over to Karl.","Karl Glassman","Thank you, Dave, and good morning. Operationally, we again performed very well there in the third quarter. Margins improved in all four segments and unit volumes grew in most of our major businesses. However, commodity deflation and currency impact continue to mask some of the sales growth.","In the Residential Furnishings segment, third quarter total sales decreased 1%. Same location sales decreased 2% with 5% unit volume growth more than offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impact.","Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding acquisitions, deflation and currency, were as follows: U.S. Spring component dollar sales increased 7%. Innerspring unit volume grew 4%, with Comfort Core up 37% during the quarter. Box spring unit volume increased 3%.","International Spring sales grew 6%. Furniture component sales increased 8%, with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper businesses up 15% and motion hardware unit volume up 6%. Sales also increased in Fabric Converting and Geo Components, while volume was down marginally in Carpet Cushion.","Segment EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the quarter, due to the non-reoccurrence of last year's foam litigation expense. Excluding this prior year charge, EBIT improved slightly with the benefit from higher unit volume largely offset by FIFO impact and several smaller factors. EBIT margin in the segment is also affected by higher adjustable bed pass-through sales and lower-than-segment average margins.","In the Commercial Product segment, third quarter total sales increased 26%. Same-location sales grew 15%, primarily from continued strong performance in our adjustable bed and fashion bed business. Adjustable bed unit volume increased 55% during the quarter. Work Furniture same-location sales were down slightly in the third quarter, primarily from currency impact. Unit volume in our North American Work Furniture business was up marginally.","In early March, we acquired a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial and other settings. This business is complementary to our North American private-label operation and allows us to support our Work Furniture customers, as they expand globally. This acquisition added 11% to the segment sales growth during the third quarter. The commercial product segment EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the third quarter, primarily due to higher sales and improved operation efficiency.","In the Industrial Materials segment, third quarter sales decreased 14%, largely from steel-related price reductions. Unit volume decreased slightly with growth in Drawn Wire more than offset by lower trade sales from our rod mill. EBIT and EBIT margin increased during the quarter, primarily due to cost reductions.","In the Specialized Product segment, third quarter sales increased 5% with an approximate 10% volume improvement, partially offset by currency impact. Excluding currency changes, automotive sales increased 13%, aerospace grew 3%, machinery sales were up 8% and CVP grew 7%. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin also improved primarily reflecting higher unit volume in the non-reoccurrence of last year's litigation accrual.","I'll now turn the call over to Matt.","Matthew Flanigan","Thanks, Karl, and good morning, everyone. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $130 million. For the first nine months of 2015, operating cash flow was $257 million, an increase of $41 million or 19% of the prior year, primarily due to higher earnings.","Adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales was 9.4% at the end of the third quarter. Excluding last year's foam litigation accruals, some of which are still on our balance sheet and included in current liabilities, working capital was a very low 10.5% of annualized sales.","In August, we increased the quarterly dividend to $0.32 per share and 2015 marks our 44 consecutive annual dividend increase at a compound annual growth rate of 13%. At yesterday's closing price of $44.64, our current yield is 2.9%. We repurchased 900,000 shares of our stock in the third quarter at an average price of $45.61 and issued 200,000 shares, largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises.","Our financial base remains very strong and this gives us considerable flexibility, when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the quarter with net debt to net capital at 36%, comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%. We also monitor debt-to-EBITDA, and at the end of the third quarter our debt was 1.7x our trailing 12-months adjusted EBITDA.","Given our strong third quarter results, we are raising our full year 2015 EPS guidance and now anticipate record earnings from continuing operations of $2.15 to $2.25 per share. Our prior EPS range was $2 to $2.15.","With ongoing raw material-related price deflation and currency impact, we are lowering sales guidance to a range $3.92 billion to $3.98 billion. This revised sales range represents a 4% to 5% increase over 2014 and includes an approximate 5% negative impact from deflation and currency. Based upon this guidance, we now anticipate a full year EBIT margin between 11.9% and 12.3%, which would be our highest level since 1999.","We expect operating cash flow to exceed $375 million in 2015. Dividend should require about $170 million of cash and capital expenditures should approximate $110 million for the year.","As has been our practice, after funding dividends and capital expenditures, remaining cash flow will be prioritized towards competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must meet stringent, strategic and financial criteria.","Should no acquisitions come to fruition and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year.","No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. However, we currently expect to repurchase about 4 million shares in 2015 and issue approximately 2.2 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans and option exercises.","Regarding 2016's outlook, sales growth excluding possible acquisitions or divestitures is expected to be in the mid-single digits next year. We anticipate continued strong unit volume growth in many of our product categories, but this will likely be partially offset by commodity related price deflation, since steel prices have continued to decline throughout 2015.","Full year EBIT margin is expected to be roughly in line with 2015, as the margin benefit from higher unit volume next year is likely to be offset by the non-recurrence of the 2015 pricing lag. This framework assumes that commodity prices will stabilize near current levels. As is our typical practice, we will issue formal 2016 sales and EPS guidance, when we announce our fourth quarter results on February 1.","With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave Haffner.","David Haffner","Thanks, Matt. Before I turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier for questions-and-answers, and because this would be my last conference call, I'd like to make a few personal comments. I want to express my appreciation to all of the analysts, portfolio managers, external shareholders and other interested parties for your efforts to best understand Leggett and Platt and its various business units.","It's a great company, and is in the best shape it's been in for many years. To our customers, I am forever grateful for the business with which you favor us. Without you, we would have no mission. To our vendors, I'd like to thank you for the long lasting commitment and support that you've provided to us. And to our employee partners, both past and present, I want to sincerely thank all of you for everything you've done to make Leggett & Platt the enterprise we all care so much about. It's been an honor to be your coworker and your leader. I will miss you.","Thanks to all for participating in the discussion today. And I'll now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier.","David DeSonier","That concludes our prepared remarks. We thank you for your attention and we will be glad to answer your questions. In order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate, we request that you ask only one question and then yield to the next participant. If you have additional questions, you are welcome to reenter the queue and we will answer those questions as well.","Kevin, we are ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Keith Hughes from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Keith Hughes","The question I had was on automotive, another good quarter from automotive, and the problems in China and things of that nature. Could you just sort of state what your exposure there and what's your outlook for the automotive market is in the near term?","Karl Glassman","Our exposure to automotive in China and Greater Asia is certainly is broad based. We have large shares. There is a lot of productive capacity that exists in China for components that are then shipped to North America and to Europe. But we remain very, very bullish on automotive in general and Automotive Asia, that the current IHS expectation is that production in China will grow 1.3% this year and 4% next.","Global major market growth for next year is forecasted to be 2.8%, and really if you run it out over the next three to four years, it aggregates to an average of 3%. So with our position from a market perspective, our ability to sell our componentry into other applications in the vehicle and our continued content gains in seating, we feel very, very strong. And as we said, units were up 13% in the quarter and we expect that to continue.","Keith Hughes","And what is your percentage exposure in China for that domestic market of your automotive?","Karl Glassman","I don't know off the top of my head. It doesn't vary that much in China as compared to the other markets. I just don't know.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Budd Bugatch from Raymond James.","Bobby Griffin","This is Bobby actually filling in for Budd. And I guess, first off, Dave congratulations on your strong success and your tenure there. It's been great getting to work with you and more importantly getting to know you over the last 2.5 years here that I've been with Budd.","And then my question really is just kind of more of a high level question. We've heard some commentary from other companies this earning season about industry growth and kind of demand taking a pause in September and October. I mean, I was just curious when you look at your end markets today versus maybe how you view them six months ago, what's kind of change and what's kind of your outlook on end-market demand?","Karl Glassman","Bobby, if you look at it at a macro level that from a unit demand perspective it hasn't changed much. We knew that we were up against some very, very difficult comps in the back half of this year. That continues. We continue to be bullish. Certainly, we've had some impact from deflationary perspective, but from a unit perspective, we really feel good about our share in the market and the way the markets are positioned.","The consumer continues to be pretty confident. The confidence statistics are a little choppy. Housing same thing, you know that we continue to see housing growth. Again, month to month might be a little choppy, but the trends are positive in both ways. So we feel pretty darn good, as evidenced by the commentary from Matt on the kind of the first glance at 2016. We're forecasting 5%-ish unit growth. So things are good.","Bobby Griffin","And maybe I could sneak one more. And Karl, can you give us a little detail on the innerspring breakout as you typically do on a monthly cadence?","Karl Glassman","Again, it softened a little bit purely from a comp perspective, but in July units were up 11%, August 3%, September down about 1%. And again, September of last year was a very, very strong month, if you remember. So from a ISPA reporting perspective, they have not issued the report for September. I suspect that they will after all the public companies release at the end of next week. Their August number was, I believe units, was flattish and mattresses is up three-tenth of a percent, so we exceeded their summary of market. We expect to continue to do so in the future.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from David MacGregor from Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","Congratulations on good quarter, and David, congratulations to you on your retirement. It was pleasure working with over the years. You're leaving the company in great shape. I guess a few questions. Let me on ask my one and get back in the queue, I guess. But you talked, at least some preliminary terms about 2016 and mid-single digit growth. I guess clarification. Does that mid single-digits include the FX and deflation? And then secondly, I guess just when do we anniversary easier compares with respect to the deflation in currency, in which quarter of '16?","Karl Glassman","David, that's a forecast of 5% unit growth. From a currency perspective, we'll anniversary most of that by the end of this year. From a deflationary perspective, we will not anniversary it in calendar '16. And you know the steel markets very, very well. Scrap rated off in October. We expect that there will be some selling price deflation in the remainder the fourth quarter and from a component perspective into the first quarter of next year. So from a comp perspective, we'll be dealing with it virtually all of next year.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from John Baugh from Stifel.","John Baugh","My first question pertains to adjustables. When do we start lapping some of the program gains there, or maybe asking it in a different way, any kind of sense of where comps, if there were such a thing, on adjustables are and where you expect them to go over the next four or some quarters?","Karl Glassman","We have anniversaried the pick up of those programs. Interestingly enough, we actually did that July 1, so to experience that strong 55% unit growth in the third quarter is notable. We believe based on industry statistics, as you'll remember that ISPA published adjustable bed information for last year and forecasted the industry or indicated the industry was growing just over 30%. We expect that growth going forward. And we expect with our market leading position and our innovation that we'll continue to lead that market.","John Baugh","And on that product line, I understand the pass-through, so the residential that dilutes margin. But when we think about the overall margin to that consolidated company, is that a trade down in line with the average trade up?","Karl Glassman","It would be just slightly aggregate everything together, just slightly below the corporate average. It is very, very good business.","John Baugh","And then my last question, quickly just elaborate a little bit. I understand the price lag, but maybe just talk us through the quarters this year and the benefits this year and kind of how that plays out into '16?","Karl Glassman","Think in terms of about a 90-day lag. So as steel has continued to deflate through the year, really started in the fourth quarter of '14, that there is at the rod and wire level, there is a shorter than 90-day lag. At the component level it averages about 90 days. So based on what we know today and forecasting steel pricing is a guess at this point, but we expect that some time in first quarter of next year that everything will levelize.","I keep thinking that steel can't get any further deeper and scrap cost can't fall anymore, and you heard what I said about October deflation. But at some point, you've read a lot of information out of China. Even the Chinese admit that they're not making money in the steel industry. It's a tough business right now. If it wasn't for our connectivity to value-added products, it would be challenging for us. So it will all true-up, we think sometime in the first or second quarter of next year, John, but I just frankly don't know.","John Baugh","So does that mean to be clear, we have tailwinds still from this event Q1, Q2, but then we face kind of a year-over-year headwind in the back half of the year? Is that a right way to think about it?","Karl Glassman","If pricing stabilizes in the fourth quarter, we will actually kind of rectify to a means sometime at the end of the first quarter of next year, but again, I don't know that time.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Herb Hardt from Monness Crespi Hardt.","Herb Hardt","David, I'll echo the comments of the others, and thank you for all the great work and good luck on the next venture. My question has to do with operating rates. If you could give us some sense of either the company as a whole or by segment, what level of capacity, because with no acquisitions 5% unit volume that should totally get close to maximum capability?","Karl Glassman","It varies, as you know, by segment. If we aggregate everything together, the way that we currently measure capacity utilization, which is based on a seven-day week, 24-hour day, which probably isn't typical to most, were about 65%, where probably 80% is at max.","So in every quarter in the last five quarters, our utilization rates have increased in every segment. They have increased most probably in commercial as we picked up some volume, but we're underutilized in commercials, particularly Work Furniture, but the trends are probably more positive there than any place else. And then we have to start to separate the segments and that we're probably fully utilized in bedding components right now.","If you think in terms of the investment that we've made in Comfort Core, but we're underutilized in some of the open coil products, because there is switch out. We don't expect to be utilized in those open core. So it's variable. The trend is positive in all the segments.","I don't feel a significant need to add capacity in most of our business units with the exception of automotive, where we're dealing with significant growth rate and specifically comfort core, as it relates to bedding. Adjustables, we've added a lot of capacity during the year. I think that we're in really good shape there at the end of the quarter, where now a forth facility coming online in Florida. So we feel pretty good about things, where we're positioned.","David Haffner","Herb, 13 of the 17 units saw meaningful improvement in their capacity utilization.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from Keith Hughes from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Keith Hughes","Just turning back in to the adjustables. Again, fantastic numbers this quarter, particularly given you've anniversaried the big program. I guess my question is with the strong growth. Is most of that being driven by new programs, new customer wins or is that just positives from existing customers?","David Haffner","Today, Keith, in the third quarter it was market growth that we're selling the right people. At the same time, the category is growing significantly.","Keith Hughes","And are you seeing your price point there? I mean your dollars are well ahead of units, clearly in the numbers that you've given earlier. As we go into '16, this trend seems to be continuing. Do you think that will ever level out as some lower end items start to move up or will this price units just remain in place?","David Haffner","I think that we'll continue to see growth at the premium price points. The high end bedding business is very, very strong, but we'll also see some growth in adjustables at more promotional price points. That's what we've seen in calendar 2015. We think that the market is probably only 5% penetrated from an attachment rate of all mattresses produced, but there's probably a 50% attachment rate currently at the ultra premium price points.","I know those producers expect that they don't grow that. But the middle price points, the promotional price points will probably never have an adjustable bed associated with them. But the high price points, we'll continue to see growth. Virtually everything mattress sold above $599 is now adjustable-friendly, giving the consumer much more choice. That's a pretty significant change in the last 24 months.","Keith Hughes","But still most of your growth currently is being at the premium end, is that correct?","David Haffner","Yes. At a rated growth, it would probably be highest in the middle price points.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Daniel Moore with CJS Securities.","Daniel Moore","I wanted to just kind of revisit the guidance again for '16 -- not guidance, but the initial framework. I think you said that volumes will be up mid-single digits, but again some headwind from input cost. So does that indicate more of a low-single digit kind of overall revenue or how should we think about that?","David Haffner","At this point, Dan, I would kind of look at the middle of our current 2015 guidance, put 5% sales growth on top of it, so we're assuming that steel levelizes. So use 5% on top of the mid-point of our guidance, that's the best we can do at this point.","Daniel Moore","That's good. I wanted to make sure that the answer to the prior question, I wasn't reading incorrectly. That's fine. I wanted to turn the attention to cash flow a little bit. I think you said at least $375 million cash from ops and that includes some significant litigation, so you're probably approaching $425 million, $450 million in sort of adjusted. As long as you're feeling generous and giving outlooks for '16, maybe talk a little bit about CapEx and working capital. Is that a good run rate for cash generation when we think about '16?","Matthew Flanigan","I think, yes, the answer to that question is yes, so something north of $400 million. We would certainly anticipate to be embodied in the guidance and the framework we just gave for 2016. In terms of capital spending, something maybe around a $120 million might be a good estimate, but again, we'll freshen that up as we get to February 1 when we provide our full year best guess at that point in time.","And in terms of working capital trends, you shouldn't see anything any differently than what has been a very good management of those categories. I will mention one thing that litigation accrual, we've talked a lot about.","At the end of last year, we had about $90 million approximately on our balance sheet. By the end of this year, we'll have about $40 million, and they'll probably still be on our balance sheet. So the timing of when that rolls off as a current liability is just a notable phenomenon, if you will, in our cash flow, both this year and next year. Said another way, we expect the $40 million, that again is approximately estimated to be on our balance sheet at the end of the year will be paid out in cash during the first half of 2016.","Daniel Moore","And then just longer term, the margin growth and expansion we've seen, really exceptional over the last couple of years, 14% margin this quarter and up to 12% for the full year. I know we're flat next year. We've got some tough headwinds. Just help us think about the operating leverage and where you think margins can go over the mid-term, maybe the next two to three years?","Karl Glassman","With the current businesses that we own, 12.5% is probably a good number. If we execute on a divestitures that we have queued up right now, we should pick up about 50 basis points. So we're sniffing 13%, and we feel really pretty good about that, so I don't think we need to give you guidance on February 1. It seems like we just did that, but yes, that's our math, 12% to 12.5% on what we own today.","Daniel Moore","Give them an inch, they will take a mile. What can I tell you?","Karl Glassman","You're never going to get a thing if you don't ask for it, Dan.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from David MacGregor from Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","You've got pretty strong cash flow characteristics. You talked earlier about the acquisition queue and your stringent criteria. I'm just wondering if there's anything that looks like it may soon clear that, if there's anything imminent. And how 2016 might shape up as an acquisition growth year?","David Haffner","We expect that we will close on some relatively small, but important acquisitions in the coming months. In terms of sizeable, there is nothing in the queue. But I don't at all want to telegraph that -- we're always going through analysis. We feel really good about the acquisition pipeline right now, but there is nothing really in line.","Operator","We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.","End of Q&A","David Haffner","We appreciate your attention and we'll talk to you again, I guess, February 1, February 2. Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for participation today."],"13020":["Leggett & Platt, Inc.

I'll now turn the call over to Karl.","Karl Glassman","Good morning, and thank you for participating in our first quarter call. As we reported yesterday, first quarter sales increased 12% to $1.16 billion. Growth from ECS and other smaller acquisitions of 13% was slightly offset by a 1% decline in organic sales. Volume was down 3%, market share and content gains led to growth in US Spring of 7%, but this was more than offset by our decision to exit the fashion bed business, software demand in automotive and volume we chose to exit in our home furniture business. Raw material related selling price increases added 4% to organic sales but were partially offset by currency impact of 2%. First quarter earnings per share were $0.45. This included $6 million of restructuring-related charges and $1 million of ECS transaction costs that amount to a $0.04 per share reduction in earnings. Excluding these items, adjusted first quarter earnings were $0.49 per share, down $0.08 from $0.57 in the first quarter last year.","Earnings benefited from improved metal margins in our steel rods business and the ECS acquisition even after $14 million of purchase accounting charges. However, these increases were more than offset by declines in automotive fashion bed, flooring products and adjustable bed as well as higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. We remain excited about the ECS acquisition and the opportunities it brings, demand for their proprietary specialty foams and downstream products is strong, even while the US bedding industry continues to be impacted by unfairly priced Chinese mattresses that are the subject of a pending anti-dumping matter, since filing the dumping case with the US International Trade Commission and Department of Commerce in September 2018, we have seen a notable increase in imported mattresses from China, which is impacted ECSs sales growth, we expect a preliminary decision on that dumping allegations by the Department of Commerce in late May.","If duties are imposed, we expect our bedding businesses along with the entire US bedding industry to benefit. As previously discussed, we conducted an in-depth analysis of our home furniture and fashion bed businesses and initiated restructuring activity in the 4th quarter of last year. We are actually in low margin business, reducing operating costs and eliminating excess capacity and home furniture. These activities should be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter. In late March, we announced the closure of fashion bed and expect to be out of that business by the end of the 3rd quarter. We expect full-year restructuring related charges of $17 million, $12 million of which is non-cash. As a reminder, from last quarter's conference call, the quarterly slide decks we post to the Investor Relations website no longer contain unit growth rates of inner spring and box spring pieces within our residential product segment, because of content gains, including strong growth of our comfort core inner springs and other higher dollar value units, dollar growth and unit growth have become increasingly disconnected.","I will now turn the call over to Matt.","Matt Flanigan","Thank you, Karl and good morning, everyone. Reflecting normal seasonality, cash from operations was $31 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $13 million versus the first quarter last year, primarily due to increased working capital, a decrease in accounts payable due to the timing of payments and inventory purchases along with wind down activity at restructured locations, led to the increase in working capital investment, we ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 13.4%, that percentage should come back down as 2019 progresses.","We continue to expect our full year operating cash flow to approximate $550 million. In February, we declared a $0.38 per share quarterly dividend and extended our record of consecutive annual increases to 48 years. We fully expect to continue increasing the dividend as we repay debt associated with the ECS acquisition. At Friday's closing price of $42.01 our current yield is 3.6%, which is one of the highest yields among the 57 companies that comprise the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. In keeping with our deleveraging plans, we repurchased only 300,000 shares of our stock at an average price of $40.38. These were primarily shares rendered by employees for option exercises. We issued 1 million shares during the quarter primarily for employee benefit plans and stock option exercise, after completing the ECS acquisition in January, we ended the quarter with debt at 3.6 times, our trailing 12 month proforma adjusted EBITDA.","We are committed to maintaining a strong investment-grade credit rating and expect to deleverage to a target ratio of debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA of approximately 2.5 times by the end of 2020. We will do this by temporarily limiting share repurchases, reducing other acquisition spending and using our operating cash flow to repay debt. In addition, we expect to bring back roughly $170 million of offshore cash in 2019. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis, our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1\/3rd of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year.","We strongly believe our disciplined growth strategy, portfolio management, and prudent use of capital will support the achievement of this top third goal over time. Our guidance for 2019 is unchanged. Full year sales are expected to be $4.95 billion to $5.1 billion or up 16% to 19% over last year. ECS should add approximately $650 million to sales, commencing from the January 16th acquisition date. And we continue to expect annualized sales of approximately $675 million.","In addition, organic sales growth is expected to be flat to up 3%, reflecting sales growth in automotive, US spring, aerospace, hydraulic cylinders, and work furniture largely offset by our exit from fashion bed and planned declines in home furniture. Full year earnings per share are expected to be $2.35 to $2.55, including approximately $0.10 per share of restructuring related costs. Therefore, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.45 to $2.65, reflecting slightly higher organic sales and moderating steel inflation, partially offset by higher tax rate. The ECS acquisition is expected to be neutral to EPS this year. EPS guidance assumes a full-year effective tax rate of 24% versus 20% in 2018. This higher rate reflects the non-recurrence of valuation allowance releases we benefited from in 2018. A smaller expected stock compensation benefit in 2019, the impact that TCJA executive compensation limits and tax implications from higher interest expense due to the financing of the ECS transaction. We expect full-year depreciation and amortization of $210 million, net interest expense of approximately $95 million and fully diluted shares of $136 million.","Based upon this guidance framework, our full year adjusted EBIT margin should be 10.8% to 11.2%. As previously mentioned, full year cash from operations should approximate $550 million. Capital expenditure should be approximately $195 million for the year and dividends should require $205 million of cash. Our dividend payout ratio over 2019 is anticipated to be above our target of approximately 50% of adjusted earnings. Our long-term priorities for use of cash remain, one, organic growth in volume capital expenditures and working capital investments, two, dividends, three, strategic acquisitions, and four, share repurchases. As previously stated, we are prioritizing debt repayment after our organic growth in dividends and as a result our temporarily limiting share repurchases and reducing acquisition spending. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Wendy.","Wendy Watson","That concludes our prepared remarks. We thank you for your attention, and we will be glad to answer your questions. In order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate, we request that you ask only one question and then yield to the next participant. If you have additional questions, you're welcome to reenter the queue and we will answer those questions as well.","Michelle we are ready to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Our next question comes from a line of Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Susan Maklari","Good morning, everybody. My first question is just you know, now that you've actually closed ECS and had some time with it this quarter, can you just talk to -- was there anything in there that has surprised you how the integration is going and it seems like things are on track in terms of the guidance that Matt talked to in the sales line, but just talk to us generally about how it's going, especially with the impact that is seen from imports maybe?","Matt Flanigan","So if you don't mind Perry Davis, I'll address that. I just said in an integration meeting at the end of last week, which we have on a regular cadence and I can tell you that the level of engagement between the Leggett folks and the ECS people is extremely good. We're tracking a lot of different work streams that range from sales and marketing all the way to IT integration and a lot of the back office functions and it's going very smoothly. We have some great people working on that, tracking that, facilitating that and we're quite pleased, we sensed prior the acquisition, the cooperative spirit of those people that ECS and I'm happy to report that our expectations, they have been realized and working together quite well.","Susan Maklari","Okay. thank you.","Karl Glassman","Add to that, from a business perspective, the surprise is that we knew at the time of the acquisition that we were starting to see some chemical deflation. So it's pressured selling prices, a little bit, but certainly not profitability and margins are enhanced as a percentage. So not a big surprise because TDI had -- had increased significantly and now is coming back. So we're seeing deflation, but it's from legacy from a profitability standpoint, it's not at all negative. The surprise probably has been the point that you started to make and that's the significant storage of dump products in advance of the ruling that we expect will take place by statutory rules, the end of May. So there is a 90-day look back from a retro duty perspective. So we knew that product it come into the country before the end of February was in effect duty-free. But the significant surge of imports 17% -- 71% in December, 63% in January, 56% in February has surprised us. So which dampened not only ECS is volume, certainly the whole US industries volume, so it impacted the conventional players in the US as well. We expect that we'll start to get some relief. The challenge is, there's a lot of inventory in this country, it's being peeled out, but it will take a while to all sort through. So we're certainly optimistic about the duties in the duty rates. We are really pleased that we made the ECS acquisitions, there is a whole lot of conversation. Perry has been involved with Chris Chrisafides who runs ECS and the rest of the ECS team and our historic Bedding group, about new programs of on-shoring and reshoring, part of US growth has been the growth of hybrids and boxed and in conventional platforms. So things are going really well. But those were kind of the two surprises.","Susan Maklari","Okay, that's helpful, Karl. Thank you. And then just following up more broadly, I guess, as we look across your end markets you've talked to weakness in autos obviously, globally I know carpet underlay had some pressures this quarter and I guess, we've kind of heard that coming out of the fourth quarter, it seems like the year started off a little slow, but then has kind of improved as we move through closer into the spring. Can you talk to what you've seen in bedding and our housing markets and those kinds of things and how you're thinking about demand coming through as we look out?","Karl Glassman","So Susan this is quite an argument, in bedding, I can tell you that as we progressed through the quarter, it got stronger and stronger, relatively good sales promotion and activity around President's Day. But again, the impact of the imports, it's hard to gauge because, we perceive that there is so much of that in the system. But I can tell you as the quarter went along the cadence got quicker and more robust. We actually saw in one of the other business units, that's been a factor that you mentioned in carpet or in our flooring products group. We did see some headwinds at the start of the year, some of that obviously construction related and weather impacted. But as we go along now and we entered into the second quarter, we've seen our business volumes there recover and where we're bullish on that business as we go forward. Now, we're beginning to see some raw material relief there also.","Susan Maklari","Okay, all right, that's helpful. And what about you know, just thinking in terms of some of your more industrial end markets, I know hydraulics had a really good quarter. But can you just talk to what you've been seeing on that side in general?","Mitchell Dolloff","Sure. Susan. This is Mitch. Let me start with auto. As you probably recall that production, the vehicle production forecast has declined consistently since the middle of last year, in fact vehicles are down almost 2.8 million vehicles since the December forecast with over 2 million of those units coming out of the first half of the year. So we're looking at a forecast for the market that shows continued softness in the first half of the year with production down year-over-year about 5% and then the forecast improves in the back half of the year with production increasing year-over-year, 3% to 4% and that's pretty much that's reflective of the trends that we see as well. Remember that, so we're facing pretty tough comps with the first half of last year being pretty strong and then falling off in the back half. So we expect to see a reverse of that this year. In PHV in the hydraulic cylinders. Yes last year was very strong. I think unit growth in Material Handling was up nearly 15%, Q1 was actually a little bit softer down about 3%. We now have good industry forecast there. So we ---unit pressure remains strong. But we'll keep an eye out for that. Aerospace build remained strong, so that we're in good shape there as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question. Mr Keith is your line on mute?","Peter Keith","I'm here. Sorry about that. I've had that finger around the mute button this morning. I do have a question just follow-up to Mitch. So interesting on the auto forecast down 5%, but then pretty sharp inflection in the back half of the year I guess up 3% to 4% would seem to run above historical demand figures that seems a little overly optimistic, I guess, do you, what do you think that forecast would be driving that sharp acceleration in the back half?","Mitchell Dolloff","Well, I think you have a lot of uncertainty that had been negatively impacting the back half of last year and into the first half of this year, particularly the trade disputes impacting North America, China, and the European Union. I think we are impacting consumer confidence certainly, retaliatory tariffs in China have reduced demand for inputs there. They continued steel and aluminum tariffs are raising transaction prices in the US slowing sales and those are really coming through lower incentives that the consumers having to absorb and then we also had the the WLTEP emissions testing backlog last year and I think it's starting to work itself out. But people expect, we'll be in better position in the second half of the year. And then I think finally, there is an expectation that will be tax incentives in China, that will help boost demand in the second half of 2019. So, I think that part of the year-over-year negative reflection in the first half is that it was really strong in '18 and we see a softer in '19 and we have the reverse scenario, so I don't think that production rates that are forecast in the back half are unrealistic.","Peter Keith","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And I actually wanted to pivot the next question back to Karl around ECS and I certainly agree with the acceleration of Chinese imports. But my impression was that imports are trying to get ahead of potential duties so that they would have inventory in place to last potentially through Q2 not as the demand accelerates and we haven't seen much pricing change on the import pricing, at least when we see online. So I guess, for the -- the core of my question is, why would the acceleration imports be impacting overall demand trends as it relates to ECS?","Karl Glassman","I think it's a continuation of low-cost product being sold in the country and the surge that exist in that inventory. So it's the growth that really started in 2016 and the acceleration of that growth continues to pressure the entry price points in the US, which the first quarter is heavily sensitive to that seasonality. So there is a continuation of a loss of business, to imports, so you know, here I fundamentally agree with your point, that it's just -- it's an acceleration. The inventory is a bigger issue from a go-forward perspective that we expect will be melted off probably sometime by the end, middle of the end of the 3rd quarter. It will be interesting to see what the import statistics for March look like, but short answer is a continued pressure on the entry price points in the US. And from our perspective and from an ECS perspective, there had been a lot of conversation and continues to be a lot of conversation of the domestic players moving to US sourcing, some of them are reassuring a good part of them are onshoring for the first time and as that inventory continues to grow, the start of those ECS programs gets pushed out. So there is a backward forecast in ECS that we think is appropriate and they will also be an impact, a knock on benefit to our conventional US spring business and as I said in the prepared comments to the US bedding industry as a whole.","Peter Keith","Okay, thank you. And I do agree with that onshoring comments, just lastly on that residential segments, so the margins continue to trend down, I thought by this point with ECS and stabilization in steel that at the margins there would be flat to up. Could you give us a little color on that specific segment?","Karl Glassman","Well, remember ECS pressure is EBIT margins in that segment. I wish we could report EBITDA margins, that's the issue.","Peter Keith","Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Hughes","Yes my question is in the furniture segment. How much of the businesses that you're exiting, how much of the 5% decline does that represent?","Matt Flanigan","Yes, most of it for sure, the significant declines in that fashion bed business I think it was down by 30% and home furniture down 12%. There is little bit of decline in adjustable bed as well, but most of -- of that is from home furniture and fashion bed.","Keith Hughes","I'm sure we get out of those, because they are not very profitable. So, I was surprised that the EBIT was down so much on that decline. What's going on with that?","Matt Flanigan","Well, I think that you have a couple of factors. You have some restructuring costs that are running through there, particularly the fashion bed business in lower margin, and so we are exiting now, we are not exiting the home furniture business, we've undertaken some significant restructuring activity really over the last several quarters there. And that business is stabilized and actually performed pretty well. We still have some work to do, but we saw margins improve there. So yes, negative impact from fashion bed also down a little bit in adjustable EBIT.","Keith Hughes","And just finally on adjustables, can you talk about, I mean, it still seems to be all the rage in the mattress industry, what, why your business is down, what's kind of the outlook?","Matt Flanigan","Yes, you're right our growth definitely began to slow in Q4 in adjustable beds and that continued in Q1 with sales down 5%, some ups and downs for sure across the different customer base, volume was negative impacted there also by our decision to exit fashion bed, fashion bed had been way to distribute to some smaller retailers adjustable beds, but it just wasn't economical for us to continue to do that. Given the decline in the other fashion bed product categories, 2018 was really volatile with really strong sales based on heavy promotional activity in the first half of the year and then a slower second half of the year. So this definitely presents challenging counts for us in 2019 like we see without the heavy promotional activity we see 2019 volume probably down somewhere in the mid-single digits. So you're right that there continues to be growth in the industry at stronger growth at really lower entry level price points. We tend to play a little bit higher price points.","Keith Hughes","Okay. Thank you.","Karl Glassman","Indeed that the risk is talking about specific customers. I feel like we need to get only this business, because as you know we're heavy weighted to Mattress Firm and sleep number in our adjustable bed sales, so Mitch is exactly right. Remember, Matt firm was incredibly aggressive from a promotional perspective in the first half of last year with fewer stores and a change of philosophy. We expect that, that will be muted significantly. We're pleased with our Mattress Firm program. We think that the current program is healthier than the historic program, sleep number is doing just fine. So, I just don't like to talk about specific customers, but felt like we needed to be here .","Matt Flanigan","Thanks, Karl. I would just add on to that too, in that second half of last year we struggled through some inventory overhang and adjustables and I think by the end of Q1, we've largely worked through that. So we think we'll see some improvement in the second half of the year as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bobby Griffin with Raymond James Financial. Please proceed with your question.","Bobby Griffin","Thank you for taking my questions. I just want to circle back on Susan's question from earlier. And maybe could you just give a little bit more color what you're either hearing from customers or seeing in some of your large business units throughout the quarter. That gives you and the team the confidence around the full-year sales guidance?","Karl Glassman","Yes, Bobby, this is going to take a little while. But I read your quick note, I'm going to give you and everyone listening, kind of a quick view of each business unit, so we'll go business unit by -- business unit organized by segment. US spring, you saw 7% growth, we expect that to continue. Certainly the bedding industry was impacted in January and February to Perry's comments by weather but there's an acceleration of our content gains market share pickup hybrids are a contributor to that. We expect dumping benefit in the -- certainly in the back half in US spring, so everything's really going well in US spring. I made the comments on ECS, we expect their back-half business to significantly improve, international spring performed well in the first quarter, we expect that to continue. There's a story by geography. Perry made a comment on flooring significantly negatively impacted in January, February. I think that's highly correlated to weather, so again in March, we expect kind of flat for the whole year there, fabric converting highly correlated to bedding and furniture, for the full year we expect flat -- because of acquisitions, we expect 20% growth in that business and machinery is relatively small, it will be flat to slightly down, because of softness in the US bedding industry.","Industrial, you saw a negative in the first quarter that was caused by our closure of a formed wire business, the anniversary is actually next week. So with cost in the first quarter, about $10 million of volume. So that negative will not repeat in the remainder of the year. Echoing some of Mitch's comments, work furniture, we expect mid-single digit growth through the year. Home furniture should be flat with units down, dollars up because of the benefit of pricing actions that were taken in the back half of last year. Mitch, both to the impact of the FPG closure and adjustable beds, auto for the year should be up mid to high single digits. Aerospace and hydraulic cylinders both up in about 10% range. So we feel really good about our guidance. I will admit that the sales guidance is probably more questionable than the EPS guidance, but as we sit here you know, end of April, we feel pretty good about our guidance.","Bobby Griffin","I appreciate all that detail that was a lot and very helpful. So thank you a lot and very helpful. So thank you. And then I guess also on Mitch on the comments about the decision to exit some of the bedding, fashion bed business and furniture products business, was that, if I take the math and I do the math on that, was that basically a 1% drag to consolidated volumes as well, your own decisions to exit those businesses?","Mitchell Dolloff","Bobby we are in thinking about the math here for a second.","Susan McCoy","Probably a little bit more than that Bobby on an annualized basis, it's not a huge hit to the sales line.","Bobby Griffin","Okay, that's helpful.","Mitchell Dolloff","And sorry. It's a little bit tough to predict as we decided to exit fashion bed. We're really in a mood of liquidating that inventory so we're out of a normal kind of some of the selling cycle, that's going really well. We're having a lot of success with that. But it's just started thinking about that.","Karl Glassman","And remember fashion bed was shrinking as the year progressed last year too so.","Susan McCoy","$40 million to $50 million is what 1% percent looks like and maybe a little bit more than that, but not a lot.","Bobby Griffin","Okay. And Susan, I didn't hear you that in, it's a little stronger in Q2, is that what you're saying? I couldn't -- the phone broke up a little bit. I'm sorry.","Susan McCoy","No, I said $40 million to $50 million, this what's a 1% decline looks like in the downdraft because of our exit of much of that volume is probably I'm little bit larger number than that, but not a lot.","Bobby Griffin","Okay. Okay. And then should I expect some similar in Q2, then and then we start to anniversary and we start starting to lessen throughout the back half?","Susan McCoy","Well, Bobby to be clear, the 40 to 50, is an annual number, not a quarter number.","Bobby Griffin","Okay.","Susan McCoy","And second quarter, Mitch?","Mitchell Dolloff","Yes, I think it goes the other way, at least in regards to fashion bed. So in 2018 trade sales and fashion bed were something like $170 million as we ramp it down. I think they were a over $30 million in the first quarter, I expect they're probably closer to $20 million in the second and third quarter spread across there and then probably very little if anything by the fourth quarter.","Susan McCoy","Yeah initial 1% a little more.","Bobby Griffin","Okay. I appreciate the detail. And then I guess lastly, also is when we model in ECS does that business follow the kind of typical seasonality of the bedding business that where we're used to, with the holidays, causing spike in three Q being a big quarter?","Karl Glassman","It's a little bit different, Bobby. We would expect that fourth quarter buy would be a little more skewed to the busier season and the reason for that is the amount of product that's moved on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, that is a tremendous injection of volume that happens around that time frame. We also see some product toward the end of the year in December and Christmas and things like that. So it's a little bit more skewed. Now, the part of the business that's related to box, beds and that type of product that probably would follow a little more seasonal -- seasonality, that's traditional. But remember, it's not all that it's things like toppers and pillows and other products that are lending themselves more to promotional activity around those a year end events. That's a very good point it's more e-commerce sensitive so it has more of e-commerce cycle than a traditional brick and motor cycle.","Bobby Griffin","Okay, I appreciate the detail. Thanks for answering my questions again, and best of luck going forward.","Karl Glassman","Thank you, Bobby.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Dan Moore with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","This is [Stefan Oskris] calling in for Dan Moore. My apologies if you've addressed this in prior calls, but given the new mix of these ECS can you walk us through your COGS on outdated basis of a percentage like raw materials versus labor?","Susan McCoy","Stephan, this is Susan. We don't have that updated from our historical presentation. I don't know what the revised split is.","Karl Glassman","Yes, we are going to need a little bit more time, remember we only ended less than a quarter. But yeah, let us say it's a good question we going to update that schedule. Obviously there is a chemical element that is while chemical input costs have always been an issue to our flooring products business is significantly larger now with the ECS, so, yes good question.","Susan McCoy","And we are actually in the process of doing that update, we just don't have it done yet. It will be soon.","Bobby Griffin","I will jump back in the queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Baugh with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","John Baugh","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering on content gains that you referenced in bedding, is there any way to quantify sort of what you're seeing year-over-year in Q1, what you expect to see for the entire year of '19?","Karl Glassman","Yeah, first quarter, we used to talk about. I was -- I thought that comfort core as a percent of the units that we sold likely would top out somewhere in the mid '40s as a percentage range. Well, in the first quarter of this year, copper core was actually 50% of the units sold is up about 24% if you look year-on-year. And then the other layer on content gains is not only the shift from open core to comfort core but the quantum part of the story and that was 43% of all the comfort core that we shipped in Q1 had a quantum edge element to it. So why do we attribute that to? I think it's a variety of things. But there's clearly a preference in the mid-line premium categories of comfort core and also on the box bed category. We're seeing continued penetration and expect that to go even further in the future, quantum edge is so prevalent and becoming so prevalent in box beds, because of the product itself is so good it just makes sense. Our customers see the benefits of that product in that it opens up and it has from the start from the opening process an enhanced edge prior to that most of the foam products and a lot of the the inner spring products had no support on the edge. This product does, it's got integrity, and it stays through the life of the mattress. So we're excited about that. And again, all those products as they get sold through that's additional volume for us and that's an additional opportunities for margin and it makes a great product.","John Baugh","Okay. And then, I assume we're anxiously awaiting this March China import data number one and we're awaiting to get a final duty number two, and I assume you have better guess where those may come in than I do, is there any way to quantify in your guidance. Once all the inventory, excess inventory that's been built ahead of these duties, what kind of impact favorably you're expecting in your bedding business, is there anything and say the back half or I think you mentioned middle of Q3 like see all the inventory work that, what do you expect the benefit maybe?","Karl Glassman","It's hard to say. John, I can tell you this, if you take there 7-8 million mattresses run rate that was coming from China, some of that goes elsewhere around the world. Obviously, we think a lot of it gets repatriated to the US and we're seeing our coal process in both among traditional customers and the box bed part of the business would indicate that there is a lot of that going to reshore, and it's a tremendous opportunity for us and for the industry and that's the reason for the filing. If you look at the schedule, as we know what today around the end of May commerce will make a preliminary determination of duties if those are favorable. There's also among the petitioners beyond the filing to have some retroactive element applied to those duties and that would be a 90-day look back if it's approved. We don't know for sure that it will be, but we believe will put a cooling effect on all of that importation, we think it already has. And if you look at the 90-day look back from the end of May in the February, so it will be interesting to see what the March numbers look like when we finally see those, but we expect the level of importation to certainly decelerate and to the degree of how quickly that happens, I don't know, but I think that the word is out. I think from all indications, we would look for a positive finding at the end of May, and that begins to flow through, will there be other glator products still sitting out there, all through the second quarter? Don't know. Could be, it's just hard to know where those sit.","Mitchell Dolloff","John, the other element to that is, as you know, most of the imported product today is phone and as we have conversation with our customers, as they talk about new product lines don't no longer have an expectation that they'll compete against a $200 that there is a lot of conversation about hybrid and, it goes to the conversation that Perry had a minute ago of comfort core and quantum edge so both the ECS level and the historic Leggett level and again, hard to quantify, but there is an expectation that whatever percentage of those 8 million units come back, a higher percentage of them will be hybrid, than are currently formed today. So we're excited, mostly because of conversation with customers. You would know that -- launched on their website, a hybrid effective two weeks ago, so that's new, they and other customers are talking about hybrids where historically had been foam. So the combination of our comfort core and the exclusion of materials from ECS are really, really powerful.","John Baugh","Okay. And secondly, just I guess a question, a clarification, given your commentary about China imports being higher than you'd thought and that being mostly foam product and impacting ECS, you are not changing at all your post January forecast for revenue growth for ECS for the year?","Karl Glassman","We are not, we are optimistic that we don't have to change.","John Baugh","And why would that not be the case, if you know really imports in January and February and presume or December were a lot higher than you thought?","Karl Glassman","It wasn't in our original guidance, the benefit of the surge wasn't in our original guidance. I would say, if you look back, this whole process on dumping has been delayed out about 40 days because of the government shutdown and we would not have known at that time, the timing of how that would affect the timing of this.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David DeSonier, Senior Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations for Leggett & Platt Incorporated. Thank you. Mr. DeSonier, you may begin.","David M. DeSonier","Good morning, and thank you for taking part in Leggett & Platt's First Quarter Conference Call. With me this morning are the following: Dave Haffner, our CEO; Karl Glassman, our Chief Operating Officer; Matt Flanagan, our CFO; and Susan McCoy, our Staff VP of Investor Relations.","The agenda for our call this morning is as follows: Dave Haffner will start with a summary of the major statements we made in yesterday's press release, Karl will provide operating highlights, Dave will then address our outlook for 2012, and finally, the group will answer any questions you have.","This conference is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material. This call may not be transcribed, recorded or broadcast without our expressed permission. A replay is available from the IR portion of our website.","We posted to the IR portion of the website yesterday a set of PowerPoint slides that contain summary of financial information. Those slides supplement the information we discuss on this call, including non-GAAP reconciliations. I need to remind you that remarks today concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements.","Actual results or events may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the section in our 10-K entitled Forward-Looking Statements.","I'll now turn the call over to Dave Haffner.","David S. Haffner","Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call. We were pleased with the first quarter results we reported yesterday. First quarter same-location sales increased 4.5% versus a relatively strong first quarter of 2011, reflecting a combination of unit volume growth and raw material related price inflation. Volume trends were mixed across our businesses. We saw volume gains in automotive and office components, as well as in U.S. Spring, adjustable beds and other parts of the Residential segment. The most notable volume declines occurred in store fixtures, furniture hardware and commercial vehicle products. ","Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.30, unchanged from the first quarter of 2011. In last year's first quarter, we had a $0.03 per share benefit from unusual items including gains from building sales that did not recur in 2012. Current quarter earnings benefited from higher unit volumes. We are also realizing the expected earnings benefits from the restructuring activities we initiated in late 2011. The strategically attractive Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition that we completed in January is exceeding in our expectation for strong operating performance. ","In the first half of this year, we will recognize $6 million of charges, half of this in the first quarter from an acquisition-related fair value adjustment to inventory. These charges will not repeat in the back half of this year, so we expect Western's earnings to improve as the year progresses. ","Our operating folks continue to do an excellent job of closely managing working capital reflecting our focus on return optimization. We ended the quarter with working capital at 12.3% of annualized sales. Current liabilities include approximately $28 million, associated with an interest rate swap that we entered in 2010. If you exclude that item, working capital was 13% of annualized sales, still well below our 15% target. Cash from operations was strong during the quarter at $65 million. We expect operating cash for the full year of over $325 million, which should once again comfortably exceed the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends. ","Capital expenditures should be approximately $100 million this year and dividends should require about $160 million. We have maintained our strong financial base and ended the first quarter with net debt at 34% of net capital, which is within our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%.","In February, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share and extended to 41 years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases. At yesterday's closing price of $23.67, the current dividend yield is 4.7%. Given the cash outlay to acquire Western Pneumatic Tube, we did not complete any open market purchases of our stock during the first quarter. However, consistent with our stated priorities for use of excess cash flow, we expect eventually to resume buying back our stock subject to the outlook to the outlook for the economy, our level of cash generation and other potential opportunities to grow the company. For the full year, with strong cash generation, we expect to repurchase some number of our shares but have established no specific repurchase commitment or timetable. We have a standing authorization from our Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. ","We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1\/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that began January 1, 2010, we have so far generated TSR of 12% per year on average, which matches the return of the S&P 500 index over that same time period. So with those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman who will provide some operating highlights. Karl?","Karl G. Glassman","Thank you, Dave. Good morning. In my comments, I'll discuss a few segment highlights. You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. First quarter, same location sales in Residential Furnishings segment increased 7% from a combination of unit volume growth and raw material related price inflation. In our U.S. Spring business, innerspring unit volumes increased 3% and boxspring units were flat. In our Furniture Hardware business, unit volume decreased 10% versus the prior year. Again this quarter, we had significant growth in adjustable beds with unit shipments of 48%. ","Sales also grew in carpet underlay, Geo Components and consumer products. EBIT and EBIT margins in the segment decreased versus the first quarter last year, primarily from the absence of a gain from a building sale that occurred in early 2011. The earnings benefit from slightly higher unit volumes in the current quarter was partially offset by raw material inflation and a less favorable sales mix. ","In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, first quarter same location sales decreased 8% from lower Fixture & Display volume. This decrease resulted in a large part from lower spending by a single large value-oriented retailer. Sales in Office Furniture components increased slightly during the quarter. Volume in this business continues to generally track the overall recovery in the office furniture industry. EBIT and EBIT margins in the segment decreased slightly versus first quarter of 2011, primarily from the absence of a gain from a building sale that occurred early last year. The earnings impact from lower sales in the current quarter was more than offset by a gain from the sale of our U.K. based Point of Purchase business in January, benefits from restructuring activity and other cost savings. ","In the Industrial Materials segment, first quarter same location sales increased 6% with growth from steel-related price inflation slightly offset by union volume declines. Overall unit volumes were lower, led by a decrease in shipments of wire and rod. EBIT decreased in the quarter primarily due to a $3 million acquisition-related fair value adjustment to inventory. Earnings benefits from the recently completed acquisition and the plant  consolidations announced in late 2011 were largely offset in the quarter by lower unit volumes and unusually high workers compensation expense. ","EBIT margins were further compressed by the inflation driven sales increase as this revenue growth brought little incremental profit. As Dave mentioned earlier, the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition, which resides in the Industrial Materials segment, is exceeding our performance expectations. We continue to expect this business to produce full-year 2012 margins greater than the company average. First and second quarter's results will reflect approximately $3 million of charges from acquisition-related fair value adjustments.  Since those charges do not repeat, segment margin should improve appreciably in the back half of the year. ","In the Specialized Products segment, first quarter sales increased 6% entirely from growth in automotive. Machinery sales were down slightly in the quarter and commercial vehicle product sales were up significantly compared to first quarter of last year. EBIT was flat and EBIT margins decreased during the quarter. Higher sales and the non-recurrence of last year's impairment charges contributed favorably to EBIT, but these improvements were offset by several items including higher raw material cost, litigation reserves, less favorable sales mix and higher R&D spending. ","Automotive industry forecasts anticipate continued growth in global production rates in 2012. But the outlook varies by geography. North America and Asia are both expected to have meaningful production growth, but European forecasts are negative as economic concerns linger. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave.","David S. Haffner","Thank you, Karl. We're pleased that certain economic factors have improved modestly in recent months. With first quarter results ahead of our internal forecast, we are increasing our full-year 2012 guidance modestly to a range of $1.25 to $1.45 per share, up from our previous range of $1.20 to $1.40 per share. We are also increasing our full-year guidance, sales guidance, that is, to $3.65 billion to $3.85 billion, which is up from our previous range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion. We continue to expect the restructuring related activities that we initiated in 2011, in total, to add $0.07 to $0.10 per share to our 2012 earnings. We also anticipate the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition to be modestly accretive to the full year's earnings here in its first year. These improvements are largely offset by a higher anticipated full-year effective tax rate and interest expense, which negatively impact earnings by approximately $0.10 per share, $0.08 of that for the tax rate and $0.02 for interest.","Now with those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier.","David M. DeSonier","That concludes our prepared remarks. We thank you for your attention and we'll now try to answer any questions. In order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate, as we typically do, we request that you ask your single best question and then voluntarily yield to the next participant. If you have additional questions, please re-enter the queue. Melissa, we're ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Leah Villalobos with Longbow Research.","Leah Villalobos - Longbow Research LLC","I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the U.S. Springs business. I know [indiscernible] is the sample, it was just a sample of the overall industry, but I was wondering if you feel like your performance in the quarter is more representative of kind of what you're seeing in the overall industry or if there's some other things kind of going on there?","Karl G. Glassman","Good morning, Leah. This is Karl. As you inferred, that ISPA the quarterly results were released not before last. And while we believe that the ISPA results are a good barometer of change from a sequential movement standpoint, that as you infer, that they only captured 65% of the industry units. So I believe, we believe, that the January and February results were probably overstated and the March results were a catch up. As are -- as we state, that our innerspring units were up 3%, we think that, that is an appropriate reflection of the industry. The ISPA statistics show that March innersprings were up 9.4% in units, our experience was a couple percent off. We believe that as a better barometer of the macro industry. So I don't think investors should view the March ISPA results as falling off a cliff, we know that, that in fact didn't happen. But we do think that it's a normalization of stronger than probably, was accurate January and February results. Now, I want to make it clear, I am not in any way, taking issue with ISPA. They are just reporting the data that's given to them so.","Leah Villalobos - Longbow Research LLC","That's really helpful. Would you be willing to comment on kind of just what you're seeing here so far through April?","Karl G. Glassman","Yes. Actually, Leah, why don't I want to walk you back, and this will help a little bit, that from our first quarter, that we saw really abnormal strength in innerspring unit sales in January and February. With January up 6%, February up about 6% also, and as I said, off a couple points in March. And through the 15 shipping days of April, we're seeing about flat units which would correlate to what we heard at the High Point Market this last weekend, where it feels like things have moderated from a demand perspective as things typically do. This is -- all we're doing is experiencing normal seasonality.","Leah Villalobos - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. That's really helpful. And then so your outlook I guess, for the year then, doesn't change as it relates to the bedding business?","Karl G. Glassman","No, I will note that ISPA recently increased their 2012 forecast for -- they  originally had forecasted units up 1%, now they're at 3.5% up. We think that, that's probably a pretty good indicator of what we should expect for the full-year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Back on residential, on margins. If I back out that building gain, it's kind of flattish year-over-year in margins. If you continue this sort of revenue pace, would we start to see the margins expand this year? And if so, what kind of what time period would that start to occur?","Karl G. Glassman","Keith, the answer is yes. You should see an expansion in margins that we had an abnormally weak mix in the first quarter with Furniture Hardware sales off 10%. And if you'll allow me, I'd like to speak to that very issue for just a second. That from a headline perspective, that may look pretty negative as it does, but our first quarter experience was pretty choppy and that the December sales of furniture hardware were actually up 7.5%. They were up 12% from our international locations. We believe there was a significant pull forward by our customers because of an unusually early Chinese New Year, so we saw a pull forward into December of 2011. The January of 2012 experience was particularly negative with units off 30%, remembering that Chinese New Year was in January this year, February last, and sort through the whole thing, and we ended up in experiencing units down 10%. Oddly, or I guess appreciatively, that unit sales were up 3% in March. So it wasn't a train wreck. From a full disclosure perspective, I do want to make comment that we have lost a little bit of market share in Furniture Hardware to a Chinese-based finished furniture manufacturer that does make some of their own lower value mechanisms. We believe that, that is completed, all -- or that exposure is behind us, all the pickup in March. So that mix of negative hardware is negative to us in the first quarter while we very much appreciate a pick up in carpet units, which was up about 6% to 7%. And a pickup in Geo Components sales, those 2 have lower contribution margins than Furniture in total. So certainly, a negative mix in the first quarter that we don't expect to continue. In addition, we're in the process of passing through some price increases, particularly in the U.S. Spring market based on some inflation, some January steel inflation that ran through the quarter. And obviously, some inflation in fuel costs. So we believe the second quarter will have a good bit of that through the system and be fully through the system by the first day of the third quarter.","David S. Haffner","Keith, this is Dave, I know your question was specific to Residential, but it would be reasonable to assume that we would see some even more meaningful margin expansion as the year goes forward in a couple of the other segments.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And I guess my follow-up question on your demand comments before, do you feel like that's the kind of year we're going to be in where you're going to have one month that's positive, one month that's flat, -- just kind of up and down, and it will all add up to a positive year? Do you think that will be the trend?.","Karl G. Glassman","Well Keith, none of us could have forecasted the lack of winter. So we probably had a pull forward in January and February. A wonderfully strong Presidents' Day. I do believe that the consumer is very sensitive and we need to look at consumer confidence numbers. Hopefully, they'll be confident around the all important Memorial and 4th of July, Labor Day selling day period. But, yes, we do expect choppiness. And the bogeyman that's out there, from a future perspective is the election. And what happens to consumer confidence around the election? We believe it will be a contentious election, we also believe that it will be a very expensive election that will force our retailer customers to spend a little bit more on advertising. So there's some concern around all of those impacts. So yes, choppiness is where we are.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Baugh with Stifel, Nicolaus.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","My question is, back to Residential on the mix, in answering that question, Karl, you were I guess, talking about mix between bedding and furniture components. I'm wondering if you could dive into the mix that's within the bedding, what did you see in the mix within furniture components.","Karl G. Glassman","That's a good question. Generally, the first quarter is our most negative mix of the year from a bedding perspective in that. We sell a lot of units, we sell more units now in the first quarter than any quarter of the year. It is highly correlated to tax refunds, it tends to be more promotional than the mix it will enjoy through the full-year. As an example, that our promotional product sales were up significantly, but are actually our fastest-growing product category is Comfort Core, our answer to Pocketed Coil. We expect that mix based on some large customers' introductions that appear to be very successfully implemented and well received in the market that, that mix will improve as the year goes on, we experienced the same thing in furniture. That there's a little bit of a low-end mix just because of the highly promotional around tax refund season.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Karl, when we were out at Vegas, you had expressed some hope about the growth you're seeing in Hybrid beds -- did that not help the first quarter at all? Or what's the prospect for that help, if any, as we go through the year?","Karl G. Glassman","There's very little help in the first quarter. Serta just started shipping in iSeries about a month ago. I know that the new Simmons product, which is Hybrid was shipped in about that same timeframe as was the new Sealy Hybrid product. We believe that, that product -- that series of product is being very well received. We think the customer has -- the consumer, the end consumer has a deep appreciation for the support that an innerspring provides in a core, augmented by the stories that they're being told of the specialty sleep applications to the top. So it will help the year as the year progresses.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then I wonder if I could just sneak one more in and jump over the retail store fixtures and display. We'll leave the name of the large discount retailer as private. But I guess I'd love to look at that business in 2 buckets. One, that customer, and what are they dealing with you and what are your expectation now for the year? And then secondly, everything else within store fixtures and display.","Karl G. Glassman","Okay. John, that customer, being Walmart, is the largest, historically, the largest retailer obviously in the world, the largest customer of our store fixtures business. In 1Q of 2011, they were very aggressively remodeling, and you'll remember that they made a very public statement in the March, June timeframe of last year, that they were going to slow their remodels and invest in other selling practices, looking at smaller stores and experimenting with different footprints. And that continues. So we continue to enjoy a very good relationship with them, they continue to remodel but at a slower pace and we expect that they'll continue to remodel at a slower pace through this year until they figure out what their strategy, from a long-term go-forward, is. We're very well-placed with them. Certainly, have a good relationship and they're doing well in the marketplace. But, what you should expect is a strong third quarter in store fixtures because of our position gained with some other retailers. You'll remember, John, that the third quarter historically, had been the strongest selling season for store fixtures as those retailers position themselves for the holiday selling season. You should have that expectation, which has not been the case for the last 3 or 4 years, but have that expectation that, that historical trend should take place in 3Q will be, by far and away, the largest quarter in store fixtures ...","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So it sounds like, Karl, Walmart will be down for the year, again. And then, the rest of it, what? Offsets, makes it up, puts us ahead, still down?","Karl G. Glassman","That's our expectation. We are still hopeful that Walmart will kick in more of their remodels in the back half. But we do not know that at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","We appreciate the transparency of Leggett. Appreciate the fact that the guidance for the year is modestly up. I want to take a little bit longer term question, go back to a question that we asked, I guess, in the middle part of '09, which was that the road map to a place where the dividend is no longer going to be kind of 77% to 90% of earnings. I know, appreciate the TSR metric and those things, but the dividend continues to increase and earnings really do not. And David, I know we've been through kind of a long simulations of, number simulations of how we get to $2. I kind of want to reflect back on that and maybe readdress that whole issue of how we get to $2 and now we need to get to $2 plus, to get to your eventual goal of a dividend payout of 50% or so.","David S. Haffner","If we go back to when we first discussed that $2 a share concept and the assumptions used in that concept, it's certainly something that we're comfortable with and the assumptions occurred and we didn't anticipate that we'd see this sort of economic downturn. That could come across as an excuse, I certainly don't mean it that way. We still have a significant, very significant amount of earnings power in the company, and especially when you take a look at our production capacity utilizations, which are up incidentally this first quarter. We're pleased to see that almost across the board in the various units. But what it's going to take is increased demand, capacity, utilization. The concept or the leverage that, that incremental volume has is still real. In some cases, the leverage is -- starts with a four handle, it has a 40% impact. In some cases, it's 18%, 19%, but on average, we still feel comfortable with that 25% to 30%, 35% leverage, Budd.  And so, when will it happen? It'll be a function of when that demand continues, I mean when the demand reaches the level that provides us the capacity utilizations that we want and need to get there. I don't know how to predict that. I know that if we say -- if we just threw our revenue number out, it's challenging because we don't know how much inflation or deflation may come into that. I'm still very comfortable as a shareholder and as part of the management team here, that we will be able to continue to reduce our payout ratio going forward, and ultimately, get into that range of 50% to 60% payout ratio. I know it's frustrating for certain investors. We're very comfortable that we'll be able to achieve that. We just need the demand. And like I said, I don't want to get too optimistic, but the first quarter, I'm looking at the production capacity utilization chart right now, is very encouraging in that regard. So as we see these margins expand in the second, third and the fourth quarter relative to last year, we can even seek more comfort in that thinking. Anybody else want to add something to that, though?","Karl G. Glassman","No, I would pile on a little bit, Budd, and that I absolutely subscribe to what Dave said that we did -- Susan did a very in-depth contribution analysis not very long ago. It's data that we continually test. As Dave said, we need a mix of unit growth and we feel very good about it. We appreciate the fact that we are seeing the benefits of every one of the restructuring events that took place in the fourth quarter of last year. We measure them very carefully. They're very trackable and while they were difficult decisions, we made the right decisions.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Can you maybe share some of that contribution margin, at least on the surface as we'd look at it? And just by the numbers year-over-year, the contribution margin really is pretty much 0 this quarter on a year-over-year basis. I didn't quite do it yet season -- sequentially, but where do we see it? How do we get more comfort to investors and to us that you're actually on track for that?","Susan R. McCoy","Budd, I'm going to speak to that just from a high level standpoint. And folks will find some of these details in the slides that we posted yesterday. Slide #4 is a bridge from last year's to this year's sales and EBIT. And if you recognize that of our total revenue growth, there's only about $20 million of that, that was from the unit volume increase that is the carrier of this 25, 30, 35% contribution margin that we talk about. And when you start with last year's EBIT, that was $74 million, but I recognize that there were $6 million or so of unusual things that helped that, that you're really looking at kind of operationally about $68 million of EBIT. And conversely, when you look at this year's $75 million of EBIT in the first quarter, and again adjust that for things that we've talked about that are a little bit out of the ordinary, including the gain from the divestiture and some of the acquisition-related adjustments, then you're somewhere around $75 million, $76 million of EBIT. That increase which is about $8 million, when you take that noise out, on $20 million of volume, and in addition, rightfully so, you should expect and we are realizing, operating contribution from the acquisition. You can see it's just -- what's unfortunate is as always, it seems like every quarter, a bit of noise here and there, whether it's revenue or in a noise, or earnings or in a noise. So it's never just one thing really, that's driving our performance. But when you kind of work through those details that's how I continue to kind of keep comfort with that 25%, 30%, 35% contribution margin. And it is mix sensitive, to Karl's comment earlier, our mix wasn't especially strong in this first quarter with some of the things going on.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","All right. One last thing -- just one quick other question, Karl. You had said inflation and I thought you called out steel and I believe energy as well, in the first quarter. As I look at the numbers that I see on the steel basis, it looks like scrap went up, but rod actually -- the selling price of rod actually went down in the quarter. Is that -- am I incorrect on that? Some spread narrowed but it was narrowing because of an increase in cost and a little bit of a decrease in the price of the market price of steel rod.","Karl G. Glassman","Budd, I hate to do this to you, considering it's your birthday. But, yes, you were wrong on that.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","That's okay, I'm wrong a lot.","Karl G. Glassman","The high carbon rod inflated during the quarter and the spread would've widened as the quarter went on.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Herb Hardt with Monness, Crespi and Hardt.","Herbert Hardt - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","A question regarding the steel operation. Most of the industrial companies I've spoken to have said kind of the reverse of your results in that January and February were slow. March came through better than expected, April again, better than expected. In your steel business itself, was that similar or also different?","Karl G. Glassman","As you know, our steel business is dedicated solely to long products, primary high carbon with specific applications. Where, I do agree with your comments, I read a lot of steel company results, they tend to be more broad-based in their application of steel with certainly, they are steel producers in this country are feeling a significant uptick in demand based on auto sales. But while -- our steel mill just absolutely does a wonderful job. They're great people that are dedicated to the business and they had a few challenges in the first quarter that won't repeat. One is we, unfortunately, had a crane-related accident. There was an employee that was hurt. That employee, thankfully, is well into recovery and was released from rehabilitation earlier this week and is now at home. So prayer's been answered. That is the reference to the worker's comp expanse in industrial. With that unfortunate incident, we did lose some yield in the steel mill. But a bigger cost impact was there was -- we took an 8-day outage in the mill that was planned, that will not repeat and it was dedicated to replacing the finishing end or the packaging line of the rod mill and that is really what the major driver was for our reduced sales. So you should expect that sales will recover in the second quarter and going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Allen Zwickler with First Manhattan.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","Could you maybe spend 2 minutes on your new acquisition? I mean I -- perhaps you've described it a little bit here and there, but just sort of the bid customers and what your expectations are to the extent that you can? I mean, I just want to sort of get my arms around. You sound very excited about it, that it's been -- it's certainly a different business than you've been in. So just, if you don't mind, maybe spending a minute or 2 on that.","David S. Haffner","Sure, Allen, let me start and then Karl can give you some detail. But one of the things I wanted to reiterate is that when we established some new criteria for acquisitions, we set a little bit of a higher bar. We wanted businesses that had higher technical content. We wanted businesses that had significant market share. We wanted businesses that had higher margins, higher growth rates, and if that wasn't enough, we wanted perfect management. So establishing those criteria gave us a very good screen on some extraordinarily good companies. Western Pneumatic happened to make that screen and we're very pleased. I'll let Karl give you some specific details.","Karl G. Glassman","Allen, the business is dedicated to the manufacturer of tube, primarily thin-walled, large diameter tubes that go into primarily, aerospace applications. They're vent tubes, they're cooling tubes. You will find their product either titanium, nickel or stainless in just about every area of commercial and military aircraft. The business, today's point, is extremely well-run. The large customers would be distributors to the aerospace industry with -- and Western itself enjoys a long-term supply agreement to both Boeing and Airbus. And as you know, Boeing earlier this week reported a wonderful first quarter and in that report said, that their backlog is only 4,000 planes. We went through the Boeing operations with Joe Downes, the manager of the Industrial Materials segment and the management team 2 weeks ago in Washington. And we are very enthused about the acquisition and believe that it allows us to analyze some possibility of some additional acquisitions around that space that would be complementary to the Western play.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","Okay. And did you release, and I'm sorry, if you did, then you could just smack me in the head. But did you release what their last year or last 12 months or however, was this -- but this is a private company, correct?","Karl G. Glassman","Yes.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","Okay. Did you release what their sales and earnings were for the prior year and sort of what their growth rate had been? Have you disclosed that to anyone?","Karl G. Glassman","Yes. Sales, we talked about that and it was ...","Susan R. McCoy","It was about $60 million.","Karl G. Glassman","$60 million in round numbers.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","Is that -- that would be a calendar year or their fiscal year, whatever, however, you want to look at it?","Karl G. Glassman","That was the 2011 calendar.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","Right, so they had $60 million in sales?","Karl G. Glassman","Yes, correct. And we did not and will not release their earnings.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","Okay. Well, could you at least tell us if they were profitable?","Karl G. Glassman","Yes, they're profitable. And in the conference call script, you would've heard us make mention to the fact that the results were above the company average from an EBIT perspective.","Susan R. McCoy","And Allen, that includes all of the charges that is even with all the charges ...","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","Well, that's what I was going to say. When you loaded up with the amortization, but not interest obviously, right? I mean I just want to make clear what your definition is when you say it's above the corporate average, would that -- are you assuming the goodwill in the -- the amortization in there on the interest expense or combination?","Karl G. Glassman","Yes. Fully burdened, it's above the corporate average.","Matthew C. Flanigan","Allen, this is Matt. Yes, both in EBIT and EBITDA perspective, it is above the corporate average, it is exceeding our expectations. Another aspect of this particular business that is beneficial, is the predictability of the future cash flows is better than a lot of other businesses, as Karl mentioned, with a backlog that Boeing, Airbus and other folks have, we feel very good about the next several years and beyond as best we can, of the reliability and predictability of those cash flows. And that helps us quite a bit in terms of our comfort with the investment, as well as the prospects for it going forward.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","And was this a competitive auction or were you the only guy in town or have you disclosed that?","Matthew C. Flanigan","It was a competitive situation.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","Okay. And my last question is, just keeping that along, is that, and you'll pardon me for asking this, what is the corporate average? I mean it's -- you've had -- again, that's been a number that's been bouncing around a lot. So what -- when you say the corporate average, could you tell us what that is or what you used?","Matthew C. Flanigan","The point of guidance this year would be 8.6% EBIT margin.","Karl G. Glassman","That's EBIT, and EBITDA based upon the guidance, is about 12%.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","Okay. So when you're referring to, it's better than that, that's -- those are the numbers that we could use. And again, just to clarify, so the fully loaded number is better than that? Is that correct?","Matthew C. Flanigan","Correct. Fully loaded EBIT with amortization and all the other acquisition.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","Right. And how did you pay -- end up paying for this acquisition? What was the final way that you spent the money? Did you just borrow under your line? Did you use some cash?","Karl G. Glassman","Yes, we borrowed under our line predominantly, Allen. We had a, as you know, $600 million facility, which is about $300 million borrowed right now and that acquisition was $180 million in January.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","Okay, so you just use your line, you didn't use an existing cash. Right?","Karl G. Glassman","That's -- well, yes, the cash flow we're generating is all part of the equation. But in essence, we used the line's capacity to help fund that transaction.","Allen Zwickler - First Manhattan Co., Research Division","Okay. Could I sneak in one more related, unrelated to that? The Residential, excuse me, the office products business or the office commercial business, could you just characterize how that is these days? I mean, for a while there, it looked like it was really humming along notwithstanding that nobody's in offices anymore. So how would you categorize that business these days? Just from a mix and a profit standpoint?","Karl G. Glassman","It continues to hum along rather well and it is up against some very difficult comps. So we feel good about that business if there's a little cloud in the broader office space, it's the lack of government spending. So you would've heard that in some of our customers' calls. But our take up there, from a sales perspective, was slightly better than flat in the first quarter, which is notable because it was up against a such a difficult comp. We expect to run positive to the remainder of the year.","Operator","Mr. DeSonier, that's the end of our questions. I'd like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.","David M. DeSonier","Okay. We'll just say we appreciate your questions and your attention, and we'll talk to you again next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."]}}
